As a result i purchased this in the sale at 1/3 of its retail price for £10.99.  So a turn based dungeon crawler with rpg character development.  Right now the nitty gritty there are some details of gameplay but i shall not spoiler you on plot etc\n\nShortfalls in my opinion\n\n1) The Overall story of the game is linear there are very few opertunities to drastically alter the outcome of the game, there are a bunch of side quests which are optional? (but not completing these for the extra loot, gold and items will make your playthrough a nightmare in its own right! as enemies will be VASTLTY superior to your party of characters. I completed all the side quests and optional dungeon choices.\n\n2) Character Creation is shallow at best  you have a choice of TWO classes! the game does suggest three but its a joke you have the choice between spellcasters and non spell casters! There are no merchants, no stealth options, just pick a close combat weapon or a ranged weapon, or spells if your the former mage class. oh and all chracters can basically become cookie cut clones if you want them to be exactly the same.\n\n3) At Certain points your party composition will be radically altered i.e random members of your party will be unavailble to you for fights following the storyline (so all that time and effort spent developing a character for a specific niche,  those skills to help your party become less brittle will be for nothing making certain fights hellish to complete.\n\n4) The world map has a mere dozen locations for you to explore consisitng of the exact same format towns with the same vendors selling almost identical gear! Black guards is not like diablo where you can expect hoards of loot and mindlesss array of weapons, there are so few it makes you wonder if your ever going to have a badass looking character.\n\n5) Most of my game time was spent on loading screens........ugh i cannot stress how mind numbing this was!\nThe Aquisition of items and gear is extremely tedious especially at the start of the game those life saving potions are almost unobtainable and forces you to either sacrifce weapon and armour or go to battle injured. Later those same items become useless which makes you wonder why you invested so much in the first place. The interface is clunky and at times often difficult to direct your actions.\n\n\n6) The variety of enemies was also sparse to say the least the same foes  cropping up again and again made killing them a real chore, I should also mention that there is NO level grinding in this game to improve your characters stats  for that fight you are having trouble with.\n\n7) THIS IS THE BIGGY The chance to hit modifier is The MOST ANNOYING PART OF THIS GAME!!! YOU WILLL NEVER BE MORE FRUSTRATED, NEVER MISS AS MANY ATTACKS OR FAILED CASTING ATTEMPTS  AS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN THIS GAME,  It has rusulted in me personally restarting hundreds of encounters because this game is COMPLETLY GOVERNED BY RANDOM CHANCE! it will try to break you!!!!!!\n\n8) There are multiple battles linked together resluting in sometimes impossible to win situations as you have been thumped so bad due to unlucky attacks you've misseed ten times in a row or the enemy lads a whole slew of critical hits forcing you to use all your recovery items. (but....i hear you say what about your inventory?? yeah invent items can only be equiped outside of combat, also quicksaving is the same! only outside the dungeon!\n\nBasically the ENTIRE game is fight, FAST TRAVEL to location,  distribute stats, rinse, repeat, load, load, load, load,  get lucky, Save.\n\nPositives\n\nThe Dungeon maps are varied and are pretty to look at,  there are interactive objects to help you, most maps have a stratagy behind them to make things a wee bit easier but a couple of crucial misses will send that plan right out the window.\n\nThere are moments of satisfaction when you drop that enemy who has forced you to load a dozen times and you complete the fight in no time flat.\n\nThe Dialogue can be entertainig at times and you do find your characters personalities are pretty unique.\n\nIm Struggling to come up with more positive points! in all honesty i personally thought this was going to be a bit like a fantasy version of  x-com enemy unknown  (which is a fantastic game i do highly reocmmend) needless to say i was sorely dissapointed!  only die hard fans will see any replay out of this title. even at £10.99 i felt robbed and yes i did pour 60 hours into it but most of this was due to the snails pace of the combat system.\n\nBrutally Honest review Hope someone finds this useful?\n\nRyan :)","November 13, 2014","false","62.1"," 589 of 717 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","589","717","7","13"

Daedalic have been great storytellers in the past and blackguards is no different. The game is dark and mature, just what I like. Often in RPG's the more morally grey characters are the most enjoyable, relate-able and overall liked characters of a given game. In Blackguards this the type of characters you play, instead of a group of moral paragons, you play a band of rogues, trying to get by in the world and dealing with events that have been thrust upon them.\n\nYou start the game as your chosen character hovering above the corpse of princess Elenor who is being eaten by a wolf, after killing said wolf you are blamed for her death, but the strange thing is, you can't quite remember what exactly happened before you saw the wolf. After being tortured and being questioned for a name you know nothing about. Enter the fire loving, fight craving, elf hating dwarf Naurim and you’re soon on a prison break with the intention of finding out just what the hell is going on here.\n\nThe Battles in blackguards are very addictive, they tend to be relatively short but by no means easier. The great thing about blackguards combat is its difficulty, some battles require real thought and careful planning. The game is very challenging but by no means overly difficult and while it can be unforgiving at times, the game auto-saves after every battle and even if you die you have the option to start the battle over at any point from the pause menu. Fans of tactical turn based Rpgs will really get a kick out of the challenge blackguards provides. One of the star features of combat is the interactive environments. In certain levels you will have objects placed around that you can use. You can cut a rope causing the hanging chandelier to crush the enemies below it, ignite flammable swamp gas to burn opponents and more. There are over 190 beautifully crafted battlefields in blackguards, these are no mere random maps, these are hand drawn, carefully thought out maps that not only feel unique but really leave a lasting impression.\n\nIf your an RPG fan, a turn based strategy fan or you just love a bloody good story, I cannot recommend blackguards enough. It is one of those rare games that I literally lost track of time playing. The story telling is good and engaging. Battles while not lengthy have great solid mechanics and good depth to them. The world is fantastically immersive, Daedalic have envisioned southern Aventuria beautifully.

In fact, there was enough for me to put in a solid 60 hours. Some of that time was redoing battles and such, but there were plenty of quests and plenty to do in general.\n\nThe game itself is a curious blend of your prototypical Daedalic adventure/point and click game (when you are in towns, albeit with the hidden object stuff removed of course) mixed with turn based hex battles that use random number generators ala XCOM and other luminous titles. The RNG aspect can make things interesting as occasionally, you will inexplicably miss when you show a 95% chance to hit (actually, it isn't inexplicable..you fell victim to that other 5% lol), but at other times, when your percentage is really low and you go for a desperation power move, and it connects, you totally feel excited and stoked for having taken that risk.\n\nGraphically, it wont blow you away. It is reminiscent of other Daedalic games when in cities/towns/etc..., but when in battle, it's more of an isometric approach with movable cameras that can be adjusted to the cardinal directions as well as going from top down to more straight ahead angles. This definitely comes into play during battles as you get different vantage points to make decisions and set actions. Definitely pulls off that middle ages with mysticism look well. The cutscenes are more of the same. Nothing too spectacular, but still effective and definitely in line with the overall game presentation.\n\nThe story itself is interesting enough. You are framed for the murder of the princess, whom you and a few of your friends grew up with while under the care and apprenticeship of a powerful wizard. You are arrested, and escape with the help of two other prisoners, who become your stalwart companions. From there, you are at first trying to solve the murder and clear your name, but as things progress, you uncover a plot that can destroy the world. At that point, your goals become far more lofty. The story was engaging enough to keep me interested throughout. Which was necessary, as the pace of the game was not very fast. In fact, it took a while for me to get to the point where my characters were able to resolve the more difficult battles without copious retries.\n\nThe battle system itself was pretty stellar in my opinion. If you have played XCOM or other turn based hex battle system games, you will have a good grasp for this game fairly quickly as far as the combat is concerned. What they don't do is churn out the same basic layout over and over. Each battle gets it's own unique battle map, which was stellar in my opinion. You never get bored from seeing the same map over and over, which even XCOM as guilty of (I keep going back o XCOM as a reference due to its accessibility as a point of reference for this games combat systems). The geography of the battle is often as important as your positioning relative to your enemies. Often, there will be traps, mires/bogs, and other obstacles that will hinder or help you and your enemies. Cover is provided on many maps. Interactive objects also make there way into the battlefield. For example, there might be a stack of barrels that you can knock over to crush enemies underneath or simply block their path (and they might use those same stacks), a stand filled with rocks that can be knocked over, bookcases, oil filled barrels that explode, pools of oil, vats of poison, simple chairs and tables, etc....The battle maps were supremely well thought out in my opinion and kept things pretty fresh. In addition to all that, there might be goals other than simply destroying your enemy, such as trying to fight your way to a specific part of the map, free prisoners to help you fight, defend citizens as they try to flee the battle zone, escort missions, and so on. There was even two instances where complete stealth was necessary and one where you are fighting your way through a cavern while also trying to stay ahead of a poison cloud that creeps slowly forward behind you. So much variety. It was really quite impressive.\n\nThe quests were pretty standard fare for the most part. Go find this missing person, please retrieve this item and possibly take it to somebody else, find out what this person or that person is hiding, intercept shipments, and so on. They were fun, and if you play RPG's, they are par for the course. However, they were much easier to finish and never dragged out. Short and to the point as it were. I had a lot of fun with them, and finished every quest the game had to offer.The main quest itself was pretty interesting, as I mentioned before, and kept you moving forward.\n\nThe pacing itself was pretty slow. In fact, the first few hours of gameplay might dissuade some people from continuing on. It takes a while for the game to start really sending you places, and it also takes a while for you to be able to upgrade your equipment and abilities. However, once you get past that initial stage, the game never stops moving forward, even if it is at a slower tan normal RPG pace. I wouldn't get discouraged by this. Once it really got going, I never looked back, although I did break up the gameplay by taking a day off in between sessions to play other types of games. I think that approach benefited the gameplay here, as it helped me to stay interested. The reason I mention this is because, on top of all that, this game is absolutely combat focused and is quite grind-ey. In fact, you will pretty much need to grind out every battle to level up enough to have a reasonable experience later in the game. Fortunately, even if you wrap up all te quests, there is the option to do gladiator fights whenever you want (after you become the champions of the gladiator ring), which will fill out any necessary experience and give you extra cash to spend on potions and such, which you will definitely need to do.\n\nHealing and mana potions (they don't call it mana, but same thing) are an absolute necessity, and especially towards the end of the game, you will want to have as many as possible. You cant have too many, and they don't carry any inventory weight with them, so there is no reason not to keep yourself well stocked. The only other things I ever really spent my coins on were arrows and the occasional armor upgrade. You will find plenty of weapons, poisons, etc...throughout the game and shouldn't need to buy any after maybe your first couple upgrades. At a certain point, those all become more than plentiful via combat spoils. You do have party encumbrance, but I never really found it to be an issue, and went over several times, lol. As far as the inventory system goes, it's pretty simple...you have your various clothing slots (which equate to pants, shoes, gloves, shirt, and hat). You have three weapon loadout slots (during battle, you can switch between the three, but each switch counts as a turn). Each loadout has two hands available, so one loadout might be sword and shield, another might be bow and arrows, another might be a greatsword, etc...You also wear a belt which can have as many as 4 slots available (depending on the belt itself). Each slot will hold one disposable item (potion, poison, grenade (equivalent), or throwing weapon).\n\nThe RPG system is fairly deep in my opinion. There are several categories that all pull from the same pool of experience points you earn, so you need to be judicious in how you spend those points. There are plenty of guides on the topic although I just used what I thought would work well with a touch of common sense and an idea of how to build a party mixed in, lol. The breakdown is abilities (strength, courage, dexterity, charisma, etc...), talents (such as survival, warfare, traps, healing, willpower, and so on), weapon skills (specific weapon categories....bows, axes and maces, two handed swords, two handed axes and maces, staffs, ec...) *continued in comment section*","July 7, 2014","true","71.0"," 210 of 239 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","210","239","0","10"

But one that I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with so far.\n\nLet's go over the problems first.\n\n1. Difficulty. Particularly early on, the difficulty of each encounter can be horribly inconsistent. There's a reason why there is a "try again" button during fights - you're going to use it. Quite a lot. A lot of the more difficult fights have some kind of trick to them that might a try or two to figure out, and a lot of the time said fights require an element of luck too. One or two bad rolls or a few fizzled spells and it's time to try again. Anyone familiar with D&D probably knows that it's hard to create a balanced party with only three characters, which is all you start off with in this game: A mage, a fighter, and your main character who you can build as you wish. After a few hours you pick up a ranger too, who happens to be pretty good with traps, but until I acquired her, any map with hidden traps was a real pain to deal with. There was one fight where I had to memorise the location of the traps through multiple attempts before I could succeed. Additionally, sometimes quests force you through multiple fights with no escapes, and no warning beforehand, which can catch you off-guard if unprepared. In summary: Save often, and be prepared to try again.\n\n2. The interface. The combat system is excellent, but the controls are a little clunky. There's some oddity to the character models which can make it hard to target enemies at times, and the camera is rather awkward at times too. It can get quite frustrating, but it's not so bad that I find myself making accidental moves or anything like that.\n\n3. Information. The game can be very unclear about things. If you're not familiar with the RPG system the game is based on, trying to figure out how it all works is awkward, and the game basically only tells you things once. Being able to mouse over raw stats to see how they affect things would be nice. I have a parry rating of 7 on a character, what sort of parry chance does that actually equate to? How are these stats modifying dice rolls? You can get a rough idea of how things work over time, but I'd like to be able to see exactly what's going on. Contrast with, say, the original neverwinter nights, where if you wanted you could see every single roll being made.\n\nSo those are the negatives.\n\nAnd the positives? Well, the combat system is fantastic, the RPG system, while incredibly deep and unclear, is also very flexible, you have a lot of freedom to let your characters grow in any way you want them to. The quests are enjoyable, the story is simple but engaging, the characters have some actual personality to them.\n\nIf you're willing to get over the initial hurdles of an incredibly complex system and some very frustrating battles, there is a deep and enjoyable game with a wealth of content available for you. The world itself is pretty unique, it does a good job of avoiding a lot of fantasy tropes and creating something a little more engaging, and there's something rather refreshing about having a party that aren't a bunch of do-gooders.\n\nYou're blackguards. My party consists of a wrongfully imprisoned warrior, a dwarf arsonist obsessed with dragons, a pompous upper-class noble from the south, and an elf who got high on drugs and owes everyone money. You're not evil, but you're certainly not good either. You're labelled scum by the people around you and hunted across a kingdom, adding to your list of crimes on the way.\n\nI've completed chapter 1 and am partway through chapter 2. I'm eager to see how the game develops from here. If you can handle some difficulty and frustration at the start, this game is well worth it.","October 10, 2014","true","30.3"," 112 of 129 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","112","129","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bikethief/recommended/249650/","bikethief","Bike Thief","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bikethief/","248 products in account","I mentioned that I would edit my review once I had played more of the game, and I've finished most of Chapter 3 at this point, and wanted to weigh in again, now that there is more content available. Once again, I really enjoy the gameplay. X-Com fans will appreciate the turn based strategy. My earlier concerns regarding the limitations of the trainer system which inhibited true freedom in character development have been lessened however. I still would prefer true freedom to spend my experience points, but the additional content gives you plenty of fights and quests with which to expand your characters, as well as more trainers with the important abilities available to train for. If you are looking for cool loots though, prepare to be disappointed. The emphasis is really more on the characters themselves. As you progress through the story, upgrades of weapons that are marginally better are available, but using merchants to upgrade your characters gear doesn't really feel as fun as beating some monsters or bad guys and finding a cool weapon or magic item.\n\nOverall, I feel the additional content pushes this game from 'not recommended' to 'recommended'. I am particularly excited for when they add more depth to character creation, as this will allow me to pick some starting skills that will more coincide with how I want to build my character. For example, warriors start with the skill that improves your attack when using a shield. If you want to build a 2-Hand sword wielding warrior, this skill is just a waste. But with the new system, hopefully you can skip that in favor of another cool skill.","December 9, 2013","true","95.5"," 277 of 367 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","277","367","0","12"

I felt obligated to do this. If you’re like me you bought in to all the good reviews this game had on Steam. A mature, turn-based rpg, starring anti-heroes? How could it be bad?\n\nWell, for starters, the “Key Features” that Blackguards lauds itself on are deeply flawed. Character choice and combat tactics are undermined by balancing issues - certain abilities and spells are clearly better than others to the point where your characters will be at a severe disadvantage if specced the wrong way and beating some of the harder fights will be near impossible if you don’t have one or two specific spells.\n\nAdditionally, the game suffers from sudden spikes in difficulty that leave the game almost unplayable. Battles go from challenging and needing strategy to just plain unfair and needing luck to win out.\n\nOutside of combat, Blackguards doesn’t fair much better. The story is piecemeal and uneven - with the whole second chapter being nothing but a combat-only reenactment of “Gladiator” that only seems to be put in place to fill time. The rest of the main quest is further hampered by a multitude of random side quests that hold no weight in the game world and only serve to distract you from your objective. Narrative elements and choices are frequently brought up only to never be talked about again. And finally, when the story actually manages to come together, it’s a rushed case of too little too late - leaving you with an ending that is worse than Mass Effect 3. Because despite what the game says, you don’t decide the course of the story at key points - nothing you do matters.\n\nCharacters are also largely underdeveloped and remain that way. Although, the voice acting, for the most part, is passable aside from one annoying companion. However, the male protagonist is the clear winner between the two gender choices (think the opposite of Mass Effect).\n\nWhen the game asks, “What happens when the only hope of a threatened world lies not with heroes in shining armor, but in the hands of a band of misfits and criminals?”. It turns out the exact same thing that would happen if it were heroes in shining armor - because for a game starring “criminals”, you spend most of your time helping people and doing the right thing.\n\nBlackguards has so much potential. It’s just like that really cool looking kid that has tattoos and fashionable clothes but when they open their mouth you realize that looking cool doesn’t mean you have substance. And as much as I wanted to like Blackguards, I can only recommend it to someone if it were deeply on sale.","February 12, 2014","false","68.9"," 97 of 113 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","97","113","0","3"

You step from one fairly mild fight to, suddenly, be faced with a large force led by a high level mage and youre expected to kill everything on the map. IN SEVEN TURNS. Did I mention all the mobs have healing potions? And the leader is on the other side of the hex map? And there are spike traps and tripwires everywhere. So you need to kill 6 mobs, in 7 turns, while they use heal pots, while missing on roughly 30-40% of your attacks. This game is dead to me.

Sadly, this genre seems to be dying out, though the Blackguards series gives me some hope for the future of gaming.  I love how the Blackguards system is based off of a German roleplaying engine.  Old AD&D games like Pool of Radiance, even Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter NIghts (though I hate the real-time aspect of these) are my favorites, and Blackguards is definitely along that same line.\n\nSome of the positives.\n*The customization available is one of this game's many strengths.  They allow the player to keep each character unique throughout this game without having too many options as to overwhelm.\n*The story isn't that happy-go-lucky anime stuff.  It's dark and intriguing.  The complaints regarding the main character's amnesia seem gripey to me.  Amnesia happens, but it's not overdone.  What I mean is that your main character may forget a few things, but won't go through the game complaining about missing memories.  The amnesia just adds to the mystery and allows the player to catch up on what has transpired.  Make no mistake, though, the focus is on the combat.\n*Most battles allow for different ways of completing your mission using objects in the field or terrain.  The complaint some make along the lines of "I use the same tactics every time and this game becomes boring" is the result of the choice the individual player has made, not the limitations of the game.\n*I love the variety of the enemies you'll face and their crazy portraits.\n*The soundtrack is mostly dark but there were several battle tracks I enjoyed.\n*Don't expect to get the "+5 Sword of Fiery Judgment" toward the end.  The weapons in this game do not provide the means to become amazing in combat, which is very unusual for RPGs.  I appreciated the change.\n\nWhat I didn't like.\n*Around 75% through the game, my melee fighters were essentially maxed out.  Without assistance from magic, fighters need a lot of luck to be helpful.\n*Speaking of luck, that D20 (the to-hit random number generator) is the most evil creature in creation.  90% treated me more like 70%.  1s were very rare and usually happened when I was finishing off a foe with few HP.  20s were frequent, as was foul language coming from me.  On top of that, there appeared to be a glitch.  I tossed, say, a 14 when 19 or below struck, yet the result was miss.  This occurred about one in every 15 attacks  (Despite this, the game is very beatable, I've finished it).\n*I wish there was more story.  Not better story, just more story.  I still don't understand the motive for one of the player-controlled characters to follow around the main character.  I wish one of the foes was more-developed.\n\nThose that haven't succumbed to mainstream gaming and still appreciate TRPGs can not go wrong in buying this game on sale.","November 14, 2015","true","63.5"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","58","69","3","0"

Words which define the game itself and help encapsulate what I'm trying to get across. This game merits one such word, and that word is :\n\n"Chewy"\n\nHere's the deal. Blackguards is a strategy game which has been dipped, liberally, in the world of The Dark Eye, think Dungeons and Dragons germanic cousin and you'll be in the right area. It's got a wonderful, thick, rich backstory, with a lot of history, gods, cults, personalities, politics and intrigue. This is a world that over the course of several games (Check out Drakensang when you get the chance if you find yourself a fan of Blackguards, it's worth the time invested) has become every bit as nuanced and subtle as the more accessible DnD counterpart. The operative word though is accessible.\n\nThe Dark Eye is to Pen and Paper roleplay what Dark Souls is to videogames. A stern, rock faced, cold hearted, unyielding dominatrix who seems impenetrable and who demands your complete and total servitude, and at the slightest folly will beat you bloody and raw and tell you to start over again. You will, multiple times, due to a flaw in your build that down the line results in your character ending up stunted and a fight proving a little beyond your reach or poor choices when you level your character.\n\nBut each time, you will learn, through the beatings and the whippings, much like Dark Souls, you will learn, and you will improve. Eventually once you get past the gatekeeper and once you've survived the rite of passage that is the near vertical learning curve of the games mechanics, you'll find a world that richly rewards, and deserves every minute you spend within it.\n\nThe graphics finally have shaken off a lot of the shoddiness and rough edges that have pervaded a lot of the TDE games, Blackguards is slick, smooth, and carries a glossy sheen with it, it's not QUITE melt your eyes gorgeous, but it's certainly pleasing to look at, and the spell effects certainly carry with them a definite sense of satisfaction as they connect and fly about the battlefield. So too has the voice acting and musical score improved, as presentation goes, Blackguards has matured TDE into a strong, and at last truly sellable product.\n\nBut it's not for novices. Noooooooo sir. This is not a new player friendly game. So far to date no actual "Roleplaying game" set in the TDE universe has managed to be even -remotely- new player friendly, this is not about to buck that trend, not when your character sheet runs to five seperate tabbed pages with more numbers to make sense of than the US Federal Budget. Not when the wheel that surrounds your character can offer dozens of possible options as to what action you might wish to take during a turn. Not when a conversation option can turn a story down a route that results in a fight you may not have been prepared for. This game does not go lenient on people who are not careful, not methodical, or not thoughtful.\n\nThe main story arc I'm going to leave spoiler free and focus on the mechanical side, the game follows a two-beat system, the world map, being a parchment map overworld that you zip around and visit static settlements to partake in various pleasantly rendered towns and villages, which offer side quests, conversation dialogs, healing and merchants. Then there's the meat of the game, a mix of single encounter and multi-encounter dungeons.\n\nThese take place on hex based maps which are closer to things like Kings Bounty : The Legend, however in this case, we're dealing with -single units-, and in this case the strategic rendering is done with TDE levels of detail. Characters are solid, so you can't shoot or cast spells through them, ditto for static objects and moveable objects. This means positioning becomes a factor, you can't just layer your melee in front of your casters, you need to play smart and ensure people are in the right place. Equipment too has significant impacts overall on the fight, with bows having minimum and maximum ranges before major penalties are applied. Spells have granular levels of "to hit" based on the casters skill... you get the idea. We're talking pen and paper levels of detail, rendered lovingly in the game.\n\nOnce you set up hotbars for your most frequently used abilities, fights run pretty smooth and fast, and the strategy element is as the word I used to begin with implies - "Chewy" - you'll be constantly thinking and rethinking your moves, and the AI puts up a respectable fight even at default difficulty. Environmental hazards too present a real and significant problem, and throw in an extra layer, thankfully there's no time constraint, so feel free to get a coffee as you ponder each move.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes. With the caveat. This is not a game that will appeal to everyone. It's a niche game. I celebrate it's existence. It's a strategy game for strategy gamers. If hexes, math, and stats excite you, get stuck in.","February 6, 2014","true","16.3"," 102 of 144 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","102","144","0","8"

There are quite a few options, here.\nNext, crawl through a vast variety of well-designed maps and interesting combat scenarios, in the turn-based strategy style.\nMarvel at the lack of decent gear... even in the final chapters. :P\nGet frustrated by missing 3x 90% (incorrectly labelled ~ more accurately 50% chance) hits in a row >  adapt by using weaker abilities with 95% hit chance. Win.\nUse reasoning skills to work out the win condition, when the game doesn't spoonfeed you how to succeed > Win.\nDelve deeper into the well written storyline.\nContemplate right vs wrong, and the way human societies functions.\nWatch a few thrown-together and anticlimactic final cutscenes.. (due credit to there being a few alternative endings).\nDecide not to make another char and start again, because you're intimate knowledge of the skills/talents/stats would make you a God on 'normal'... and increasing the difficulty level would just cause the more annoying aspects of the game to become too much to be enjoyable.\n\n--------------* See last paragraph for a list of helpful hints **--------------------\n\nThe pro's and con's:\n\nPro's:\nInteresting maps, and scenario's.\nGreat range of character stats to customise. These stats actually made a significant difference to how your character could be played.\nSometimes required me to stop - think about why I just lost - adapt. Rather than just steamrolling through every scenario.\nEspecially, when 2-star enemies start appearing.\nSometimes required me to work out the puzzle of how to win the map. (Despite some other reviewers' comments, this rarely required chain-learning trap locations *but even when it did I could have put points into Traps (talent) to over come this* - see above point about actually strategising instead of gratuitous wins).\nWell written story, and voice acting. Particularly, the wide range of accents.\nThe overarching theme of the dialogue was thought provoking, with concepts of anarchism, liberalism, and competing social values.\nNo "+50% damage trinkets."\nCon's:\nNo "+50% damage trinkets;" in fact, upgrades were very hard to come by, with the best gear in the game being only marginally better than the starting level gear.\nThe lack of gear-based character improvement makes Adventure Points essential for creating an effectively optimised end-game character. It's important to get it right on the Character Creation screen.\nThere's almost nothing worth buying, especially because main quests give you free full armor sets in Chapters 2 and 3. By the end of the game, I had over 1000gold and nothing to spend it on (the top level chest armor cost 50g) <-  This was only exacurbated by the need to regularly clear your inventory of unnecessary weight\nAround the second half of Chapter 3, 2-star enemies suddenly begun appearing - much stronger than 1-star enemies - receiving a huge buff to their stats and global buffs. (E.g. +8 attack, +2 dodge +20% Magic Resist buff for all enemies!!).   their strength increased too much, too suddenly.\nMelee Hit chances are too low. Even with maxed out Attack from stats, Weapon Skills, and weapons/shields.\nBy the end of the game, poorly scaled hit chance forced me to abandon my expensive big-hitting melee attacks (ie Hammer Blow - which I had spent over 3000 Adventure points in meeting these abilities' requirements). Was forced to use weak high hit chance abilities to even hit anything.\nBy the end of the game, the game forced me to abandon my dreams of a badass melee build; opting for 1Hander axe and sheild, instead.\nBoss enemies in the 4th and 5th Chapters regularly potioned to full health when falling below ~30% health.  Combined with the fact that I rarely hit melee attacks, it became frustratingly difficult to get through the last 10 or so damage in a single turn before they 100% healed.\nThe game kept messing with my team synergies by  taking away one of spell casters for long periods of time , and killing off my ranger.\nThere are a few spells pretty much beat any enemy (example: Karnifilo Frenzy - the insane rage spell that makes groups of enemies kill each other)\nMaps with many enemies became very slow due to the inability to skip enemy movement and attack animations. Even enemies that couldn't reach you due to blocked paths would run in this painfully time-consuming circle, in order to use up their movement points.\nBack-to-the-past missions took away your well synergised gang of fighters; instead, leaving you with a lone character that wasn't optimised for solo play. (I felt sorry for any spell-casters, here).\nIn-game decisions make minimal differences to the actual gameplay - mostly just affect the cutscenes.\nHelpful Hints:\n- Probably wouldn't put points into Treat Wounds (talent). Instead, get 13 points on one of your party member's Healing (spell), because it heals all wounds as well as being much more convenient.\n- Don't allow you characters to remain wounded. 3 wounds will severely weaken any character.\n- Team buffing & enemy debuffing spells are game changers!\n- Rangers are actully pretty decent in this game, so long as you have a tank or two to keep enemies 5 hexagons away.\n- If melee, don't bother going for Hammer Blow (tier 3 Abilty), nor Death Blow (tier 3) as their hit chances are way too low to provide reliable damage in the second half of the game. Tier 1 melee abilities remain viable the whole game due to their high chance to hit.\n- Minimum 8 points in Body control (talent) for every character is ESSENTIAL; 8+ points in Willpower (talent) are helpful for every character.\n- 8 Points in Warfare (talents) and 8 points in Animal Lore (talents) are very useful for melee  and ranged characters.\n- Defensive characters & spell casters should have relevant Weapon Skills of at least 8 points, and set to full defensive mode (for example, Zurbaran with 8 points in staves, with the sliding bar all the way to the left).\n- Gear is so hard to come by in this game, so you need Adventure Points in order to improve you characters. Didn't bother putting any points into Charisma as it seems counter-intuitive to effectively reduce your Adventure Points just for easy conversation options.\n- Finally, using poisons on you weapons is a great way to get through some impressive damage.","November 26, 2014","true","61.9"," 57 of 72 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","57","72","3","2"

You get Blackguards!\n\nBlackguards is another in a string of games recently that have such wonderful aspects about them and yet have some fatal flaw that sabotages every good experience you have with it.  That flaw is that the game straight-up cheats.  Now I'd normally be the first person to say "suck it up you sissy, it's meant to be challenging."  But there's a big difference between something that is genuinely challenging, and something that cheats.\n\n-I can't tell you how many times I laughed my butt off watching the number of ways the game abused my characters.  Character killed before anyone can act in a battle.  No problem, reload.  Character recovers from knock down only to be knocked down once more with no apparent cause?  No problem, reload.  The game is full of this kind of stuff.  Prepare to be "loved" in the most brutal way by this game.  There's little else that you can do other than laugh about it...it's baked in.\n\n-Ignore any percentages to succeed on anything you do.  They're meaningless.  You'll realize it's all BS after your 10th time of failing when it says you have a 100% chance of success.  This will be driven home even harder when you see your character who has maxxed out stats in his chosen weapon, the champion of the arena, outfitted in the best gear, and still being unable to hit some highwayman in leather armor.  And if you do, it will be a small percentage of the damage that guy can do to you.  It's depressing, really.\n\n-Forget tactics.  They really have no place here.  You'll find some style that works with your approach to games and work it over and over again (as best as the broken mechanics will let you of course).  The game doesn't give you much reason to try anything else, and you won't want to because you're just trying desperately to win some battle.\n\nIt's like the designers were unable to find a way to make the game challenging besides giving the enemies a wholly unfair advantage.  And that's what it feels like...cheap and dirty hits.  That might be ok if it was built into the story and somehow made sense.  But when it's the developers that are doing it, you really don't feel like supporting them again.\n\nWhich is a shame, because if they tweaked just that one thing...that one small thing...to play by the rules...it would be pretty enjoyable.  There's a lot of content, some really funny breaking-the-4th-wall comedy, amazing production values in some areas (the world map), and combat with some moderate depth. But alas, it was not meant to be.\n\nFrankly, as much as I want to I can't recommend this game.  I got it super cheap as part of a Humble Bundle, and I still can't recommend it.  I don't know if I'll ever return to the game again, but if the developers fix these problems, I'll certainly update my review.","December 2, 2014","false","60.3"," 51 of 64 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","51","64","4","1"

You don't really have a real choice on how to develop them, there is a few things you can decide but since mages are defined by their magic and one of the fighters comes in already half trained the tactical phisionomy of your team is pretty much decided before you start the game. You can customize your main character a bit more but you'll realize that the only role lacking in your team will be an archer which is also the stronger dps in the game...\n\nSecond and most important: everytime a loading screens appears cross your fingers because there's a good chance the game is gonna crash. This is most definetly something that can be fixed and it's also something that didn't affect every player,  but given how frequent and long the loading screens generally are it really ruined my experience with this game.\n\nThird: devs brag a lot a about the depth of the story, they also use it as an alibi to justify things like killing fresh characters for no reason and the impossibility to farm. But the truth is there is not much of a story at all, the most of the game is a barely engagefull hunt for clues to unveil the mistery of what happened at the beginning, very linear, not interactive at all, if you really dig powerfull story-driven stuff this will also strike you as trivial and stupid at some points.\n\nAlso given the price nowadays there's plenty more games of the same genre you might wanna give a shot to on steam that look much more promising.","October 18, 2014","false","33.0"," 85 of 125 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","85","125","0","0"

And how can I foresee that the story seriously impacts the functioning of my party?  At two moments in the game you will be inflicted with a setback that unhinges your party's fighting power. Once, one of the party members gets killed because the story is written that way. And at another time her replacement, a magic user, gets robbed of her ability to do magic and so thousands of points sunk in developing her magic powers becomes nullified with one stroke.\nSo you might expect that the game takes this into account, but not at all: you cannot undo your choices nor does the game allow you to make up for the loss of a valuable party member.\n\nThis then, in a nutshell, is the problem with Blackguards..\n\nThis game is very much like searching for keys to doors, while you do not know which key opens which door, you do not know if a door leads to anything useful, you do not know when or if you will find the key or the door to which it belongs and you might find  that the keys and doors disappeared before you actually could make use of them.\nSo what is left is to go back to an earlier point in the game and find the right keys to the right doors: make the right choices. And unfortunately you might have to go a long way back: perhaps all the way to the beginning.\n\nAnd then another issue pops up.\n\nBlackguards is  basically a tactical battle simulator in which the battles are linked together by a thin storyline that gives the battles context. You will find that many of the common characteristics of a roleplay game are underdeveloped. For one, your party members are a given and so are their classes. Do not expect that you can build your own party.\nFurthermore there are few choices in equipment so your party will be running around with the same armor and weapons for long stretches.  And while many places have shops, you will only visit them to restock your supplies.\nBut the crucial issue is that the story is simply too linear. While at some point you can select what to do first, you will be unable to change the storyline in any significant way. And because the story isn't really special at all, redoing this game just so you can change your characters is not enough of an incentive to go through the game again..\n\nEven as a tactical battle simulator the game leaves much to be desired. For instance you are unable to determine the setup of your party members. More often than not the game gleefully shoves your more vulnerable members, your magic users, in the front line.  Hilarious is the ability to set traps. You have almost no time to set traps, let alone set the traps that actually make  difference. The traps are expensive, the relevant skill requires a massive amount of points and you have only a very limited amount of traps.\nIn addition some battles confront you with a special setup that is pivotal to the battle, often without explaining to you the specifics. In one battle, for instance, you will be able to make use of automated flamethrowers. But the game doesn't explain this to you, nor do you know what the impact is until you have seen their effect and you figured out how to operate them. It therefore requires you to redo the battle at least once.\nSome battles are practically unwinnable until you achieve a certain level, or develop a certain ability to a certain level.\n\nIs it all bad then?\n\nActually no.\nWhen I went through the game the first time I actually was entertained. The game uses what I call the fall out principle. The fall out principle is that you start out as a nobody and then gradually start to make a difference when the story unfolds. This is the reverse of what you might call the dragon age effect in which  it is clear from the start that you are a special person destined to make a difference.\nPersonally I prefer the first angle to the last.\nAlso the characters are amusing, even though, or perhaps because, they are so cliche. The remarks of the Naurim, the grumpy dwarf, are pretty funny and in line of what you might expect from a dwarf: a fighter who distrusts magic users and elves.\nThe story, although linear, has a few twists and also there is some emotional connection as it involves a friend and later on a family member. It isn't also clearcut that the enemy is actually bad and it leaves things fuzzy  for a long time.\nSo it seems to me that if you go once through the game(using a game guide to form your party) then you might probably be entertained.\n\n\n\nVerdict:\nBlackguard is a nice filler when you are in between better games. Pick it up when it is in the bargain bin and around five dollars or euros or less.\n\n(Note: steam doesn't allow for a meh score at the time of writing this review. This game most certainly belongs to this category. I gave it a thumbs up just because, when choosing between the negative and the positive, i prefer the latter).","June 13, 2015","true","74.6"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","39","51","2","0"

A murder. Are you guilty? Are you innocent? If you are innocent, who is the true murderer? Why can't you remember nothing?\nAnd with that, you get out of prison to live some adventures.\nThe characters are charismatic and with personalities of their own. The world is full of life, but most of the secondary missions are only valuable for the Adventure Points (the XP of the game), and they are irrelevant to the story.\n\nThe game has a few plot twists and they are not bad at all, but before reaching them you will probably exhausted. The problem is that the ending is... well... is HORRIBLE. It is the ending that you can expect, but is displayed in a really awful and strange way that makes you think: "I really finished this game to see this?"\n\nThe gameplay is good in the beginning, but when you are more or less mid-game you will probably be sick of being poisoned. And that's only the start: The machine abuses the use of poisons. You will probably hear every turn "Poison!" or "I am poisoned!" or "I hate poison". Also, some special combats in Act 5 are never explained why are this special or why the special rules.\n\nAs many other tactic turn-based games, probabilities are really important. That means you can have a lucky day and impact an almost impossible shoot, or a really unlucky and fail all your 98% chance spells. But, as always, it seems "50%" means "1/2" to me and "1/10" to machine, as I never impacted an attack under 20% and usually failed things of 70-80%, 95% or even 98%. In a game where every movement, every action counts, this can make you sick really fast. Also, the enemies are as if they were taken out of Matrix, because they can dodge easily and usually all your attacks.\n\nSo, well, unless you really want to be poisoned EVERY combat, lose your patience failing your 98% chance spells and being parried attacks that shouldn't be parried, and playing a lot of hours to receive a half-cooked last Act with a fast ending as closure, you probably shouldn't play this game.","April 3","false","44.8"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","25","28","3","0"

I was getting so frustrated I nearly threw my mouse through my monitor.  Blackguards is presented as a game returning to the core roots of RPG strategy goodness.  Just check out the multiple videos from Daedalic above for all the stuff that sounds so great about this game.  What is presented sounded awesome to me but in reality my two attempts through the game turned into a frustrating slog from one scenario to the next.\n\nI got hooked on the story from the start which turned out to be a prison break.  Nothing ground-shakingly new here but it worked for bringing three main characters together and launching them off on what was to be a quest to save the world.  The cut-scene interactions just propel the story forward, but did contain some humorous dialogue.  City/settlement locations are really just screens you click on to visit the tavern/shop/quest giver, etc.  Again, nothing earth-shattering for the genre but where this game was supposed to shine was in the combat.\n\nAnd the combat on many of the levels was excellent.  Some of the scenarios were very challenging and I truly felt good when I had achieved victory conditions.  You certainly cannot simply build up your characters and then rush through everything.  Planning was necessary.   All that was great.\n\nSpecific building of your characters is crucial to the point that if you build them wrong, you will find that the difficulty spikes.  Character building is handled through allocating skill points.  There are a lot of options (FIVE screens worth) and very little in-game guidance on what to build up first.  I am sure most players will do what I did and end up resorting to the forums and walkthroughs to know how best to maximize their points.  It should not be this difficult or nebulous on building up your characters - especially with this many options.  The game reminds you to save often so you can go back to an earlier time and rebuild if needed.  But that still stings a little knowing that you lost that progress and will need to make it up.\n\nBut then the game started throwing out some curve balls on the scenarios and I found myself needing to restart certain ones again and again.  These levels were often fronted by a cut-scene dialogue that had to be clicked through again and again.  I just do not understand why they couldn't simply start the level with your characters on the field.  Many of these levels had special rules or situations that were not made apparent until you played them.  So you learned the "special" rules through failing at the level and had to try again.  And again.  And again.\n\nIt does not help when the game chains scenarios together without a way to rest in-between.  You may find that by the end of the 2nd or 3rd scenario you are completely out of potions/health/magic/whatever.  And you may need to not only restart that level, but perhaps go back to a prior level so that you end with enough health/magic to be successful in the next one.  I could see the game doing this on hardcore difficulty for those who really enjoy upping the difficulty, but I just wanted to veg out after a hard day at work.\n\nBy the time I was into the gladiator fights in chapter 2 I realized something.  The. Game. Was. No. Fun.\n\nI am recommending a pass on this one.  If you do buy it, wait for a nice Steam or bundle sale.","August 24, 2015","false","24.8"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","27","36","3","0"

It is actually the closest thing to the JAGGED ALLIANCE games that has happened in years: Most strategy games will have you move nameless armies on maps, in BLACKGUARDS you will have to rely on a band of adventurers, all of whom have clear-cut personalities. This adds a lot of flavour to the game, as you will grow to like this bunch. Just like the mercenaries of the olden JAGGED ALLIANCE series, your BLACKGUARDS crew is a shady and shifty bunch. Daedalic, the German studio behind this game, used to specialize in point and click adventures and they certainly applied their writing skills here: All characters speak with characteristic voices and have oppinions and attitudes that never seem out of place or unexpected. BLACKGUARDS is not a bleak game, though - there are some goofy laughs to be had as well and the story soon develops into a fairly generic, yet highly enjoyable fantasy romp.\n\nGameplaywise, you will be moving up to four characters around the hexes of smallish arenas and duking it out with lizardmen, skeletons, dragons and the like. You have two areas of movement: One within which you are able to follow up with an action (like an attack or a spell) and a larger one that consumes your action. Anybody who played Firaxis' XCOM reboot should feel right at home here - it is pretty basic stuff. The fun part ist the RPG foundation that calculates pretty much all of your actions on the battlefield: BLACKGUARDS is a game situated in "The Dark Eye" universe, which is a pen and paper RPG system that is quite popular in Germany (it even originated from a failed attempt to license D&D stuff for Germany). You get the unadultered real deal: You will have to level stats, weapon skills, special talents, magic schools and spells for each and every of your characters and because "The Dark Eye" system allows for a lot of freedom in regards to development of characters, you might find yourselves a bit overwhelmed at first. Should you level your mage's staff fighting skills as well? Should you try to improve his skills with bows so he can keep on dishing out damage even when he runs low on mana? Should you ignore his weapon skill entirely and concentrate on beefing up his bread and butter stuff like fireballs and shockwaves? You could do either of these! My tip for you is to specialize your crew members during your first run and start experimenting on the second! There are some excellent guides on steam, too, so make sure to check those out as well.\n\nBLACKGUARDS has received some rather harsh and negative reviews due to its complexity and difficulty. These two are closely related and once you start understanding the basic RPG mechanics, the battles will become significantly less challenging. The game has been thoroughly patched up and there is an excellent tutorial in place now. It will teach you 80% of the stuff you need to know - the rest can be found in guides or through experimentation.\n\nTo sum it up: This is a fairly complex and tough game but also an immensely rewarding one. If you consider yourself experienced with RPGs and turn based strategy, then chances are good that you will love BLACKGUARDS!","November 4, 2014","true","11.5"," 33 of 48 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","33","48","0","2"

Framed and tortured by the one you called your friend, you make your escape with a few other prisoners, trying to find out the truth behind the accusations against you. This review takes into account the Untold Legends DLC.\n\nPros: Nice game with enough mechanical depth to offer a variety of gameplay styles: rather than level-based progression, you spend adventure points on anything from attributes, weapon skills, spells and perks and determine exactly how specialized you become with your various talents. The story isn't of a great hero, but of someone who won't leave a mark on history, making your way in shady towns and accepting questionable quests, especially in the multiple side quests added by the Untold Legend DLC where you must take stances on subjects such as slavery. Graphics are good enough for the genre, tactical maps are clean, most of which have interactive environment elements you might use against your foes if they don't use them against you. The game is sufficiently balanced, and even with the occasional difficulty spikes, you can jump right back in the last encounter to try things differently.\n\nCons: Many will find the depth to be a bit too much, scrolling through 5 pages of skills and perks will make it hard to figure the best way to optimize your character. There is a limited variety of equipment, especially armor. The story is pretty linear and not all that complexe. The odds of success aren't mushed, so 95% chance of success might still miss, multiple times, in a row, which will frustrate anyone who isn't used to rolling dices. The music is somber, and sucks life and excitement out of the game whenever you're not in a combat situation.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nThis is an ok RPG. It is definitively ported directly from its tabletop RPG roots, which might feel very "meh" to the average gamer. I still recommend it, just make sure you also get the Untold Legend DLC, or you'll feel the game is short on side-quests.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","May 26, 2015","true","75.4"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","29","41","0","0"

If you are looking for "fast paced" look elsewhere. EVERY thing that you do NEEDS to be carefully considered and thought out. The Manual says to "save often." And it is spot on because you WILL have to go back and retry battles.\nThe biggest problem that I have (had) with it is that while it is billed as non-linear, in the begining it IS. And some of the begining quests are out of balance with the character's abilities. Now, I will readily admit that I am not an especially intelligent person.

(ex: The King's Bounty Games, the Witcher games, and the Elder Scrolls series.) some - like this one - do not.\nIf you LOVE a real challenge and don't mind the frustration of failing and having to re-start a game... buy this.

I had to switch down from Normal in order to make any progress past the first chapter.\n\nNow for the bad news.\n\nFirst, the combat system is incredibly complicated.  The rules for combat are mostly invisible, but reading through them (on the help screen) made my eyes cross.  This coming from a guy who plays tabletop D&D, HERO System, Shadowrun, Traveller, and Legend of the Five Rings.  This might explain why the chance to hit an opponent is vastly different from the chance marked on your screen.  Anything under an 80% chance to hit will miss at least 2/3 of the time.  And there's one enemy in particular that you won't hit more than about 1/20 of the time, despite the fact that your hit % is shown as 60.  Always.  I'm not sure if the hit chance is failing to take into account about half the combat rules, or if (as some others have suggested) the random number generator is just broken.  Either way, this drops my enjoyment of the game by quite a bit.\n\nThe other problem is that there's really no actual "role-playing" involved in the game.  There's little to nothing you can do to direct the game, except in some of the sidequests.  And most of that involves giving up a sidequest instead of finishing it.  Sure, you have dialogue options, but they don't really *DO* anything.\n\nOverall, I'd probably rate this something like 3/10.  The combat scenes are great, but the combat itself fails, and everything else is boring as hell.","November 2, 2014","false","48.0"," 48 of 80 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","48","80","2","2"

Cities, dungeons, and world are travelled by point and click and I enjoyed the simplicity of it.\n\nCombat is done with an isometric view on hexes. Each combat area is unique. Melee combat is fairly straight forward. The magic combat really shines with up to 4 levels of each spell, each level unique, allowing you to pick any level you have unlocked. So later in the game, a mage can have quite the variation of spells to choose from.\n\nI felt the game started a little slow, took off and didn't slow down until the anticlimactic ending. I was able to beat the game with over 30 hours which included the DLC. The DLC was integrated into the main campaign, which was nice. I like a game that doesn't overstay it's welcome.\n\nRegarding difficulty, I felt many previous The Dark Eye games were much more difficult and appreciated the fact that I was able to get through this game with minimal issues. It is a strategy game, so if you pick poor weapon and spell combinations,you will hit a brick wall you can't pass. If you are having difficulty with the game, lower the difficulty. I like that difficulty can be changed.\n\nAnother bonus is the game starts up quick and you can skip the intro and get right to the menu. It is worth mentioning with so many games forcing you to wait through minutes of unskippable logos.","October 18, 2014","true","39.3"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","26","40","2","0"

One moment in particular seems to have turned some players off, I thought it was a brave decision by the developers, and I thought it worked well, a story should generate emotion, and this one did. It's not all grim and dark however, and the humour is very finely tuned in places.\n\nTurn based tactical games are a genre that I'm very much into, I play a lot of Chaos Reborn on a daily basis for the PvP side of it. Consequentially I often find that with story driven turn based tactical games that the PvE battles are a let-down, I don't think an AI can generally replicate the engagement that comes from playing against a human opponent. But I tell you what, Blackguards comes as close to it as I've ever found. There's a real wealth of variation in the battles that occur from; small skirmishes, arena fights, fighting withdraws, chase downs, there's all sorts. The developers of Blackguards have really gone out of their way to keep the fighting fresh. As a result this is one story driven turn based tactical game that I can see myself replaying. Just taken on their own the fights are a lot of fun.\n\nI think the one caveat that I'd give is that this is a game where it's worth checking out what happens to certain characters in advance. I’m not going to give anyway any spoilers here, but making your party build based on that knowledge does make a difference to the overall effectiveness of your party by the end of the game.","March 19","true","55.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

SYGO.\n\nLore: This games has a great story, or maybe just a good one, but with great soundtrack. Every time the action stops to give me some of the story, be it only with voice over or with a cinematic, it makes me feel like sitting back, dimming the light, lighting up a cigar (I don't smoke cigars, wtf) and just getting immersed in that world. It works. Oh and SYGO.\n\nGraphics: Every graphics outside of the spells and backdrops are ok for a turn-based strategy game, cinematics or gameplay. The backdrops are nice. But the spells are one notch above that. They are cool. Let just say that after 80 hours, I'd gladly skip the crossbow animation in order to save 4 seconds every time, but I'd keep the spells any day of the week.\n\nGameplay: I recommend you name your character SYGO. I didn't. I should have. Now I need to restart from scratch. Don't just SYGO. Keep them. You'll need them. This game is unforgiving as it leads you to think that you'll need this skill and that skill in order to make it, yet it surprises you (too) many times with different tactics and resistance to particular damage. If you can finish this game without a single hint from the internet, a walkthrough or without ever needing to backtrack yourself once to change some skill points (let alone back track yourself 40 hours to change almost everything...) you are a God amongst humans.\n\nTL/DR: One of the best turn-based game I've played, as enjoyable as your favorite HOMM or Civ. Poor DLC value, very good base value. If you don't want a good challenge (60 hours) that kinda forces you into restarting at least once the game from scratch (do I hear 120 hours?), then this might not be for you. Only negative thing is that I'm really dissapointed that the dev made a Blackguards 2 instead of adding more than one DLC to this game. Did I mentioned SYGO? Yeah, SYGO. Or cry.

Regardless, I can't believe how much fun the combat in this game is.  I'll break down some key game concepts that might persuade you to buy or push you away.\n\nGood:\n-Amazing character development using a deep system of random dice rolls and old-school board game elements\n-Hard battles (some are pushovers) that make you think or have to re-do because of a single screw up\n-Deep turn based hexagonal board-like combat involving traps and the environment\n-A Baldur's Gate style of map minus the exploration\n-The game really focuses on the battles without the fuss of wandering and exploring (ie. not an exploration game)\n\nBad:\n-The story is not bad, but one shouldn't be getting this game for that reason\n-The itemization and game mechanics are a bit complicated to understand and required a lot of Google searching\n-Linear story and no exploration\n\nIf you are looking for a game that focuses purely on the tactical turn based combat, then this is truly it.  There is no wandering and exploring with your party and discovering secrets.  The world map is like Baldur's Gate, however, when you visit cities and places, you are either transported into a combat situation with some cutscenes or visit a town where NPC's are static screens filled with innkeepers, healers, merchants, etc.","May 9","true","57.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It is so broken i cannot even believe it. Some fights are so unbalanced i had to actually lower the difficultry to Normal to beat them, which i never ever did for any game in my life. This because you are put in situations where you just need luck to make it out alive.\n\nAnd Luck is the real master of this game, not skill nor strategy. Just pure luck. RNG (Random Numerical Generation) (What determines % of success or failure of things) is so determining in the combat that it just rules over everything. In other turn based games there is RNG of course, but also other factors like strategy, formations, class builds, level are critical to win a fight, but not here in blackguards, not at the same level.\n\nA single random critical, or spell failure (spells can FAIL casting, yes you got it right), or a random miss with 99% chance, or again some trap which activates randomly decides to turn just towards your party and wipe it out with a blast of fire.\n\nAll these things can make a fight fail. Random chance upon chance upon chance upon chance. Not even in Vegas there is so much gambling.\n\nThis more than a game of skill is a game of luck. I have many many years of experience in all kinds of RPGs but i just cannot take it anymore. I find myself by now to repeat fight over and over and over again just to get a fight where the RNG favors me, where traps do not activate on my team, or on the target i have to protect, etc, and make me fail after a well planned strategy.\n\nDo yourself a favor, go and buy Divinity Original Sin, that's a turn based game made right, not this disguised slot machine of a game we have here.","May 26","false","20.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Said dungeon is especially mildew-y and uninspired, packed with boring old barred cells and dirt floors.Then the player meets a wizard with a voice so melodramatic and overacted that some will likely be put off the game almost immediately.But to strike off the game due to its weak opening alone would be shame, as Blackguards grows gradually into its own strategic combat system, and presents colourful and fantastical confrontations that escalate nicely as the game progresses.Blackguards is a turn-based RPG at heart, based within the universe and roleplaying system of enduring German Dungeons & Dragons-alike The Dark Eye. The story is simple and functional: the player character has been convicted of the murder of a noble’s daughter, with whom he or she was a close friend.Towns consist of little more than painted landscapes populated with stationary NPCs that can be clicked to begin a sparse dialogue tree.There’s no overworld to navigate, merely a series of interconnected nodes on a map. Building a game on the back of a pre-existing RPG has pros and cons, and perhaps because of its hardcore tabletop roots, the levelling and character progression system in Blackguards is immediately intimidating.The combat is easy to understand on a basic level. A player can move and use an action, or cover a greater distance by sacrificing an action. The number of actions that can be performed, including spells and attacks, quickly broaden the combat system into a rich tapestry of decisions.That combat is absolutely the core of Blackguards, both in a gameplay and aesthetic sense.An early assault of brown and grey doesn’t do it any favours, but the presence of large numbers of well-animated on-screen characters later on certainly do. The spell effects are similarly excellent, and there are some creative and terrifying monster designs.There may not be an overworld, and the friendly towns found in most RPGs are absent, but Blackguards does possess an extremely well-developed core combat system, and for that it deserves to be commended.Overall 7/10.","November 17, 2014","true","75.1"," 34 of 61 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","34","61","0","0"

If you like RPGs, buy a real RPG, if you like tactical combat, buy XCOM. But dont buy Blackguards.\n\nAfter 10 hours of playing the game, the game is simply over for me. I am stuck at an impossible fight, the autosave is at a point were I cannot make any meaningful alterations to who fights anymore. And the fight is unwinable with the character I build.\n\nNow, dont get me wrong. Its not a badly build character. Its a very straightforward mage. Its not underleveled either for I did every single quest so far. But if your character is a mage, and you dont build it in one very specific way, you will be stuck at the beginning of chapter 2. It is impossible to progress, since there are no potions or pieces of mage armor available so you usually just get one-shot.\n\nUnfortunately, this happens quite often in Blackguards. The game is not balanced - at all. You can in theory build a character, but if you build anything other than a fighter or a very specific mage, you just get stuck in impossible fights - like the one that ended my game.\n\nI had fights like this before, and I got through them by just reloading for two hours until the RNG finally turned into my favor.  Here is an example:\n\nIn one fight, turn one, my main character would get shot and fall on his ♥♥♥ about 90% of the time. That means the fight is over - I lacked the DPS to win and he would just continually be shot down. There is nothing you can do against this either. You cannot prepare for fights - all spells etc. can only cast once you are IN the fight. So right away 9/10 cases, I had to reload. If my character managed to dodge, I now had to get a very specific spell of to make sure he wont get shot down every single time. However, the spell barely ever got used so it failed in 3/10 cases. If it failed, reload.\n\nSo right away I could only progress in 3% of the cases. Of course the rest of the fight also included a lot of luck.\n\nSure with a different character build that wouldnt have happened - but if the game is only beatable with some very specific builds than either dont give the players the option to build their characters, or rebalance the fights.\n\nThis is the main problem of Blackguards - the game is not skillbased, its largely RNG. That means that dicerolls decide outcomes of fights, not your skill or ingenuity. This makes the whole experience hugely frustrating.\n\nAnd its not frustrating in a good way. In Dark Souls, it is extremely frustrating but you know its your fault, and if you get good enough, if you finally figure all the patterns out, you beat it, and its awesome. In Blackguards, you beat a frustrating fight and the only thing you feel is 'finally its over'. Because its not skill that won the fight, its just that for pure random chance the dice have fallen in your favor.\n\nAlmost every fight in the game is like this. The few fights that arent usually have a very simple to figure out environmental danger that you have to activate in order to basically get a free win.\n\nUntil this game actually gets balanced, dont buy it.","January 27, 2014","false","25.4"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

It is linear in nature like most tactical RPGs, it is still engaging enough to keep you playing.\n\n\nWhat could of been an exceptional tactical RPG, is heavilly mared by the skewerd RNG.  Enemies with ludecrously low hit chances will regularly hit, while your group with ludecriously high chances to hit will miss quite often.  This simply plays out this way the entire game.\n\nMany of the enemy hits will impose effects but you wont resist them because of penalites of unknown oragin making the skills you developed to resist them, meaningless.  Likewise Enemies will constantly resist your statuses because aparently you dont apply the same penalities to them.\n\nThis would be fine for the most part if enemies did similare damage to your group, sadly they typically will almost always do about 50% more, leaving you to scratch your head wondering why.\n\nIn general enemies will always be better than or equal to your group in combat, even if they happen to be some merchant or alchemist they will be exceptional warriors none the less.  They also wont give you the gear they are using (aparently that vanishes in a puff of smoke when they die)\n\nAgain this woud be fine through the use of tactics.  However the RNG issues will often destroy the best tactics you can bring to the table.\n\nPlenty of places have traps everywhere and the non-enviromental ones will let the enemies happilly walk over with without triggering them.\n\nAt the end of the day unless you are happy to ignore the RNG issues and vague information on many of the combat aspects, I cant really recomened Blackguards (hopefully the second one has improved those issues).   Even then best to get it on a 75% off sale.","May 8, 2015","false","134.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Story is linear and boring.  it's cut scene after cut scene forcing you thr4ough the story interupted but completely unbalanced fights.  i have a dwarf in the game who wields a two handed hammer, and i cant hit an unarmoured wizard, on top of that when i do land a blow, the wizard deals more damage to me with his melee attack.  so the mechanics are sort of broken and frustrating.  It is ultimately a bad story mixed with crappy game mechanics (BTW i am playing on normal).  There is no exploration into the game.  i have played 10+ hours worth so far.  just go hear kill this go hear kill that, save this maiden, do this task.  etc...  If you decide you want to gain some xp before you move forward so the game doesnt kill you very easily you do not have an option.  you have to crank the diff down to easy and then it becomes boring and dull with no real challenge.\n\nSo the two options i found where ridiculously hard and non sensical (wizard does more melee damage than a two handed melee weilding dwarf)\n\nor easy and equivelant to pressing play on a bad fantasy movie every now and again to get the story going.  i would not recomend this game to anyone, especially not for $40.

This is a game that seems to have nearly a 50/50 split on good and bad comments/reviews.  I've been working through a fairly long LP of this game and I figure that I probably should weigh-in as well.  I am 100% for this game and I'll list the reasons why down below.  I'll give a short version and a long version for those that want it.\n\nIf anyone is interested in seeing a bit more of how the game plays out before picking it up, or just wants to enjoy my struggles and successes, feel free to check it out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InfeXUTUooc&list=PLtzgP48ATFJD01tDF_OJ7aNixtraiTUBt\n\nor for any of my other games:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/bumpymcsquigums\n\nShort version:\n\nBlackguards is a tactical, squad-based, turn-based rpg.  The story is very funny at times and quite dark throughout.  You have quite a bit of freedom in regards to how to train your party, what equipment, skills and abilities each person should have.  You are on a linear path, but there is freedom in that as well.  There is, of course, the main quest line to advance the story, (which I find rather entertaining, it's funny, but also dark) and there are several side quests that you CAN do, or miss.  (I missed a few)  There are some things I don't like, (RNG makes things rough and a few multiple battles means one bad decision early can be terrible for you) but overall those can be overcome and dealt with.  I recommend saving often, as I SHOULD have been doing all along.  Still, I think this is by far one of the best games in the tactical, squad-based, turn-based rpg games I've played in a long time.  I really don't understand all the negativity towards the game.  :(\n\nThe Long Version:\n\n\nBlackguards is a tactical, squad-based, turn-based rpg.  The story is very funny at times and quite dark throughout. :)\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe pacing of the game is fun and very enjoyable and this IS one of the longer games of it's type that I've played in recent memory.  The fact that there's more to the battles than just your attacks/skills/spells abilities is a very refreshing change.\n\nNow, I love X-COM and I know this game catches some comparison to it, but even in the different missions in X-COM you pretty much just killed all the aliens.  There's different objectives in battle as well as usable/destroyable terrain.  Sometimes you might have to rush across a bridge to save someone within "x" number of turns.  Maybe you are escaping from prison and you can fight the guards, or free other prisoners to fight them off for you.  There's usually several ways to achieve the goal and they add enough different things to keep you guessing AND make it entertaining.\n\nYou are part of a story. so the linear gameplay makes sense.  There are flashbacks and you learn pretty quickly what all is going on, well for the most part.  There's still a lot you need to discover, but the story is well written even if it's a bit cheesey at times and overly dark at others.  The voice acting is quite a bit better than I would have expected.  I personally think they did an exceptional job in this department.  The music and graphics are also very well done.\n\nThe different characters you can pick up for your party all play pretty differently.  The nice thing is you DO have a say in all of their training/gear/abilities after what they have initially.  A mage plays very different from a warrior, who plays very different from an archer.  One of the things I did was had a third mage like character and transitioned her into an archer as I lost my archer a bit earlier on.  So she can use a bow decently well and has spells to fall back on.\n\nI think 90% of the battles are pretty balanced, but every so often you get a battle that just makes you think and rethink your strategy 100 times over before you get it.\n\nThe game is unique, I haven't seen anything quite like this before.  The concept isn't so different from a lot of other games, but the setting, the story, even just the idea of having a group of misfits, criminals, drug-addicts as the "heroes"\nis fairly different from the norm.\n\nI could go on and on about the "good" of the game, but I want to address the few issues that I have come across that you may want to know about.  It's a very good game, but nothing is perfect.  :)\n\nThe Bad : (or Frustrating if you will)\n\nThe RNG can be exceptionally frustrating at times and bad decisions can bring you to a screeching halt.  I don't recommend "save scumming" but I DO recommend saving often, as there are many multiple battles with no way to back out.  There were a few times that I ran into a battle that I made a bad decision in the fight before it and it cost me quite a few stressful attempts to survive.  I have also fought a few battles without really changing my tactics and only managed to win because RNG (Randon Number Generations, i.e. Luck) was in my favor.  One fight in particular that I fought 4 times or more, I did MINOR changes but it really came down to my person not missing as much.  In all  honesty, this is really the only BAD thing.  Now, if I had chosen a different team setup in the previous fight, it probably would have been easier.\n\nSome of the other "Bad" things in the game would be more about personal preferences.  I personally play both open world games as well as linear.  Some people hate linear games.  I don't mind it as I find the story is usually tighter, better told and more memorable in the linear games.  You have less "distractions".  You have a main quest line you have to follow and it advances the story.  You can't do stuff from chapter 5 in chapter 1.  There are several side quests however and you can do those whenever you feel like each chapter.  I skipped a few or missed a few in chapter 1 as I wasn't 100% sure which was which.  There's no free-roaming, it's towns, points of interests, people of interests that you click on a map and throughout the cities.    So it's the world map, town maps, area maps, or the battle map you deal with.  Again, I don't mind it, but some people will.\n\nYou have only 3 choices for your main character.  Archer, Warrior, Mage (not sure what "specific" names they give those classes).  However, you have a lot of freedom on how you want to train your character and the members of your party.  The game slowly teaches you how to play, so it may start a bit slow with all the tutorial messages popping up, but the tutorial DOES do a good job at teaching you what you need to know.\n\nOccasionally the camera angles can be a bit annoying or cumbersome, but it's not much of an issue overall.\n\nIt might seem like there's a lot bad here, but in reality it's just a lot of detail.  Most of which is personal preference or it limits you....only a little, but again, some people hate any limitations.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nThe game is very fun, and makes you think.  You will breeze through some fights and then just hang your head in shame in others.  You have a set path to follow, but you can take several side streets along the way and the ride is very enjoyable.  I really really like Blackguards and I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Tactical, squad-based, turn-based strategy rpg games.  It has a few problems, but the good outweighs the bad by a landslide.  This is a shining gem from Daedalic Entertainment, well....a Darkly Shining Gem!

Little things that seem to have been left incomplete, or lack polish. This includes a few bugs with quests and achievements. A good example is that the combat controls list auto-save, but if you try to use it, the game says you can't.\n- Not explaining things. Sometimes you will see environmental effects or objects, but have no idea what they are or do until they kill you. Sometimes it will drop you in a level with a special win condition, but it won't be clear what it is. This is fine once you work it out, but causes a bit of trial-and-error frustration\n- The ending is, well, balls. Quite simply.

A solid and highly enjoyable RPG!\n\nPROLOGUE: I show as having 88 hours playing this game, as of this review.  I probably actually was playing for 80 hours of that, for ONE playthrough. I am methodical and slow, so most of you whippersnappers who like to cut to the chase will likely finish in 40 hours or less.  I saw a lot of complaints about this game having spikes of frustratingly high difficulty, so I played the EASY/NOVICE setting, which I believe gives more Adventure Points (AP) than the other settings.  In retrospect, I can understand the complaints; but I never had that problem, maybe because of the easy setting, maybe for the most part because I pushed off what I suspected would be the tougher fights until I had more skills under my party's belts.  I ended the game with 1300 ducats (enough to ditch EVERYTHING the party needed and buy it all back again), lots of poisons, potions, provisions, projectiles, traps, and other stuff I never seemed to have the need to use.  I used one potion, and that in the second to last battle.  Perhaps on NORMAL difficulty I would have needed more...\n\nREVIEW:  This game has a main storyline which is fairly linear, but the available sidequests (and locations they open) make it feel less so.  The RPG character development system is versatile and refreshing: You can mold your characters by earning and using AP to buy levels in any of a myriad of basic traits, talents, weapon talents, special abilities, and (for magic users) spells.  You get AP by fighting battles and completing quests.  You do not get enough AP to turn your characters into super heros; but, if you do most of the sidequests, you will get enough to make them excellent in their chosen specialty (magic, melee, ranged) and solid in a second specialty and/or support.  One word of caution: this is not the game for those who want to destroy waves of hapless foes with giant fire or frost balls.  Using magic to buff teammates (and/or debuff enemies) will carry the day.\n\nThere are approximately 180 fights available in the game, for those who wish to seek them all out, with plenty of tactical variety and some light "in-fight" puzzle solving.  In all but a few cases, the game clues you in to what is needed to make a fight easier.  For those few where they fall short, there is the internet: I used it about six times.  There were about three fights I elected to replay because I failed or did not like the outcome.  All in all, I found the combat to be satisfying.\n\nSome have complained of running out of ammo (the shops do not re-stock arrows and bolts); but I ran two archers and one crossbow, and did not come close to running out.  I think someone relied too heavily on "triple shot" and "rain of arrows," which skills none of my characters learned.\n\nThe storyline is nothing to write home about; and the ending cutscenes/wrap-up is lackluster.  But the character voice acting, approriate interjection of humor, and plot intrigue that is played out was, in my opinion, quite well done.\n\nReplay value is modest.  The plot twists and intrigue are a lot of what pulled me along the first time.  Your party characters are a mandatory set of (up to) five characters, only one of which you get to roll from scratch, and even HIM not entirely (name, gender and appearance are all set for you).  After almost 90 hours on record for my first run, another one (this time on NORMAL) will have to wait until I am up for it.  But, for the pittance I paid for the game (got it on a deep, DEEP discount), one run was overwhemingly worth the price!\n\nEPILOGUE / HINTS (which some might consider slightly spoilerish, but I will not give away plot.)\n-- Screw the game's advice:  Roll your own character from scratch the first time.  It is almost impossible to fail if you buy in as a magic user and start him out good at SOMETHING.\n-- Take magic, unless you are dead set on a heavy melee fighter.  the 500 AP cost might seem like a lot, but it is a pittance over the course of the game, compared to the advantages it gives.\n-- Continuing this line of thought, a dedicated heavy melee fighter is probably not the best choice, as you will eventually end up having two excellent ones foisted upon you.  You will be much better served with a magic buffer/healer who is good at bows.\n-- All your magic users should be good with staffs, or possibly daggers.\n-- Study spells carefully before trying to achieve high ranks in them.  For most spells, level 4 is not worth the cost.\n-- Hammer Blow (HB), coupled with level 3 "Standfast Catlike" buff is OP.\n-- The level 3 buff "Move like Lightning" (or some name llike that) is OP.\n-- A fighter simultaneously buffed with level 3 Lightning and Standfast, and also using HB, is beyond OP for most fights.","January 25","true","88.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Do you like campaigns in which dialogue options are almost meaningless and the plot is confusing? Well if you haven't, Blackguards can fill that void for you.\n\nThe plot isn't bad. It captured my attention fairly early and has some nice twists in it. The main focus of this game, however, is the combat system. I love the combat in this game. Blackguards uses a version of tabletop rules to fuel its combat. There are even simulated dice rolls for damage and hit chance. Unfortunately, (or fortunately depending) pretty much every dialogue option leads to some sort of cliche combat. Very rarely is there a non-combat solution to anything.\n\nThe character creation is pretty cool also. There are two modes; basic and advanced. The creation is very open and is manipulated by AP (adventure points (I think)). Using these points (earned from combat and completion of quests), you can add talents, special abilities, spells, and basic attributes to your character, none being restricted to your character (except spells in some cases).\n\nUnfortunately, this game does have some downsides. Some of the encounters are downright frustrating and (at least for me), very difficult. A number of times I've had to walk away from the game or take a break. These particular encounters seem to me generated specifically to be hard and not at all story oriented. I won't go into much detail about them so I don't spoil the "fun" for you. On the plus side however, there is no penalty for losing as the game forces you to keep trying unless you load a previous save before the encounter.\n\nThe graphics are actually quite nice and are better than I expected. The layout for combat is excellent, using hex-tiles and a partially destructible environment. The cities however seem more like pretty backdrops for my character sheets and are fairly dull.\n\nI would recommend this game if you are an avid tabletop gamer looking for your D&D fix, or someone who appreciates tabletop games.\n\n7.5/10","June 3, 2014","true","24.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Sure there are a few choice options that cater to your supposed anti-heroism but they are few and far between.\n\nTrue to its billing I did clock in completing the game in about 40 hours. I liked the game for what it was (i've played better/worse turn based RPGs) and will most likely play it again with a different hero build but I'm not really in any rush to do so.","January 30, 2014","false","40.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The plot line is good, with enough mystery to leave you wondering at what's happened (alongside the protagonist, who can be either male or female, and is voiced appropriately) and what's going to happen next.\n\nI haven't quite finished the game yet, but would recommend it to anyone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/249650/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","Blackguards is a turn-based strategy game with deep RPG elements based on the popular German pen and paper RPG The Dark Eye. You assume the role of your own custom character who is accused of killing the princess in the opening cinematic. Your only choice is to run away, assemble a cast of shady characters such as the suave mage Zurbaran, the feisty dwarf Naurim and the tribal warrior Takate. The storytelling and the characters are solid, but they really don’t stand out in any significant way, for the most part it really feels like a poor man’s BioWare story.\n\nWhat makes Blackguards truly shine are its great combat system and wonderful game world. The combat system is hex based and may at first remind you of fantasy turn-based strategy games such as Heroes of Might and Magic or King’s Bounty. In reality, it’s more like a combination of Disciples III and Neverwinter Nights, a heavy mixture of classic turn-based strategy and role-playing philosophy. The fantastic thing about the combat system is that every single battlefield is completely unique. Not only are they all different from a visual standpoint, but they are all set up differently as well. Sometimes you’re surrounded, sometimes you have multiple goals, sometimes you have to defend something. You can also use the environment to your advantage. Cut the rope to make the heavy wooden chandelier fall on your foes or burn down the walkway spiderwebs causing deadly poisonous spiders fall to their doom.\n\nAnother big thing different from usual turn-based strategy games is that you’re not building an army, you have a party of up to five characters. As you progress through the game, you acquire adventure points which you can use to upgrade your characters in a wide variety of attributes, abilities, spells, talents and weapon talents. It’s a really robust system that allows for truly deep customization and experimentation. The only negative thing is that the game assumes that you’re familiar with The Dark Eye ruleset when in reality you will need some time to really figure it out.\n\nThe other problem stemming from the use of The Dark Eye ruleset is that almost any attack can be a hit or miss. Because the game is really tough and the opening battles are rather grueling, it can be really frustrating missing a 95% attack. There are ways to upgrade your characters to offset this, but again, this will take some time to figure out as the game doesn’t really explain much of anything. This can cause some really ugly bouts of frustration and anger, but it’s not a deal breaker.\n\nThe vast majority of the gameplay is in the battles. Apart from that, you’ll be using a lovely 2D map to travel from location to location. Towns are represented with a single screen depicting various points of interest such as shops, healers, blacksmiths and quests. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the wonderful art style is sort of a mixture between fantasy, medieval Spain and 16th century Caribbean which is actually seldom seen in games. The accompanying soundtrack reflects that as well and fits the game very well. However, the animations aren’t that great and the voice work, while mostly solid, can be a bit cringe-worthy at times.\n\nBlackguards is a hardcore game for hardcore gamers and it is completely unapologetic about it. So be prepared for some truly grueling stuff and a steep learning curve. The great thing is, it’s absolutely worth playing thanks to the great combat system, deep RPG elements and a wonderful game world.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","February 16, 2014","true","63.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

I have no idea who my character is, what he's done, or if there's any reasoning behind anything I've ran across thus far.\nThe other heroes are so painfully one note it's not even funny. The dwarf is quite possibly insane and is hunting a dragon (which may or may not be real). The mage is a scholor but mostly a well spoken man♥♥♥♥♥. The elf is a drug addict who owes people money. Oh, and has an injured sister.\n\nMost of that stuff is what I learned about them in the first five minutes of their appearing and nothing has changed.\nThe story isn't much better. After nine hours I've discovered that we're trying escape capture and figure out what's going on.\nWhich is pretty much where I was ten minutes in. It's just going too slow to really get invested in anything.\n\nThe second problem is the combat.\nI will conceed that they did a nice job of varying the maps and throwing in varying maps with different enviromental hazards.\nUnfortunatly that's about all of the nice things I can say. After nine hours I had access to nearly no abilities to play with, a limited number of spells worth using.\nFights for me basically went "Warriors power attack, mage fire bolts"\nMost of the fights feel like I wont mostly because I had more HP than they did rather than any tactical considerations.\nAnd since most of the fights feel the same, the combat quickly feels very much like a grind.\n\nWhich is ironic because grinding is something you can't do intentionally.\n\nCombat only happens during missions and subquests. So you can't build up money to buy stuff, and you can't grind to build up some extra XP. So if you're having difficulty there's no way to stack the odds in your favor.\n\nAnd if you want anything new you will need a LOT of gold. Sadly, though, you won't find much in the way of new equipment, or new weapons for quite some time.\n\nAnd you know how in D&D looting the bodies after a fight was the most exciting part, because maybe... just maybe you'd get an awesome magical sword, or some kind of unique armor? Well this isn't D&D, you'll get some generic weapons if you're lucky.\nYou want something unique? Watch for sidequests. Nine hours in there are two. And those two weapons are only marginally better than the weapons you pick up after your first fight.\n*sigh*\n\nThe final and biggest problem with combat is that it seems to linked to some kind of weird nonsense logic. You can have a 95% chance of hitting and you can (and will) miss three out of four time.\nI had a mage with an 85% chance of success cast one successful spell in five rounds. The good news is that failing to cast a spell doesn't cost you magic points, but it wastes your entire round.\nAnd I am aware that enemies have the ability to dodge or parry your attack, but doesn't that seem like something that should be listed in the to hit percental?\nIf I see 95% to hit, I assume that means that out of a hundred attacks I'll miss five times. The battle Log, which shows the results of all your attacks, isn't any help in deciphering why you've missed. Which is frustrating after three rounds of both my fighters missing an enemy and that same enemy missing them.\nIf I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, I can't fix it.\n\nAnd don't expect the game to explain it to you. It doesn't.\n\nBasically all of my complaints seems to come down to pacing. It's too slow. The story is too slow for me to get interested in it, the characters develope to slow (if at all) for me to bond with them, my combat options increase too slow so I'm bored with combat, my equipment changes so slowly I'm not really interested in even winning fights, and my abilities increase so slow I'm not even interested in trying to buy the very limited number of skills in the game.\nHell, going into towns in this game is slow! There is a surprisingly long load time to pop into cities which are, for all extents and purposes, a static shot of a the town with three to five people standing around.\nDon't expect to explore the town, either, generally you get three icons to click on and then you're officially done with everything the town has to offer.\n\nBut I figured, oh well. If playing it on Easy is still a painfully slow slog maybe I can just cheat to get a ton of gold, EXP and just power through the game.\nAnd, unfortunatly, the creators decided that there isn't even a cheating option. Sounds bad for me to complain about that, but after three fights which were basically attrition battles designed to wear down your team and waste your (EXPENSIVE) potions in long drawn out fights where enemies just continiously spawn...\n\nYeah, I'm tired. I just want to speed things up so I can see if the story gets any better. But I can't. So, I'm done.\n\nI can't suggest it, which is sad because I wanted this game to be good. I wanted to play this and I wanted to enjoy it.","July 12, 2014","false","19.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

I want to tell you the story is fantastic. Filled with all the ups and downs of great storytelling. I want to tell you the mechanics are fun, challenging and rewarding. I want to, I really do.\n\nWhat I will tell you though, is that music is very atmospheric and enjoyable. I found the characters likable and humorous with the exception of Aurelia. They all were perhaps a bit over the top in most aspects of their personality. However, that's what makes them a character isn't it?\n\nTurn based strategy games are slow affairs to begin with for obvious reasons. This one however, in specific battles, has more enemies than can fit on the screen. Some examples, Slugs (Morfus) Zombies, skeletons, other dead things that move incredibly slowly. And you have to watch each one take their horrifically slow turns. Perhaps there was a way to skip this or have it resolve faster, however I was unable to find such amenities.\n\nThe tactics leave something to be desired as well. I don't really have a real complaint about them just that they don't feel rewarding. It doesn't feel you've out smarted anyone or overcome some great obstacle. It just feels like you've done your due diligence. So the game decides to let you win now.\n\nI did experience “the feels” when Niam is killed for little to no reason. But I can't help but question the anti-drug undertone.\n\nThis is possibly one of my least favorite games I've ever completed.

I love the Dark Eye world and the gritty fantasy found therein and I feel that this game does not disappoint.\n\nPROS\n\n1) THE CHARACTERS! I adored the main characters and genuinely felt that each line of dialogue between them was solid gold.  Every one of them had a great personality and contributed to the overall value of this game a great deal.\n\n2) The Dialogue and Story: You can take it or leave it but I what I came across I enjoyed.  While it is true that the story is linear and doing side-missions does nothing but help you grind this was never an issue for me.  I liked the story and the direction it was taken.  You're a bad guy doing bad things for the right reasons and it is not often to come across something that does this trope well.  The game does a great job of putting you into the "antihero" mentality.\n\n3) Combat: This game does not hold your hand.  You WILL redo fights, you WILL get frustrated, and unless you know how to build your stats and abilities you WILL fall behind but as long as you play your hand correctly you will always be able to win the next fight.  Similar to older iterations of D&D (which Die Schwarze Auge/The Dark Eye is the German equivalent of more or less) there are weapon AND damage types to consider.  Knowing what kind of weapons and what kind of damage types to use are crucial against certain enemies.  For example, DON'T USE PIERCING AGAINST THE UNDEAD!  They are completely immune to anything that doesn't impart massive physical trauma to their skeleton like slashing or bashing weapons would.  Some enemies are immune to poison, some to magic, and some to physical damage.  It will be trial and error to figure this out but this is also why you can equip each character with three different weapon load-outs which you can cycle through in combat so as to avoid being harmless to a specific enemy.  Other things to note about combat include the diversity of places you will fight in (it makes you feel like you're actually traveling from place to place), the importance of positioning, the use of environmental effects to your advantage, and bottlenecking.  Combat is the meat and potatoes to this game and after 50+ hours of this game I, for one, can say that it does not get old.\n\n4) Stat Systems and Leveling: DO NOT RAISE BASE STATS! At least not at first.  This game offers a wide variety of upgrade paths with which you can take your party in a multitude of directions.  Wanna be a crazy hefty tank? Upgrade Warcraft, Body Control, Willpower, Strength, Vitality, and the proficiency of two weapons of your choice.  Wanna be everywhere and piercing armor? Upgrade Agility, Body Control, Spear proficiency, Dexterity, and Vitality for that damage you are most certainly going to take.  Wanna mage it up?  Take Bow proficiency, level your spells like crazy (a hefty investment), and make sure you have a tank or two between you and the enemy.  While some might bemoan the lack of class options with there only being three, Warrior, Ranger, and Mage, it isn't that large of an issue.  This is not a game about diplomacy or sneaking around (ignoring two or three AWFUL missions that can be solved with fighting), it's about slugging it out with the enemy.  To play something that doesn't contribute to the fight directly is to take a difficult game and make it impossible.\n\n5) Grittiness: I consider this a plus because I like games that force you to be aware of the number of arrows in your quiver, how absolutely vital healing can be, and how huge a difference is made when you finally buy that new axe that does ONE MORE DAMAGE.  This is a game where all the small things add up over time to take your party from bandit npcs to gods on the battlefield.  Throughout the game you can also learn special attacks which give you advantages in certain situations such as inflicting wounds (Wounds and HP Damage are totally separate things), knocking down enemies, or doing more damage from a distance with ranged weaponry.  The larger and more valuable the effect the more costly the attack will be in terms of accuracy so a very effective trade-off between damage/utility and accuracy is established.\n\n6) The World: Not much to say aside from how much I enjoyed it and all the people you come across.  It is VERY uncommon for you to run across nice individuals so when you do you instantly grow attached to them.  Even then most of the "nice" people you come across are still awful by today's standards due to their desires to brainwash, enslave, or kill off rivals for a plethora of reasons.  Aventuria (the world) isn't a great place and it's heroes reflect that, but maybe, with a great deal of effort, you can change that.\n\nCONS\n\n1) The Probability System: IT LIESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! Never in a game have I missed five consecutive instances of hitting with a 95% chance of my attack succeeding each time.  It is without a doubt the single most irritating and detracting point to this whole game.  Until you play Blackguards you will not understand how infuriating it can be.  It doesn't just apply to physical attacks, though.  Your spells will fizzle out and do nothing, your arrows can randomly vanish, you will fail body tests where you have a 99% chance of passing and fall down.  This was a HUGE oversight on the part of the developers and if they would just release a patch that made these percentages more accurate I would have nothing against this RPG.\n\n2) POISONS and Enemy Buffs! In the latter half of the campaign in an attempt to balance the gameplay the developers just decided to either give the enemies a flat magic stat buff or give all of their attacks the poison quality which will do continuous damage or give you a stat debuff for the rest of the fight.  Not nearly as irritating as the percentage issue but it does somewhat cheapen the joy you get when your party goes into an encounter that you should faceroll only to discover that the enemy basically leveled up with you.\n\n3) Stat Building: While I did mention this as a plus earlier you can very easily destroy your game by building poorly.  Seeing as how there is no way to undo this it can prove to be game ruining.\n\nOverall, I would give this experience a solid 8/10.  Fun from beginning to end and if you see it on sale for less than 10 you should instantly snatch it up.","December 5, 2014","true","55.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Although even those are just a numbers game, just bigger numbers. You can also choose your starting equipment, this is pretty neat, if it weren't for the fact that you lose all of your equipment after your first combat.\n\nSpeaking of combat, every action you do has a high chance of failing, from casting a spell to setting a trap to swinging a club. The chance to hit or be succesful is made harder by your enemies' defenses. Wait, that's not all, the damage range of your weapons goes from 1-6, 5-10, or 4-12 for example, this damage is further reduced by your enemies' damage reduction %, and flat damage reduction. This means that on top of the abnormally high miss chance(plus dodge and parry chances!), actually dealing damage is stupendously hard. Now imagine most enemies have around the same health as you, 30ish. So what do you do? You wail on the enemies until they fall down, hoping you even hit them. This makes combat feel sluggish, your actions meaningless, and generally make you waste time.\n\nThe story? You get to choose which lines are said first.. sometimes. It also appears you get some dialogue options at times. None of these worked, and didn't work the few times I did try them. Perhaps they work later in the game when you have a higher Charisma? Thing is, I maxed my charisma, it wouldn't go higher, so why have those options there at the start anyway? To waste my time? Make me feel like I have a choice?

It's just extremely mediocre.  If you're into D&D alternatives and dig X-Com, it probably won't waste your time.  But I can't recommend it for most people.\n\nThe character customization is surprisingly lacking, despite the illusion of choice.  There are twice as many attributes as a D&D system, but they all just sum together to increase your attack, dodge chance, initiative, etc.  There are only a handful of combat abilities to use, so there's not a lot of choice as far stabbing/shooting.  The magic users are more nuanced; there are a ton of spells, each with 4 tiers, so you're constantly weighing the cost/benefit of those.\n\nCombat itself is very similar to X-Com or D&D 4.0: you get either a move and an action, or a double move.  This all occurs on a hex-grid, and most maps have some sort of interactable element to spice it up.  They do an admirable attempt to differentiate the levels, but you will take place in about a billion combat scenarios, so a lot of them inevitably feel repetitive.  You'll probably be skipping side quests by the end out of boredom.\n\nThe plot is pretty linear.  There are batches of side quests that open up at various points, but none of them augment the main plot line at all.  It's your typical RPG "save my daughter" or "escort my caravan" kind of stuff.  You become enslaved and forced to fight in a gladiatorial arena at one point, so that's pretty neat.","April 4, 2015","false","28.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The system is both simple and overly complex at the same time, but it balances out nicely. The graphics and the storyline certainly aren't anything to write home about, but for a turn-based game they are more than acceptable - after all, the real focus of any turn-based strategy game is going to be the combat, not the sparkling wit or crisp graphics.\n\nUnfortunately, the combat is where things really fall apart.\n\nThat's not to say that the combat system itself is at fault. It's passable, and roughly analogous to Dungeons & Dragons. The real problem is that many of the set-piece battles are designed to be inherently unfair. Even on the easiest difficulty, you'll often struggle with scenarios that are designed to be one step short of impossible. You'll often find your character(s) stripped of their equipment and forced to use random items that you don't have the skill to use. You'll often find yourself thrown into insane battlefields filled with literally dozens of hidden traps, endless hordes of respawning opponents, or obtuse victory conditions that require you to interact with five or more scattered pieces of scenery. Somewhere along the line, the designers seem to have gotten just a bit too clever about their level designs, inadvertantly making many encounters more frustrating than fun.\n\nFortunately, the developers made several adjustments as the game went through early release - so if you can power through the first two chapters (Chapter Two is particularly frustrating), then you'll find that the game opens up a good deal. At that point it becomes a much more enjoyable experience, although still occasionally plagued with annoyingly obtuse map design (one optional "arena" map can easily take an hour or more to finish due to it's maze-like design and infinitely spawning enemies).\n\nIf you're a hardcore strategy gamer, then Blackguards is certainly worth buying. For anyone even slightly more casual, though, you should probably give Blackguards a pass.","January 27, 2014","false","43.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

When even a single missed hit can cost you the battle (which are frequently overly long) it seems counter-productive to have such low hit chances even when the relevant weapon skill is maxed out and complimentary stats are high.\nI'm sure if you are a veteran of The Dark Eye, the choice of character build could be optimised such that the battles are easier; on the other hand the highly repetitive battle sequences, lack of character placement pre-battle, dreadful story, and lacklustre town interface probably wouldn't make the game enjoyable.\nI was genuinely looking forward to this game heralding a new wave of turn-based/tactical rpgs (of which i am a great fan), but now I am left sincerely hoping the publisher never curses the world with a sequel.","October 12, 2014","false","19.6"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","0"

Simple put, if you enjoy games where you have to lose battles a dozen times to memorize trap locations, constantly fight unbalanced matches and only like to stick with non-intuitive,  cookie cutter builds, then this game is definitely for you.\nIf you want to experiment with unique builds, play melee or just want some fun battles and original gameplay, look elsewhere, this really isnt for you.\n\nNot even a couple of hours into the game and I realised that the battle mechanics are absolutely one of the worst i've seen, in over a decade of playing turn based strategy games. It's another perfect example of developers compensating for horrible AI, by overpowering the player.\n\nA few other problems: This isnt tactical, it's nearly impossible to be tactical in this game because the maps are way too simple, if you're looking for XCOM style tactics, this is nowhere close. Most of the obstacles can be shot through and they provide no additional defense(unless of course the enemy is behind them, in which case they will shoot from behind their obstacle and also through yours and still knock you down with an arrow, from the other end of the map), even with 90% hit chance you will constantly miss.\n\nI've never once wanted to give up on a game so fast but I already see no incentive to continue with this game, it's just so boring and unrewarding for the difficulty. I regret buying it, even at the sale price of $15.\n\nPlease, for your sake, ignore the steam reviews and do some proper online research before buying this game.","November 2, 2014","false","38.4"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","3"

If you like old school D&D themed type of games and turn based combat with quite a few skills spells and stats..... this game is for you. If you want a pew pew own other players in an MMO this game is not for you. The game seems slow to many people because well... it  IS!!! It's supposed to be a kick back and enjoy the world story with fun turn based battles. It may not be the best game ever or anything, I'm not saying that, but it is damn good imo. The dialouge can be pretty damn funny at times and it's a pretty game. The loading screens can be a bit annoying when you are trying to find a particular trainer or whatever so I suggest using a pen and paper if you find yourself forgetting where destinations are. One thing that annoys me a bit is I still have not found anywhere that tells me my AR flat out....and some of the hover overs on new equiptment can be annoying as they are not intuiative... takes a bit to figure out and doesn't need to be that way imo. I'd still give the game a 4.5 out of 5 stars...and it's a lot longer than I expected it to be which pleased me so far. (not finished with the game yet only at the end of chapter 3).

It has turn based mechanics with lots of flexibility - shall i use the environment to my advantage, shall i switch weapons or shall i just spam the most powerful attack i have (yes. do the latter). Just the WORST thing about the game is when you successfully miss 4 attacks in a row each with a hit chance of 80%. This sort of treachery happens often and really spoils the battle.\n\nThe battle map is great and you can easily find your way around the battlefield although in my opinion the user interface is lacking a bit - all the useful buttons are grouped together and are a little bit too small for my liking. You can semi-personalise each character and evolve their skills and attributes to your liking - although unless you want to turn a mage into a bad-boy-brawler (and why the hell would you do that) there isnt that much choice.\n\nAll in all it is a better than average game although is only worth buying when on steam sale.","December 4, 2015","true","4.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Tends to get somewhat repetitive over time, and suffers somewhat from the inherent weaknesses inherited from the Dark Eye game system and background.

None. Zero. Your experience with exploring the world of Blackguards consists of clicking on an icon on the world map representing a settlement and loading up a marketplace view, said view having a few icons to click on that load up the various types of stores or that occasionally (a different icon) offer quests. And that's it.\n\nThe various settlements are highly detailed, but all of that detail exists on static backgrounds. The backdrop pictures could have offered a great sense of place simply by utilizing a nice exterior shot. Indeed, this being a fantasy world, and one where many of the settlements offer a rather distinct size and local elements, exterior views could have added a great deal of wonder and adventure to the player's sense of the world. As it is, though, settlements are just a series of the same four stores with minor hints at the diversity that the world has to offer with a few extra flourishes added to some of the marketplaces.\n\nFor the most part, one's interaction with the world is on the level of an mmo. There are stores to click on and buy stuff, and there is the occasional quest giver that is met once or twice, says his generic spiel to send you off on your generic quest, and one never sees them again after. Leaving the game with no sense of character.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe overall concept of Blackguards is generic chosen one gets chosen for unknown reasons to save the world. It's a bland and generic concept, but there's nothing inherently bad about it. One can take a generic concept and sprinkle originality upon it to make an exciting concept. Operative word being can. With Blackguards, the one conceit to originality is that the characters are "blackguards".\n\nExcept they're not. The main character is, in actuality, falsely accused of a crime he/she didn't commit. And he/she now roams the badlands, an outlaw hunting outlaws...a RENEGADE.\n\nSome of your cohorts have committed crimes. But other than a few - very rare - jokes, this never really comes into play. The only character who is actually a criminal during the game is quickly killed off. The rest of the characters are more in the "gang of rogues and misfits" territory. And the things that that band of rogues and misfits are called upon to do during the game are the usual generic RPG quests. Find the lost "ring", rescue the damsel in distress, kill these bandits, etc.\n\nWith only that unused conceit to count towards originality, there is nothing original in the Blackguards storyline. It is, unfortunately, the usual generic, bland template upon which to hand an RPG. But it actually gets worse than that, because the various enemies and situations are also generic, and the core development is a jumbled mess, leading to no driving reason to progress through the story. (Stressing here that there is no driving reason to progress through the story, not the game.)\n\nThere's a core of a good story lying within Blackguards. Evil villains, saving the world, high adventure. But none of it ever gets used. Instead, the overall story sits in the background while the characters get captured - again - and drug around doing random combats against generic foes that have no personal stake in the overall story. The number of times that the party actually fights people who are involved in the threat to the world before reaching the final chapter is incredibly low. Instead, in a world threatened with destruction, it's mostly bandits, gladiators, various animals, and independent undead that the party meets.\n\nThe characters of the main party have some personality, even if it is a bit two-dimensional. Their personalities are well-written. But there is little there to most of them, and those personalities do not drive the story. The only driving force in the story is the Chosen One main character. The other members of the party simply offer some localized color here and there. And unfortunately, the best personality is killed off early and replaced by someone as bland as the Chosen One main character. The remaining personalities are well-written, but bland.\n\nWhich brings up one of the major points that are often brought up about games like Blackguards - "It's not about the story; it's about the combat". And while it is true that the centerpiece of Blackguards is combat, one also spends a lot of time watching cutscenes following along the story. If the story isn't actually a major part of the game, then it shouldn't occupy a major part of the time of the game. If it does occupy a large portion of gametime, then it is a major part of the game. End of story.\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT\n\nAt first, the resource management of Blackguards seems like it will be an exciting and detailed system. But like so much else in the game, none of what is met in that first impression is ever fully realized. There is a lot of meat here. The consumables system is highly detailed, with a lot to offer a game that put pressure on those resources. But there is never any pressure. None of the resources matter.  The most glaring of these is rations. The sole use of rations is to allow the group to camp out on the world map. Yet, since there are no wandering monsters and no risk or real time involved in traveling, there is no reason not to simply click on a settlement and rest at its inn rather than lug around heavy rations units (other than the obscurely long loading times for the settlements).\n\nThe only resource that is regularly bought are arrows, for those rare times when there aren't bundles of them found on the enemy, or when - much more often - all of your equipment has been taken from you. As with so much else in Blackguards, resource management is a highly detailed system that a lot could be done with, but that never comes to fruition. Soon after it's introduction, it becomes left by the wayside.\n\nCOMBAT\n\nFor all of the famed glory of the Blackguards combat system, there actually isn't much to it. The party is made up of five members, and they usually fight from 6-7 enemies, occasionally more, sometimes less. The battles take place on a hex-grid, and they take place in turns based on individual character speed and an initiative roll.\n\nUnfortunately, the enemies are underdeveloped. There is not a great deal of enemy variety. There are a large number of enemy portraits to fight. But there are not a wide variety of methods of attack. Most enemies are melee grunts who attack using the same pattern and single attack, whether they are mindless zombies or (supposedly) intelligent bandits. A few combats have enemies with ranged ability, which they use in a largely random fashion, instead of a focused aggressive one. And a rare few  have spellcasters, which use their spells in a largely ineffective fashion. Combats against opponents with special abilities beyond that are really rare.\n\nOn the other hand, it is good for the party that enemies remain stupid and unfocused, as the party are always outnumbered and usually fighting on empty square battlemaps, and thus a focused effort would likely easily overwhelm the party. Likewise, the enemy do not have all of the special abilities that the party do. Again, this is a must for the survivability of the party. The power feats that are available are just so intensely powerful, and there is so little defense against them, that having any of those abilities is essentially an I-WIN button.\n\nWhich leads to the main issue with the combat - it's is badly balanced. Open character development systems are really hard to balance, and this one is not even remotely in the balanced ballpark. There are some aspects of the character that are hugely beneficial (Super Improved Power Attack), some that are only of minor benefit (Read Enemy hp), and some that are of no benefit at all (fireball).

Scratch that....\n\nCombat which you will be doing alot of is bland and repetative. Be prepared to be posioned in alot of battles, also prepare for your spells to fail regardless if you are maxed out in them, For example I had 1 spell called  Cold Shock (Level 18) Maxed in the description I have a 99% chance to cast, in one battle this % drops to 8% with no explaination. This game is not not very forth coming in telling you the negatives that effect you well unless is poison :).\n\nMagic, What the game does not tell you is with spells that effect all enemies your chances of casting these spells drops to stupid odds... For example in the last few fights in Chapter 5 I was trying to cast a few spells the chance was 1%, please understand I had all my skills maxed regarding spell casting, even reliable spells like the Fireball one was reduced to 48% from 99%. As a whole being a magic user you are punished. Does the enemy get punished in the same way? No they are able to case level 4 spells at 99%.\n\nStoryline, seems non exsistant at the moment and I am on chapter 5 the last chapter, you arent made to care for your choices or characters sorry I like to feel my choices in RPGs actually make a difference.\n\nSkill Trees, again like combat it is bland, if you go melee you want to go for Hammer Blow which forces you to take Two Handed Bashing or Axes and Maces. I did start the game of as dual wielding swords how wrong I was :(. There is very little choices in skills say unlike games like Path of Exile.\n\nThe equipment you get is standard and boring. You would expect from a Fantasy RPG to get some magic items well dont hold your breath, there are a few items that will give you the odd boost but they are few and far between.\n\nOverall as a fan of Turn-Based games and RPGs Blackguards comes up short in so many ways.\n\nI am glad I paid less than what its on sale for.","January 26, 2014","false","29.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

So I *know* when I talk about difficulty I mean it, this game is absolutely frustrating sometimes; on easy the enemies are more forgiving ( and I am not one to use that setting unless absolutely necesary) BUT the hazards and Obstacles are NOT.\n\nI will still purchase whatever DLC the devs decide to release, and I will definitely purchase a second part of this game, just because I am a very passionate RPG'er, and this is truly a gem of game. However, a lotta folks will be put off by the brutal difficulty the game throws at you constantly and the (somewhat) steep learning curve.","March 9, 2014","false","43.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

There are plenty of community posts surrounding the faulty achievements.\n\nThe game itself took a while for me to get into, it wasn't until part way through the second chapter that I found myself actually wanting to continue playing the game.\n\nI experienced 2 bugs during my gameplay, once the game crashed when trying to add a new save to my list of game saves and once when casting a spell in battle, nothing happened after the casting animation so I had to crash out and re-load the battle.\n\nAs for game play and story line, you can tell this game was not finished when it was released due to the map being more than twice the size of the actual parts of the map you explore during the game. I found the ending very anticlimactic. The whole game is fully voice acted, yet the ending has a few words show up at the bottom of the screen over some scenic views... There is no obvious resolution to anything in the storyline and you are not told how the choices you made throughout the game have affected the outcome of the ending, meaning if you were to replay the game you wouldn't know what to do differently.\n\nThe game is visually very nice and the voice acting is good, although some times in battle I had a mans voice sound when I hit a female enemy and vice versa.\n\nAs a result, I have to say that Blackguards is a non-recommendation as I don't feel like the story provided me with anything to take away and think about, and also because of the bugged achievements meaning I can never 100% this game!","April 7, 2015","false","33.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

D&D style RPG that invokes quests that don't use your current stats.  One that takes away all the party's armor and gives everyone clubs.  Another that takes one of your party out of the fight (and kills them off).  While one might say it's a strategic RPG,  that only applies if there aren't so may variables as to make strategy next to pointless (it's mandatory, but still comes down to plain luck far too often).  Bad enough the normal D&D variables to hit, the variable damage, but then lets toss in higher numbers of opponents, invisible terrain traps, and opponents that always have poisoned weapons.  Flanking an opponent doesn't seem to have been included, so pointless, and while crit hits are included, when the opponents out number you, they have a greater chance of getting crits, by benefit of more of them means more chances for a crit role. High level of frustration.\nUpdate - 2nd attempt, a little better.  Got to the point I quit first time.  Believe first time it was bugged as chance to hit was only 55% and bugs hit for 8-10 dmg.  This time I see my hit chance at 75% and bugs hit for 4-5 damage.

Follows genetic fantasy tropes . Character creation is bare bones , you cannot modify starting stats .  Game offers large world map , but due to its linear nature you will be just staring at places you can't go . Story progresses by clicking on hubs where you will either enter a city screen or combat . Side quests are very limited .\n\nAppearance customization is limited to picking  out of five pre-made characters per gender.  There is significant shortage of light and leather armor variety . 85-90% of all armors in a game are metal which means you spell caster wont be able to use it . Game has nice sandbox system where you are allowed pick whichever skills/perks you like . Perks require xp and trainer .  It can be difficult to find trainer to teach you perk . For example you might unknowingly leave act 1 and lose access to mage trainer for rest of act 2 .\n\nCombat is dull . Most of it involves using same spell/melee attack and hoping you will get lucky.\n\nGraphics and are style are uninspiring .  There is no camera angle rotation and overall camera controls are poor . This can lead to some frustration such as inability to target or see enemy hiding in a corner .\n\nYou can interact with some environment and there are some environmental hazards like methane gas in swamps. You characters and enemies can slip on wet floor . Some maps with lots of water spills turn into some kind of comedy involving every character falling to the ground at start of their turn .\n\nVoice acting is decent . And dwarf you get in beginning of the game is awesome .\n\nIn terms of bugs and glitches game was polished in its early stages .

The game can be VERY punishing.  An NPC in the tutorial village suggested I master many different weapon styles.  Seeing as it was an NPC in the tutorial village I took its advice...BIG mistake.  I got punished sooooo hard for making my warriors master 3 weapon styles.  I think what the NPC meant to say was make sure your PARTY masters different weapon styles.  For example, make sure everyone doesn't use piercing weapons because the undead are IMMUNE to spears and arrows!!!  Rekt....\n\nBut once I changed the difficulty slider from normal to easy I managed to get through the game and beat it with still a challegning final boss fight...on easy...\n\nThe jist of it is, if you're going to play Blackguards have a clear plan of what you want your group to do.  Warriors should be warriors not fighter/archer hybrids.  Mages should max buff and debuff spells not staff and 1 handed swords...sigh (I WANTED A MAGE TANK)...didn't happen. Archers should BE archers.  Don't teach your archers how to use 2 handed weapons you will get punished hard if you do.\n\nIts a shame the game doesn't let the player do more hybrid, jack of all trade kind of builds, but it just doesn't.  Think of your party as an old fashioned dungeon and dragons group.  Dwarf uses axe, mage uses magic, elf uses bow.  That's just how it is in this game.\n\nI picked this game up on sale for $10 and got over 40 hours out of it (and I may play again sometime down the line....waaaaay down the line).  So that's value.  Its fun so long as you play with a party build goal and don't over reach where you allocate your party stats.","December 16, 2014","true","43.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","2"

Well it is a good idea for a game, but the realisation is missing something.\nWhat could that be?\nWell the first impressions were good- the characters have a lot to learn, but somehow for the new players it is unknown could they learn everything, something or just few things? There is no explanation.\nThe game gives you to chose between 2 options that will define your game- will the main stats of the hero will be automaticaly distrubuted, or you will do everything manualy.\nSo far for me, my adventure was with 3 heroes, however I was with 2 warriors and a mage. Somehow I did not made a ranger and I found that as a mistake when advansing in the game.\nI found myself more frequently repeating and reloading a map to find the best solution to win or get out from combat.\nYes, the combat.\nWell, the combat is Turn Based so you have time to think your strategy, however heroes miss a lot, and sometimes a chance to hit or make a spell of 70%+ is not enough. Every fail punish could punish you really badly.\nThe maps are not so big, but for that kind of game I guess they are enough, however, for me, they looked someking small.\nYou could interact with some object in the map or use an object to take a cover from an enemy archer, however, not everytime this thing works. Some archers simply ignore that.\nThe audio is good. The voice acting is in good level.\nThe soundtrack is good. I liked it.\nI made few side quests, but one of them was really pain in the ♥♥♥ in at the end I even did not finished it. It was horrible. Probably much higher level heroes could do it.\nThe grapics are nice for the eye.\nI did not encounter any bugs, but I can not keep playing the game. It is enough.\nSo for final- this is avarage turn based strategy with RPG elements, however, there are better ones out there that you can play.\nFor me- I would not try this game anymore.

If you picked a ranged charcter like I did, assume all your gold is going to provisions, healers and arrows.\n\nNo farming, since you can't just go get in an random battles, if you have an area to explore it is best to visit every location to get all the EXP you can.\n\nMake sure you save in multiple save slots, you can get yourself in a chain of mission that you just can't win without an extra provision or something.  If you don't have that save game from before you trigger the chain of events you could be stuck.\n\nOne last thing, don't be afraid to click end turn 50 times in a row if monsters aren't activated to get your magic points back and heal everyone and then get them back of to be ready for combat.\n\nOverall, I am really enjoying it so far.

There are a lot of looading pages, and even though the game auto saves before and after a battle, it is best to make your own save file. If you loose a battle, and the game reloads, it will autosave again, and unless you have your own save file, you'll be stuck in an endless loop until you succeed, and sometimes those battles weren't ment to be entered yet.\n\nThe voiceacting is actually pretty welldone. I was suprised. The art is decent, the story thus far is very predictable, but still enjoyable. There's lots of side quests you can complete. It seems to be a good idea to do them, just to get the experience and the points to spend on spells, and abilities. Makes the game a little easier, and allows for more battle options.\n\nI'm not a fan of the buying system. There's seems to be a limited number of arrows. After buying all of them in a shop, it seems they don't restock. I've come back to shops after many battles to see if they resupply, but it doesn't seem they do. The potion prices are rediculous. Though you shouldn't need them very often.\n\nThere is a little bit of a freedom  aspect. At a certain point you can choose where you want to go, and dialog options give you different results.

I really, really have. The character development system is complex and has a depth rarely found in RPGs. The story and choices are a combination of dark and darker, and yet there is no shortage of humor in the game. Having said all of that, I do NOT recommend this game for the casual gamer who enjoys RPGs. This is for the hardcore gaming fans who want to spend hours agonizing over points spent in skill and character development, only to find that you have to start over because you lack core abilities in your characters to survive. Further, the combat system is ridiculous. You get a wizard at the beginning of the game as a companion who has an ~80% accuracy range - however, in my experience, his spellcasting is weak at best, and backfires most of the time, and at often critical moments. Unfortunately, healing is also problematic because it uses an entire action (turn), and so by the next round, you may be down more health points than you were before you healed. Following me so far? That's good, because on top of that, you can count on being outnumbered and outmaneuvered in nearly every battle.\n\nI could go on to wax poetic about the ineptitude of the combat system and the way the developers correlated character development with combat in a way that is clear, but I think you can get the gist of it from above. I have to quit playing this game because after too much time trying the same battle over and over again to rescue some baroness who loves the less than useless wizard companion I have, I am going to retire this game entirely and quite playing it. It simply lacks any enjoyment for me at this point. I think the game designers have a lot of work to do to create a product that I would ever consider purchasing again. I feel cheated of my money and my time.\n\nOh, and you don't have the option of really grinding your characters up to par, either. There are a set number of quests and side quests, and you spend those character development points at your own risk.\n\nAgain, there may be a market for this to hardcore gamers and some others, but it is definitely not for the faint of heart.","May 12","false","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are parts that need tightening up, like seeing the console commands on screen, but aside from that it's been a smooth experience for me.\n\nThe story is interesting, the world is intriguingly dark and the characters, so far, are all interesting (my favourite being Niam the crackheaded half elf). Combat plays out on small, hex based maps that keep the action from getting bogged down or boring. And, while in combat, that's all you focus on; you can't loot corpses, for example. All of that happens afterwards which I like a LOT.\n\nThe combat system is simple, really, but it works. There are enough special abilties to keep it all interesting and to give you a wide variety of tactics (at least when you get the right people to suit your style) but they're not exactly trying to break the mold here. Basically, you've probably seen this all before. It didn't bother me, but I could see it boring some people.\n\nThe graphics do their job, though they're nothing to write home about. The voice acting has been surprisingly good for the main characters, although I find the NPCs tend to fall into stereotypes (villains sound like they're about to go "NYAH I'M EVIL"). It's not really distracting, since their lines are short and to the point, but it was something I noticed so take that as you will.\n\nWhich is really the best way to sum up this game; to the point. There are side quests and the like, but this isn't an open world game like Skyrim where you can spend a fair amount of time just walking around. You move from battle to battle, taking breathers when you need/want them, and then get right back into the thick of it. It is for this reason that I recommend this game. It's fast, fun but not short. Buy it.","January 10, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Overal Blackguards is an extremely fun game but it has one big flaw.\n\nFirst the positive points:\nThe strategic turn-based hex battles are great, I'm happy that finally game developers are taking this up again instead of all that RTS nonsense. The combat system with different moves goes smoothly, also the interface using a radial menu is OK. It does take a while getting used to.\nNice character development using a skill/talent system which is unconventional. This feels fresh and is an interesting change compared to other typical RPG's.\nThe voice acting is great and really adds to the immersion, also the characters themselves are well fleshed out and the interaction between them is hilareous at times (which is positive i.e. there is a lot of humor in the game).\nThere are many different (side-)quests, lots of items to find and experiment with etc.\nThe story itself is interesting and while the game is very linear it doesn't come as a hindrance. This also is a nice change of pace compared to other games recently where everything has to be 'open'.\n\nNow to the one flaw which at times totally screws up the game: 'nonsense' battles ...\nEach time I play, the battles are sometimes challenging, sometimes easy but overal quite fun. However, when you reach the pinnacle of that fun and are really enjoying the game ... the devs throw in what I call 'nonsense' battles which totally kill the mood and make you want to remove the game from the harddrive.\n\nThese 'nonsense' battles for example require you to rescue someone in 6 turns. The first say two attempts it won't work since you have to figure out what is needed, the next couple of attempts you run into traps (you can't detect them since there is no time in 6 turns). So in the end you have to constantly reload and reload and reload. Try a fireball on the first turn, if it fails, reload since no miss can be afforded. The game in such battles also feels as if the 'to hit' percentages are inversed. For example a 'to hit' percentage of 95% in these battles feels as if it's 5% since suddenly everything misses (so reload and reload and reload). It thus has nothing to do with strategy anymore but purely boils down to finding that one single path which 'could' lead to victory and then pray that your attacks actually succeed.\n\nThe above is really sad since it totally spoils the mood. After completing such a 'nonsense' battle (which is really a waste of time) the game is again great and fun until you again reach a point where they decided to dump such a miscreation.\nIt feels as if the game was designed by two different people. One person designed 85% of the game which is great and 15% was designed by someone who's only goal was 'How can I annoy the player the most?".\n\nThe game also has some minor issues like incorrect voices in cutscenes or a slight stutter when using certail skills (hammer blow) etc but nothing game breaking. I didn't have any crash or anything, overal it runs smooth.\n\nIn total it took me 47 hrs to complete it on medium.  Considering the fact that it has some interesting replay value (different starting class, different spells, ....) the game delivers quite some content.\n\nSo, in summary, it's a great game if you're into turn-based combat and will give you a lot of fun and funny moments, but beware the 'nonsense' battles since they can make you switch to a different game in a blink. When looking at the whole package the 85% definitely outweighs the 15% so I recommend it.","March 8, 2014","true","47.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/249650/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Blackguards is a turn-based combat focused RPG, that will most likely frustrate you a lot with the amount of dice rolling in it!\n\nMy opinions won't really add much to the discussion, as they're mixed... like almost everyone else's. Also, I'm farily new to the genre, so the min-maxing aspect present in the attributes and skill-trees in the game don't really appeal to me, yet (mostly how of ignorance, but anyway...).\n\nI really like RPGs in general, but I'm not one to read up on the game's numerous systems to learn what the optimal builds are -- I like to shape my characters as I please, leading to some interesting, fun, but not necessarily good decisions. I've done the same in Blackguards and will admit that, for the most part, it went alright. I played through Normal mode, and never got truly stuck, which was my biggest worry.\n\nMany people complained about reaching an unbeatable point in the game because they had a sub-optimal build. Maybe they were either playing on Hard, or I've simply been fairly lucky in my decision.\n\nI will say that there were lots of details in the game that I simply did not delve into -- potions (offensive), traps, etc. Those didn't seem all important in any of the battles in Normal.\n\nAnyway. It's tough. Some of the battles were infuriating, missing 3x in a row when I had a 90% chance to hit, having some periods of extended battles that far overstayed their welcome, etc.\n\nBut I did enjoy it quite a lot. Until I finished the 3rd Chapter, that is. Then the game offered nothing new.\n\nThe game is very linear, although it opens up a bit in the 3rd Chapter, giving you quite a lot of sidequests. The following 2 chapters barely have any of those, which felt strange.\nIt seems like the focus of the game was only the 3rd chapter, the other ones being mostly to build it up or simply carry the story.\n\nThe story was pretty bland, and the sidequests weren't too interesting either. Gameplay-wise, it's almost a pure combat game. You move from battle to battle. Other than battles, you just go to cities to buy equipment/heal/train, and get sidequests. Sidequests simply lead you into more battles. You never explore anything, never really find emergent gameplay or anything of the sort. It's very, very combat focused.\n\nBut hey... I really have very little to add that would be in any way meaningful. I want to talk about one thing exclusively -- and that is how opaque the game actually was! It was one of the biggest sources of frustration, for me.\n\n\nSometimes, the game pushes you into extended battles. Battle after battle after battle without an opportunity to heal, restock, change equipment, etc. These, of course, are a much bigger challenge -- especially because, if you do poorly on one battle, you'll carry that penalty onto the next one.\nThese battles felt extremely tense, to me. Sometimes they could go on for 2 hours, even if they were just 2 or 3 battles. The game is very slow paced, and a mistake can cost you quite a lot of time, which is frustrating. And the game often likes to pull tricks on you that it never pointed to. They're unwelcome surprises.\n\nThis is one side of it. The other, happened in the end of the game. After the point of no return, you're lead into a serious of battles, but you can heal and re-equip between them. What you can not do, is buy anything. Every healing potion, equipment, etc. that you can use is what you've taken with you.\nThere were a few problems here -- first, you had no idea how many battles there would be, so you couldn't really judge. Second, what the game showed you was very misleading, by having it spread over 2 "pages", but only showing you the first.\nBasically, you're expecting x battles, and suddenly, after wasting most of your potions, you're shown that there are actually twice as many. Well, ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThankfully, the game wasn't tricking the player and ramping up the difficulty artifically -- on that second page, there was a healer and merchant that was essentially a safe point. And that was a very nice thing.\nThe problem is how the game never communicated that beforehand. Every battle I fought felt that much more frustrating because a small mistake seemed like a colossal one.\n\nArguably, that the feeling that the game was trying to carry -- I doubt it, though. In this case, it was simply a case of bad communication with the player, it seemed. And similar issues happened throughout the game -- often leading you into "extended battles" without warning, and the like.\n\nFor me, at least, it's a huge source of frustration, to have to "judge" something without information. Especially when mistakes can cost hours.\n\nSo yeah. That's basically it. The game is a huge "tension" without the "release"...\n\n\nRegardless, I enjoyed it. I'm not a hardcore player of the genre, so my appreciation is certainly different. It was a good challenge! There was some frustration with the dice-rolls, but overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tough turn based rpg.","December 20, 2015","true","40.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This foundation is both the strongest and weakest characteristic of the game.\n\nStrong because the combat system is very smart and tricky, challenging you to really think when spending adventure points or making actions in turn based battles.\n\nWeak because this system has rather long learning curve and is very unforgiving for players who don't know its rules well.\n\nThis is probably the main reason for so many bad user reviews here. It's a shame because Blackguards really isn't "frustratingly hard", nor "miss-fest", and can be very rewarding for your strategical planning and tactical thinking. Also it has enchanting graphics, entertaining story, good music and great voice acting.\n\nSo yes, I can't recommend this game to the general audience. But that doesn't mean it's a bad game, although it has some quirks of course (weird user interface for example).

I really haven't gotten to invested into the story yet but it is interesting enough.  Visually the game is very pretty and gameplay wise it seems rewarding.   I haven't seen anything that reinvents the wheel but that said what it does it does well.  I so far highly recommend the game.  Honestly in the short time I have been playing I have had more fun combat wise than with games like Dragon Age.  Of course it isn't completely fair to compare a Real Time with Pause game with a turned based game.   I will say that between this and Divnity: Original Sins it makes a turned based strategy RPG gamer happy with glee to see such great games coming out.","January 23, 2014","true","6.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The amount of freedom you have when it comes to upgrading your characters is quite welcome as wel, as is the interactive objects on the battlfield.

It at once feels like a renaissance of the turn-based genre, but with some newer, unique ideas. Character customization looks outrageous and daunting at first, but with a single type of Adventure Point and clear class-goals, linear guidance eases the pain, while still allowing anyone to experiment with wild combinations. It's a classic tale of old-school meets new-school, all in a really tightly-produced package. Graphics, story and gameplay are all great.","February 25, 2014","true","15.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The gameplay is fantastic and the level design is great. Unlike most of the RPG I played, this game is brutal*: the heroes are either undernumbered or weak compared to the enemies and you have to take advantage of the environment in order to win. On top of that, my mage, the squishy guy with low initiative was always in the wrong spot at the start of the fight. On the other hand, some fights (only a few tho) were simply bad designed: in one of them I had to fight a mage and a tank with my mage and tank who's weapon was poisoned. They were way better than my guys and there was no trap, no object, no catch on that map. It took me about an hour to win and it was only possible with the help of the RNG gods.\nI did not like the story.\nThe "RPG" aspect is ok. There are a few weapon categories with unique features and access to a number of skills, but there are only a few weapons in each category**. My main character used a spear, but later on the spears look more like strange polearms. I wanted to see a partisan spear as endgame weapon, instead of a mace with a spike mounted on a big stick. The spells are interesting. I like how they gain a new effect when you level them. The character development*** is similar to NWN / Drakensang. However, due to the low numbers of characters in the party some characters need to go hybrid and fill multiple slots.\nThey ask 40euro for it. Well, that is too much - 20euro is more like a fair price for this game.\n\n* I have only played on the hard difficulty; don't know about the others;\n** I don't count this as a "con";\n*** attributes and how they influence the gameplay","February 22, 2015","true","61.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

That is where the fun ended sadly. The skills/abilities sound great but there is no way you can know what you need to go for. I built a fairly rounded party so I could be flexible and now can't even defeat basic enemies. This is, for me, a major problem as I now have to go back to an earlier save to re-spec.\n\nNot so bad you would think. Well this is where the problem is multiplied hugely. The point I am at in the game, for some unknown reason, is at the end of a series of very tedious battles. These do not allow you to save of even gather experience between them. So I have to go back beyond this point. Which is frankly killing any enjoyment I got from this game.\n\nHonestly this is a decent attempt at a turn based RPG. What lets it down is the total lack of freedom in your choices. No random battles means you have to know where to spend those skill points as you aren't getting any more from anywhere. Couple this with the fact that there is no real way of knowing what you need to spend them on till you have a go and this ruins what could have been fun.\n\nI am aware of the online guides on how to spec characters but what is the point of having lots of options only to have them reduced down to a handful that are actually feasible? Really feel that at half price I have been robbed.","April 14, 2014","false","12.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This is (luckily in my eyes) a typical The Dark Eye game. If you do not know this RPG system: it's Germany's biggest and probably oldest Pen & Paper RPG system that is still maintained. And as many things from Germany it is deep and complex, but needs a certain degree of dedication.\n\nYou will not be able to simply start this game, kill some enemies and have fun. You really need to have a look at the rule system and how all the character values influence your fighting, casting and other skills. The same goes for spending your experience points, if you simply raise a stat here and there you will find the game very hard and probably quit. If you decide what role a character will have and raise the necessary stats and skills for this you will have a much easier time and will be able to enjoy the very complex fight options.\n\nOne definitive pro from my point of view are the really varied battle maps. Most maps have unique interactive features that you can use in the battle, like alchimistic tables that will poison bystanders when smashed. Or drawbridges that can be raised or lowered. Or cranes with crates that might smash your heroes from the docks - or the enemies if you position yourself smart enough.\n\nAlltogether it is a clear recommendation for me if you like complex strategy games with RPG-like character development. Do not buy if you look for Diabloesque casual RPGs.","December 23, 2014","true","25.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

For instance, you could be in combat with an insect, a large dumb version of 'lice' that would waltz right by your entire team to go secure an objective that you should be holding that the insect doesn't even KNOW about, story wise.\n\nThere is no way to view your armor as a whole, to compare it to other armor sets. This also doesn't let you save in combat, and the combats are slow and tedious. Matter of fact, I had the FINAL gladiator fight I was in crash on the next to final turn as a waited out the final baddy to blow up (was on a timer in an arena and covered in oil and lit.)\n\nThis game will make you rage, not because of the difficulty, but because the horrible interface, no real enemy A.I.

I should jump up and down on this space over and over again until I keel over!)\n\nOverall, go with something more polished that you can get your hands on.

My existing save game made any new battles unfinishable as you couldnt end a turn - all your characters just stood there with no end turn available.  That's okay I thought, I will start a new game, it will be fun choosing a different character from Chapter 1.  Oh no ....... BIG FAIL.

Character development is very deep and interesting for an indie RPG and the combat, while not incredibly nuanced, is fun and challenging. On the other hand however, the game's marketing material tout that you play as a band a criminals and miscreants - even the name of the game hints at this. However the game appears to reward you for being the 'good' guy and punish you by omission for being the 'bad' guy, which is surely counter productive if you want your players to be nasty 'Blackguards'. However that's just my opinion.\n\nI can't recommend this game in its current state. There are far too many bugs and design issues that should have been weeded out during testing. Another testament to how pointless and anti-consumer the early access system is. The game is simply not worth the asking price as it is. However once these problems are fixed and perhaps the game comes down in price a little, I'd happily recommend it. At its core it's a very enjoyable game.","January 24, 2014","false","26.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/recommended/249650/","stambo","stambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stambo/","1618 products in account","Blackguards is at first an interesting turn based RPG, with combat occuring on premade hex grid based maps. It is interesting because it does away with most of the filler that comes with most every RPG. You do not control your characters in any way outside of combat, you simply shift to a different spot in a city where you can talk to a couple of NPCs and that's it. Outside of towns you travel on the world map by clicking on a selectable point on the map and you are instantly transported to a town, or into combat if you have a quest going on outside of town.\n\nThis makes the game more fun at the beginning, because you always get to the important parts of the game instantly, that would be the combat and the story. However as you progress through the game the positive turns into a negative because you never start feeling a connection with any of your characters. The only time you control them is in combat and in combat they are simply damage dealing stats.\n\nSo the game becomes tedious as you start clicking through all the dialogue to just pick up the quests and then you do the quests, almost always by going into combat and you soon realise that the primary things you do in the game are combat and clicking through the story, which I might add is very simple and not at all interesting.\n\nThe combat at first is satisfying, especially for me since I am a fan of turn based, tile based combat. However you will probably start getting more and more annoyed with it because of its randomness (nearly every action has at least a small chance to fail and it seems to happen more often than it should). And also because of the lack of data while in combat, the battlelog is very nearly completely useless so you have to constantly pay attention to know what is happening, since the camera can jump around a bit if it's a larger map and you can lose track of the enemy actions. And there isn't enough contextual information with the game for when you move your characters. For example I'd like to know if one of my characters will pass through where an enemy can do an attack of opportunity on him, it's true that it isn't too hard to figure out for yourself if that will happen, but honestly you probably won't have the patience to do it after you are controlling 5 characters and have 5+ enemies each taking their own turn. The combat just becomes too slow at that point.\n\nOutside of combat you also manage the equipment of each of your characters, which isn't really that interesting because there isn't much choice of weapons or armour and what little there is it's always a straight upgrade or not, so there isn't much thinking involved. Somewhat more involved is improving the skills of your characters, but even that becomes straightforward after a while, since you get an abundance of points to allocate throughout the game and you soon pick up the more desirable skills.\n\nSo to summarise my main points: no filler makes for a fun start, but it also destroys any potential character building, the story is very simple and not at all interesting, the combat is at first fun but it becomes tedious after a while, not much variety in equipment and finally not enough interesting skills which are worth putting points in. Definitely try the game if you are into turn based, tile based RPGs however be warned that the game can become tedious to play and it did so for me.\n\n5 / 10","November 14, 2014","false","10.0"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

The fight sequences are repetitive and even on normal mode seemed arbitrarily hard, suggesting not a lot of creativity went into the difficulty just number values. The side quests were uninteresting, the characters were fairly stock and it just had the feeling of an unfinished game in general. Too be fair, I never made it out of Chapter 1, so I can't say it doesn't get better; however, I'm a firm believer in having the beginning of the game be the hook, to entice the gamer to play more. Another reason being: if the first chapter feels unfinished, how is the rest of the game going to feel better? And spells that have a chance of failing? I understand Magic Resists/Immunities creating another level of gameplay, but buff spells that have a 46% chance to fail?\nOverall 5/10.","March 8, 2014","false","6.9"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

The character stat screen tells you very little of the impact that your leveling decisions make.  So much of the directional choices you make with characters appears to be hidden.  The hit percentage system, how to recover health/mana efficiently and the effects of decisions are just a few examples of this.\n\nI understand that a fair amount of people believe that this hidden veil makes the game more complex, and that they consequently are "more intelligent" because they "figured it out".  I would argue that they wasted their time fiddling with a poorly designed game when they could have been playing a game that isn't a waste of time.\n\nI should have played the friggin' demo first.

It commits every sin in the CRPG handbook.\n\nUltimately this game is NOT an enjoyable experience. The first mistake the developers make is confusing complexity with challenge. The character system in this game is needlessly complex and completely opaque. The fights are incredibly unbalanced, and while it is possible to scrape your way through using tactics, it all comes down to luck.\n\nThe combat system is absurd. My archer has repeatedly missed 100% chance to hit shots. Not parries, mind you, just completely missed. When you miss 5 90% shots in a row, against an opponent that has no special buffs, and meanwhile the enemy are not just hitting you but criting away, leaving you wounded and dying.\n\nTwice now the game has committed the cardinal sin of CRPGs of taking away your progression for the sake of a gimmick. Too bad if you were trying to make an archer, here's a club, go knock things on the head for 2 damage. See, the thing is, unless you picked the fighter class you won't have power attack, which makes melee weapons as good as useless since you'll just be scratching the ticks of the enemies back.\n\nYou can play as skillfully as you want and you will still be screwed over by RNG and the absurd combat mechanics. Here's an example: My archer just missed 5 90% shots in a row on a target. Missed. Not parried. The target was not buffed with dodge enhancing stats. Now, in some games that would be okay, you'd curse your luck but recover and reorganize your strategy. In Xcom you might pull back and try to lure the enemy into an overwatch trap while you heal up your guys. In this game, every shot you miss, every hit you do not land sets you further and further behind and it is completely out of your hand due to the level up system and comparitive enemy strengths.\n\nThis is not fun. The game itself is boring enough without having to go back and redo every freaking fight over and over trying to find some way to have just one of your guys survive.\n\nThe loot drops are hilarious. Fifty pairs of hardened leather boots. Not one usable piece of armor. Boots. Boots all day. But don't think you can just buy armor for your party, the gold costs of the items mean that at best you will have one reasonably equipped and maybe leather pants on your other guys.\n\nAnd why on earth do the combat percentages change every round? Why when nothing else has changed does my warrior go from 90% to 50% then back to 85% ... if anything, im hitting the enemy it should go up. None of this makes any sense, it makes tactics pointless. Nothing is every explained.\n\nHonestly do not waste your money.","November 14, 2014","false","114.1"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","17","33","2","0"

I have played a pretty good amount of this game so far. Is it the best? No. However it is not bad by any means.\n\nIf you like turn based RPGs then this game is great. People REALLY should research games before they buy them. The game has a little bit of a steep learning curve but if you are even a semi-decent gamer and are familiar with TBS games then that should not be a problem at all.\n\nPersonally I am REALLY REALLY sick of all the games nowdays hand holding you and making things so simple. What some say about the leveling and skills/stat points is true however. There is really not alot of explaination about how to do this. Trial and error is all you have. I ended up starting the game over a few times before I really started to figure out how to do it properly.\n\nThe story is not the greatest and neither is the gameplay or graphics. However I have had alot of fun with this game. I like the darker story. I like that your crew is not a bunch of goody goody types. The movement and cities are pretty bland but that is ok beacuse the fights are alot of fun IMO. The enviornmental parts of the battles are very cool. I like that you have to open cells to create a distraction and get away from the guards. It was way cool that I had to lead the troll into some flammable gas and then shoot him with a fireball to do a ton of damage. Cutting the rope and dropping a chandelier on some  guards was pretty damn cool. There is alot to like in this game if you can get around the mediocre graphics and horrid voice acting!\n\nIf you are looking for a AAA super polished graphical game this is not for you. If you like a decent story, dont really care about graphics, and you like TBS RPGs then this is for you!\n\nOverall this is a pretty good game. There are not alot of TBS RPGs out there to pick from and if your a big fan of that genre then you will like this game.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is a better choice IMO but that is still in Alpha and has ALOT of bugs. I bought both of them and I really enjoy them both.\n\nAgain this is not the prettiest game. The voice acting and cut scenes are ATROCIOUS!!!!! But who cares as long as the combat and RPG elements are good.\n\nGraphics: 5/10\nSound: 5/10\nStory: 5/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nOverall: 6/10\n\nLike I said its not the greatest game out there. But in this genre there is really not much to choose from. TBS RPGs are probably my favorite type of game and this game does an above average job.\n\nBuy it if you are like me and really jonesing for a TBS RPG!","January 27, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You probably heard about the interaction with stuff in battles, but that's totally overrated: Wasting a turn to push a box or set something ablaze is rarely worth it. Occasionally this is implemented quite nicely, like trapping something in a cage, but most of the time there's only boxes to push.\n\nI hear people drooling over how interesting the characters are, but honestly your party members are *completely* one-sided and sometimes downright dislikeable  (*minor spoiler* Zurburan selling Takate to some slaver...seriously? *spoiler end*). Their is no intruiging background story to them and definetly no progression in personality whatsoever. The story on the other hand is compelling, but since story-specific dialogue is only few and far in between the dominating combat, it's ultimately thin...very thin (if you know DBZ, you lnow what I'm talking about *lol*). The world itself feels a bit on the bland side and the streamlined gameplay leaves little room for Lore or in-depth consideration of your potentially stunning surroundings.\n\nThe biggest issue here is how barebone the gameplay is. After a fight you basically point&-)click your mouse button a few times to advance the dialogue or move to the interchangeable towns to check on the completely interchangeable merchants and start the next fight. Combat-Dialogue-Click-Combat-Repeat. Kudos for the quest-writing though which I found top notch!\n\n\nSo: Combat: AWESOME. The rest: *MEH*. I enjoyed it a lot, also because it is more fast-paced than some of its TBS-brethren.","January 29, 2014","true","53.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is quite the first time for me to decide and upgrade upon the talents, skills, magic and stuff.\n\nAnother thing that I like was that you can equip any kind of weapon.

The RPG system, 2. The actual roleplay, 3. The feel of the game. It is worth mentioning that I am a RPG guy with long experience in both Pen and Paper RPG (mostly PF, but also Vampire), and a lot of CRPG. So, naturally, this has an impact on how I liked or disliked the game.\n\n1. The roleplaying system The Black Eye is really nice and has a lot of depth and will be candy if you, like me, havent tried it before. I cannot accout for the differences between the pen and paper 4th edition (witch the game mechanic is derived from) and the system Blackguards has implemented. But as far as I am concerned its really nice. Different attributes combinate to give different base statistics - and control how well you fight / use talents / casts spells. There are no levels for characters, insted you gain Adventure Points from combats and finished quests that you either continually spend or save up to spend on more expensive upgrades. It really is a fun system and has similarity with the way Vampire the masquerade works. The turn based tactics is nothing but pure enjoyment!\n\n2. The actual roleplaying is somewhat linear. If you like that then no problem. If you want more choice, then it has shortcomings. Things are pretty much set up and you cannot deviate too much from the path. The choices you are given doesnt even have that much impact. For instance one side quest presents you with two identical twins, the one is evil and the other is good - but who is who. In the end, if you chose to root out the good guy OR the bad guy there is no impact on the game other than your own conciousness. (...and honestly, who cares abouth truth when it comes to a book worth 50 ducats?!)\n\n3. The acutal feel of the game is, at least to me, awsome. The characters you pick up are rather strange, a paranoid dwarf, a sleezy magician and later on a drug addict elf to name some. But this is what strangley keeps it interesting - actually highly enjoyable. Bugger off with the lawful good paladin that does good at every turn. Here its like "plant unlawful poison at a highly esteemed noble to get him arrested" or "Get a new slavegirl / trophy for the master of the city".\n\nTo sum up, I really enjoy the game - (not finished yet as this is written) and I see a replay possibility with choosing differet abilities. If you enjoy RPGs and in particular the combat part - this is a game for you.","February 1, 2014","true","105.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is almost the perfect T.B.S. game for real. So close. It has everything you'd expect, but misses a few. These drawbacks are only "my opinion". The progression is strangely slow, in that it takes so long to get enough points in one stat to notice the difference, and then once you've spent literally days worth of playing, you can't undo those decisions. Which I don't wish to "undo" my stat point decisions any time I wish, but it's very aggrevating to get so far into the game and wish you hadn't wasted those points.\nThe choice of weapons and their cost (in gold). The amount of weapon choices is very boring, just your run of the mill (standard) choices. And the fact that you literally never, NEVER, feel as if "that weapon was the best choice". Because all of your enemies have the same or better chance of killing you. You never feel even slightly more powerful or skillful than your enemies. I understand this game is dice rolling, but when you get a "good roll", you should feel EMPOWERED damn it! I spent all those points in that axe for the dwarf and it didn't seem to make him a badass with an axe. Lastly the cost of anything is just silly. You make one wrong purchase, and bingo, you're out of money and your whatever is pratically useless.\nThat's really it! The game is so so so so very close to being amazing, but it's those small couple of things that ruin it for me.\nAlso they should have added blacksmithing or crafting.\nThe magic is actually really awesome, but it is the same feeling of "I wish I fealt more powerful" after spending all of my points.","January 30, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game has some of the best voice acting and music I've heard and its gameplay feels like it actually melds with the story. Quite a few times you'll be presented with interesting alternatives in combat most wouldn’t think of in a turn based RPG. You could go the classic route and just beat the baddies in a one on one fight, or if you’re feeling creative lure them into hazards that you normally wouldn't think of. For instance lure them into a bush then set it on fire or release a group of prisoners to fight for you. Even some battles have great story elements. Need to collect some mushrooms while a giant troll is guarding them. Distract the troll and gather the mushrooms, then run. It’s these types of options that make you feel like you’re having an impact and cause you to think outside the box. The few problems I do have with the game mostly revolve around a few graphical glitches and sometimes the enemy AI can be a little too slow. Graphical glitches like people suddenly having mouths that stretch way too far when they speak or the amount of a silver currency you earned being blocked has happened to me. While the biggest flaw is probably the AI, I like how you can set traps for them but when an enemy chooses to continually get burned in a bush and not leave it that’s when I call stupid on the AI. These bugs can be annoying but they don't break the game and I recommend this game to any RPG or Turn-Based Strategy fan.","January 28, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have played a pretty good amount of this game so far. Is it the best? No. However it is not bad by any means.\n\nIf you like turn based RPGs then this game is great. People REALLY should research games before they buy them. The game has a little bit of a steep learning curve but if you are even a semi-decent gamer and are familiar with TBS games then that should not be a problem at all.\n\nPersonally I am REALLY REALLY sick of all the games nowdays hand holding you and making things so simple. What some say about the leveling and skills/stat points is true however. There is really not alot of explaination about how to do this. Trial and error is all you have. I ended up starting the game over a few times before I really started to figure out how to do it properly.\n\nThe story is not the greatest and neither is the gameplay or graphics. However I have had alot of fun with this game. I like the darker story. I like that your crew is not a bunch of goody goody types. The movement and cities are pretty bland but that is ok beacuse the fights are alot of fun IMO. The enviornmental parts of the battles are very cool. I like that you have to open cells to create a distraction and get away from the guards. It was way cool that I had to lead the troll into some flammable gas and then shoot him with a fireball to do a ton of damage. Cutting the rope and dropping a chandelier on some  guards was pretty damn cool. There is alot to like in this game if you can get around the mediocre graphics and horrid voice acting!\n\nIf you are looking for a AAA super polished graphical game this is not for you. If you like a decent story, dont really care about graphics, and you like TBS RPGs then this is for you!\n\nOverall this is a pretty good game. There are not alot of TBS RPGs out there to pick from and if your a big fan of that genre then you will like this game.\n\nDivinity: Original Sin is a better choice IMO but that is still in Alpha and has ALOT of bugs. I bought both of them and I really enjoy them both.\n\nAgain this is not the prettiest game. The voice acting and cut scenes are ATROCIOUS!!!!! But who cares as long as the combat and RPG elements are good.\n\nGraphics: 5/10\nSound: 5/10\nStory: 5/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nOverall: 6/10\n\nLike I said its not the greatest game out there. But in this genre there is really not much to choose from. TBS RPGs are probably my favorite type of game and this game does an above average job.\n\nBuy it if you are like me and really jonesing for a TBS RPG!","January 27, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is a good feeling to catch myself laughing at the well voice acted humorous dialogue, which I haven't experienced to this degree since way back in games such as KOTOR and Jade Empire. Daedalic Entertainment might just be the new old pre-EA BioWare we all fondly remember.\n\nProbably the only frustrating thing I experienced was the questionable stated odds of a spell succeeding, but I am also not sure if that percentage was meant to take into account the defender's resistances.\n\nI give it a 9 because it is hard to me to envision a better RPG without my mind drifting back to old BioWare. So this is a real user score, not an artificially inflated rating meant to preemptively fend off the incoming 0's from reviewers that found fault in this product.\n\nI eagerly await the Chapter 5 release...","January 23, 2014","true","191.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It does have to be said that the premise and characters aren't as dark as you would initially expect, given that this game promises something close to flawed dark 'heroes', but does make a nice change to the usual knight in shining armor.\nAm only in the 2nd chapter so am not sure how the slighly repetative layouts and fights will play out as I progress, as do feel that it may grow stale after anothter 10 or so hours.  Also the inability to grind to gain AP (like EXP) does irritate in a game where every point counts and you feel as though you have never levelled up the right stat/skill/spell.\nBug-wise tha game has been fine thus far.

First of all I really enjoy the game even if I sometimes feel the desire to hammer the game against a wall.\nClasses:\n-Mage\nI've started as a Mage and even if it is really frustrating at the beginning, because your spells miss all the time (one 7times in a row...(This needs to be fixed!)), at the end of chapter one I have no clue how you would survive without having main char mage + the story-mage that joins your party. The story-mage is even worse at castin than your main-char and sometimes next to useless but for a few heals now an than...if he manages to cast them...My main char-mage now casts some spells with 99% accuracy but I'm not really sure why this improved...\n-Warrior\nSo far my warrior is pretty useless besides sucking up damage, of course this is his main aim at the moment, but it is still frustrating that just 1 out of 5 attacks succed because the parring/evasion rate of most enemies is pretty high.\nSo far my warrior only fought with axe and shield, so maybe that's just an unfortunate combination.\n-Archer\nNothing much to say here, I think this class is pretty good balanced at the moment, or a bit too good if Mage/warrior are taken as standard.\n\nA few pros and cons:\n-Until chapter one the game is quite linear, besides a few flashbacks. You can't explore any areals or wander around between cities you just leap from to the other most of the time.\n-I really like the difficulty of the game, even though I'm playing on "normal" is quite demanding at times, but as mentioned above it's a bit up to luck in hard mission weather you succed or not depending on if you miss the first few hits or not...\n-I would really like it if after you explored a city there would be a Sign above the city on the world map indicating what kind of trainer you found in this city, because otherwise you got to go through the cities to find them again.\n-The skilling system is nice but sometimes a bit annoying because I don't know when I'll find the next trainer or which skills he can teach me so I end up not really knowing where to invest my points.\n\nI'd like to state again that I think it's a great game despite a few issues and I'm having quite a lot of fun playing it.\n","January 2, 2014","true","45.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is misunderstood very often.\n\n+ great gameplay (not as good as XCOMs but still nice)\n+ based on The Dark Eye - refreshing compared to all the games based on D&D\n+ nice story\n+ nice quests (and side quests)\n+ funny interaction in-between the characters\n+ really good value for money when on sale\n+ lots of different skills and builds to explore (a bit confusing and overwhelming for beginners though)\n+ good difficulty (it will be very challenging at times and you will have to change your tactics which worked before)\n\n\n-	Obviously not a huge development budget (they made the best out of it)\n-	Graphics are nice but could be way better (eg. cutscenes …)\n-	Skills & talents can be difficult to understand. You’ll probably need to google a bit to understand the different character values.\n-	Some bugs can be frustrating, eg. when the healer in-between the gladiator fights won’t heal you anymore. There aren’t many but this one made it very hard for me\n-	Save often. (same as xcom). It could save you time.\n-	Usability in the stat/spell/… screens could be better, especially when trying to figure out which weapon does more damage.\n\nAll in all, I can live without the best graphics and animations (like XCOM does superb). I was willing to learn about the skills and mechanics. I accepted the couple of bugs I encountered – it only lead to the game being more difficult but didn’t break the game itself.\n\nAfter reading many negative reviews I think the problem is that this game isn’t like many other games out there, it’s comparable to XCOM but with possibility to skill your characters in a complex way. You can’t save every minute and decisions you made today could be a problem much later. You may have to do some side quests to get the experience to advance. You won’t be able to blindly upgrade every skill and spell there is. You will have to use different tactics. Using Takate with his piercing skill will work awesome most of the time, but if an enemy is immune to piercing you should better have given him some other weapon and skills (I learned this the hard way).\n\nObviously something went wrong during the beta version, because most of the negative reviews are from back then. I didn’t experience many of the problems from back then. If you like turn based games with a lot of strategy involved you’ll probably like this. If you want to kill many monsters with huge firewalls better get path of exile ;)\n","June 26, 2014","true","47.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In this game you will be taking on the role of a commoner who is friends with those in high places, especially a princess, but wait, what was that? Oh no the princess has been killed, and you are having the finger pointed at you. This is where the true story begins, and where you will met the first of your companions that will help you through the game with either their strength or their magical abilities.\n\nGraphically this game has a couple of small hiccups from time to time, but the overall game gives you the feel of a dark and desolate world that is clinging to the world of old gods. Even though you don't get to actually walk through the towns, you are given 3D scenes that you can click on the action icons to interact with, they all have depth and personality. Another thing is that there is a lot of different models used when it comes to interacting with towns, you are not going to see a lot of repeats, though to be fair its not like any of the towns are overflowing with people. Now as far as the combat graphics are concerned you are placed in a 3D hex-based grid system in which you will be moving from 3/4s side view to top down view so that you can see the whole field and make sure you're not missing anything such as traps or enemies that could be hiding behind walls, plants, etc. I do like the fact that at the bottom of the screen, since this is turn based, that there are images of the enemies, and they have about 3 to 4 stock images so that the enemies have a little bit of variety to them. Sure the models all look the same with the exception of if the enemy is a specific class or sex.\n\nThe music in the game was very well made, and there were quite a few haunting tunes that as soon as they start I immediately think about the game. The voice acting for the most part was solid as well, there were a couple of over the top performances, but sometimes that's going to happen when try too hard to capture a specific type of character.\n\nThe controls in the game are pretty straight forward. You are going to use the mouse coupled with WASD for most everything while moving around a map, or on the battlefield. You will of course be using the usual 'i' for inventory and 'c' for character sheet.\n\nSo this game is pretty deep when it comes to all the little tweaks you can make to your character. There is a good number of spells to cast, there is weapon proficiency to think about, active and passive skills to learn, traits to learn, and of course stats to increase. I have to say that this was always a daunting task for me, but for the most part, once I really got into the game, I had the feel for what was really important for my party to not only survive, but to succeed. You'll also be given weapons, armor, and items galore that you will have to learn to balance. I found out the hard way that putting items or equipment on your characters does not take away much if any of the load in your inventory. So when I had my party fully decked out I almost had no room for much else, unless of course I wanted to play encumbered. That being said it didn't created THAT big of an annoyance.\n\nYou of course have your own main quest, starting off with you trying to figure out what is really going on, and then of course the twists happen and all hell possibly breaks loose. The thing is that there are a ton of side quests to keep your eyes out for. Now I will say this, until the very end of the game you might lose access to some quests, but have no fear you will regain it later on in the game. There's also many quests that you might miss out on if you don't periodically check in on all the cities. Yes, I understand that that means that you will be dealing with a ton of load screens, but none of them are really unbearable, and when you get to the end of the game, you will thank me for making you search for extra quests.\n\nI'm going to be totally honest with you, it took a couple of attempts for me to get into this game, but once I was invested in the game I couldn't stop. I wanted to see what was behind the next bend in the road, what enemies would stand in my way, and of course it stood out to me because I've always loved pencil and paper RPGs, and this felt like a pretty good transition from sitting around a round table with friends and experiencing and adventure. So in the end I have to say that through it all I have to give this game an 8.9 out of 10.","March 25, 2014","true","55.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, it just feels like it fell short of its potential. Not to knit pick but starting with the lack of facial customizations. I know its not a big deal but in my opinion, it starts the game off on the wrong foot and goes on from there.\n\nthere is really no exploration, its extremely linear and predictable as far as the encounters go. The rules of turn based combat are also not the greatest and are very vanilla. No attack from behind bonuses that I could see so you can retreat and not worry about taking a blade to the back if you were standing in a hex next to an enemy.\n\nMy biggest frustration was in upgrading my gear. Theres RNG involved for what you can loot from battles, so dont count on picking up that axe that this guy just done done whacking at you with for the past 10 minutes.  It just vaporizes apparently leaving you with your trusty ol' starter torch.\nWeapons and armor cost a lot of money and while you may be able to gear your guy up with a basic sword after the first half dozen encounters, that will be it for quite a while until you can afford more. Meanwhile, wave after wave of baddies wielding swords, shields, axes, armor, bows and arrows will make sure you pull your hair out before you can afford to gear your party adequately enough to fight them.","February 2, 2014","false","2.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I really like the different characters being voiced by different actors (though I'm sure some NPC's have doubled-up).\n\nI'm glad that players have the option of "creating" their character's base stats.\n\n\nCons:\n\nI'm playing on a 2-year-old  Mac and the game crashes frequently. I restart the game, restart the Steam client -- even restart my computer -- and it's still frequently crashing.\n\nWhen I'm in the game, occasionally the screen changes colours / views. For example, I'll see lines across the screen (not just the hexes) and sometimes the screen is entirely composed of solid colours. Another time I was playing the game and all the arrows / NPC conversation icons disappeared.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nMaybe these troubles are just due to playing the game on a Mac. If you can pick the game up on sale ($5 or less), then it's worth giving a try. I don't recommend paying full price for what can be a buggy experience.","December 29, 2015","true","31.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You'll enjoy it if you like that sort of thing.\n\nBlackguards is an old-school gaming experience dressed in modern threads, a pen-and-paper RPG brought to life on the PC. The graphics are appealing, animations smooth, sound effects satisfying and voice acting mostly good. You take the role of an assistant to a noble family who gets into trouble at the outset and goes on the run, and your attempts to unravel what's happened ultimately take on a global significance. The story, chiefly told in cutscenes whose animation is best described as economical, follows a fairly linear path, but a wealth of subplots and sidetracks provides a pleasant illusion of free movement which probably won't convince today's open-world gamers.\n\nYour character is provided with several sidekicks and you marshall and move your party on the world map. Movement is essentially the selection of locations and passage of time is not tracked. In towns and similar locations you'll find traders, trainers, inns, healers, and the like, as well as NPCs who advance the plot and give you quests. Party management is done through the stat sheet and inventory of each character, and true to the RPG that gave birth to this game, the system is satisfyingly deep and complex. Your decisions about character development will win or lose you the game, and new players should take note: it is possible to build a character badly and it's very difficult to undo this once you've done it, so take the time to read the manual and the in-game character creation notes (which don't appear in the manual and are very useful).\n\nQuests and plot advancement almost always involve a skirmish, and it's these hex-map clashes where you'll spend most of your game hours. It's clear that a lot of thought has gone into skirmish map design: in some cases it's a straight fight to the death, but often there are environmental factors to deal with and in some cases the map is a puzzle which you must solve to win. In fact you can think of every skirmish as a puzzle which must be solved, as enemies differ in their capacities and susceptibilities and you must apply the right tools in terms of weapons, spells and equipment to prevail. That said, the game depends ultimately on the roll of the dice, so luck is always a factor. Fortunately death isn't permanent and so long as you have the last man standing, you'll walk away with your party intact.\n\nSome reviewers have complained of the game's excessive difficulty. At the time of writing this review I've completed the game on Normal difficulty and have clocked up over 80 hours of play. I think I saw every skirmish there was to see, well over a hundred in total, and more than half of those I completed first time. There were only a handful I had to attempt more than twice. The final battle is difficult, but so it should be – my only gripe is that the plotting, or perhaps the scriptwriting, feels a bit wrong at the end, but YMMV. If you find yourself stymied by a skirmish, see whether you can go elsewhere to level your party up a bit; if not, it's very likely that you're either missing something important in the skirmish (always check the interactive objects) or you've taken a serious misstep in character building. Be careful not to spread XPs too thin on your characters: you can't take all spells and weapons to the maximum in the course of the game, and you do need some top-level skills and spells by the end if not by the middle.\n\nTwo things bothered me about this game: loading times, and the ending. My system isn't top-of-the-line but neither is this game, and I saw far too much of the loading screens for my liking (Mengbilla in particular tried my patience quite a bit). The ending... without spoiling things, I was surprised to see essentially the same cutscene after winning the final battle that I'd seen when I lost it. I'm unsure if your choice in dialogues makes any real difference to the way the game pans out, and online chatter suggests that a lot of players were left confused by the denouement. I can't honestly recommend that anyone other than a genre purist buy this game at full price, but if you see it on sale grab it and give it a try, and be sure to get to the top of the bow skill tree as early as possible!","January 10","true","82.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a turn-based, hex-based, combat-oriented game that presents some of the most wickedly challenging combat scenarios I have had to face in a turn-based game.  The developers have made excellent use of the environment, using traps, environmental effects, hindering terrain, and interactive objects integral to most combats.  This, combined with a wide array of special abilities available through warrior training or spell effects, makes combat very dynamic and challenging.  It can also be very frustrating.  On the plus side, when you lose a tough battle, there is an option to replay the battle from the beginning of the battle, as well as from your last save, so you need not redo extensive amounts of replay to "get to the good stuff."\n\nThere are four character generation options for this game, three basic with pre-builds of a melee warrior, a hunter archer, and a mage, and fourth option to custom build a character from scratch.  I have tried all four, but recommend trying building a character from scratch only after having tackled at least the first chapter of the game to get an idea of what the game is like.  I wanted to build an archer-mage, and found that it was easier (and you got better abilities) by starting as a straight mage and then investing experience points in archery talents and proficiencies to make up the difference.\n\nThe NPCs in the game are fun and all dialogue is voiced.  The dwarven NPC (your first ally) has some really good lines.  The story is VERY linear, literally a "go here and do this" with arrows pointing your next route, which is nice in some ways and very frustrating in others.\n\nYou get advancement points for every fight and story event, and you get a lot of them.  They accumulate quickly, but you need a ton to advance a stat or skill.  Stats, talents, weapon talents, and spells all rank from 1 to 18, with varying costs from 6 to over 480 to advance to the next level.   Experience comes in multiples of 25, depending on encounter difficulty, with more coming in the later stages of the game. Still, your Special Abilities are what makes your character be able to do extraordinary things like being able to regenerate Astral Points (mana) or Knockdown an opponent in combat.  These are relatively cheap to buy, at around 300 Advancement Points, but Special Abilities often have stat and weapon talent prerequisites that in turn cost advancement points to purchase, which all adds up to more advancement points....  I could not imagine playing "The Dark Eye" without a computer to aid me, especially as your Attack Value, Parry Value, Dodge Value, and Ranged Attack Value are all based on three stats added together and divided by five.  And that every roll in the game is a test against three ability scores.  All of this is handled by the computer and done very nicely in a battlelog that summarizes it in a percentage chance for you.  It can be a bit confusing when your 100% chance to hit misses, because evidently the computer rounds to the nearest %(?) but that's a quibble.\n\nIn all this is an exceptionally fun game.  I keep telling myself I am tired of getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by the game and will quit THIS TIME for sure, but in minutes I am back to beat the fight that got me.  It's so linear you can hear the train whistle when you play.  You will have your butt kicked routinely.  But if you like challenging turn-based combat and designing your own characters, you will likely love this game.","April 20, 2014","true","104.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

(melee weapons with poison are pretty nice)\n-Mages now can annihilate an entire battle alone.

This game makes NWN 1+2 look cutting edge\n\n*FLAWS*\n\n1) Inconsistant Mechanics; in short, they're half baked. An early mechanic is terrain tiles (water is slippery, bushes are flammable etc) and in theory these could make for some more complex tactical play, but sometimes thats not the case, water may just be a watery looking tile, or it may cause you to fall on your ♥♥♥ and be prone for a turn. Enemies never use them either, they just move to attack range throw fire, ice and poison.\n\n2) Incorrect RNG; this is a tabletop system adapted for the PC, so of course its simmulating (with a pretty bad generator I might add) die rolls under the hood. You get told a percentage chance to hit (and can level up enough to see other stats) but the percentage shown is WRONG. That's right, the game actively lies to you because its number generation system isn't implemented right. 100% chance is actualy 90%, 65% is actualy 40%. You will also see the same resualt consistantly for mid range %, every time I fire an arrow at a humanoid enemy with a 65% chance to hit I would miss without fail. same goes for 50% with melee, this makes me think the random generator isn't so random after all.\n\n3) Atrocious Voice acting; Dear gods is it terrible, it's not even laughably bad, the actors are often re-used but its like no-one told them they were doing different characters so everyone they voice sounds identicle. They were also clearly recorded completly seperatly without any lead in or practice because they're all delivered with the same dry detatchment of people with a full frontal lobotomy.\n\n4) Poor story telling; The plot may improve as time goes on, but from what I've experienced so far I can already tell you my version "And so it was that the brave ranger stabbed the annoying sidekicks while they slept and went to live away from the continent full of madmen". Honestly it started out bad enough with the giant wolf having killed (or having been eating) a random damsel, you kill the wolf and then get arrested for her murder. The wolf was right there, you kill it, its body is lying on the ground next to the corpse, yet they arrest you for her murder. The rest of the story was following a bread crumb story into a veriaty of linier dungeons, speaking of which.\n\n5) Dull Dungeon Design; if you're making a dungeon crawler then you need decent dungeons, so far everything has been a straight line with preset encounters, no element of maze, mystery or surprise. You know you will need to enter each point on the dungeon map, you know that each point is going to have an encounter, and you know that you will want to save scum the hell out of it just to preserve your precious resources.\n\n6) Cheap assets; It's ugly. Very Ugly. There is no sense of unifying aesthetic. Everything is the same blocky 3d models with dodgy shadowing, terrain detailing can actualy conflict with mechanics "is that shoreline tile a water tile or a land tile? You won't know till you step on it" the models are barely detailed, only slightly more complex than the 3d models used for CIV V (the ones designed to render quickly at distance and not be looked at too closely). Combine this with a lack luster muZak score and it just doesn't feel good to experience.\n\n7) Poor Performance; for a PC game, its not offering much in the way of performance options. You can set nebulous graphics quality but get no fine choice, you can pick a resolution but theres no windowed mode. In game I've seen multiple graphics glitches caused by lighting effects, flickering textures and even the Hex Grid breaking and flashing at the bottom of the screen.\n","November 18, 2014","false","6.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

It kind of is, but it's incredibly frustrating. Poor detection on clicking enemies and random luck screws you over worse than it does in XCOM. It's really inconsistant in its mechanics. You'd think it would be simple, that highest initiative goes first. But it doesn't. It seems like it only improves chances of going earlier in the turn order. Because I'll restart a level and a different character gets the first move. You'd think this would make things interesting but it just makes it incredibly difficult to learn from your mistakes when it constantly changes. Wounds just break immersion so much it's baffling that they put them in. Your characters get "wounds" that carry over from one fight to the next, which cripples them somewhat and you have to see a healer constantly if you didn't invest heavily in some kind of "do-it-yourself" wound healing. Really kills the immersion for me at least to leave a dungeon, go get healed and come back after every room. Some maps are just really unreasonable and you have to try over and over again to even almost win. I mean, it speaks volumes when the first option in the esc menu is "Try Again".

And it is great because of it.\n\nGraphics are wonderful. They won't blow you away but are for the most part hand drawn and look phenominal. Musical score is excellent. (Really wish I had gotten the SE for the bonuses) The story seems well written, however I have not gotten very far to give a decent opinion about it.\n\nThe combat may turn some people away as it can be very difficult at times (and since it relies on dice rolls it can be quite rage inducing) but if you show determination (there is no shame in saving and walking away for a bit, might save a monitor and keyboard or 2) the combat is extremely rewarding.\n\nIf you like The Dark Eye world, or am just a fan of strategey based RPG's, take a long look at this game. Just don't forget to spend time reading details about every skill and stat before you use your AP (like XP) on them, because it can be really easy to screw up a build.","March 23, 2014","true","16.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

An experienced software house, mostly famous for their many graphic adventures, managed to bring us a game which delivers a grand amount of turn-based tactical rpg goodness, focusing on combat, even if it doesn't shine in terms of storytelling and pure roleplaying. What is mainly fine with the game is the fact that it never gets boring, since every battle is different, well thought and characterized, other than being intelligent for example making the battlefield often interactive with the party characters skills: a mix of variety and possibilities with a functional adaptation of the TDE combat system.\nPersonally enjoyed all over the long duration of the campaign, planning and battling with satisfaction on a game that needs attention and ability over situations thankfully non-easy nor banal. Dealing with improvements on the less considered sides of this role-playing game, like story, characters history or C&C, would make a perfect sequel for an already substantial and well-directed game.","April 14, 2014","true","57.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I think the thing most people have a hard time with in this one is the dificulty of the game and them not really explaining on how attacks work. like in the percent chance to hit someone.  but if you do a little research you can figure out how to make it easy.\n\nlike all spells have three attributes allocated to them. so if you want to cast a spell that has agi, cha, const then you would want all 3 of those stats to be high. the higher they are and the higher the spell lvl is the better chance you have to hitting someone with them.\n\nfor rng and mele you want have the stat to be high to hit. for range its dex for mele its str. think there are also others that help. then you need the weapon you are using good also. plus therre is also a slider on the weapon. that lets you decide if you want to defend or attack better. so if you are on defend on the item you wont hit as often or as hard. so set it to attack.\n\nall in all i think this is a decent game worth a shot. at least on the demo for anyone who has an interest in tactical strategy rpgs.  i got it on sale and im not disapointed at all. also the difficulty can be a little harsh you will not win a battle the first time everytime. but im not one for easy games i loved temple of elemental evil and others that are harsh.","January 28, 2014","true","59.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I am a big fan of turn based tactical RPGs, and Blackguards does very well with the genre. Game difficulty is good, the story (though not amazing) is told well. Graphics are all right, but nothing to write home about. The maps are well designed and do not feel re-used, but the characters look like something from a game that was released over 6 years ago, not just over 6 months ago. Only being able to pick a head out of a choice of 6? I expect that from an indie company, not an established development studio.\n\nEnemies are diverse, and they tossed in a good amount of missions with different obectives so the goal it's always just to wipe out the other side. There are times when it does get frustrating as the number of enimies can be many on a map, and we feel like you're spending more time waiting than actually playing the game.\n\nWhen I first started playing Blackguards (during version 1.2) the game was buggy af. Some trainers did not work, some healers did not work (including what that was kind of critical to being able to progress in the game). Thought this was fixed in patch 1.3, but the game still has its bugs. These range from minor annoyance (I swear 25% of the achievements are bugged), to "Why isn't this fixed yet" (Big huge massive spoiler --> Seriously, what's up with Aurelia? I trusted her and sided with her on everything, and in the end she still dies...

Blackguards is one of those games that is not going to give you instant gratification.  After playing it for a couple of hours I initially logged out and went back to another RPG thinking to myself that it was not very fun.  Well after going back to it a few times and progressing through the game I've determined i love the game.  It takes some time to figure out the combat system and how to get a feel for the ebonflow.  It is highly strategic and combat can be approached many different ways using the battlefield, spells, usable inventory and special abilities, this is where the game really shines, it has a difficult and somewhat different system than most RPGs I've played.\n\nIf you dislike a true roll based game where you expect to push x spell and it hit your enemy, do not buy.  This game will drive you crazy sometimes in that regard, the battles can be long and having your caster miss twice in a row with your entire party down really brings me back to the Nintendo days of smashing my controller into the screen.  However this is part of the appeal to me.  And yes somewhat less but the enemies do bork their spells ocassionally too so it is a little fair in that regard.\n\nIf you dislike having to study a game with a totally different feel than what you are used to, in regards to stats, abilities, and tactics, do not buy.\n\nIf you love a good challenge and are willing to spend some trial and error learning the system, it is extremely fun and the play is flawless, i've seen no bugs or problems other than the Head and Foot Icon on the character pane reversed.  I've only put a few days into the game but can say that it has grown on me with each battle and i can see where the replay on it will be high since each battle really is totally different and your tactics are very modifiable.  I'd give this game a 8/10 thus far and believe it's one of the better RPGs on the market right now.

And it is great because of it.\n\nGraphics are wonderful. They won't blow you away but are for the most part hand drawn and look phenominal. Musical score is excellent. (Really wish I had gotten the SE for the bonuses) The story seems well written, however I have not gotten very far to give a decent opinion about it.\n\nThe combat may turn some people away as it can be very difficult at times (and since it relies on dice rolls it can be quite rage inducing) but if you show determination (there is no shame in saving and walking away for a bit, might save a monitor and keyboard or 2) the combat is extremely rewarding.\n\nIf you like The Dark Eye world, or am just a fan of strategey based RPG's, take a long look at this game. Just don't forget to spend time reading details about every skill and stat before you use your AP (like XP) on them, because it can be really easy to screw up a build.","March 23, 2014","true","16.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

For the record, I'm a seasoned RPG-player and accustomed to the old-school turn based games.\n\nShort version: Bl♥♥♥♥guards is an average game which could have been a lot better without some of the bugs and a more intuitively developed story engine.\n\nFor those of you who remember the glory days of the genre with Baldur's Gate I and II, IceWind Dale amongst others, Blackguars might still be worth looking into. I enjoyed playing it, but I would also like to post a warning about some of things that knocked down the total score for me:\n\nThe main plot is... kinda slow. And dull. I actually enjoyed several of the side-quests a lot more than the main story. The ending is very dissapointing (and without giving any spoilers, that is an understatement). I also missed having background stories unfold for the main characters, but perhaps Daedalic are saving those for the sequel(?).\n\nSeveral achievements are (still) bugged. 5 of them simply can't be completed at all (confirmed by the steam community) but I've had a total of 6-7 that bugged in my game. It's been more than a year since these bugs were first reported and the steam forums have had no response from the developers yet. Like I just mentioned above, they are currently developing a sequel to Blackguards, so chances are that these bugs might never be fixed. Hence: be warned if you're one of those players (like me) who wants to cross off every achievement from the list. For future reference: I have not bought or played the DLC.\n\nSome of the game mechanics are not explained (at all) in the manual and I had to scavenge the steam forums to see if they actually worked or not. Armor is perhaps the most obvious aspect, where players have no way of telling if the armor skills makes any difference or if the character is encumbered (and if so, what penalties to expect in battles).\n\nAn abundance of spells and skills makes things look very promising at first glance, but in reality, most of them are pretty much useless. Even when taking in account different preferations/play styles, at least 50% of the spells are likely to never be used by any player. Unfortunately, that goes for weapon types, talents and weapon skills as well. I can't shake the feeling that these worthless skills where put only there for marketing purposes rather than adding flavour to the game. It's either that, or Daedalic simply ran out of time/funds and had to release the game without proper (re)balancing tests.\n\nAlthough you are frequently presented with alternatives and choices in NPC dialogues, it rarely matters what you choose. I guess you could say that they are there to add some RP, but even so it could have been handled with more finesse. Instead you're bound to a main plot that you have no chance of altering the outcome of.\n\nI really don't want to spoil anything for you, but a frequent bother is when the game removes one ore more of your followers (and sometimes even your main character) without warning. A new player might have to start from scratch halfway through the game. Hint: make sure that your main character is at least somewhat decent in ranged combat.\n\nThe 20th time the game presents you with two choices where one gives you a handsome reward (typically the "evil" aligned choice) while the other leaves you empty handed you can't help but wonder why? Most players expect good deeds to add up to some kind of greater reward later on. In my personal opinion, this is perhaps the single biggest flaw Blackguards has, and it feels like the developers rushed the story instead of taking time to plot out great stories. Let me underline that I don't think that "good" alignment should be favoured in any way. The rewards doesn't have to be better gear or more gold, it could for example be new dialogues/NPC's that are unlocked at some point further down the line. For a game that relies so heavily on RPG stereotypes it's dissapointing that karma is pretty much non-existant in Blackguards, And yet, sometimes the choices you make are actually so important that it could warrant starting over from the beginning. I would advice all new players to SAVE, SAVE and SAVE their game as often as possible. Think of Blackguards as a Bethesda title in that aspect.\nWith the bad stuff out of the way, let's round things up with the more positive aspects of Blackguards:\n\nit's an ambitious attempt at rebooting the genre (yes, I'm aware that there are several other similar games on the market nowdays) based on a popular tabletop theme. The graphics are decent and the voice acting is top notch.\n\nCurrently priced at €39.99, I'd recommend potential customers to wait for one of the steam sales before buying. For that kind of money you'll likely to find plenty of better alternatives. Personally I bought it in a Daedalic bundle and 120 hours of gameplay is more than I expect to get from most titles these days.\n\nAll in all I'd score Blackguards a somewhere between 6 and 7 out of 10.","January 11, 2015","false","113.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The story has its ups and downs and early it is a bit confusing because they throw alot of unknown terms at you and and most of them you will only learn halfway through the game. And the end is kinda lackluster in my opinion.\n\nThe combat is turn based and the battles are mostly diversed since some can have puzzle elemnts others can have a few stages and so on. And your choices along the game influences some of the battles you have.\n\nOne of the biggest problem in the game is the amount of stats and character builds you can do makes the game way to difficult and players that dont understand how the game works in that regards can completely screw their games and be forced to start from scratch. The game does a really poor job of explaining how the overall stats work and the only way to learn about them is looking at help menu and read it or go to the manual.\n\nOn the positive side when you learn to make a proper build your mid-late game characters can have quite impressive abilities and power, the high level spell effects are rather impressive.\n\nAlso it is worth mentioning some of the achievements don't work properly or don't work at all.\n\nOverall I liked the game however the high learning curve that can really punish you is something that only some people can tolerate. And the game only really offers a couple of playthroughs in terms of story and in regards to builds I dont think that people will play purely on the interest of seeing builds with diferent weapons, the spells are nice but they will not make the players play the game again just to see their high level form.","October 12, 2015","true","77.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My first impression was that I'll get bored playing this very quickly, but they change the dynamics of the battles throughout the game so it's often not as straightforward as killing all the mobs.\n\nThe overall mechanics of the game are very familiar. Collect experience (action points) and use it to buy upgrades to your character. The battles are all turn based so you essentially get a number of action points per turn with which to move your character and perform a single action. Not being used to this type of game I wasn't too sure I would  like it but I ended up really enjoying it.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice, not spectacular, but nice, The voice acting is a little ropey but doesn't spoil the game.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the game and would recommend it.","February 27","true","53.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

My first impression was that I'll get bored playing this very quickly, but they change the dynamics of the battles throughout the game so it's often not as straightforward as killing all the mobs.\n\nThe overall mechanics of the game are very familiar. Collect experience (action points) and use it to buy upgrades to your character. The battles are all turn based so you essentially get a number of action points per turn with which to move your character and perform a single action. Not being used to this type of game I wasn't too sure I would  like it but I ended up really enjoying it.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice, not spectacular, but nice, The voice acting is a little ropey but doesn't spoil the game.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the game and would recommend it.","February 27","true","53.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Mostly I had fun playing the game.\n\n- The difficulty of the game is quite easy at the begining but later on it becomes really annoying because mostly your enemies use spells that lower your move speed, attack chance and health. Also it will become quite impossible to fight your enemies if you don't finish all of the side quest.\n\n- Interface/Combat  is excellent, but the controls are a little wonky and sometimes quite slow. There are some monsters that take up more than 1 hex ( places on the field) and it's hard to locate the spot to hit but it's not that bad that you will ruin your whole turn.\n\n- Information is a little unclear  but after few hours you should figure it out.\n\n- Loading screens. You will spend some time on loading screens.\n\n- There is not much of different gear and weapons. Don't expect to find a lot of variety of great weapons, few of my characters had the same weapon from the 1-2 chapter to the end of the game. Also my wizards had the same clothes from the 1 chapter to the last part of the chapter 5.\n\n- Opponents. There are a lot of different opponents and interesting ones. There are also opponents that are just frustrating you because they have have spells that lower everything (so yout hit chance isn't 95% but 45%) so they are hell to beat but when you beat them it's beautiful.\n\n- Characters. All of the characters u play have different personalities that are unique. In some dialogues you can choose what your characters will say.\n\n- Story. It's not a bad story at all and has some twists.\n\n- Graphics. Some people might not care at all about graphics but I like it when the game I play has at least deacent graphics. The graphics are not that bad at all but when you talk to some people they will look totally different in the picture then they look in the game.\n\n- Playability it depends on what difficulty you choose to play but It will surely have around 40 hours (surely more).\n\n- To conclude this review I recommend you buy this game but on sale. You will enjoy it and be frustrated.\n","January 5, 2015","true","37.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You can miss like 10-15 times on a row, even with maxed skills and thus lose fights on it, and other times you might hit and crit on bosses constantly and wipe them extremly fast... A quick examples are bosses that has 40% dodge on any attacks you do. Now imagien that they also poison you, and spawning mobs that are basically impossible to kill. Now, you can lose this fight, like I did 10+ times because you keep missing everytime. And yes, then another time, you might hit basically every swing and boss is down before you know it. Thats not balanced, its just random and in a SRPG based on tactics luck should never play a big part into it. I can understand some luck mechanics for the rpg-elements, but 40% miss on a boss that hit hard back? and he is a tank? Come on...\n\nI would give this game maybe a 7.5 or 8.0 of 10. When this game is at its best its actually really good, but when its at its worst its horrible. Probably need better beta test for the sequal in terms of balancing out battles, be more open about what to level up in, lots of trial and errors if you dont know what your supposed to level up or not. Also, the story and sidequest need to be better... basically as it is now, side-quest are kind of neccessary to finish for that vital AP which you level up in. So its not even a choice to do them or not.\n\nI finished the game in 40 hours on normal difficulty, so this is a pretty lenghty game I guess 35 to 45+ hours.\nWould I buy the sequal? Probably, yes, especially when its on some kind of a cheap discount, because I love srpg's and wanna support them (Final Fantasy Tactics need a sequal...) - but if the sequal for Blackguards, which is in development at this moment, get good reviews from the critics, I would probably buy it at launch.\nAs I said this game could be great, it isnt however atm in this state in terms of balancing and storywise.","September 7, 2014","true","40.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tso/recommended/249650/","tso","Tweedlebum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tso/","181 products in account","Blackguards has a pretty standard premise, in that it is a save the world fantasy story.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is stilted and often disjointed and the gameplay is dense and perhaps overly complicated.  I can forgive the voice acting, and odd story easily, but it is the game mechanics themselves that perhaps need tweaking.\n\nThe dice rolls are punishing and heavily weighted towards failure.  It is laughably common to miss 3 75% chances in a row and taking a risk on anything under a 50% chance is pretty much a guaranteed miss.   It has been said on various forums that there are many mechanics that are affecting the probabilities that don't appear in the shown hit chance.  That sounds to me like a User Interface failure and a pretty important one at that.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring issue of this is the arena fights at the beginning of Chapter 2.  When you have to pull off 6 hits in a row to kill the first enemy and then another 8 hits to kill the second.

As long as this issue is not fixed, I cannot recommend at all.\n\nUpdate (after finishing the game):\nAnother negative point: story is extremly linear. Your choices make no difference at all, because the outcome is always the same. The choices only affects the ending you may get but you notice this only at the very very very end (if you can keep playing that long that is...)","December 8, 2014","false","46.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The combat would be great if it wasn't so RNG dependent. Attacks are more limited by being able to actually hit stuff than they are about causing enough damage. Chance to hit of 65% or lower is normal for everything but a basic melee attack even when you've pretty much maxed out your character's relevant stats and weapon skill, and that 65% is actually more like 30% chance to hit because the percentage shown is just your character's accuracy. Your attack can and will still be parried or dodged half that percentage again.\n\nYou have to buff your characters with magic before they're worth a damn, but guess what. The magic has a chance of success too. So until you spend a few thousand points levelling up your mages' stats and getting them a certain ability, the highest chance of success with casting spells is ~85%. But I don't know how many times I had a mage miscast 4-5 times in a row even with a (supposedly) 80-90% chance of success.\n\nYou lose more battles because of unlucky streaks of whiffed attacks and spells fizzling out than you do from anything else.\n\nIn short, it was fun for a while, but became tedious by the end. It's worth picking up for $5 or so, because I really loved the battle set ups (there's very few boring battles because most try to do something unique and no two are the same) and the style of the game, but there's just too much wrong with it to be worth full price.","December 20, 2014","false","73.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The world is interesting, but it gets lost when you fight very samey enemies all the time. Story could be interesting if characters wouldn't change their motivation every now and then, yet they keep being predictable. Also the world is very limited to a 1-3 screens per town.\nBattles could be fun - the system has some neat ideas, enviroment has traps and cool strategic placements, but you very rarely get to use that, since you have to attack or you get surrounded and can't move.\n\nBut the major flaw is that the game FEELS UNFAIR all the time (even when maybe it is not really). Instead of making battles interesting, the game more than once takes your whole inventory and offers you bad equipment in exchange, then you have to battle and find out that enemies in that arena are better equipped than you.\nAttack chances are random at best  (a number like 90% chance don't mean anything in this game). Damage you inflict is always small unless your character has fully invested in one weapon skill (which I had to change for one character because it had the same setup as my main character and then spent many hours inflicting 3x less damage than the enemies).\nThe whole unfairness also applies to experience point requirements - some skills seem very out of reach (I can see the options ahead, but what I can actually afford/choose is 1-2 options and get stuck with that for hours). "Special" attacks make very little difference most of the time and are in no way interesting.\n","January 6, 2015","false","11.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I don't understand why game developers think that RNG and setting the odds against you makes a game fun.  If you enjoy loading over and over again until you get a perfect roll and get the scenario down perfect is fun than this is the game for you!\n\nThe graphics are mediocre, they characters look mediocre and no way to customize, the classes are mediocre and you don't gain enough skill points to keep up with the difficulty curve.\n\nThe game is linear, offering no real exploration.  Just move from one scenario to another.  One scenario will be easy the next not to bad and than they throw one at you that you have to reload over and over again until you get lucky.  No skill involved, just luck on RNG.  This game gets the terrible reviews it deserves.\n\nI am in the second chapter stuck on fighting the "newcomer" gladiators.  They split your group into 2 groups.  So if you didn't choose a warrior in the beginning you will be stuck fighting 2 ranged against a tank and range setup, which is painful.  There is making the game difficult and then there is making it silly just to extend the life of the game.  I will try to finish the game and see but my will to continue is slowly dwindling, I am beginning to think that this company doesn't know how to make games.\n\nOK Made it past that point, now I am to a part in the gladiator games where they throw 3 waves of enemies at you without any rest.  This really is some of the worst game design I have had the misfortune in playing.  You get no breaks, no way to bind your wounds... nothing.  I made it to the 8th wave and there is an instant win button the enemies can do that you have no way of stopping.  It is completely random.

The core gameplay and character progression elements are easily some of the best in the genre, but as battles tend to drag on and more and more enemies scream “owAUGH,” the interest tends to fade. The story is easy enough to follow and interesting enough to keep players interested, so fantasy buffs should feel engaged the entire time.

The core gameplay and character progression elements are easily some of the best in the genre, but as battles tend to drag on and more and more enemies scream “owAUGH,” the interest tends to fade. The story is easy enough to follow and interesting enough to keep players interested, so fantasy buffs should feel engaged the entire time. Even if the sound effects weren't satisfying, the gameplay itself more than made up for that, and it’s easy to see that Daedalic Entertainment has a bright future ahead of them in the strategy sphere."\n\nIn other words, a great game for fantasy/strategy fans!

The story is neither the worst nor the best but is enough to be interesting to see through to as far as I've gotten.  There is virtually no exploration involved in this game what so ever. You go to the main map screen different cities and town, and areas of interest, but there is no in game screens of wondering through the woods or anything.  All exploration is done in areas other than cities with a simple overlay of your icon lines leading to circles with events where you fight, and only fight.  Combat is a whole other thing entirely mostly coming down to "you see that little 90% hit chance on the icon to attack nah not gonna happen".  I've had dozens of time where I will have a 90% or 95% chance to hit an enemy and miss more often than a character with a 65% to hit; it is the most extreme level of riduclous.  The point where i finally broke down to write this review was when I'm fighting for a city so I can advance the story and go south.  I have to fight lizardmen I think no problem, I save some of the villagers and get to were the next objective is to kill more lizardmen and destroy these crystals.  I think ok this may be a challenge but I'l see what I can do.  these crystals continually heal all the lizardmen every turn to almost full health, combined with the 90-95% chance to "hit" wiff animation i could do nothing but exhaust all of my resources to kill one at a time losing half my team of 4 people.  by the time i get down to one or 2 lizardmen i have no way to cause enough damage in a turn to kill one without healing.  and you may think the crystals are be destroyed, and your right but each hit from my hardest hitting character is 1 Point of damage.\n\nThere are some good things about this game like the fact that decisions in the game can have consequences later on.  the story while not entirely mind blowning awesome has a level of mystery that keeps me wanting to keep going to find out why this is all happening, but this combat system needs alot of work to give accurate information when a 65% is gonna hit but a 95% chance to hit is swinging for air so much of the time.  Until this is fixed I'm gonna have to say that 40 dollars is way to much when there is a diffinitive level of pure luck regardless of the numbers in a game that is suppose to be strategic.","January 30, 2014","false","10.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Blackguards seems difficult for all the wrong reasons, from an obtuse user interface to mindbogglingly poorly designed stats pages.\nWhile I appreciate that any game coming from an existing Pen and Paper world will always have a higher step up for the user than most, Shadowrun earlier last year seemed to create a system both faithful and functional while Blackguards seemed bogged down in it's own mechanics.\nThe story is about par for course and the voice acting is quite refreshing, but it just seems like the clunky mechanics just get in the way of that experience and the difficulty wildly differs so much you bound between feeling elated and cheated every few minutes.\nWhile people howl off the rooftops at the percieved "dumbing down" of videogames, sometimes it has a point. Parts of the design feel snobbish, as if it wants to pat it's faithful on the back and tell them how smart and clever they are while with the other hand swatting away the "casual, filthy masses". Blackguards needs to get down of it's high horse and reduce the barriers to entry that stop it from being the good game I know underneath is has the potential to be.","January 18, 2015","false","7.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game brought back some memories.\n\nIt has a nice atmosphere and is quite challenging. I really missed the roundbased RPGs, which is, for me atleast, revived in this. Sometimes you have to think ahead, sometimes you can just bully everybody down. Some fights are really stressful, while others are straightforward. The point is that almost no fight is like another one, each requires new tactics and strategies, atleast to a point. Of course you have your base tactics, which, in my case was a mostly ranged combat play style. But pure melee or multiple spellcasters sound interesting too. The good thing is that every character is can mostly do anything, aside the fact that only characters with magic potential can become wizards.\n\nAnother interesting thing for was the whole plot. Having played the other TDE games made it easy for me to fit into the world with its twelve gods, its mostly human based civilisation, with much prejudice against other races and of course its bright and wild country side, which makes this world a beautiful place. But the beauty in this is just a mask for all the darker happenings in this world.\n\nAll in all, if you love Roundbased Strategy, a good and detailed told story and funny, yet serious, characters, this game is for you. Just bring some time and patience, because the downside of this are the time consuming fights and the kinda missing background story of your secondary characters.","February 22, 2015","true","64.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The main problem is that it's built around an obscure role playing system that is both punishing and not fun. It's based on the Dark Eye role playing system in Germany. It's a fairly punishing system that gives too much power to the RNG and not enough to the player.\n\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\nIt's just no fun having a 50/50 chance of casting a spell fail 6 or 7 times in a row and that costing you a battle. It's luck, not tactics or skill, that will get you through battles and luck doesn't make for a fun game. The "tactics" are minimal and your choices in leveling a character are severely restricted because if you don't take certain paths with certain classes you simply won't be able to proceed through the battles. This is the core problem with the game. It's like playing chess with an RNG. It simply defeats the purpose.\n\nThe game wants you to play it one way. It discourages experimentation and creativity while demanding that you play it the "right" way with the "right" skill and classes or woe to the user. This isn't a strategy game but more of a puzzle and one that's not fun to piece together. Either you read a guide or you will be forced to start over at some point. That's just really poor design.\n\nAs for the other aspects of the game, consider me unimpressed. The voice acting is truly horrible and the plotline is both forgettable and so dumb as to be insulting to the player. You can't rotate the camera and often enemies are obscured. The graphics are decent but nothing fantastic. The videos stutter and tend to happen too often.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, there's really nothing redeeming about Blackguards beyond the fact that when you finally uninstall it you'll clear up 17GB of hard drive space to use for something better. You'll get better tactics out of King's Bounty and Divinity: Original Sin than this game plus better exploration and more personality. Save your money, buy those and you'll have far more fun than you would with this game.","December 15, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I enjoyed this game far much more than I did for UFO Enemy unknown.\n\nI do not have any experience with the dark eye world so I browsed steam community guides (class guide was most helpful) and some forum posts. Concentration (on certain skills or spells for a character) was advised and it is really important.  I tried to max weapon talent, base stat and skill which are matched (refer community guide). Chapter 1 was a bit difficult since the system was new to me but the remaining chapters became more comfortable as I learn combinations of spells and base stats (for example, one of the  spells that I specialized requires cleverness and constitution). All the information is well presented in game. Carefully building your character not wasting points here and there is crucial. (Dont be afraid if it sounds complicated. If you play 3-4 hours, every thing becomes clearer).\n\nCertainly, randomness is there but every RPG has that element. So it wasnt a big deal for me.\n\nI am looking forward to Blackguards 2.

My experience thus far is that the game is well worth while, and I would recommend it to any fan of tactical RPGs. This review will cover positive aspects of the game, negative aspects of the game (and why they don't matter much), and advice for potential adventurers.\n\nPositive aspects:\n\nFirst and foremost, the leveling system is vast. You are confronted with tons of options right at the outset, which provides a good degree of clarity about how to plan your path. It is definitely viable to create hard class archetypes, and is likely also viable to create more versatile heroes. There is a solid mix of cheap levelling options that help do what you want your character to do now, and choices that allow you to transition to new skills later.\n\nSecond, the tactical combat is varied enough to prevent approaching all battles in the same way. Differences in enemy types  and compositions, apparent environmental attributes, hidden environmental objects, and varied victory conditions  all help to keep things fresh. Depending on these scenarios, I've had success with tactics involving methodical advancement, bait and run, divide and conquer, run and gun, and defensive walling. I imagine that if you built for it, you could plan to finish some battles with ranged attacks before the enemies even reach you.\n\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning a few things other than the core gameplay. The story is well-told and evenly-paced, and is compelling enough to justify the  constant fighting. The music is solid (though repetitive). And the world map is easy to navigate.\n\nNegative aspects:\n\nFirst, the graphical quality for character models is a little poor when seen up close. Characters don't look quite right facially, and when they talk you can even see that they don't have an inside to their mouths. Character portraits look little like their polygonal counterparts. While this can be offputting, it is not so apparent in battle view, and is not a major detriment.\n\nThe only other negative point is the tedious exploration. While map exploration is simple, it is a tedious point-and-click affair. Finding a quest sometimes means visiting each town (many of which look and feel the same) on the off-chance that it will have one, and clicking through each of the people to make sure. Because this is quickly accomplished, it is not a huge drawback, but it is a boring aspect of the game.\n\nMy advice:\n\nSome helpful pointers for those who do choose to buy this game (my first piece of advice is that you do) are below:\n- Start with a notion of what you want each of your characters to do, and focus solely on that at first (melee vs. ranged vs. magic, choice of weapons, choice of spells). Plan to branch your characters out later.\n- It is probably best to make your starting character a magic user, even if you don't plan to focus on spells right away. I don't feel particularly disadvantaged by not having done so, but I can see how an additional magic user could be helpful down the road.\n- Don't focus on magic for your starting character, even if you make them a magic user. You will get other characters, and you probably don't need more than one pure mage.\n- Magic users aren't great early on, but focusing on healing first is a big help to boosting their early-game usefulness without taking away from long-term viability.\n- You will want at least one ranged character, and it will be obvious at a few points in the game who can fill that role.\n- Stats and skills that accomplish more per turn/action are more valuable than capacity stats like HP and Astral Points.\n- Gold matters a ton in the early parts of the game, and not at all after. Your priority spending should be on the best weapons you can find, followed by set armor.\n- It is okay to skip a quest you're not ready for. Some builds can't handle some scenarios, and you may need to level up a little more to take it on. This is a likely but infrequent occurrence. As far as I can tell, quests don't disappear just by waiting.\n- Don't be afraid to re-roll and start over. It is tempting to try different things, and you may discover early in the game that your build isn't working like you wanted. Your second try will be much improved.\n\nThank you for reading, I hope it was helpful, and please let others know whether or not you found this review informative.\n\nPeace!\nAFoolToFollow","November 23, 2014","true","80.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But unlike most games based on D&D, Blackguards (and most TDE games) is based on a relatively low-magic world.  This and some other things makes me think that TDE was perhaps not the best ruleset to base the game's engine on.\n\nTHE GOOD\n-Challenging difficulty\n-Characters are cliche, but well written\n-Battlefields are almost always unique for each battle\n\nTHE BAD\n-Needlessly complex character customization with very linear results\n-Extremely frequent loading times\n-Occasional chore-like battle\n-Story falls flat\n\nBlackguards plays like a more linear King's Bounty, except more linear and with actual party members instead of squadrons of soldiers.  I played Hard Mode on my first playthrough I found it to be very challenging; the game punishes you greatly for building characters incorrectly, doing poorly in certain battles (because you don't get healed for the next at!), and picking the wrong fights at the wrong time.  However, there is a good amount of diversity in game objectives and the battlefields are mostly unique for each battle.\n\nStrategy in this game favors positioning above all else, because the strongest abilities in the game belong to melee and rangers whose primary attack abilities have no cooldowns and insignificant downsides to their use.  Mages are primarily support characters, and their best spells simply involve turning your melee guy into an even stronger skill spammer.  Had they used a different ruleset or made one of their own, they could have improved the strategy element of the battle system.  If you're going to make a turn-based strategy RPG, isn't strategy a lot of what the whole idea is about?\n\nDon't expect the same kind of class diversity that D&D games have.  Despite the complexity of TDE's character customization, there isn't a lot of customization to be done.  Blackguards doesn't take a lot of steps to simplify the rules, but despite all of the little things the player must keep track of, the end result is almost always the same; melee and ranged guys hit hard, mages either cast support spells or suck.\n\nLoad times are unnecessarily frequent.  The game features a lot of cities, most of which don't have much unique to offer, yet trying to find quests in them involves watching a loading screen for each one.  It gets ridiculous because some of the cities have more than one section, with each section requiring even more time at the loading screen to move around to.\n\nIt was suggested by previews that Blackguards would set the player in the role of being the "bad guy" or at least the guy most people think is the bad guy.  The story even sets itself up with an intriguing mystery of laser guided amnesia, but aside from a couple scenes falls flat after the first chapter.  However, the voice acting is pretty good, and the characters, though cliche and mostly linear, are written quite well. Hell, Naurim is more memorable to me than any of the characters from Dragon Age: Origins.\n\nWith all of this negative stuff being said, I had decent fun playing Blackguards.  It's challenging, offers some diversity in scenarios and battlefields, and has decently well written characters.  Definitely try the demo before buying, it contains hours of content.  Buy it on sale.","November 23, 2014","true","60.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is ultimately focused more on preparation than on actual strategy in combat. Generally speaking basic resource management and a bit of luck when it comes to the (sometimes infuriating) RNG will win fights.\nI found the poison & trapping elements of Blackguards to be more to it's detriment than benefit, with poisons and traps being prohibitively expensive both in terms of currency and the use of a turn to apply them and a belt slot to carry them. Most enemies are immune or highly resilient to poison and trap effects, and there are many enemies which will poison you with debuffs for the whole battle if they land a hit. The only spell which works to remove poison is ineffective against the stonger poisons, which by endgame most enemies use.

I had reservations, but so far I put in a few hours into it. It's fun, there are some mechanics that are not as intuitive, and I'm early on in the game.  For instance buying weapons.  Would be nice when buying a new sword, that it would list all the characters that can use that sword and their +- stats if they were to buy that sword. Hoping for more weapon variety in upcoming patches.  The game is sufficiently challenging.  Gold is hard to come by so items you purchase can be frustrating at times. If you spent all your money on an axe, you just happen to find during the next battle for instance.  But that's the nature of the beast I guess.  The battles are a bit more like HOMM vs xcom.   Overall, I would recommend this game!

The loot is pretty uninteresting, and I wish there was more things that mattered.\n\nEDIT:\nFinished one playthrough. The game story itself isn't that interesting honestly, it feels rather cut in pieces. Also, the whole 'choices' thing seems to be a trend lately mostly along with the popularity of visual novels that actually are totally based off only those choices...but if you're going to have a game that really wants a diverging story up to that level, blackguards isn't your thing.\n\nThe selling point, however, is that the battle system is awesome and pretty fun. True, it can get a bit repetitive and annoying, and perhaps easy if you're not playing hardmode. Still, the combat is solid and pretty fun.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 3.5 / 5. Good enough for a single playthrough unless they come up with more updates. Is it worth the money? I honestly dunno, but I'd pay around 20 i guess.

It is ultimately focused more on preparation than on actual strategy in combat. Generally speaking basic resource management and a bit of luck when it comes to the (sometimes infuriating) RNG will win fights.\nI found the poison & trapping elements of Blackguards to be more to it's detriment than benefit, with poisons and traps being prohibitively expensive both in terms of currency and the use of a turn to apply them and a belt slot to carry them. Most enemies are immune or highly resilient to poison and trap effects, and there are many enemies which will poison you with debuffs for the whole battle if they land a hit. The only spell which works to remove poison is ineffective against the stonger poisons, which by endgame most enemies use.

Blackguards.  With the world map travelling system and tactical battlefields, Blackguards has a real old school feel to it, in a very good way.  Blackguards is a lot of fun to play and thoroughly enjoyable.  Replayability, since you control 5 simulaneous characters, is a bit iffy since you already have the opportunity to develop all types, really, and the story is pretty much the same though and through.  The only complaints I have is that the story is not as coherent as it should be at times.  Unfortunately, this is most markedly recognizable at the end of the game, when the story pretty much falls completely apart and the "end game" you been promised from the beginning ("the Name") never truly materializes or wraps up.  Worse, your characters, at this point, have nothing further to do but wander the world map and its areas, completely unimpeded.  A deep dungeon or more really would have helped here.","July 20, 2014","true","50.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you like turn based combat in a fantasy world, this is a must. I enjoyed this game far much more than I did for UFO Enemy unknown.\n\nI do not have any experience with the dark eye world so I browsed steam community guides (class guide was most helpful) and some forum posts. Concentration (on certain skills or spells for a character) was advised and it is really important.  I tried to max weapon talent, base stat and skill which are matched (refer community guide). Chapter 1 was a bit difficult since the system was new to me but the remaining chapters became more comfortable as I learn combinations of spells and base stats (for example, one of the  spells that I specialized requires cleverness and constitution). All the information is well presented in game. Carefully building your character not wasting points here and there is crucial. (Dont be afraid if it sounds complicated. If you play 3-4 hours, every thing becomes clearer).\n\nCertainly, randomness is there but every RPG has that element. So it wasnt a big deal for me.\n\nI am looking forward to Blackguards 2.

My experience thus far is that the game is well worth while, and I would recommend it to any fan of tactical RPGs. This review will cover positive aspects of the game, negative aspects of the game (and why they don't matter much), and advice for potential adventurers.\n\nPositive aspects:\n\nFirst and foremost, the leveling system is vast. You are confronted with tons of options right at the outset, which provides a good degree of clarity about how to plan your path. It is definitely viable to create hard class archetypes, and is likely also viable to create more versatile heroes. There is a solid mix of cheap levelling options that help do what you want your character to do now, and choices that allow you to transition to new skills later.\n\nSecond, the tactical combat is varied enough to prevent approaching all battles in the same way. Differences in enemy types  and compositions, apparent environmental attributes, hidden environmental objects, and varied victory conditions  all help to keep things fresh. Depending on these scenarios, I've had success with tactics involving methodical advancement, bait and run, divide and conquer, run and gun, and defensive walling. I imagine that if you built for it, you could plan to finish some battles with ranged attacks before the enemies even reach you.\n\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning a few things other than the core gameplay. The story is well-told and evenly-paced, and is compelling enough to justify the  constant fighting. The music is solid (though repetitive). And the world map is easy to navigate.\n\nNegative aspects:\n\nFirst, the graphical quality for character models is a little poor when seen up close. Characters don't look quite right facially, and when they talk you can even see that they don't have an inside to their mouths. Character portraits look little like their polygonal counterparts. While this can be offputting, it is not so apparent in battle view, and is not a major detriment.\n\nThe only other negative point is the tedious exploration. While map exploration is simple, it is a tedious point-and-click affair. Finding a quest sometimes means visiting each town (many of which look and feel the same) on the off-chance that it will have one, and clicking through each of the people to make sure. Because this is quickly accomplished, it is not a huge drawback, but it is a boring aspect of the game.\n\nMy advice:\n\nSome helpful pointers for those who do choose to buy this game (my first piece of advice is that you do) are below:\n- Start with a notion of what you want each of your characters to do, and focus solely on that at first (melee vs. ranged vs. magic, choice of weapons, choice of spells). Plan to branch your characters out later.\n- It is probably best to make your starting character a magic user, even if you don't plan to focus on spells right away. I don't feel particularly disadvantaged by not having done so, but I can see how an additional magic user could be helpful down the road.\n- Don't focus on magic for your starting character, even if you make them a magic user. You will get other characters, and you probably don't need more than one pure mage.\n- Magic users aren't great early on, but focusing on healing first is a big help to boosting their early-game usefulness without taking away from long-term viability.\n- You will want at least one ranged character, and it will be obvious at a few points in the game who can fill that role.\n- Stats and skills that accomplish more per turn/action are more valuable than capacity stats like HP and Astral Points.\n- Gold matters a ton in the early parts of the game, and not at all after. Your priority spending should be on the best weapons you can find, followed by set armor.\n- It is okay to skip a quest you're not ready for. Some builds can't handle some scenarios, and you may need to level up a little more to take it on. This is a likely but infrequent occurrence. As far as I can tell, quests don't disappear just by waiting.\n- Don't be afraid to re-roll and start over. It is tempting to try different things, and you may discover early in the game that your build isn't working like you wanted. Your second try will be much improved.\n\nThank you for reading, I hope it was helpful, and please let others know whether or not you found this review informative.\n\nPeace!\nAFoolToFollow","November 23, 2014","true","80.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game features a lot of cities, most of which don't have much unique to offer, yet trying to find quests in them involves watching a loading screen for each one.

However, the voice acting is pretty good, and the characters, though cliche and mostly linear, are written quite well.

Combat is the typical turn based Hex grid goto but this is when the game can be a pain, traps are invisible of course you can take an action to scan the area around you for them, BUT to scan furthur areas you must move another character into the area avoiding the traps that are reveal. Movement is crap, the Hex grid makes thing wonky and you end up having the character accidentally move through a trap, inflicting damage, possible status effects, and ending their turn. If you don't end up walking through a trap on your way to the empty space you will likely hit a trap that is still hidden. Also the  AI opponents know where the traps are so unless it plays stupid and tries to make it's way to a weakend ally it will almost never hit them.\n\nI am saddend by this spike in difficulty but if you enjoy masocistic gaming feel free but other wise avoid.","June 6, 2015","false","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Inventory management really sucks a lot, not too mention quirky little fun things like characters using bandages to cure lasting injuries only on themselves - means you cannot reliably heal with a character you build for such stuff.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mawndough/recommended/249650/","Mawndough","Mawndough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mawndough/","167 products in account","I bought this on sale for like $3. I regret buying it.\n\nPros:\nHex-based tactical combat\nLots of character customization\nPoints system for leveling skills\nEnvironmental effects such as setting bushes on fire, slipping in puddles, or knocking stalagtites off the ceiling of a cave\n\nCons:\nYou will likely hit your opponents maybe 10% of the time. You have a hit percentage ranging from 0 to 100. This is based on your skill with the weapon, your attack stat, and the level of the creature you're attacking. This does not take into account their ability to dodge or parry. A character (opponent or ally) can parry the first physical attack against them each turn. They can dodge any number of attacks per turn. So, if you have a 90% chance to hit, it is then further reduced behind the scenes by their dodge rating, and again by parry if they have not yet been hit. If you have anything less than say, 80% chance to hit, it may take you dozens of turns to end a battle that could have ended in like 6.\n\nEnemies at the beginning of the game hit every hard, and rarely miss. You can increase your dodge and parry ratings through skills, but at character select you can't exactly make it huge. This would be fine, if it weren't for the fact that enemies can quite often hit for 10-15 damage, while your character only has about 30 health. Early game you only have 3 party members, and very often face off against 5+ enemies. It's easy to get swarmed, so using choke points is a must-- at least it would be if the majority of the levels they put you in weren't open rooms.\n\nCover doesn't seem to do anything. One of the earliest tips you get is that you are harder to hit in partial cover, and even harder to hit in full cover, like behind a tree. Archers have no trouble hitting you from the full length of the map behind full cover for 5-8 damage a turn, and it will take at least 2 or 3 turns to be able to reach them.\n\nSome quests/scenarios are outright impossible if you try them too early, and the game has no qualms about sending you to your death. A good example of an early scenario in this game is facing a Wood Troll (like a treant). It has a ton of health and does a lot of damage (like 15-20 per hit), but it's slow and in a gaseous swamp. You can stand in front of a gas pocket and  use a fire spell or torch on the gas to explode it a few times to win the fight. You could do this at level 1 if you wanted, but an uninformed player would try to rush it and die quickly.\n\nA bad example is later on. You fight some dwarves in an arena. They have a lot of health, do a lot of damage, and can move as far as you. You're *supposed* to use the same method as the Wood Troll. Stand in front of the mace trap before it activates, lure the enemy into it, and do most of the damage through the trap. My issue is I was underleveled, and there was no way for me to know this until it was too late. The enemy dodged 100% of my attacks, knocked down a character per turn, and the melee dwarf hit for 15+ damage per turn plus 5 poison per turn while 2 of my characters had ~30 hp, and one with 46. The melee dward also parried the trap that was supposed to deal the damage to him each turn, so he was functionally invincible. I tried at least a dozen times, looked online, and saw the only real way to win the fight is to ignore the mission until you had another party member and were a little more leveled. Looking at my saves, I had one auto save right before the fight, a quick save right before the fight, and a manual save about an hour and a half prior (Which isn't the game's fault, but frustrating nonetheless).\n\nYou can't level skills without finding a trainer, even if you meet the pre-requisites to unlock it, or had the option to learn it during character creation. If I don't spend at least one point into the mend wounds ability at character creation, I cannot learn it until much later when I find the right trainer. I would understand for some skills, but for the basic levels of some passive abilities or skills it doesn't make much sense.\n\nOverall, the game is difficult for the sake of being difficult, but not in a way that self improvement can make it any easier. Unlike an action game like Dark Souls, dying isn't always the result of you ♥♥♥♥ing up. A lot of the time, it's because a creature rolled the highest it possibly could 3 turns in a row, or all 3 of your characters missed every single roll 3 turns in a row. If you're okay with restarting a mission over and over just to beat it, or to avoid getting knocked down and started on fire before your first turn, go for it. If you're as easily frustrated as me at a game where RNG is the core mechanic of the game, avoid it, even for $3.00","September 1, 2015","false","23.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Does each character have skeletons, of course but I've yet to see one that actually warrents a "Blackguard" title; in fairness here the Blackguard definition, a-la from Dungeons & Dragons, is in a different context then from this title.\n\nAs has been stated in other reviews & from Daedelic Entertainment, the game is based off a tabletop role-playing game from Germany. This is my first foray into this system in any case.  The story is OK, but not much more then that.  You don't gain levels per se, but you gain adventure points (AP) when either defeating foes or completing a quest.  You use these points to raise just about everything pertaining to your character, be it statistics, your skills, your resitances, & for magic users how effective spells are & the astral points needed to cast them.  The higher the "level" of the STATS, skills etc, the more AP they cost.  Unfortunately, I've not come into any battle where my group has had a "windfall" of AP, so far  I've either gotten 30, 60 or around 120 AP depending on the battle (whether mundane foes or major ones).   I've gotten a bit more AP when completing quests though. In fairness here I'm playing it on the easiest difficulty, maybe battles give you more AP on the harder ones, though I doubt it.\n\nThe hightlights of the game are the battle system, I've yet to encounter any "cut & paste" battle area.  The upgrade system for your characters is fairly subtle, but noticable for the most part.  In short, you don't feel like you're spending AP to upgrade your character & they don't feel like they're more powerful.   The spells are diverse & effective. Mapwise there is a fairly large area to cover in both the in battle maps & world map.\n\nThe weaknesses of the game, thus far are:\n\nNo areas to really grind for AP,  with possible exception of arena, but even there I believe you can only have a certain amount of battles in the arena.  You can't actually make things, not armor or weapons, at least not at the point in the game that I'm at.  There's no height or lowlands difference in battles; in short I've not had so much as 1 battle where either I or the enemy started at the top of a hill.  I've also yet to have been involved in a battle where I've gotten a huge amount of AP. I'm roughly at the halfway mark, going by what the creators wrote on the main page, but I've yet to see so much as one magical item, whether defensive or offensive item.  I don't know the tabletop RPG this is based off of so perhaps the world lacks magical items or if they're simply more subtle in nature when compared to games like Final Fantasy Tactics.   The spellcasters also need work, I find them more useful as party "buffers", and from what I've read on the forums I'm in the nearly overwhelming majority.\n\nThis game needs some minor tweaks to really grab you & keep you in it's grip; but so far any issues I have with it, in the scheme of things, are relatively minor & not game breaking.","February 2, 2014","true","54.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Strategy gamers will find the combat tacky and repetitive because it always comes down to enemies trying to overwhelm you with odds with very simplistic AI.\n\n3.  It can't possibly appeal to people looking for a great story because the story is clearly an afterthought.  You get brief looks into your characters pasts between drawn out combat sessions but there's no real development.  Things just happen and force you into the next fight.\n\nSo really, who was this game made for?","June 28, 2014","false","5.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As an avid fan of turn based games, this is severely lacking. Inconsistency is the biggest flaw. The game is seemingly okay for the first few battles however soon after, it quickly becomes a reload and try again, 12-20 times. Go to a prior save, make adjustments and try again. Too often, for instance, my mage character with 80% and above chance to heal fails, too often failure to use the environment will make a battle impossible. Too often your characters will miss leaving foes drooling at another chance to make you reload.\nI had high hopes for the game. The menus are not great, the story is rather drab, but it only felt horrible when every map because a reload the game fest. If you're looking for turn based...

Blackgaurds has decent graphics and gameplay and I enjoy the battles that require real thinking to resolve. I can also appreciate the aspect of the game where you need to be very careful how you expend your experience because there is a fairly linear event horizon and if you have mispent too many points you may not be able to win the next fight.\n\nWhat I very much do not appreciate about the game are the various idiotic things you need to do to stay alive where you aren't really roleplaying, you are trying to beat the ganme:\n\n1. You dont seem to be able to buy a potion of healing and just drink it. You need to enter a fight then waste your time drinking it.\n\n2. I have mana regenration and healing (basically over time unlimited healing) I can sit in a fairly safe town but need to entera fight to regenerate mana. I would be fine with this in an arena with 10 seconds between fights but in the narrative I have hours to lounge around the town. However, I cant heal myself even though I have the ability.\n\n3. When you have a character with a healing spell and mana regeneration, you have to sit around with one monster left hitting one character (or behind a force wall) as your mana regenerates and you heal. You spend 40 turns getting your mana and health up to full.\n\nAll in all an okay game. I cant really get into it thought because I spend too long having to game the system.","January 28, 2014","true","28.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The characters feel nice and different, they folow certain cliches but those are unavoidable. For me what makes this game shine is the characters and he conversations, i mean how can you not love the joke "An elf a human and a dwarf were wading through a river, the elf said 'This water is up to my chest' the human said 'It's up to my neck' the dwarf said... nothing." The combat in this game is often a challenge and requires you to think out your attack, use the environment and each character's abilities together or suffer heavy damge in most situations. The story is a nice break from the typical "We are the heros out on a noble quest to defeat evil." that often plagues the rpg genre. Overall if i had to rate this game i'd give it an 8/10, great game, fun characters and a nice story ut very unforgiving at most times, but at leas it gives you a "Try again" button for every fight.","February 9, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You take on the role of a criminal that has been accused of murder and your ultimate goal is to escape the people that are after you and find out exactly what happened to you... and probably save the world.\n\nYou can pick from a roughly customizable melee fighter, an archer, or a mage to start out with and you will acquire a melee fighter and a mage in your party after the first couple of fights. You do not get your 4th party member, an archer,  until about half way through chapter one.\n\nThe fighting is actually strategic with being able to move and take an action, move further but not be able to take an action that turn, or wait and the rest of that characters turn will move to the end of the queue for that turn. There are a lot of things that can be interacted with in the battles for various effects, such as lighting things on fire to cause damage to anything moving through them, activating traps, or removing items that are giving enemies buffs.\n\nThere is the occasional difficulty spike, but if you think strategically you can work around them. Your choices also have at least short term consequences, and possibly long term ones. Enemy AI can be used against them, which is a bit sad to watch occasionally. It is a bit disappointing watching as the enemy stands in the same spot turn after turn and takes trap damage because one of your characters is standing one spot over and within melee range.\n\nCharacter interactions are amazingly fun. The stock melee character you get at the start of the game is very gruff, and will shout out lines if you heal him with magic, just as an example. The dialog outside of battle is just as fun, with one of the characters being obviously very self-serving and causing a bit of trouble because of it.\n\nSkill trees seem to be fairly balanced, but within the first couple chapters of the game having an archer or 2 is a godsend. My archers have probably taken out more enemies than my melee fighter, so I make sure I am very well stocked on arrows. Mages start out very weak, and don't pick up until they get some levels on their skills to improve their accuracy.\n\nNow the bad, some of the encounters are annoying or just outright boring. I hate seeing crypt lice because they're boring to kill. Another couple instances had me defending an endless stream of helpless NPCs until they got through a gate, and the enemies respawn until a certain number of NPCs get out of the gate. Boring, tedious, and not very fun... especially when the respawning enemies have a throw attack that is capable of instantly killing the NPCs on an unlucky roll. Money is not exactly easy to come by early on and items are EXPENSIVE. So you will be getting a lot of your gear through drops for a fair bit... and enemies drop weapons far more often than armor.\n\nGood game, definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of the TBS games.","June 30, 2014","true","30.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Single-screen cities, magic fails profoundly and its influence on combat is mediocre.\n\nConclusion: It's not a real RPG, it's tactical TBS with some RPG elements. Not worth the full price, but at 50% or more discount - why not.","March 7, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Granted you are still on a quest to save your world, but you do go about it in a slightly different manner. Does the game differentiate itself enough from similar competitors, or should it have remained in solitary confinement? Suppose you’ll have to read on to find out eh?\n\nLet’s be honest, if you have enough interest in the game to have happened upon this review then you’ve probably seen a couple of videos. From there we can assume you know what kind of art style is at play here. It’s dark, it’s got a lot of browns and grays, and it’s a high-fantasy setting. Dwarves, mages, swords and archers are all present. This is all to be expected, so we won’t cover the art beyond that. It’s pretty generic but it does the job. So we’ll go ahead and move on to cover something you’re more interested in instead.\n\nThe gameplay! This is what you were looking for, right? It’s alright. You don’t have to be ashamed that you skipped directly to this section. I won’t hold it against you. I’ll still tell you all about the game and help you decide if it’s worth the price or not. Let’s begin shall we? Blackguards is an isometric turn-based strategy game with all the expected trappings that come along with it. You begin by creating a character via a fairly detailed skill/attribute tree using a preset number of character points. You may begin as either a warrior or a mage, with the mage class costing you extra points to unlock. Points may be spent on spells, skills, attributes and upgrades for all of those. Further character points are earned by completing quests and missions throughout the game.\n\nAs you play, you collect various companions who can be fully customized in the same fashion, giving a great deal of customization options and variations to be had. Each character, including your own, is fully voice acted and animated. Though it is hit or miss, none of it is particularly bad. It certainly doesn’t detract anything from the game even if it doesn’t always add to it either. The gameplay itself boils down to what you might expect; characters act in turns based on their initiative values, which are affected by what armor you have equipped. Heavier armor lowers initiative, light armor lowers it less. It’s fairly straightforward. Combat is equally typical of the genre. During a turn you may move and attack, or move a little further and not attack. It has a bit of depth, but not so much that it needs any more detail listed here.\n\nWhere Blackguards separates itself from the pack is with its tone. You aren’t a band of heroes out to save the world. You are a band of outlaws, cutthroats and brigands who just happen to be on the path that might end with the world being saved. As a result a lot of your quests have to do with helping a party member engage in some…bedroom fun times, we’ll call it, with a local baroness. Also robbery, murder, chaos and overall mayhem. It’s a nice change of pace from the usual save this person or that thing and be all heroic that usually come in games like this.\n\nOverall, Blackguards is a fun game. It has some downsides, being low-budget, but nothing that detracts in any meaningful way from the quality of the game. It’s worth the price of admission if you’re looking for a turn-based rpg to sink some time into. Give it a shot if it looks interesting and you like the genre. I don’t think you’ll regret it too much.\n","February 11, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The combat system reminds me of king's bounty, or maybe Heroes of Might and Magic where your characters are on a hex grid and you move then attack/ability. It has the feel of a proper RPG though, with various attributes/skills/powers that have points put into them that are subsequently used in the fights. The out of combat system isn't as interactive as, say, fallout 3 or skyrim or something. It's almost exclusively chatboxes accompanying a thumbnail picture of the speaker while there is a static background image, like many JRPGs (especially back in the day), and there is a map with nodes on it to which you may travel but you don't run around freely looking for stuff. Personally I don't consider that a drawback per se but others might. I can't say for sure how much your choices effect the story because I'm too early in the game, but the element of your choices mattering seems to be there, for example *spoiler* there are twin brothers that want to kill each other and you can choose if or which one you help them kill and you fight different battles and get different rewards depending on which one you choose. It's a sidequest though so I'm not certain it's a big deal.\n\nAnyway great game!

Also since this is combat only they should at least have let you build all characters but no you can only build one, you are stuck with the rest of the team.\n\nThe layout is also in my opinion clunky and you can't rotate the map to get a better view, sometimes characters can be hard to see hidden behind objects on the map.\n\nI cannot recommend this game but if you are really in to the tactical combat part of roleplaying games and want a challenge give it a try.\n\n","September 16, 2015","false","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Anyways, I can't openly recommend this game though I will continue playing it and do enjoy aspects of it. It's a start over too many times kind of game. Sometimes the CTH (chance to hit) can frustrate you more than anything else. Because it's played tactical turn style this makes some battles painfully long, and some easy battles unneccsarily hard. I truly had a fight where luck jsut spit on my and I failed every spell, before writing this review actually, and I was killed by two wolves...eh.\nIt does get better, obviously as I said I will keep playing it. Nice feel, voice acting is ok, story is fine so far though nothing pushing the limits I feel it could move forward readily. I'm interested to see how strong I can make my characters and well I can customize them. Still, I can't recommend it.\nWhy?\nIt falls into a category of games where there are many options for you that are easier to pickup and just as customizable. If you've already played through a plethora of these titles you will then enjoy this as you're out of new stuff to do.

It's also a bit of an adjustment constantly preparing your ammo and healing your characters before each battle since they don't just regenerate fully or have unlimited ammo by themselves.

This is an easy game to get into but a hard game to master. Unlike many games of this genre, Blackguards is very unforgiving and will teach you a solid lesson for every mistake you do. Every action, moves and attacks you do should not be taken lightly. Even if the odds appear in your favour, not using cover, trying to get an attack on every turn and forgetting to equip valuable potions and such will quickly turn your battle sour.\n\nWhile a bit frustrating at times, I rather find this game a lot of fun. For the few hours that I've played, the storyline isn't bad and the characters are interesting. This basically a straight to the point, no BS RPG. There's no running around a village 2 hours just for the scenery. You get somewhere, talk to the npcs, get quests and you're in battle.\n\nThe difficult battles are what keeps you hooked and satisfying.

(I had a 5% chance to hit a troll 7 hexes big...really? Or tried to cast a spell and had it fail 3 times with a 90% and then another 85% all in a row...which is about a 1 in a million chance I believe)  As well I at least disliked both the dialog and the leveling system which rather then letting you pick what you want if you do not go up in certain skills you will make the game impossible since there are no methods of leveling up other then the pre-set battles.  I tired with 4 different setup and every time(sometimes sooner then others) ran into a just stupidly setup battle where I would have selected a much different skill set then I had.\n\nI did end up not playing this game much but unless it takes off(always a possibility) it seems that you are just meandering through life without much direction other then random people giving you quests that I mean go to X and have a battle...no real interesting battles other then some I get to run through enemies with everyone killing me in a time limit or press a button causing some other random thing to happen that I feel was just put there to make the battle go on longer rather then for flavor.\n\nI am sure there are plenty of people who like this game but I just don't see why I would play this when there are so many better games out there even in this genre then this.\n","September 7, 2014","false","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was expecting it to be primarily centered around hex-grid combat. I knew this and dived in - I love games like HoMM and Kings Bounty. Other reviews have mentioned that the game is essentially battle to battle, with a few static village screens thrown in to try and create a background. Even so, I was expecting so much more. Everything in the game seems to have been implemented with the minimum amount of thought. There are relatively few upgradable skills and I found it fairly easy to just divide skill groups between party members and max them out fairly early in the game. Other reviewers have mentioned difficulty spikes in certain battles and this is occassionally true - some of the early battles are harder than the 'legendary' arena battles you have to overcome later on.\n\nActually, one of the main sticking points for me was the distinct lack of equipment - or at least variety of equipment. If the game is going to be based entirely around battles, surely you should feel like winning is going to bring some great bounty, but in the end all you get is a pair of boots and 5 coins, or whatever. There aren't even any item conditions to mix things up (rusty swards, superior buckler, etc). The amount of XP you get after a battle seems to bear very little resemblence to its difficulty either. All of this leaves the game without any reason for you to be excited or want to carry on into the next battle (apart from the inherent addictiveness of turn-based RPG combat). You feel like maybe you should be progressing the story, but I also found the story boring for the most part, apart from a few of the cut-scene events. I recently bought the Baldurs Gate 2:EE and played for a few hours, the contrast in characterisation is ludicrous - straight away I was enjoying the quips and comments from party members - while the characters in Blackguards just aren't really memorable, I found myself interested at the beginning, but raply lost interest, either through poor writing or due to the incredibly slow pace of storytelling.\n\nOverall, I felt there weren't really any redeeming features for Blackguards - sure its graphically competent (although by no means pretty), sure the combat and strategy is acceptable (but by no means exciting or ground breaking in any way), sure the character concepts are interesting, but they just don't go anywhere. It's all a bit of a muddle really.","September 8, 2014","false","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Only 6 hours in doesn't make me an expert by any means, but 6 hours of frustration and boredom is enough for me.\n\nThe towm screens are all static,  with certain activities highlighted.  You can shop which doesn't take long as everything costs allot of coins and what the player gets on drops is insignificant.  Weapons drop and they are all inappropriate for the "basic" games preset skills.  For example, your warrior is proficient in single handed axes and the only bladed weapons that drop, initially, are swords.  So, in order to even hope to survive any of the battles you have to pump AP ( which are earned by combat and quests) into a weapon that you have found, rather than saving them for other talents.  Armor is virtually non existant as drops so you have no defense really.\n\nThere is virtually no game here other than scrounging for gear and combat.  Your path is pretty much preset with no real exploration and each location is either a static town or a combat grid.\n\nThe other really stupid mechanic is your starting companions.   You get a dwarf warrior that is pretty good and a mage that is as useful as a box of combs for a bald man.  Now if you choose a mage as your class, the party has great ranged dps ability and very weak melee.  If you chosse a warrior its the reverse and you are in even worse shape as the preset companion mage is useless.  When looking at the mages's stats, you wil see he has the best "ranged weapon" skills of the three.  He also has the most Astral Points ( mana ) of the three.  Yet when equipped with a ranged weapon like a bow he misses every time.  His casting skills are not bad but the only really good spell is an AoE fire attack that does little or no damage and uses up all his mana in 3 turns.  Oh, your mana regens at the alarming rate of 1 to 2 points every 5 turns.  You are long dead by then as a mage can't wear armor, has little or no melee skills and now cant use magic.\n\nCasting is a thrill, the effects are nice especially the failures which occur more than 50% of the time and the melee companion will miss 80% of the time on the only attack that does decent damage and the attack that has a high chance of hitting does insigificant damage.\n\nNow I know that any starting party is releatively weak and there is an expected number of failures in any combat until the combat system is learned.  However, the punishment vs reward system in this game crucifies a new party.\n\nThe typical battle has the odds at 3 or 4 enemies to 1, so you have 3 party members that miss and fizzle spells most of the time with no armor and medocre weapons against 6 or more enemies that miss maybe 1 in 10 times.  Your mana is used up pretty quick and the regen might let you cast one 10 pt heal just before the 3 enemies around you hit for 10 pts of damage each.\n\nThere was one battle in a cave of sorts, the 30 odd enemies were seperated from the party by twisting tunnels, but you can see them, so you know what is up a ahead.  After killing the 1st batch of enemies, about 10, I got to sit there mindlessly pressing the space bar until our mana regenerated enough to heal.  Yes heal pots, well they are  very dear, almost never drop and best saved for combat.   After healing the party I sat there pressing space bar for another 40 turns to regen enough mana to move forward and take on the next batch of enemies.  Needless to say that aside from the very deep skill system this game is visually boring and the combat is more so.\n\nQuite a few words come to mind for this game:  Dark, Dismal, Uninspirering, Frustrating, Boring.  It seems that the publisher is punishing the player for being stupid enough to actually give them money for the priviledge of being bored!\n\nBlackguards is the sort of game that if you had a choice of getting a root canal or playing the game, you'd rush to your dentist with a smile on your face rather than load this game up!\n\nI may get back into it, but there is no desire to spend many hours in this mess as there are other more rewarding games out there.","September 29, 2014","false","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will be stuck with a pre-determined 'party', with pre-determined skillsets, there is no 'designing a party'.\n\n2. The story is predictable, you loose your memory and gotta figure out what you forgot...\n\n3. The 'dialogue/charisma' options  while changing minor things are so few and far between there is almost no reason to do anything but SMASH and kill everything.\n\n4. Mages can't learn new skills until you purchase books for them (which are extremely expensive, so you won't learn any new magics till mid-late game.) While I am on the topic of mages there is a checkbox at the start of the game which effective says 'magic abillity' if you select that, you get mana and can be a mage- otherwise you'll never have that option.\n\n5. The skill tree is the same for everyone, so your sword wielding guy will go into swords and use the same 1-3 skills the entire game. (but will have extra points so he can get the same skills as your... archer!)\n\nIf you haven't decided to quickly run away from this game yet, there are more 'great' things about this game I can only hope you never find out. The ending is as bad as you think its going to be about half way through (and its almost 100% predictible from the start...).\n\nIf you haven't fled by now, you either love torture or your so dense this game might be for you (join the other <7% that have played through more than half of this game...).\n\nIf you want a game like this, go play Dragon Age I or II, Divinity (for gods sake its way better), or pretty much any other turn based RPG game.","September 13, 2014","false","54.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am a big fan of D&D and have played more RPGs than I can count.  I am also a huge fan on XCOM and that style of strategy so this looked like a match made in game heaven.\n\nAlas it was not to be though.  Here is the good the bad and the ugly.\n\nGood:\n- Graphics are wonderful.\n- Voice acting is top-notch.\n- There "appears" to be a lot of character customizations.\n\nBad:\n- Storyline beats you up in the second chapter and you lose your "investment" arbitrarily.  Sad really.\n- There really is a lack of "strategy" as you are at the whim of roll of the dice.  Not XCOM calibre, not even close.\n- $39.99?  I got is pre-release cheap.  Save your money it isn't worth that much.\n\n\nUgly:\n- XCOM style strategy doesn't play as such.  Random roll really makes this a flawed game.  You can employ the exact same strategy move for move and breeze through a level, and other times get decimated.\n- There is no place to "grind" it out to build up your characters if you are so willing to do so.  Early in the game you will find yourself redoing levels because you got a bad roll and you haven't enough Ducats (money) to do what you need.\n- Some levels (first one) become closed the moment you go to another map.  There is no turning back until later.  A big map, but very linear and very unforgiving.\n\nYou have to REALLY love D&D style play to get into this game.  It will take a while to get used to, and even longer to become skilled at this game.  It feels more like work and less like fun.\n\nI would not buy this game again.","February 5, 2014","false","93.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Based on this price I think Blackguards is definitely worth it. The full price of £29.99 is however WAY off the mark for the amount of game you get (hint: not much)\n\nDespite me finishing the game in 40 hours, it is a very combat focused where pretty much every event you’ll encounter will be a fight. Whilst this is fun to begin with, as a lot of battle maps are quite interesting, after 20 odd hours it just got tiresome. After every cut scene, conversation, exploration, etc I knew I would be fighting something. So you can imagine my utter delight when after defeating the final boss, the final cut-scene was just that a cut-scene!\n\nOutside of combat there is unfortunately very little to the game, hence I only recommend it at a steep discount. There is no exploration to speak off, the town screens are static and the story kind of gets lots amongst 180 fight scenes you’ll have to slog through.\n\nI also have a few gripes about the story, but these could just be personal preferences. For example, I don’t see how this is a “dark” story as it seems very much like any other RPG where you-are-our-only-hope-to-save-the-world story (spoiler: you save it). Also this games is called Blackguards and makes the point of your character being an outlaw. I was picturing more of a vagabond, a mercenary on the run, or some petty thief down and on his luck. What I wasn’t expecting however was for my character to be buddies with a PRINCES whilst chilling at a home of a COUNT in the first “memory” cutscene. Less of a BlackGuard, more of a Brodude! Also in this game you have no meaningful choice – it really just railroads you along the main story-line with some side-quests where you have a choice between killing guy A or guy B... with no impact on main story-line.\n\nA lot of negative reviews about this game are regarding the dodgy RNG, and whilst I have encountered some odd miss on a 95% chance, I have never experienced a 3 in a row miss. If you read the manual and understand how the rules work. The % you see isn’t the % to inflict damage, but rather to do an action, then the enemy gets a couple of saving rolls – parry / dodge. So you might have successfully rolled an action, but then the enemy might have rolled a saving throw and so all you see is your guy missing or spell fizzing out.","May 13, 2015","true","40.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I really enjoyed the first chapter of this game, the combat and the class system seemed rich. But the game really starts to go downhill from there. There really aren't a whole lot of choices to how to build your characters and the combat gets really easy after the first chapter. To be honest after the second chapter of the game it felt like they weren't putting the same amount of effort into the game at all. Many of the fights are very similar and the game basically becomes a grindfest to finish it, it practically plays itself. During the first chapter it seemed like they put effort into every sidequest. I still recommend this game if this is your sort of thing but it isn't without it's problems. I would also like to point out that many of the achivments are broken and rarely register. Also the story which seems like it might be cool at first starts to go downhill pretty fast and will seem pretty silly to most players. Overall I'd say if your willing to overlook this games flaws you won't regret this purchace but definitly don't buy this game for it's full price, wait for a decent sale.

Blackguards is a hex turn based rpg type game, with much less of the traditional rpg feel and much more of the board game elements. As a genre, it’s not my cup of tea but I can see why people enjoy the thoughtful strategy of it.\n\nPlaying Blackguards felt sort of like playing a chess match over and over again with the outcome being nearly entirely based on luck. Perhaps it boils down to the visuals not being all that visceral, but even things like positioning relative to the enemy seems to have no effect on combat outcomes. In the hour and a halfish I played I did little more than click on enemies and wait to either win or have to reload. It was as if the game was trying to distance itself from me.\n\nDefinitely not a recommendation on any of my lists; if I wanted a strategic RPG I’d reinstall Neverwinter Nights, if I wanted a board game I’d find a free online chess game.","November 25, 2014","false","1.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It feels like a solid title through and through and it has hours of fun and enjoyment in it where you will be redoing battles over and over until you find the right strategy for them and beat them easily. This is definitely a challenging game with a lot of good sides to it, but it has one major flaw, and that is that it is far from complete and full of game-ending bugs. Expect to go somewhere and not being able to play if you make that choice because the game will crash if you make that certain turn, if you were lucky you had savegames prior to that choice, if not - then you have to start all over again.\n\nBy game-breaking bugs I mean that when you reach a certain location, the game will just crash every single time you go there. Reloading the game won't help, it will continuously crash and if you had an old savegame you can get around it, otherwise you are screwed until they either fix it, or you move on to another game, alternatively give this game another try and remember what choice you made that led to the crashing.\n\nUnfortunately this is a dealbreaker for me, and while I did have a lot of fun, I didn't get to experience the game as I played it, and I refuse to go back to change how I played just because the game is unfinished. Supposedly it's going to be done this autumn, but I doubt there will be much more development on this title, they've been releasing a DLC for it already, and announced a sequel, which is underway. It's a pity that a title that has such great core mechanics get ruined in the details, but such is the way right now.\n\nIt is quite possible that you do not run into these bugs, and have an excellent experience, but keep in mind, you might end up like me.\n\n","June 29, 2014","false","13.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The biggest problem is that the harder settings make experience points go down and the mission harder...  breaking the standard expectation of harder missions and more experience that I wanted.  I don't want to go through on uber hard mode and end up with a nerfed character.\n\nI suppose the other problem, and if you're thinking balancing trouble is the deal with the criticism, I know, I've thought of that, the problem is that you're pigeon holed into one kind of min/max or maybe two if you want to beat the game on hard.  This, to me, is not acceptable, lol.\n\nBut, also, not that the difficulty setting thing means that, when you finally have to switch back to normal to kill the gators with your incorrectly min/maxed character build, you might have to make the disgusting decision to set it to easy...  which I know a lot of gamers like me just cannot fathom, lol.\n\nI suppose this brings me to another failure of modern gaming...  it's not like and can grind out another level in the middle of the story, which I would love to do rather than abandon my character... but why nerf my powers when I have it on hard, really...","March 2","false","306.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I recommend this game if you like turn-based tactical RPG's. Overall the game is a fun experience. The biggest aspect of this game is gameplay and story. Other strengths such as atmosphere and tone create a nice world. Great soundtrack as well.\n\nCouple things to point out. The world map movement is point and click/adventure, which I did not expect to enjoy so much at first. This creates a little slower pacing then I am used to in other RPG's. Just kick back and relax during world map movement and you'll learn to enjoy it.\n\nCustomization can be a "gift or a curse," depending on your personality. Personally, the party customization screens were cumbersome and confusing for the first 5-8 hours. If you get overwhelemed at charcter customization screen, I recommend going with the default builds, or research other builds online for direction. Try not to waste allocating points until you decide on a main build. By the end of Chapter 1 you can handle all of the customization options though. If you love stats and numbers, you will no doubt enjoy the customization. Sometimes battles take party-management prep work before you engage.\n\nOverall the game is a good experience and I recommend it if you enjoy turn-based RPG's. Great story involvment. The game has a slower pacing, but this is not a bad thing.

You will come to love most of the characters. The dialogues are simply amazing. Your party members are exactly what you expect your most extreme type of role-playing friends to be during a sesstion of a tabletop game like DnD.\n\n"I AM A MAGICIAN OF LOVE. I WILL SEDUCE EVERYONE!" and then you get into battle because he fails all of his seduction.\n\nEveryone takes it to the extreme. One is hella dumb, funny and racist toward the elves. Another is just always sarcastic and mean most of the time.\n\nThat covers most of the story telling. Let's get into the gameplay.\n\nTHE\nDARN\nTHING\nWILL\nTRY TO BREAK YOU.\n\nThe hex-based map is great.\nThe game using the "automated diceroll" system as if you were playing an actual table top is great.\nProblem though is that the other side cheats way too often for you to really enjoy the combat.\nSomes of them are insanely easy.\nAnd the next one is just demanding you to either get the spell to work on a 50% rate at the start of the turn with the follow up attack from your friends hitting everything on the first turn or you might as well retry the battle.\n\nAnd to make it worse. Everything, except for some of the weak fodders, are either as strong as you or much stronger than you. It's funny the first few time you see a lizardman sniping your team with a javelin better than your archer can shoot someone with his bow but after about 2 to 3 hits, it stops being funny because they deal much more damage than you do and even has additional effects until you manage to get to a certain point where you can finally learn your cheap spamming moves too just to destroy everything.\n\nAnd "HARD" mode isn't even hard. It's just frustrating and cheating. Usually, in a strategy game, repeating the same failed strategy oftens lead to the same fail result. However, in Blackguards, repeating the same strategy is what you do until you finally roll enough damage and hit rate to actually carry out that strategy, and that the environment isn't messing with you.\n\nRNG governs everything. Mobs are predictable but overstat as heck that they will deal your critical-like damage on a normal hit so you just have to retry over and over until the 35% hit rate on them actually miss instead of hitting 3 times in a row while your 90-95% are still missing over and over, or dealing minimal damage when it actually hits, leaving the mobs with 1 hp.\n\nBecause this game offers no between-combat regen so sometime, delaying a battle to 60 turns + is necessary although you can end it in 7. It wasn't challenging. It was just the game forcing me to repeat the "Whole map kite" for the next 10 minutes just to full heal the whole team. At normal or so, this isn't always necessary. I can try with 75% health and mana on the next map. On hard? You better be full or you might as well restart the whole battle chain.\n\nBut that's really the annoying part and it can easily be somewhat remedied by just setting the mode to "Normal" unless you're ready to go through pointless self-torture that makes you want to ragequit because of a single crit or a slip on an overstat mob forcing an instaretry. Other than that, I see nothing wrong with this game. People often makes fun of the voice acting but it's only horrible on the trailer. The in-game voice acting is so much better and really fit the situation when the characters are trying to be mean or sarcasting, which isn't really something you can see on the trailer.\n\nI also recommend getting the big pack. The artbook is simply amazing.","December 25, 2014","true","41.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Some nodes are cities where you may learn skills, buy equipment, and get/perform quests, other nodes are quest nodes that may sometimes be skipped. Most of the time is however spent in  hexagon based maps fighting various bad guys.\n\nThe game has a lot of skills and stats that you may experiment with, but mostly it makes little difference what you chose to skill up (For spells any nuke will do, some early bosses are weak to fire, but it makes little difference for most enemies, a healing spell is pretty much required, you will alternate between those two and auto attacks for the whole game), and as most stats and skills are needed in the end anyway the customization adds little depth to a shallow game.\n\nThe major problem with Blackguards is that fights are mostly based on luck. Want to attack someone? Well, usually you have a 90% chance to hit (not bad, but that's as good as it gets unless someone is knocked down), but if you use a more powerful attack it might drop down to 85%, 70%, or 60% (based on dodge stat vs dexterity I think), further reduced with wounds that are randomly obtained when taking damage (I think your to hit chance can potentially go all the way down to 30%). If you manage to hit at all the damage dealt is then further randomed in a fairly large spread, and rarely it will crit for double damage. The damage is fairly high, so 3-4 good attacks is enough to drop most enemies and heroes.\nThis means that missing more than a few attacks will result in one of your heroes getting knocked unconscious, and the enemies snowball from there.\nIt's typically the enemies who get the good dodge stats, so while your heroes will mostly take full damage from anything that attacks them late game, your heroes will miss, miss, miss,miss, and miss some more as you watch them slowly die in frustration.\n\nThe game's "difficulty" slowly ramps up as you play. Every encounter is level (in)appropriate, so every fight is a challenge. Since spell damage is fixed your magic users slowly get weaker after their 2 main spells hit level 3. While this makes sense in a way you will never get to be satisfied with how much stronger your heroes have gotten. Enemies have about the same stats and skills and do about as much damage as the heroes do, so fights vary little in practise between various encounters.\n\nThe game could still be a mildly enjoyable grind with the above mentioned issues, but clearly the devs were obsessed with making the game into a never ending series of encounters by a power tripping DM trying to make your party lose.\nI got through several unfair fights like Running past all the enemies who get to hit you for free for 6 turns to get to the girl before she's killed, shoot a giant tree with 150 hp to death with arrows that each do 1 dmg because it 2 shots everything in melee range, run through a basement filled with traps to get to the guy you need to kill before he gets away, kill the necromancer who's surrounded by unkillalbe skeletons that block your spells and arrows, and many many more. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the fight against the tiger lilly where one of your heroes is turned against you, you have to run up to a plant that always has a 60% hit chance, is immune to magic damage, every turn one of your heroes is knocked down, and 5-6 tentacles you're not supposed to kill get to attack your heroes freely while blocking off healing spells you might want to cast on the hero being bullied.\nI understand that something like this was necessary to make the game interesting, as the fights by themselves clearly aren't. With a different combat system these fights might have been fun, but in Blackguards you will just keep doing the right thing again and again untill it finally works and you get to go on.\n\nSo, TL;DR: Turn based fights heavily based on luck, little customization in practise despite the wealth of options available, you get weaker as you keep on playing, and gimmicky fights where the devs metaphorically throw your miss chance and weakness in your face again and again by setting up scenarios that force you into doing stupid things over and over untill the RNG gods decide that you may finally pass. If it sounds like your cup of tea then you will probably enjoy Blackguards, but I did not.","January 1, 2015","false","33.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049245659/recommended/249650/","76561198049245659","Cubano","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049245659/","136 products in account","Blackguards is an tactical turn-based RPG game that brings some new soultions and points of view to the table, that are not always good.\n\n(New feature - Simple city interface.)\nIf you remember Drakensang, Dragon Age or most other RPGs cities, large, vast, many NPCs, a lot of chests to look and barrels to smash for loot. Nothing like that in Blackguards. City is a simple one screen view with most important NPCs, merchant, healer, trainer, quest giver, tavern, the end. If you have business in the city it takes you about a minute to get it done and leave to get back to action. Some might like it, some might not. I like it, as it saves time, no more need to remember where was that cool merchant or a hidden pass etc.\n\nSo you may wonder how does this tactical turn base combat looks like.\n(Character summary)\nBefore we get there you must know that Blackguards are based on The Dark Eye RPG pen and paper system. And character development is very much like in the pen and paper game. If you played Drakensangs before you will be very familiar with the system.\nIn most RPG games you have classes to select. There are no classes in this game. When creating character you select if you wanna be spell-casting able or not and then you build character on skills/spells you chose. In that this system is similar to Elder Scrolls. If you wanna be a warrior you can be a warrior, if you wanna be a warrior-priest you can be warrior-priest it's all based on how to chose your skills, not limited by class.\nSo characters have attribiutes that calculate their base stats like vitality, astral points (manna), base attack, dodge and parry. Attriubutes cost a lot of adventure points to raise. By chosing how to spend attribiutes you craft base for your character, if you invest heavy into strength, agility, courage and constitiution you will end up with a fighter with almost no chance to cast any spell. If you go for intuition, cleverness and charisma you will end up with solid base for mage with poor fighting abilities. You can also walk the path of average, but you must be careful and just select few spells and weapons to invest in those heavy.\nKeep in mind that mages are limited by metalic armor - they will not regenerate astral points while wearing even a single piece of it and will have negative casting modifier, so a melee mage is a hard to play, but possible with correct spell investment.\nThen are the skills. Skills are divided into weapons, talents (perception, traps etc) and spells. And in that game every weapon is another skills, so if your character is an expert swordsman (18 swordsmanship skill), when he will be forced to use an axe, he will be very poor with ti because he has no skill in axe, he will have very small chance to hit and large to be hit by enemies.\nSkills make your characters use stuff. Skills are rated from 0-18. Spells and talents unlock bonusses at 8,13,18 levels. Here you choce which spells your character can cast and weapons to use.\nAt the end are special abilities - special attacks for melees, ranged and boosts for mages.\nThe better the special attack the harder it is to hit with it.\nOriginal pen and paper game used three 20 side dices for skill tests, to make it computer game, devs changed that into % chance. So unlike dragon age it is not enough to unlock a spell to cast it, you must unlock the spell and invest points into it.\n(Note on spells)\nFor me spells in this game are net design to be used mainly at blunt offensive magic. Spells play a support role in this game. You can cast offensive spells and they will do a lot of damage, however doing so will deplete your astral points in two shots so after your mage will not be able to do anything else than bash stuff with his staff.\n(Note on weapons)\nI really love games which make using axe different than using a sword for example. Blackguards is such a game.Every weapon type has it damage type (piercing for spears and fancing weapons, slashing for swords and blunt for maces). Every weapon type also uses a different skill. So if you wanna use few different weapons you must spend points on different skills. Different weapons also have different special attacks, you cannot make armor ignoring attack with maces, but you can make attack that tripples the damage with them.\n\n(Combat)\nHaving explained the above. Combat is turn based in which your heros and enemies take their turns in order of initiative. On their turn everyone can move a little and make action (attack, cast spell, place trap, disarm trap, spot for traps, use item etc) or move further. You can hide behind objects or other heros to break line of sights of enemy archers to your mages as well, there is no other cover system.\nCombat map is divided into small hexes for movement and there can be varius hazard spaces on the map like oil set on fire will deal you fire damage when you cross it, while mud can make your character fall down unless he passes bosy control test.\n(Tactical combat)\nBy using combination on magic and physical attacks you must cripple and defeat enemies. Enemies will usually outnumber you as well and some of them will also cast spells, use healing potions and have special attacks. So this is where tactic comes into place.\nUse your melees to block enemies before they reach your mages, or run to enemy mage to bash on him. Use obejects on the map and magic walls to block enemy movement and shoot them directly. You have options.\nCast damage spells to finish fight quickly, or same astral points for buffing and healing magic.\n\n(Plot - Story)\nUnfortunately game story is quite linear and not really involving. Characters are a bit shallow and the only one who really feels realistic is the dwarf who is fun and really combat oriented.\nAt few points in the game you will be stripped of your gear and forced to make through with given equipment untill you can regain your stuff. So it is goot to invest a little into maces(as you will usually end up fighting with a torch or a club) and offensive magic.\n\n(Flaws)\nThere are some flaws to the game:\n-Horrible mouth work. Unlike other modern games, the speaking animations here are just horrible, you will see heros open mouth like fish trying to catch a breath, it has no connectiong with what is being spoken.\n-Very bad equipment comparison system. There is no way to compare one set of armor with another other than noting down the stats, changing set and seeing new stats.\n-I have really no idea what in this game make it be 20gb large.\n-Game does little to introduce players who are new to the difficult character creating and developemtn system. [there is good help&tips in the menu if you can spend a moment to read and understand it]\n-Not involving plot and shallow characters.\n-Not intuitive UI.\n-No crafting system.\n\n(Merits)\n+Realistic when it comes to weapons and armors. Armors comes in sets, so it is no longer find best pieces, but you need to wear a complete set of armor to have best benefits. And I like it that way.\n+Deep and difficult tactical combat. I like the games that are not easy.\n+Quick cities exploration.\n+You are not limited when crafting your heros, you have a lot of freedom in systems without classes.\n\nOverall I would give this game 7/10.\nI hope most of the flaws will be corrected in the upcomming Blackguards 2.","January 6, 2015","true","47.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Alas, I ended up quite frustrated with a few aspects that are quite game (and immersion) breaking:\n1. losing vital companions at crucial times makes party build options very limited. Essentially, once you figure out what will happen to X, you need to rethink your entire strategy for party build. This sometimes means restarting from scratch, or a very earlier save, as party build is very important in some of the encounters (especially the main ones)\n2. lack of clothing for non-metal wearing characters - while there are several pretty good sets of armour for warriors, the (complete) lack of mage oriented outfits is a bit mind baffling. I could not fathom that no mage outfits EVER dropped, although you battle many mages wearing unique outfits. And none can be bought. As a consequence, you mage characters have to either wear horrible looking leather armour, or spend a lot of time buffing/running/dying. This is also important for...\n3. almost 100% spell failure when wearing metal armour. I can accept offensive spells (cast outward) failing, but having a healing/self-buff spell have a <25% of success is nonsense. So playing as a battle mage/arcane warrior/cleric type role is pretty much out of the question\n4. tedious battles - which can go on for a long time, with a lot of time sitting, and staring at the screen while seemingly endless hordes of critters/monsters/lice/etc. go thought their turns. Even tentacles get their own turns, and usually have a higher initiative than your party...\n5. endgame decision disasters - going back to #1 - at the end game you find out that you are 'supposed to' have made certain vital conversation decisions with one companion, otherwise they will be lost, which as mentioned before, can be a disaster for the party.\n\nSo, if you want to play this:\na) read the guides and build a cooky cutter type that the developers had in mind, and\nb) follow a pro-forma discussion template to placate one party member, or lose them at a crucial stage (or build with their loss in mind)\nc) have a good book/magazine handy to read during battles, as you otherwise stare at the screen waiting endlessly\n\nPity, had potential","January 6, 2015","false","94.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Some nodes are cities where you may learn skills, buy equipment, and get/perform quests, other nodes are quest nodes that may sometimes be skipped. Most of the time is however spent in  hexagon based maps fighting various bad guys.\n\nThe game has a lot of skills and stats that you may experiment with, but mostly it makes little difference what you chose to skill up (For spells any nuke will do, some early bosses are weak to fire, but it makes little difference for most enemies, a healing spell is pretty much required, you will alternate between those two and auto attacks for the whole game), and as most stats and skills are needed in the end anyway the customization adds little depth to a shallow game.\n\nThe major problem with Blackguards is that fights are mostly based on luck. Want to attack someone? Well, usually you have a 90% chance to hit (not bad, but that's as good as it gets unless someone is knocked down), but if you use a more powerful attack it might drop down to 85%, 70%, or 60% (based on dodge stat vs dexterity I think), further reduced with wounds that are randomly obtained when taking damage (I think your to hit chance can potentially go all the way down to 30%). If you manage to hit at all the damage dealt is then further randomed in a fairly large spread, and rarely it will crit for double damage. The damage is fairly high, so 3-4 good attacks is enough to drop most enemies and heroes.\nThis means that missing more than a few attacks will result in one of your heroes getting knocked unconscious, and the enemies snowball from there.\nIt's typically the enemies who get the good dodge stats, so while your heroes will mostly take full damage from anything that attacks them late game, your heroes will miss, miss, miss,miss, and miss some more as you watch them slowly die in frustration.\n\nThe game's "difficulty" slowly ramps up as you play. Every encounter is level (in)appropriate, so every fight is a challenge. Since spell damage is fixed your magic users slowly get weaker after their 2 main spells hit level 3. While this makes sense in a way you will never get to be satisfied with how much stronger your heroes have gotten. Enemies have about the same stats and skills and do about as much damage as the heroes do, so fights vary little in practise between various encounters.\n\nThe game could still be a mildly enjoyable grind with the above mentioned issues, but clearly the devs were obsessed with making the game into a never ending series of encounters by a power tripping DM trying to make your party lose.\nI got through several unfair fights like Running past all the enemies who get to hit you for free for 6 turns to get to the girl before she's killed, shoot a giant tree with 150 hp to death with arrows that each do 1 dmg because it 2 shots everything in melee range, run through a basement filled with traps to get to the guy you need to kill before he gets away, kill the necromancer who's surrounded by unkillalbe skeletons that block your spells and arrows, and many many more. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the fight against the tiger lilly where one of your heroes is turned against you, you have to run up to a plant that always has a 60% hit chance, is immune to magic damage, every turn one of your heroes is knocked down, and 5-6 tentacles you're not supposed to kill get to attack your heroes freely while blocking off healing spells you might want to cast on the hero being bullied.\nI understand that something like this was necessary to make the game interesting, as the fights by themselves clearly aren't. With a different combat system these fights might have been fun, but in Blackguards you will just keep doing the right thing again and again untill it finally works and you get to go on.\n\nSo, TL;DR: Turn based fights heavily based on luck, little customization in practise despite the wealth of options available, you get weaker as you keep on playing, and gimmicky fights where the devs metaphorically throw your miss chance and weakness in your face again and again by setting up scenarios that force you into doing stupid things over and over untill the RNG gods decide that you may finally pass. If it sounds like your cup of tea then you will probably enjoy Blackguards, but I did not.","January 1, 2015","false","33.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Can take several turns just to do a few damage to a target with as much HP as you.\n\nBattles are made difficult by swamping you with enemies, given the drawn out nature of tying to do any damage to enemies this can lead to really long, fustrating fights.\n\nIt is difficult, which is a good thing, but difficult because of the RNG system and the fact that you will be outnumbered several times over or forced to do multiple fights with no chance to rest.  Healing potions and mana potions are over priced.  Weapons are over priced and there is little variety.  Armor is so over priced i assume you need to go back to some of the starting towns once you are deep in game to afford nominal upgrades.\n\nBasically its 3 of you vs 5-20 enemies of equal strength.  Majority of combat is spent whiffing shots, fizzling magic, and doing low to no damage.  RNG tends to ensure that vital heal on a tank fizzles several times in a row.  One lost character is losing the battle in the end, have fun restarting that 40minuet drawn out battle.\n\nIts not an awful game, just a huige missed oppertuinty.

The biggest problem is that the harder settings make experience points go down and the mission harder...  breaking the standard expectation of harder missions and more experience that I wanted.  I don't want to go through on uber hard mode and end up with a nerfed character.\n\nI suppose the other problem, and if you're thinking balancing trouble is the deal with the criticism, I know, I've thought of that, the problem is that you're pigeon holed into one kind of min/max or maybe two if you want to beat the game on hard.  This, to me, is not acceptable, lol.\n\nBut, also, not that the difficulty setting thing means that, when you finally have to switch back to normal to kill the gators with your incorrectly min/maxed character build, you might have to make the disgusting decision to set it to easy...  which I know a lot of gamers like me just cannot fathom, lol.\n\nI suppose this brings me to another failure of modern gaming...  it's not like and can grind out another level in the middle of the story, which I would love to do rather than abandon my character... but why nerf my powers when I have it on hard, really...","March 2","false","306.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It is a good looking game.  I like the character development, except the trainer availability.\n","June 28, 2014","false","84.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I had been playing for over 2 hours (8+ combat missions) before I got a couple of the tips on how to do basic things.\n*Horrible camera system.  Unable to rotate the camera, forcing you to revert to top down view in many areas just to be able to see the hex map behind objects/allies/enemies.\n*No resource regeneration out of combat.  You can camp to restore Health and Astral points, which isn't bad, but when you hit one of the first major fight areas, you are prevented from camping.  You are forced to use town healers to restore HP out of combat, even if you have 2 mages with healing in your party.  No Astral Point (mana) regeneration outside of combat, even with talents that grant passive Astral Regen per turn, forcing you to use your very expensive Astral Potions to be able to actually use a mage character.\n*Treating injuries with bandages has a chance to fail (very high chance) outside of combat, and almost useless to try in combat (6% chance of success at first rank).\n*You are forced to buy belts to be able to carry many items into combat with you, but you are encumbered in combat by ALL the equipment in your bags, even you quest items and camping resources.\n*Almost no income, with horribly high priced item.  At one point, you are given a large amount of money and told to go to the armorer to get equiped to help defend a town.  The armorer has 1 type of armor, 2 sets of it, and you are given enough to buy 1 piece of equipment.  Not a set, 1 piece.  You have to choose between upgrading a single piece of heavy armor, or to buy Astral and Health potions.\n*Horrible UI.  Almost no explanations as to what means what, or as to how anything is calculated.  When comparing armor pieces, it does not compare piece to piece, only how it will change your whole, and armor/encumbrance always shows a penalty, even if it is an upgrade.\n*Horrible combat encounter design.  In many of the fights, all of the mobs will sit back throwing poisoned javelines at you, each of which hits your heavily armored character for 15-30% of his total HP, and also poisons him.  Was forced to use the fighter as a tank, both of my mages as pure healers, while slowly grinding down the mobs hp with my archer (arrows cost a lot, and have weight.  I overmaxed my encumbrance just from provisions, which you need to camp, and arrows alone).\n*Buff, healing and utility spells have default fail chance, which until you pick of a very very expensive talent, are almost impossible to cast (22% fail chance to heal an ally, 68% chance to fail to dispel a poison with a spell that only dispels poisons, 48% chance to fail to cast a "wall" spell, etc).  Combined with no innate astral regen, very low astral point pool and high astral point cost to cast makes playing a mage character feel like your being penalized for playing the game.","April 15, 2014","false","8.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This one really is. If you love turn based combat, with simple to learn rules but a lot of nuances, if losing a fight makes you want to play it better - this is a game for you. The story is simple but not bad, it progresses through dialogues as there is no actual exploration. But the whole point is developing your party and fighting cleverly designed fights. They require you to use terrain, positioning, traps and other tricks to survive. If by RPG you understand a game where you just click on an opponent - this game is not for you. Actually I would rather recommend this game to a strategy fan not an RPG one.\n\nEDIT> I am sad but I feel I have to change my recommendation to a negative one. While the game itself is great, I ran into a bug in a fight at the end of chapter 3. Basically the turn of one of AI characters (Manolo) never ends. Thus I can't complete this fight and progress with the game. I reported the bug 3 months ago and still nothing, only a generic automated response.","February 22, 2014","false","51.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Of course I need to state that I'm only on Chapter 2 at this point, so maybe that changes. Some battles have been easy enough, others have been challenging. There's been a few battles that I've had to retry but it's been a fun challenge, not a drain on my enjoyment of the game.\n\nSo far, I'm loving this game and have been looking forward to playing it as time permits. I started over 6 hours into the game to switch from a basic character to an expert (custom) character. Having become more familiar with the game, I wanted to be able to customize my character more.

Blackguard is long. Blackguard is fun.\nThe game forces you to utilize your envirounment on the maps of the different battles you will fight. The Mano a mano approach often leads to defeat or severe injurie. There's a lot of thinking, planning and retrying involved (when a strategy doesn't pan out), especially since you can only save before and after a battle, not during it. It's great though, makes the feeling of accomplishment that much stronger once you beat a battle while achieving all optional goals.\nThe length of the game is very refreshing. 40 hours can very well be exceeded, depending on how often you fail ;)\nAll said and donde, Blackguard is a real treat for all fans of tactical round based gaming. The story is kind of nice, but the gameplay is what kept me glued to this game for hours since I started.\n","December 28, 2013","true","61.9"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

The combat is from Heroes of Might and Magic.  Flat hex map walk towards each other and swing, over and over.  90% of the skills are useless (spend points on being able to see the hit chance of the guy I'm swinging at anyway, or spend points on +1 to hit), and the 3d20 skill system may be novel for the RPG this is based on but here it is just opaque and weird.   Going straight from battle to battle is actually a good thing, so don't fault it for not being the JRPG it is not.  But boring battles and boring equipment and boring skills in a Tactics game is a bad thing.

The battle system is pretty good, you have quite a few options during combat and the interactive battlefields add a layer of fun and somewhat fresh gameplay.\n\nMy primary gripe with Blackguards is the difficulty.  To say that Blackguards is a challenging game is an understatement, but I feel that the way that Blackguards challenges you is a bit contrived and ultimately kind of cheap.  I've played difficult games in which I've lost or barely won a battle and have walked away thinking "wow that was a good fight".  In Black Guards if I lose I usually feel like I've been robbed.  You constantly miss spells and attacks and the enemy constantly connects whether you're fighting a semi-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ goblin, a backstabbing rogue or a giant tree.  And the dire situations that you are placed in again and again suggest to me that you're not so much a group of badasses so much as you are really gullible and kind of incompetent.    The main character feels really generic.  Pretty much everyone or everything that you encounter seems better suited for combat than the protaganist.  And so far I don't feel like the four playable characters that I have encountered live up to the name Blackguards.  They actually seem like relatively nice guys.  When I saw the name Blackguards I got excited because I had assumed that I would be taking on the roles of the Lannisters from GOT.  Instead it feels more like I've signed on with the Partridge family.  I've only  played a few hours so far and I'm not giving up on the game entirely just yet, but that's mostly because of the price tag.  This is not a 40 dollar game and I would not recommend that anyone pay that much to play this.\n\nI work as a merchant sailor and I am literally stuck on a boat for the next month so I will be playing on.  If I get to a point in the gameplay in which I feel that my assesment was premature or unfair I will return to humbly apologize and I sincerely hope that, that happens.","February 7, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

I enjoyed the first chapter then it got a bit tedious , it seemed a game designed to make sure you had no fun. I love turn based tactical games and i dont think i've ever played one i didnt enjoy before.\n\ncharacter develpoment and advancemet is dreadful , worst of any RPG or CRPG i've ever played , It's so boring and mundane. There's an illusion of freedom but really you just stick to a few skills and spells that are clearly miles better , if you dont you end up with useless underpowered skills and characters.\n\nI think i am still using the same 1 skill with my melee and archer characters 10 hours into the game and the same 2 spells on my casters. There's just not enough variety to the game. In another 10 hours i probably be using the same 2 skills. Thats not enough depth for a tactical game or an RPG.\n\nAs an RPG it is without doubt poor but i expected that and assumed the tactical combat would make up for it , it didnt , the combat was worse than i expected and that is the reason i eventually got bored of clicking the same 2 buttons and stopped playing","June 25, 2014","false","9.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

This year is fortunately again fruitful for this style and is experiencing a minor revival. How, then turned one such RPG from relatively unknown Daedalic Entertainment?\n\nRight at the beginning, after selecting a new game in the menu, the player can choose either the simplified selection of attributes, or expert, according as it is familiar with the style board game The Dark Eye. In the selection of the division are three different professions, namely Warrior, Magician and Hunter. In addition, it is possible to choose from several preset face and sex. Already here, I have to criticize that particular types of female faces look sometimes very belligerent manner and at the same time from each other and a little different. Overall graphics page, especially dealing with details of the figure was weaker.\n\nThe second setting, ie expert player allows much more extensive treatment of the characters and follow the rules of points. Basically, a player has a choice to 10,000 points, labeled BD from which you can then has any assembly dream champion. At the outset, it must pay 500 if you want to have a magical character. After this selection opens a few talent trees, which can be additionally porozdeľovať points to a maximum of up to 14 properties, the talents and spells 8. However, while playing and later acquire new levels of these attributes can continue to accrue. Points can be reallocated in several areas, namely core values, Fighting talent, talents, spells, and finally special skills. It is important to all of these points divided as effectively as possible, because after creating new characters and the plot itself enters into all the remaining points are canceled.\n\nThe core values are called major modifiers in creating characters, namely strength, charisma etc., these in turn affect many elements such as the capacity of heroes, the number of lives, or the ability to communicate with the outside world and the characters in it. Between fighting talent then there are various weapons from daggers, crossbows over, after two-handed swords. By investing points into the player's weapons of course increases the attack or the defense of a given type of weapon, depending on how it is set. Among the talent is also possible to choose from nine different talents. For example, the ability of the trap, which allows the player to identify, considered, or even defuse traps or Ranhojičstvo, which in turn allows the player to heal from injuries. We walk the kids, which are of course only applicable if a player chooses a character magician. Spells are divided between the offensive and strengthening and debilitating. Found them quite a decent amount of fans and fiery, respectively. ice magic school here will surely enjoy. Finally, we get the special abilities, which are different upgrades for close combat, ranged or magic, or even passive abilities.\n\nEdit character is indeed fairly complex and enthusiasts making such tailor-made nature of certain very pleased. Conversely, players who want to jump into the story as soon as possible to be able to circumvent these adjustments using automatic reallocation of points in the selection of the games.\n\nWhether a player chooses to basic or expert mode, after completion of the selection starts intro and the player is familiar with the mysterious death of Princess Elanor. Here are gradually unveiled on different battle tactics such as moving figures after hexagonal boxes, or attacking. However, the main protagonists are caught in a stationary body guards pathetic Princess and cast him into prison. The initial steps of the story thus seek out of this place and the run will help the player and other figures rough dwarf Naurima and individually mage Zurbaran. Later, therefore, the player will control the widening of the characters, and it is therefore important to learn the capabilities and advantages make the most of the fight.\n\nIt should be noted that the combat encounters tend to be really hard sometimes, or vice versa, sometimes very simple. At times it can be unpredictable for the game, which depends on various calculations, attack, defense, and to recover the attack power of intervention, and the like. Another element is the very place where the fight takes place. You should be commended on one side of the creators, because these so-called arenas are interactive and can be, for example, to hide his magician for any obstacle from enemies and calmly zosielať healing spells at his comrades, or even drop, for example luster on unsuspecting opponents. On the other hand, sometimes these interactive game environment, they can do very easily, so will everyone else struggle and it's up to the player as will be careful to monitor the area in which the fight takes place and whether it will be able to benefit or not.\n\nAfter deliverance from prison pending player main story line, which is of course finding a clarification of the death of the Princess, in which the main character was involved already. Later, however, the procedure of the story in five different chapters player looks at different places of the world and in addition to the main storyline is of course possible to perform a secondary task, which can be obtained, for example, also visited cities around the world.\n\nAs regards the visual side of the game is not any graphical champion, but what should be on-screen instructions, it handles. The environments are quite varied and dark stomp the player gets to the green meadows, respectively. in different forests or cities. After zooming in, however, and examining the details of the characters come often unpleasant experience, which is especially noticeable when prestrihových animation. The game simply can not cope with these details, but I must say that in this type of RPG is not a graphics page and so important.\n\nAudio is contrary to the relatively high level of quality musical accompaniment and a good dubbing. The only thing you can criticize the common neprecítenie some situations Daberas (initial torture when choosing a female protagonist in the prison).\n\nBlackguards is certainly an interesting title and if you're a fan of tensile RPG, or even know the style of the game The Dark Eye, you will not be disappointed. For other players, the game offers many hours of tasks in an interesting world where the most important temporize and think through each move before the player how to fix it. Playing on the other hand suffers quick repetetívnosťou and certainly not for hotheads who like to do so and then they think. Through it all, however Blackguards among the titles above average and certainly have their supporters and fans found.","December 16, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's similar to point-and-click adventures of old. Let's you get to the story and/or combat quickly.\n\nCool level-up system. Characters really start to feel powerful at later levels.\n\nAttractive graphics and runs smoothly.\n\nNeat battle set-ups. Battles have traps, special objectives, secrets, and ambushes. There are a good number of straight up fights, but the set piece battles really spice things up.\n\nInteresting (but not completely original) story with an compelling (but really not original) cast. It keeps you interested enough to follow along rather than just clicking through the dialogs, and the cut-scenes are simple but well done.\n\nCons: I strongly recommend starting on "Easy" difficultly. This really feels like it should be the default and is best for first-time players. The mechanics of the game are a little obscure, and having one play-through under your belt is best. Easy offers a good challenge without being frustrating, and gives you freedom to explore the game.\n\nAgain, obscure mechanics and no way to respec makes the game progression rather unforgiving.\n\nSparse loot. Don't get me wrong, I think it is a nice chance of pace to have magic items actually be rare and not drop 11 times each battle, but it feels like the game is really stingy with the rewards. It does make the few items you get feel more special but, unfortunately, they're not even that much better than the standard ones you can buy.\n\nThe characters you get aren't very customizable in their roles. But they do what they do well.\n\nLow replayability. You could replay the game on a harder difficulty, but why? It's a long game and nothing is really randomized. It's not really much of a con though since the game is so long with lots of optional quests.","September 19, 2014","true","49.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Though it has a reasonable story, you might be disappointed if you're looking for an RPG. It isn't open world, there aren't many meaningful story choices for you to make, and there isn't much customization available for your character's appearance.)\n\nThe campaign is reasonably long, though the game doesn't feel repetitive thanks to reasonably varied fight scenarios and win-conditions. Early problems with bugged quests and translation issues from the original German seem mostly resolved at this point (I only noticed some spelling errors in the English version and had no problems with bugged quests.)\n\nCommon complaints about the game focus on numerous loading screens and an unintuitive UI. I found the UI fairly easy to pick up myself, only issuing incorrect commands once or twice. Though there are a lot of loading screens between scenarios, each one lasted only 1-3 seconds for me so they didn't detract from my experience. People playing on systems using HDDs rather than SSDs may find the loading screens take longer and so are more annoying, though.\n\nI was worried by the relatively low Metacritic score for this game, but I'm glad I wasn't deterred. If you like single-player, turn-based strategy games that put you in control of a small group of specialized combatants, you'll probably like this.","August 12, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For one, i do!\nThe combat is nicely done and obviously the strong point of the game - it works, and keeps you challenged (at least, up to now).\nThe graphics are nice, but a little too cartoon-ish for my taste (and for the atmosphere the game tries to create).\nThe story is good enough to carry you from chapter to chapter, although it's a little obvious in its twists.\n\nThere are obviously a few cons as well:\n- The biggest minus for me it's the inventory, and the way it works. You don't get a clear comparison between your equipped item and another one, in your pack or at a vendor - this alone makes choosing weapons a nuisance at later stages. The inventory also becomes cluttered extremely easy.\n- Also a minus is the auto saving system. The game makes it that, quite a few times, you have to fight battle after battle, without possibility of resting&healing. And the autosave saves as you enter a new battle. This means that, if you don't take extra care, you'll end up (it happened to me once) in a position i hate most in RPGs - making some bad decisions in a 3rd-in-a-row battle, i had no chance of winning the 4th. And the autosave was only for the 4th. So i had to restart not only the 3 battles before, but the whole branch of the chapter (a lot of dialogue and cinematics included) - and i hate remaking choices i already made, listening to the same lines over and over again etc. They should have made an auto save for each battle, and an autosave for entering a chain of events/battles - this way, you can restart the fights without restarting the story itself.\n\nAnyway, all in all, is a nice game (and i bought it during a sale) - so i give it 7.5/10.","August 13, 2014","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still needs some polish, but it is very impressive at its current stage. The characters, while not very deep during Chapter 1 (only chapter available yet, of 5), are still very fun and you get a good sense of their personalities through their dialogue and opinions on the situations. I see a lot of potential with this game. The combat can be a little shallow at the moment, ending up with just moving across the battlefields and attacking/healing as necessary, but I also have not acquired many of the bountiful skills available. Plenty of skills available, but the game does not hold your hand; acquiring and saving the necessary points is definitely part of the challenge and not unwelcome. While it definitely isn't paced to have you being dragonslayers within the first few hours, it isn't overly difficult either. A few battles required multiple tries from me, but only because I was trying to reach bonus objectives in the alloted time. I've burnt through other SRPGs and got bored within the first few hours of playing, but this game has just enough flavor and interest to keep me coming back to the well for more. It is not a AAA title by any means, but an impressive soundtrack, very believable voice-acting and dialogue, and earnest, hard work prove to be more than any flash and bang a mainstream title would use.

I wouldn't recommend it based off of my standards for games but others might still find it enjoyable.\n\nCons\nTerrible story ( Confusing, presents a lot of questions but gives few answers. Main character seems like a loser)\nFlat characters, characters seem to blurt out whatever is in their head instead of talking to each other\nPlot twists are in poor taste (They come of as 'we did this to you because we can')\nSomewhat steep learning curve when it comes to training your characters\nWeapon system seems biased in the sense that there is little to no benefit to pick x over y in any scenerio\nGame consistantly pushes you back to square one by taking your gear/characters away from you and forcing you to fight at a severe disadvantage\n\nPros\nCharacters are customizable in their fighting style, although non mages have a limited non passive special talent selection.\nDifficult (although for the wrong reasons imo)\nTactical turnbased game\nBug free from what I have seen.\n\nIf you are a diehard fan of tactical turn based games and do not care about story elements then this game might interest you.

I really wanted to like it, but it just does so many things just wrong. Everything is ridiculously expensive, there is zero immersion.

Still stuck with the crappy torches! And still can't afford 1 crappy hand axe, which the game seems to value at 13 gold! These developers are clueless at both medieval history and game balance (a hand axe would NEVER cost anywhere that much) !  Oh, and then the game wants to kill gigantic troll with your crap weapons! It's like the game is trolling you! I didn't even mention that almost everything to do in this game can just fail as it does nothing and waste your turn. It seems the way the developers want you to  get through this game is to save scum your way through, just hope you hit the all the monsters all the time and load if you don't! How fun!

Why can you only switch your melee skill between offensive and defensive outside of battle, why does changing it make no difference?  Why can I get 100%s to hit when 19-20/20 is always a crit fail? etc.),\nRandom to an excessive level (Nothing you do means anything.  Your completely non melee focused mage can work better as a tank than your completely tank focused sword and board char.  Your spell which does 8-18 dmg (firebolt 2) actually rolls for between 3 and 27, before factoring in resists/weaknesses)\nOn top of that, the AI cheats (They get 100%s to hit fairly regularly, they can parry a seemingly infinite amount of times, they parry your 95%s to hit about 95% of the time, they still maintain accuracy despite having every possible debuff put on them, they get access to things like potions in fights where it is explicitly stated no one has them, they succeed/fail skill checks in a completely disproportionate amount to thier displayed chances of success (etc)),\nThe story is both unoriginal and bland,\nThe world is completely nonsensical, you can walk across what is described as a "Vast empire" and back in less than a day,\nApart from your PC, Naurim and the fat mage, all of the voice actors are phoning it in, especially Neera (or whatever she is called),\nThe game is ugly as all hell, yet still has horrendous loadtimes and FPS drops (I am on a 4GHz 3770, a GTX680, 16 GIGs of DDR3, and a high speed SSD, yet it still drops to below 10 frames per second at times, seemingly randomly),\nThe UI is ♥♥♥♥ (IE every spell has 4 levels, each needs to be put onto your hotbar at a set level).\nThe progression is ♥♥♥♥ (no matter how difficult the fight is, you get 23 or 45 exp),\n\n\nProbably more, but this game is so painful to play through.  I wish my kindly friend hadnt bought the humble bundle for me, as then I would have bought it myself and could have just never played this game, but since someone bought it for me I HAVE to finish it so as to not waste thier money.\n\nHeres hoping it stops being ♥♥♥♥ at some point... Here is hoping it isnt 40 hours in...\n\n*Edit, I didnt quite force myself to 40 hours, close enough though, and I did give up in the end.  It never got good.  Its entirely possible the story gets good later on (though from comments I have seen it doesnt, BG2 supposedly has a good story if still unoriginal, and it having a good story is always mentioned as a positive comparison to BG 1), but if the gameplay is tantamount to pulling your own teeth out through your ♥♥♥♥, why would you even bother getting that far?","November 25, 2014","false","32.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are average, with bits of them bordering on terrible.  The story and exploration are linear, and the story itself is just plain boring.  The voice-work is just good enough to point out how comically bad it is.  Towns are bland and lifeless.  Combat is stagnant, and shows no complexity.  Even if you buy Blackguards on sale, you likely still won't find the time to sit down with it.  There just isn't any single thing exciting enough to make up for the blandness of the rest of the game.  Nothing to draw you back in, after the first time you've played.\n\nIt's well done from a mechanical standpoint - The skill trees are well thought out and balanced.  There's just nothing flashy in them to draw attention, and the execution becomes poor when you see your character dully performing their moves and abilities with passable graphics and poor weapons/equipment.  Blackguards is a pen-and-paper RPG adaptation that never really got past the pen-and-paper bit.  More of a visualisation of some DM's real-world tabletop setup that would seem much cooler set up with cardboard on your buddy's gaming table.\n\nIf you're hellbent on playing Blackguards, I hear Blackguards 2 is actually worth the time.  It's on my list of 'soon to play' games, so I'll put up a review ASAP.","March 22","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
