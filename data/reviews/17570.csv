However, there is one major problem I see in this game achieving greatness, its VERY small community. That small community being made up of mostly veteran players, it turns off many new players from staying in the game, thus keeping the player base about the same level. This game would definitely rise in greatness if many of the new players were to stay, allowing following new players something to do other than wait in respawn. This would then raise the fan base encouraging the devs to realease more content more fluidly.\n\nSo, yes, I do recommend this game, in the hopes for a stronger future for it.","January 17, 2014","true","96.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is not some bug-haunted piece of software without any content to it, if you are afraid about that.\n\nSecondly: You don't need to own any Source engine game to play PVKII. Just go to the Steam Store and start downloading it!\n\nAnd as a third point: Some negative reviews criticized the unrealistic damage displayed for some attacks. The damage display is a plugin for "SourceMod" and has nothing to do with the PVKII base game. It is known that this plugin is not optimized for PVKII and sometimes displays improper damage. Therefore, most people use it only as a "hit detector" on certain servers.\n\nSpeaking of the game itself: It has so much love in it, you can see it everywhere: The voice acting is one of the best I've seen in a game - even retail ones. The voices and the beautifully crafted, slightly comic-styled models give each class a real "personality". The design of the stock maps fits the game's theme perfectly and the community has created a lot of good custom maps so far.\n\nI have to admit that the population in the game is not the biggest, but it is always possible to find a full server or fill one quickly. The learning curve is steep and you will encounter many good players with hundreds or thousands of hours play time. While this could be frustrating for new players, it keeps the fights always challenging. In the end, the game is all about team play and even good players might not be able to win a game against a team working together really well.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention here is the rate of updates: There aren't as many updates as in other games, but it already takes quite some time to get into the game. You have to practice with each class for a while to be good with it. Creating classes and doing other major updates takes time. Especially since classes are not random models, but - as I mentioned before - real personalities and have a lot of references to literature and movies. There is also a lot of actual play testing by experienced beta testers involved before a release. This means that none of the updates has brought any balance problems with it so far. It always became better and each new class has been integrated really well.\n\nI can only recommend to try out this game and want to thank everyone for reading my review!","December 5, 2013","true","477.0"," 99 of 111 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","99","111","0","11"

Like for an example "Joe The Brave" or "Fred The Coward."\n\nThe Sniper classes are easily some of the most balanced in gaming, their attacks are effected by gravity and are very vulnerable to attacks.\n\nLots of maps and custom gamemodes from the community!\n\nEasily the best free mod on steam.\n\nCons:\n\nSource Engine, hitboxes are awful as usual, however PVK2 has the best Hit detection of all Source Engine multiplayer games. Still it's unfair when the Skirmisher's pistol can't hit sh*t when shooting someone 1 foot infront of you while an axe slashes your head off 200 miles away.\n\nDue to how hard it is to learn this game and how unknown this game is, the playerbase is rather small, unless a Major update comes out.\n\nTeams can be horribly unbalanced depending which map you play on, in an area where there are lots of Pitfalls, Vikings will dominate, while more tighter areas make Knights very deadly, the only map where this doesn't happen often is Bt_Island which is one of the most played maps in the game.\n\nUpdates are slow because the Dev team is small and works on a game FOR FREE! You can donate at their offical website if you want to give a bit of money!\nhttp://www.octosharkstudios.com/pvkii/\n\nAlso even though they take a long time to update, the actual updates are much higher quality then most games I play, they often add lots of new maps, balance changes, tons of bug fixes and more! Plus it's rare a new game changing bug is introduced, the only bad glitch I can think of is when on Island you can get into the Viking spawn, but even then that isn't as bad as other glitches since you or they cannot attack you. However what annoys me is when you compare this small awesome company/Dev Team to a larger company like Valve, look at TF2, makes millions a day, most updates are either g*mped of content like EOTL or massive cashcows like the Robotic Boogaloo update and even the best update of 2015 Gun Mettle which makes all the other cashcow updates look like nothing, plus TF2 is still full with glitches, so much infact that it  makes Ride To Hell look polished sometimes.\nSorry for the rant, but like I said I hate it when I compare a small company which makes next to no money and makes a much more polished game, then a large company which makes millions and don't want to fix all the major issues with the game 90% of the time.\n\nWell anyhow PVK2 is a very hard game to learn, however once you learn it, it's one of the best FPS on steam and I highly recommend this game to anyone.","June 5, 2015","true","70.8"," 121 of 146 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","121","146","11","5"

Great fun!\n//Rant Below//\nLets put it this way. I've always played games that have sandbox elements, guns, good old outer space, and had plenty of modding.\n\nLets begin with the games description.\n\n"you'll find this game both hilarious and exhilarating."\n\nThis is not a lie. You will be laughing at how hard you will probably fail, how crazy the classes are, the voice lines, and practically everything about this game.\n\n"I like guns" - COD KID\n\nGuess what COD kid? There is actually a good deal of ranged weapons. You will still contribute with these intresting variety of weapons to hit people from a distance. Its not just bows and arrows. Heck you got a pistol and a rifle as a sharpshooter. Sure its old, but it is still a gun. You like having stuff kill people for you? Play as pirate captain and send your trusty old attack parrot after em.\n\nYou like chopping people up? I've never seen so many ways to obliterate people with swords. Sword play is quite well done for a source game. Its incredible actually.\n\nYou even have specials for the classes. Seriously this game is 10/10.\n\nThis game is not fun to watch as it is to play. Play it now! Seriously.... do it! If you like the video on the store page you will probably like this game. If you did not you might still like this game. Watching that video does not do this game justice of how fun actually playing it is.\n\nLets get this straight. IT IS NOT A FREE TO PLAY! IT IS FREE! There is a difference between those. This game is 100% FREE. There is absolutely nothing to lose by playing this game! There is no in game store and it would not ask for anything from you.\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING TO LOSE! In TF2 you try to get stupid hats and everyone can outclass you with money. This game you JUST play. Nothing else. You enjoy and have fun. No more euphoric top hat scouts. Just play this as it is what tf2 should have been.\n\nNot a single dollar will need to be spent for this game.\n\nThe developers are truely great and I thank them for making a truely wonderful free game.\n\nPlease play this game now!","October 28, 2015","true","13.5"," 88 of 106 people (83%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","83","88","106","21","5"

There may be a few small clips or graphical problems, but the game runs very smooth, since it does not have fancy shaders or modeling. Audio is fine. Background music is satisfactory, and the sound effects are very good.\n\nIdea (Mechanics/Balancing/Marketing):\nPVKII is a VERY good idea. As the title states, it is a three team battle. Pirates VS Vikings VS Knights. All the teams have three classes, which normally are: Ranger, Melee, and a medium-ranged fighter. The game is well-balanced, with many counter attacks you can make against other players. The community is amazing! The developers are awesome!\n\nFun:\nPVKII is a FREE game. It's not filled to the brim with microtransactions like other "free" games. In fact, there is nothing to buy. (except HL2 to play the mod ) The game is very fun. Instead of your normal two team fighting game, this game is perfect for groups with multiples of three. If you have lopsided teams in other games, try PVKII with friends! All the classes are unique, along with the teams.\n\nOverall:\nAmazing, truly FREE game. Very fun three team fighting game! Developers are cool, and the game is amazing! The game itself runs very smooth, with a sacrifice of polycount. (but in an intense fight, you wouldn't care, and it's not THAT noticable as other games)\n\nBuy it when it goes on sa-... wait... it's free! If you do not have the original game (HL2), BUY IT NOW. Play HL2 through, and then play PVKII.\nThe only drawback is the small community. Otherwise, this game is perfect. You probably want to play with friends though, so you can find people to play with.\n9.5/10.","December 25, 2014","true","35.4"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","49","54","4","0"

So you got 12 different classes, each with his own skills, strengths and weaknessess. The main game mode is trying to grab treasure chests and try to keep them in your base untill the time expires, obviously the other factions will try to steal them from you. Ofcourse you also got (T)DM if that's more to your liking.\n\nPirates, Vikings and Knights II takes a funny approach to Multiplayer Deathmatches and it will probably enjoy you for many hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/euphemision/recommended/17570/","euphemision","Gilgamesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/euphemision/","31 products in account","Pirates, Vikings and Knights II is a game with amazing potential. Currently, though incomplete, it can still be played and enjoyed as a solid version of the full game, albeit with limited classes.  However, right now the classes are: Berserker, Huscarl and Gestir on Vikings; Heavy Knight, Archer and Man-at-Arms on Knights; and Skirmisher, Captain and Sharpshooter on Pirates.  So they do have at least 3 per team, and it is more varied than previous versions.  One downside has been the long wait for each new class, but the vast majority of players are grateful for what they get, and rightfully so because it has always been a free mod.  The gameplay was always solid, so for it's time it deserves a lot of credit.  It's unfortunate that it hasn't been greenlighted on Steam.  I'll need to look into that.\n\nI recommend PVKII if you're familiar with games like Oblivion/Skyrim, Chivalry, or any Half-Life 2 games in particular.  Beyond that, any FPS player out there is perfect, as the main perspective is first-person.  The action is very fast paced and accuracy and timing oriented.  There's plenty of interesting custom maps on those servers as well when the core maps become familiar, though the core maps tend to be higher quality than custom.  It's a game to have fun in and adapt to the physics and movement limitations.  You can dodge arrows and feint in battle to dodge and counter their attack.  You can throw a keg and shoot it with your pistol as a Skirmisher and have it explode immediately. (This is dangerous though, you're likely to hit it closer and that may be suicidal. But it's hilarious.)  Every class has it's own style and you can figure out how to best utilize their advantages while adjusting for their disadvantages.  I suggest embracing their disadvantages -- for example, as a Heavy Knight, it's easier to let them come to you.  When you aren't constantly moving while they're moving, they won't see your relative speed, so when you do move to dodge their attack they likely won't be able to adjust in time.  A charged attack from a Heavy Knight does the most damage when used accurately.  Heavy Knights deserve credit because they have the hardest time getting food to restore health, as they run the slowest by far of any class in the game, due to balancing their Attack with Health/Armor and Attack Speed/Movement Speed.\nSkirmishers can also die in two hits from a Heavy Knight's Great Sword, or three hits from a Two-handed Axe, and all depending on how Charged and accurate the attack was.  Skirmishers, however, run the fastest. Due to the WASD movement you can move in and out to attack, dodge, or feint (have them swing, you dodge, then counter). A Skirmisher is able to move backwards faster than most classes run forwards.  Thus, if you can time it, you can theoretically avoid every attack.  There tends to be a split second where they are in reach, so you'll want to Charge your attack around a corner, and hearing his footsteps, you move forward and swing towards him.  Otherwise, use Taunt and maybe they'll want to cut you to ribbons.  Then you just allow yourself to get hit and attack them as they can't dodge.  The Heavy Knight blocks slowly, and has a long attack delay, but if you can manage it you should Parry and Counter a Skirmisher because it usually results in a death if they have already engaged in battle.  It's a quick finisher that makes the Heavy Knight more into a Samurai for that moment.  Don't try it too much if they know to just Charge their attack so as not to get Parried, however.  Then you have to absorb their attack to hit them, if they're skilled in weaving their movement and much faster.  A Viking Huscarl and Pirate Captain could even out-maneuver a Heavy Knight.\n\nAbove all, you'll want to support your team with Encourage or have some fun over the mic, and try to work together to bring down the enemy teams.  The most important thing in PVK is teamwork.  We all like to mess around and have fun, but when you want to win because the same guy has been winning the last three rounds in a row and is a total d-bag about it, all you gotta do is move in one big group and swing away.  As long as you don't get distracted or separated, you should be akin to a tank with rotating sawblades.  I'm looking at you, Vikings.  Pirates, you gotta run away.  But just long enough to come back and throw eight kegs at the Vikings and Knights who are fighting each other and desperately want to get that kill point from the guy they were just fighting, so they'll let you throw the keg and try to jump away at the last second. But you won't let that happen.  You wait til the wick of the keg is just barely sticking out, one second away from exploding, and you run forward, jump and throw it slightly up so as to fall in the middle of the most fighters in proximity to the keg's explosion, and you in one instant take 4 kills for you and your team.  That, or you and your teammates kegs end up littering the battlefield and clearing everyone out in turn.  Knights, your archers will want to kill a Skirmisher in two hits using one shot from the Crossbow and one shot from their Longbow.  Several archers can nail a Skirmisher if they're accurate and the skirmisher likely has their keg out and moves slower.  Archers, you still do the most damage with your Crossbow and Longbow, so you should try to be like Legolas and shoot people point blank if they get too close.  You can learn to utilize your Shortsword in time, but as it's shorter and weaker than other light weapons, it should be taken into consideration you'll have to work harder to kill with that than as any other class.  Unless the enemy has low health, using this is only for advanced players.  Much like the Sharpshooter's knife or the Captain's hook and fist. Though I would say the Shortsword isn't half bad, either.  It's fun to play Archer with Shortsword because the enemy tends to expect an easy kill.  You can avoid their hits (you'd better) and weaken them, then do a ton of damage with a point-blank Crossbow bolt and usually finish them then.  There's many ways to play, and I could go on.\n\nMost importantly, the gameplay is innovative and has the most control out of any other game.  I look forward to future updates, but I also hope more developers see the potential in this style of gameplay.  The dev team deserves to be picked up and paid to create.","October 18, 2015","true","135.2"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","36","44","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sixgun/recommended/17570/","sixgun","Hussar, The Winged","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sixgun/","301 products in account","Sadly, the game is passed its prime. There are too many similar and complete games out right now to justify pvkii. I put several hundred hours into this game; I LOVED this game, but I simply can't bring myself to get back into it. The most disappointing facet about this game is the level of support the game has gotten.\n\nI get it, games take time, money and energy to make. It's a fact that probably doesn't get noticed nearly enough these games. The game has been out for over half a decade now and still has not managed to release half of the classes that were planned from the beginning. Each update has become more and more underwhelming as time goes on. When the game first came out, there was only one class per team. They were unbalanced and buggy, but they had personality and synergised well together. Later updates brought variety, engagement and even a complete overhauls of game mechanics. The game began a bit of a decent by the release of 2.3, which is a bit odd for me to say because i probably had the most fun during 2.3.\n\n2.3 brought a new class, an updated engine and multiple bug fixes, but it had one flaw. 2.3  allowed player to choose between a manual and automatic block function. This may not seem like much to someone looking in from the outside, but modern game communities are finicky about the games that they've put so many hours into. Imagine, if you will, a game suck as Counter-strike 1.6 added some sort of option that reduced the amount of damage that a headshot inflicted; but, at the same time, increased how much damage a body shot would do. This would drasticly reduce the learning curve for new players, while leaving the game unaltered for the die hard veterans that have been eating and breathing this game for the past decade. You could balance the damage figures perfectly and draw all of the graphs you wanted, but the veterans are not going to like the fact that the skills they have honed have now been made slightly less effective so that some filthy pesant  with a brand new copy can feel accomplished. A small change that forever alters the way that the game is seen. Manual blocking was still the default option, even preferred by some of those old pvkii vets, but auto-block gave new players an arguably unearned and uneven playing field. This seemingly insignificant change drove a spike through the community.\n\nAnd this brings me to the a very taboo topic in pvkii. The "community." Some will tell you that the community is in ashes. Some will tell you that the community is just fine. All can agree on the same thing, the community has gotten SMALLER. I, personally, won't be going into the specifics about the sociology behind the pvkii community because i wouldn't be able to progress beyond a ramble that leads to nothing productive. Instead, I'll bring up the previously mentioned issue, the spike that drove the community apart. Modern gaming is leaning towards a sort of bipartisan: "Core" gamers and "Casual" gamers. "Veterans" and "Noobs." "People that play more than me" and "People that play less than me." "12 years olds" and "12 year olds." The core guys bring stability to the community and the new comers bring life. Neither are perfect but both are vital. When the barely sentient guy that just installed the game manages to get a lucky hit on someone who has the pvkii logo tattooed on his forehead for so long that the ink is starting to seep into his brain and cause mood swings, two things happen. One: the new guy tells his friends, they tell their friends, who tell their friends and so on until, you got a reputable pack of these little poobrains wobbling about mashing the m1 button so hard that Razor's share holders are starting to get nervous and Two: the hardcore players lock themselves away in a single server so that they can beat each other over the head with their erect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and talk about how good they are compared to everyone else while comparing size in peace. These two rabbles are what we have now, and what have to be appeased.\n\nUpdates after 2.3 left much to be desired. New voice overs for every class were added, leading to the reactions "WTF I LIKE THE OLD ONES" from the vets and "Oh cool, this game has voice acting" from the new guys. A new class was added, considered "lame and game breaking" by some and "easy to kill if you're not an idiot" buy others. Some old maps were taken out and put back in, leaving everyone to wonder where that balanced class was that was supposed to be added 3 patches ago. It seems nothing the poor devs can do makes anyone happy anymore for more than 2 seconds. The voices conflict each other 9 times out of ten, and it's a shame to see it all for nothing. So much love has been put into this project, that much is apparent just by booting it up and listening to the theme music. So why can't I give this game another chance? Why can't I find enjoyment in something so beautiful and unique and amazing since there's so much love smeared all over it?\n\nA while ago, the game released a ranged class. This was the first exclusivly ranged-focused class added to the game. The devs balanced the archer by handing out arrow blocking shields like expired candy to pretty much everyone else. It took some skill and getting used to before you could manage anything with it. Naturally, as change tends to do, everyone was enraged for one reason or another. The other guys saw the utility of this archer class and the new guys hated every second that they couldn't play one. A few updates later, a NEW ranged class was added to the game. You know what they forgot? Anti-ranged classes. And i don't mean classes that have a really good chance against archers when they're right on top of them. I mean some kind of stealth unit that can sneak up behind rangers and one-shot back stab them. Something that totally obliterates archers and sharpshooters when used by a competent player. Something that makes you NOT WANT TO PLAY A RANGED CLASS. Naturally, these units would be completely destroyed by melee units and thus you achieve balance.\n\nNow we run into the heart of the problem. We have a simple problem with a simple solution. Finish what was started, the world keeps spinning. But the problem isn't being solved. Updates have been excruciatingly slow, and depressing when they finally do get here. The most recent class, the Sharpshooter, isn't nearly as up-to-par as all of the other classes. Its another backpetalling archer with slightly more speed than you and seemingly unlimited ammunition. Without a counter class, my frustration with this game is doubled. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an Archer class and a Sharpshooter class and even the idea of having to find a way of dealing with them as a melee class. What i don't like is having to fight ranged classes and melee classes at the same time constantly. You've got two voices coming from the community. One says "U GUYS IM LIKE SUPR GUD AT RANGR YOLO420SWAGSNIPERWOLFNARUTO4EVER" and "No, it's easy. You've just got to use your shield and kite around this rock and run all the way around and wait until he's not paying attention and change classes 2 or 3 times and shoot him in the face. It's easy." (That is, IF you can hear them over the sound of errect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slapping against foreheads and keyboards.) I get it, you can get around them by kiting and shielding. I've done it many times. ITS NOT FUN.  I also get that you can start a fire with a stick and a rock, but that didn't stop matches from catching on. So two voices are left. Counter the rangers or don't counter the rangers. I get it, updates are in progress, these things take time blah blah blah, but the game play has been deteriorated. With a majority of the blocking mechanic has been practically removed and pure melee fighting nearly unheard of anymore, the melee combat is basic and unenjoyable. Balance it and i'll give it another try. Melee based games need fun melee combat.","December 13, 2013","false","583.6"," 85 of 144 people (59%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","59","85","144","10","2"

You will enjoy alot while playing with friends (LAN or just random public server). We have pirates that are focused on ranged weaponry, Every pirate class have at least a ranged weapon. Then Vikings wich are focused on melee combat and crowd control. Yes, they do have ranged weapons but you will notice that all of them have at least one large melee weapon (husclar's axe/ gestir's spear etc). And lastly we have knights, who are a mix of both. Knight (AKA: Ironman) doesn't have a ranged weapon and archer is ranged specialist (no strong melee weapon). While Man-at-Arms is a mix of ranged combat and melee combat.\n\nThe game is being constantly updated with new maps, gamemodes and classes.Allthough the game is being updated like rain in the middle of sahara.

And that's usually followed by "Noob", "Gtfo", or an outright kick/ban/mute.  And if the admins don't have you banned for "Dumbass" or something of that note, prepare to be berated and verbally annihilated by all the good friends, admirers, and fellow Hackers of the Player in suspect when you say your piece about them.\n\nPVKII WOULD be fun, if not for the fact that the only way to HAVE ANY FUN if you aren't also using Hacks, is to find a way onto the Knights team and get Carried by Archerbots.\nOh and believe me, the Ranged Combat for the Pirates?  Innacurate as hell and always a gamble.  You won't hit practically anything even point-blank.  And Vikings throw things, enough said.  Oh it's not?  The Travel time on a Javelin or Axe is so slow, that people will literally just keep strafing you and you'll miss half or all of your throws.\n\nSo honest to goodness, unless you already plan to start off your PVKII experience using the latest and greatest Bot/Trainer/AimAssist, you're going to have a dumb, unfun time.\n\nAlso, if you find yourself up against an Archer who has unbelievable skills, stand in their view and rapidly alternate your Strafe Left Strafe Right keys.  Notice how they'll immediately start missing almost every shot.  At you, someone who is physically standing still, yet has a Hitbox swerving all over the place.  You'll get what I'm talking about once you try this out.","July 17, 2014","false","174.6"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spirrwell/recommended/17570/","Spirrwell","Spirrwell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spirrwell/","39 products in account","Swords, axes, crossbows, and rifles. You have three classic teams of old times, Pirates, Vikings, and Knights. The Pirates have their speedy skirmishers, tough captains, and a gun-happy sharpshooter. The Vikings have their insane yet fast berserkers, the powerfully defensive huscarl with his two handed axe and shield, and the gestir that pokes people with a spear. The Knights have your standard archer with both a longbow and a crossbow that's not quite so strong but is very quick, and they also have the heavy knight with his two handed sword can take out most enemies in just two or three hits.\n\nThis is a great game for up close melee, but you do have to deal with the ranged classes and they can be very annoying from afar. But with your speedy sword swinging teammates, taking them down can be very easy depending on who you're fighting. Sure you have people that love to run away, and that's when it's best to have a ranged weapon to take them out from afar when they have their back turned trying desperately to run away from you.\n\nIt's a great, fun, and crazy online game to play. It takes a while to master your sword swinging, parrying, and gunslinging, but it's well worth it when you're finally able to take down those really tough opponents. It's an all around enjoyable game that's not without its flaws, but still a great game especially for free. If you have the time to download it, I say get it. I rate this game a 7.5/10. Sure I want to rate it a 9/10, but I do recognize some of the game mechanics flaws particularly in balancing the three teams. Still I definitely recommend this game!","April 18, 2013","true","644.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","4"

It shows what direction the enemy is attacking/blocking, and their current charge. I can't find a way to disable them.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7Emd7aE.png\n\nThey also, for some reason, added this really awkward "roll" mechanic to the game (and also a kick mechanic that makes shields rather worthless for knockback). Using it gets you killed, and there's no cooldown. Every server I join the entire enemy teams are constantly rolling, not hurting anyone but being annoying to hit. They just take slightly longer to kill and is aggravating. The only benefits to rolling are comically overpowered, but only against heavy knights: rolling makes it so you can flee from them at any time, and if you're a pirate sharpshooter the only way they can kill you is if you get cornered. Now the class that had to stay back and act as a supporting role can be more effective than any other class, simply because they can't get hit, and reload while they roll.\n\nI've never seen a game go from so good to so bad so quickly. It used to be in my top 5 games, now I doubt I'll even ever play it. Even if I did want to play it, nobody plays this game anymore, there's hardly any people on ever. Unless I want to play 24/7 island servers in Europe with 300 ping, of course. Even counting that though, at the time of writing there's only about 50~60 players playing right now, on any server. And only ~15 of them aren't on the European servers running the same one map constantly.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the auto-balance is still really horrible and abusable, even restacking teams if balance was fixed. Ex, 4 knights, 6 pirates, 5 vikings, you're a pirate set to balance on death, a knight joins to make it 5/6/5, and then you get balanced on death to 6/5/5 for no reason.","May 2","false","199.9"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","19","32","3","4"

As for cash shop or anything of the sorts, i didn't reall see one which in my opinion makes the game good by far. except ----v\n\nNegative Review:\nAs i mentioned above this, the hit detection is quite a bit off and can be quite annoying, and also there is the server problem, i picked the server that has good ping "or so it says" and when i joined everyone has 150 - 300 ping... making it almost impossible to hit anyone.... but everyone can hit you...\nanother problem with the servers... they are pretty much empty... now idk if it is because im US East or not, but there were only 3 games out of....50 servers? give or take 10.... 1 had 6 players, 1 had 2 and one "which had the worst ping" had 26 players.... i tried them all, and i could hardly kill anyone, out of my 0.7 hrs of play i got 3 kills or something around that and north of 20 deaths... i know maybe i could just suck at the game...true, but my chiv record says otherwise.\n\npersonal thoughts only:\nI didn't mind the game, but it's not for me... I'll stick with Chiv, but don't let this have you shy away from the game, no no no... give it a try this is just my personal thoughts, if the game looks interesting to you, go ahead and download it, it doesn't cost you anything and there is no cash shop as i mentioned. who knows you might be really good and love the game.","September 25, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The game is plagued with horribly unbalanced teams. Unless you're a Skirmisher, Sharpshooter, or Archer, you can expect most of your game time to be spent chasing after said enemies who can damage AS they outrun you, and they will. Maybe once in a while, you'll get a good actual fight in, but the times you spend being frustrated just overtakes it. It's fun if you can play with a bunch of friends who would abuse this imbalance, but otherwise I definately won't be coming back until this is fixed.","June 17, 2015","false","22.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

It does feel as though the game was made with love, but it's still an awkward, clumsy, and unpolished combat experience. I'm easily satisfied when it comes to melee combat but this game was actually hard to enjoy. Fights are just people running around each other swinging and swinging and swinging their awkward weapons until they die. They're long and unfulfilling.\n\nIf you're using one of the weapons worth using (as in, non-ranged and not one in which you hold down the attack button to repeat the little "chop-chop" animation), you look in a direction to choose which of your three attacks you're going to do, and there the weapon stays for as long as you hold that button. The idea is this "charges" your attacks, which is a welcome mechanic, but all it does is slow down your attacking. There is no flow, no comboing, no way to mix it up. You have three attacks that won't ever change and they're all made for a very small hitbox. You really can't drag it around either as you can in the aforementioned games, leaving you feel less like a warrior and more like a theme park robot. And in the event you raise up a fully charged attack, know that you aren't going to kill anyone. Everyone has what is effectively a dual health bar - one for health and the other for "armor" - and you'll be hacking at even an archer for quite a while before they die because of it. Seriously... You'll take your greataxe, walk up to an archer with a fully charged attack, bring it down on their head, and they'll just look at you like you were stupid to try it. Then they just walk away as you try to hit them the 3-4 more times it takes to kill them.\n\nThere exists a parry system like that of mount and blade, in that you must look a certain direction to ready the right parry. It's potentially nice if you have the presence of mind to use it, but in all likelihood, your opponent is going to miss that attack that you're prepared for, and most fights are just exchanges of swings. Parrying only seems worth it if you're incredibly practiced at it, and if you're using it in a duel, otherwise you just want to get out as much hitting as possible.\n\nEveryone is appropriately mobile, at least. The base run speed is quite fast and perfect as such, and everyone has a nifty little roll they can execute, although I'm unsure of how applicable it really is in a fight. You can't roll and transition smoothly into an attack.\n\nAre the teams balanced? I haven't played enough to say for sure, but it seems the pirates generally come out on top. In a game where hitting people to death is a tedious experience, the characters that can just shoot you as well as place powerful explosives are probably going to have an edge.","September 7, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Sadly when I booted up the game I found out that bots wasn't an option which is surprising since this is a source engine game and most source engine games have bots in them. Nevertheless, I was keen to find out what this game was all about. I picked a multiplayer server in the arena (since arenas are round and pretty basic so it wouldn't take much time for me to learn my surroundings, plus I saw it on a SeaNanners video) and I quickly caught onto how the combat works, bearing in mind this game doesn't have much of a tutorial, so the combat is pretty easy and quite fun and doesn't require a lot of skill, you just have to move around a bit and strike when the time is right. Although my kills were severely outweighed by my deaths I was still having fun and haven't managed to rage once (so I'm currently beating the record for most COD players.) The voice acting was laughable, and I don't mean that in a bad way, I mean it was hilarious to listen to how it sticks to the medieval stereotype warrior with it's sayings.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to anyone, even with strangers it was pretty fun for my first time. Though the experience would be greatly enhanced when playing with friends.","July 12, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I really do. It certainly has a good amount of things going for it, however, there are some major drawbacks.\n\n1) There are only about 3 servers that have more than 5 people on them at any given time, which is a big problem in and of itself, but especially when you are bored of playing the Island map (there is a server that only uses Island), it can be frustrating.\n\n2) There is a pretty steep learning curve, especially if you plan on mastering all of the classes for all 3 factions. If you really cannot stand the learning curve, consider something like Age of Chivalry which is more geared to helping you learn the ins and outs of the game.\n\n3) *sigh* this brings me to the maps. While some of the maps are good, as i said before, they can become very tedious very quickly. Rounds have a tendency to last longer than they really should (that goes for games too) and you might find yourself just spectating other players because you can't muster up the enthusiam to actually join the game.\n\n4) My last point, and in my opinion by FAR the most important, is how awful the community can be. I have dealt with racism while playing other multiplayer games, but it usually just amounts to some 12 year old calling you a dirty n-word before he impales you. The difference between that, and what happens on PVK2 is that these are not twelve year olds, they are adults, and they aren't being racist to be funny, they are being racist because they are actually racist.\n\nI had to put up with a guy in a server who, through 2 or three seperate games, went on saying that whites are the superior race in every way, and every other race owes them something, along with a multitude of other vile, completely untrue statements. However, because there are no other servers and the Admin was away, I couldn't really do a thing about it.\n\nIN CLOSING, if you don't want to put up with  bad community, stale maps, a lack of servers, or just general boredom, don't bother putting too much time into it.\n","August 1, 2015","false","11.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

It was fine in mount and blade because mount and blade is a single player game so winning isn't as important, but here it can be extremely frustrating to go into a battle knowing you are going to lose because the opponent reacts faster than you.","May 30, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Different modes existed, like a sort of CTF, deathmatch, etc..\n\nThe graphics are from the Source engine, so, it was very nice. And each map could be related to each faction: old castle, docks, paradise island.\n\nAt least, even if I wasn't a good player, I had fun being a knight or the pirate with the keg.

Stealing maps from ex-devs who left years ago, but claiming it a NEW map (check the REAL author for tortuga and when it was made, you will find it was created around 6 years before it was actually released as a "new map"), constantly desperate to take maps made by the community and make them official so the dev team can avoid doing any real work, even if said maps don't fit the theme in the slightest, or are fugly as hell and need dozens of revisions (which plenty of the official maps already get anyway which says a lot about their confidence in the first place) and to top it all off, the dev team has had a LOAD of behind-the-scenes drama with each other AND its own community. The biggest of these countless examples would probably be them giving the finger to the ORIGINAL CREATOR OF PIRATES, VIKINGS AND KNIGHTS on the goldsource engine, ultimately showing zero respect for authors of ACTUAL creativity (as is still practiced by them with their map theft and content-copying) considering the majority of everything created was based off of someone else's work, including multiple maps, biggest example obviously being bt_island.\n\nAvoid this ♥♥♥♥ at all costs. It is garbage, and is made by the embodiment of quite the same.

Go and boil your bottoms, you sons of a silly person. I blow my nose at you, so-called 'Arthur King', you and all your silly English K-nig-hts. I dont want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!"\n\n+ ability to play classic music gems during gameplay\n+ great sounds; voice acting, especially man-at-arms\n+ melee combat mechanics is 100% skill oriented\n\n- lack of vote system for tossing the teams if unbalanced\n- need more playable characters for ex. healers etc..\n\nThis is not just a mod, but well designed competitive team based action game. At first, after launching I thought that its cheap piece of sh** with crappy graphics.. it took me couple of hours to realize how I was mistaken. Humourous taunts, references to Monty Python, goofy community members; all that makes game so good. Some moments you find a pure joy to be part of the events happening during the gameplay while trying to survive in the middle of madness.","June 1","true","77.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So that's a plus for people who have low end PCs.\n+Different styles of combat for every character in each team.\n+It has its fair share of maps and gamemodes. But there are still much more made by the community.\n+Great combat mechanics (kinda hard to master though)\n+Everything is balanced.\n\nCons\n\n-Not that many characters. (as of now, but the devs are working on it)\n-Some problems with the textures on some maps.\n-Not that many servers with people constantly in it. (I've only found 9 so far, 1 is almost always full)\n-Most of the servers are only either in USA or EU. So it's a little hard for other people from other countries to play.\n\nBut other than that, it's a great game. I definitely recommend trying this game out.\nBots will be very much appreciated though.","July 8, 2015","true","28.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Fuq no\n\nCompletely unbalanced? FUQ NO\n\nNo melee classes can catch up with ranges? LOL RANGED ARE SOME OF THE SLOWEST CLASSES.\n\nSure it may seem unbalanced when you very first begin, but just that's because some classes are just easier to learn than others.\n\nThe game is 100% skill based - The better You are the better You will perform. Every class has weaknesses, you can defeat any class with any class - some classes are just easier to get good at! Doesn't mean they're unbalanced.\n\n\nNow, on to the Review....\n\n\nEasy to Learn Difficult to Master type of game.\n\nCOMPLETELY FREE – YOU DON’T BUY PREMIUM WEAPONS, ARMOUR, NOTHING.\n\nYou don’t get more opposite of Pay2Win than this game.\n\nWHAT IS THE GAME LIKE?\n\nThe game is purely skill-based, I would say for most you need at least 200+ hours to be not be considered an amateur.\n\nVery fun mod, all classes are very equally balanced apart from 2, however they're getting re-balanced in the next update which should improve that.\n\nIt’s an open map First Person Perspective (or third-person enabled in some servers) games, with a very medieval theme added to it. It has swords, bows, axes, pistols, blunderbusses, parrots, halberds, spears, javelins, exploding kegs, rifles (old-fashioned), hooks and more!\n\nThere are different games modes – Team Death Match, Capture the Booty, Trinket Wars, Capture the Flag and a lot of different maps but the most played are Arena, Island and Cathedral.\n\nYou can't properly bunnyhop, however you can spam jump, of course, which, if you use it right can make it very difficult for people (especially new players) to hit you, since you can jump over their swing (tip: just aim higher with the weapon).\n\nFor every class, if you do enough damage you can use your Special, the Special varies on every class, for example on the Archer (Knights) it’s 3 flaming arrows, on the Captain (Pirates) you can load a flaming cannon ball! Some may sound more OP than others but they are very closely balanced.\n\nANY VIRUSES OR BUGS OR HACKERS?\n\nI've heard some people think it's full of viruses? Complete BS, there are no viruses and in my almost 3 years of playing I’ve seen only 1 real hacker, who was banned in a day, obviously.\n\nNo serious bugs that affect gameplay, although you do get people who exploit the game with scripts and that - adding extra reach or reducing their hitbox. However, if you're good enough you can still beat them.\n\nThere's no doubt noobs out there saying it's full of hackers, there just describing the skilled players of the game that are good enough to make it seem like their hacking -  you get them in all games, no?\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS WHEN PLAYING?\n\nIf you're a new player I recommend easier classes to begin with - Man At Arms (Knights), Huscarl (Vikings), Skirmisher/Captain (Pirates)\n\nFor more experienced players, the top of the list would definitely be the Beserker (Vikings) utilize him right and you're a beast, however, any class can perform well if you use them right.\n\nDOWNSIDE?\n\nNeeds more players.\n\nUPSIDE?\n\nYou get a parrot as Captain and you can name and choose what colour he should be (you unlock more colour themes with achievements)!\n\n179 Achievements! No one has them all yet!\n\n\nOVERALL\n\nAn extremely fun-filled game! Kinda like CS:GO but the guns replaced with medieval weapons and there’s no skins/crates/Russians and less rage\n\nFun Fact: The Parrot poops!","October 4, 2015","true","125.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

The learning curve is certainly a little steep and there are balance issues that manifest on certain maps (there are a massive number of custom maps), but all in all this is one of the most well-crafted little free mods out there. The developers update the game on a somewhat infrequent but regular basis, and their releases are pretty uniformly stable.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there are few modes: point capture/hold, deathmatch, "trinket" (sort of like an inverse team hot-potato deathmatch mode), and bounty (capture the "flag" with a lot of "flags"). Each one rewards certain playstyles more than others.\n\nThis mod has been out for some time and has a fairly experienced cadre of regular players that are pretty good. This can be frustrating for new players at first, but provided that you're willing to die a few times to learn how to play, it won't take too terribly long to get up to speed. I played the first PVK--which was an HL1 mod--many years back, and the devs never "finished" it (in terms of classes and gameplay). It looks like they're making more steady strides toward completing this one. I haven't seen a CTD bug in years, and a good game gets a little better with every update.\n\nGive this one a shot. I was drawn to the novelty that is a game where three teams from far-flung places and times smash into each other, and I stayed for the challenge, the fun, and humor. If nothing else, play once for the pleasure of sending your attack parrot to peck someone's eyes out. And then once more to be a viking lawnmower. And maybe one more time to fart someone to death.","September 15, 2015","true","153.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The pirates have pistols and access to gunpowder, whilst the vikings and knights rely on older technology.\nPVK2 is a colorful mod with detailed graphics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sugnod/recommended/17570/","sugnod","4pollo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sugnod/","57 products in account","I can't remember exactly when I started playing this. It was pretty early in development, but still had the basic gameplay. I didn't start playing it a lot, though, until a year or two back. Let me just start by saying it is an amazing game through and through. The ideas are pretty original or adaptations of good ideas, there's humor, the developers are nearly always in contact with the players, and other than the random fools that will join, the community can be entertaining and inviting.\n\nI will admit that there are cons. There are true cons and then my opinion of bad things. The largest con, I think, is that there is not a large playerbase behind this game. And that is a con in two ways: not a lot of people to play with, and the developers thrive off the fans' feedback. With only a small knit group of players supporting the mod, I feel it's a waste; not because the game is bad but because it's a diamond in the sand that no one will ever see. This mod needs people to help work on it and to help give it publicity. The second major con is the community. I said earlier that they can be entertaining and inviting, but because they are so tight knit, some players will immediately reject new players. And a part of me feels that this isn't because the community is full of bad people. I've met a lot of the community and they can be nice people. It's just that there will be a lot of rotten apples, and the regulars will get really sour with these apples, because they're usually new players goofing off. It's more a defensive thing: the fanbase wants the community to look amazing, so they are very apprehensive towards new players. But it goes both ways: if you're not a tool, they will gradually accept you.\n\nThe combat system is fun, but I'm pretty neutral about it. Sometimes I love it, and sometimes it makes me shake my head. This could be a variety of problems: lag or connection, plain luck, balance issues, or the high learning curve on some characters. This game isn't that easy to "dominate" in without practice. You can get one or two kills without any knowledge, but to really do well you have to dedicate time. I personally like this as it shows skill and how much time you've put into the game, but I know it can be a major put-off for people who don't want to learn. There are even people who criticize the combat system and say it's too easy or simple compared to other games. I honestly can't say for sure, since I don't play other games like this, but that's because I don't really enjoy other games with similar systems. This game keeps me entertained.\n\nIn the end, would I recommend it? Of course. Does it need work? Of course. Nothing's perfect. But it's a hell of a game that not many people seem to realize exists. And it's free, so why not?","February 26, 2014","true","381.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

In some ways it's even better than Team Fortress 2. You get three teams: Pirates, Vikings and Knights, and each of those teams are fun to play as, and they all have their different characters with different personalities, including different and quite interesting weapons, such as claymores, pistols and throwing axes. I really recommend this game if you're a multiplayer FPS fan. Better yet... it's an FPS set in the 1500-1700's.

The over-the-top theme, humorous voice-acting, and class variety make this game a must-play for anyone that can download it.\n\nHowever, like most competitive melee-based FPSs, it has a fairly steep learning curve and incredibly immature community.  I cannot stress how terrible the community is (Or was when I played.  It's still probably pretty terrible, though.).  Having a thick skin is highly recommended.\n\nWhile the game currently has a lot classes and features planned for it, the developers are developing the game at a snail's pace.  However, what's already in-game offers plenty of entertainment for those with a taste for competitive melee.  Or throwing axes.  Or parrots.\n\nYes, parrots are weapons.","October 1, 2011","true","210.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sugnod/recommended/17570/","sugnod","4pollo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sugnod/","57 products in account","I can't remember exactly when I started playing this. It was pretty early in development, but still had the basic gameplay. I didn't start playing it a lot, though, until a year or two back. Let me just start by saying it is an amazing game through and through. The ideas are pretty original or adaptations of good ideas, there's humor, the developers are nearly always in contact with the players, and other than the random fools that will join, the community can be entertaining and inviting.\n\nI will admit that there are cons. There are true cons and then my opinion of bad things. The largest con, I think, is that there is not a large playerbase behind this game. And that is a con in two ways: not a lot of people to play with, and the developers thrive off the fans' feedback. With only a small knit group of players supporting the mod, I feel it's a waste; not because the game is bad but because it's a diamond in the sand that no one will ever see. This mod needs people to help work on it and to help give it publicity. The second major con is the community. I said earlier that they can be entertaining and inviting, but because they are so tight knit, some players will immediately reject new players. And a part of me feels that this isn't because the community is full of bad people. I've met a lot of the community and they can be nice people. It's just that there will be a lot of rotten apples, and the regulars will get really sour with these apples, because they're usually new players goofing off. It's more a defensive thing: the fanbase wants the community to look amazing, so they are very apprehensive towards new players. But it goes both ways: if you're not a tool, they will gradually accept you.\n\nThe combat system is fun, but I'm pretty neutral about it. Sometimes I love it, and sometimes it makes me shake my head. This could be a variety of problems: lag or connection, plain luck, balance issues, or the high learning curve on some characters. This game isn't that easy to "dominate" in without practice. You can get one or two kills without any knowledge, but to really do well you have to dedicate time. I personally like this as it shows skill and how much time you've put into the game, but I know it can be a major put-off for people who don't want to learn. There are even people who criticize the combat system and say it's too easy or simple compared to other games. I honestly can't say for sure, since I don't play other games like this, but that's because I don't really enjoy other games with similar systems. This game keeps me entertained.\n\nIn the end, would I recommend it? Of course. Does it need work? Of course. Nothing's perfect. But it's a hell of a game that not many people seem to realize exists. And it's free, so why not?","February 26, 2014","true","381.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

In some ways it's even better than Team Fortress 2. You get three teams: Pirates, Vikings and Knights, and each of those teams are fun to play as, and they all have their different characters with different personalities, including different and quite interesting weapons, such as claymores, pistols and throwing axes. I really recommend this game if you're a multiplayer FPS fan. Better yet... it's an FPS set in the 1500-1700's.

The over-the-top theme, humorous voice-acting, and class variety make this game a must-play for anyone that can download it.\n\nHowever, like most competitive melee-based FPSs, it has a fairly steep learning curve and incredibly immature community.  I cannot stress how terrible the community is (Or was when I played.  It's still probably pretty terrible, though.).  Having a thick skin is highly recommended.\n\nWhile the game currently has a lot classes and features planned for it, the developers are developing the game at a snail's pace.  However, what's already in-game offers plenty of entertainment for those with a taste for competitive melee.  Or throwing axes.  Or parrots.\n\nYes, parrots are weapons.","October 1, 2011","true","210.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No bots, no way. ALL OF THE GOLDSRC engine games have bots. ALL THEIR MODS ARE NOTHING BUT EMPTY SERVERS, the players are gone BUT, the bots still linger, and its what keeps me playing these old games because i had such fond memories with them and i can still remake them with BOTS. But not SOURCE ENGINED MODS thats for sure, the only source engine mods that even HAVE bots, CS:S(Well-made bots with 3/4 difficulties10/10), TF:2,(has Well made bots no difficulty but still smart bots 8/10) Well the only 2 source mods/games with bots i know of, THATS IT. Oh yeah the review of THIS game, well gameplay is AWESOME, still barely any players or servers(Still in Beta obviously) its been 7 YEARS and this mod is still in BETA?

Kill your enemies with flatulence, taunts, and parrots as you try and take chests of booty from the other teams, and play as an angry furry, the taunting Frenchman, or the Black Knight while waiting for that perfect moment to use that badass special move you've been saving.\n\nOne of the best things I found about this game is that each team has it's own specialty and feels very unique. The Pirates lack bulky classes and do poorly in fair fights. To make up for this, Pirates don't get into fair fights. Vikings are very fast and  on average, quite hardy and can deal considerable amounts of damage very quickly. However, they can be easily taken down with some harassed damage and avoiding a direct fight. The Knights, when working as a team, are generally more powerful than the other teams. Thier biggest weakness is their individual classes, which all have massive and easily exploitable flaws.\n\n\nOverall, a brilliant game with a few flaws:\n\n-Ocasionally, it can be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t\n-Due to the game being a hobby for the devs, it is updated VERY slowly (It's been in beta since 2007)\n-A few days ago, a French YouTuber with 4.2 million subscribers made a video on the game, and all of the servers are completely full, the ones that aren't full, people there can't understand me anyway\n-Before the servers became totally full of the French, the only people who played were deathmatchers who refused to play on any map but bt_island (A good map, but any map gets boring after 80 constant hours)\n\nThat's about all I have to say.

The Pirates lack bulky classes and do poorly in fair fights. To make up for this, Pirates don't get into fair fights. Vikings are very fast and  on average, quite hardy and can deal considerable amounts of damage very quickly. However, they can be easily taken down with some harassed damage and avoiding a direct fight. The Knights, when working as a team, are generally more powerful than the other teams. Thier biggest weakness is their individual classes, which all have massive and easily exploitable flaws.\n\n\nOverall, a brilliant game with a few flaws:\n\n-Ocasionally, it can be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t\n-Due to the game being a hobby for the devs, it is updated VERY slowly (It's been in beta since 2007)\n-A few days ago, a French YouTuber with 4.2 million subscribers made a video on the game, and all of the servers are completely full, the ones that aren't full, people there can't understand me anyway\n-Before the servers became totally full of the French, the only people who played were deathmatchers who refused to play on any map but bt_island (A good map, but any map gets boring after 80 constant hours)\n\nThat's about all I have to say. Play this game now. Right now. Stop reading this review. Go! Now!\n\n\n9.4/10","July 11, 2015","true","154.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CryonicSuspension/recommended/17570/","CryonicSuspension","CryonicSuspension","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CryonicSuspension/","208 products in account","A fun game. Different maps have different goals. Arena is a "Last Man Standing" ( Last Team Standing ) map. My favourite game mode is on Booty Island: the Knights start off with 6 treasure chests. If they hold them for long enough, they win the game. The Vikings and Pirates try and steal the treasure chests and bring them back to their hideouts. There is a countdown timer, so you are on the clock. Picking up a chest from the enemy base and throwing it, will delay the clock. Which is why you see me picking up chests and throwing them into the ocean, as a denial tactic. This game is for the mischievous.\n\nThe game has the same mechanics as Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, which makes me think that Torn Banner ( Chivalry ) borrowed the game mechanics. PVKII has faster running speed, slightly less finesse but not necessarily less tactical complexity - the battlefield is mayhem. What's refreshing is that there are no cheese / exploit mechanics like in Chivalry. I have 333 hours in Chivalry, so I'm not saying that Chivalry is a bad game, Chivalry just has some high end exploits that advanced players like to use ( duck + 180 degree spin swing. Honestly duck should be taken out of the game. ).\n\nPVKII is a fun casual game ( casual in the sense that games take 2-6 minutes to play. There are hardcore players in the game ). You only need a few players on each team, to play a game, so don't let the low player count deter you.","June 10, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CryonicSuspension/recommended/17570/","CryonicSuspension","CryonicSuspension","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CryonicSuspension/","208 products in account","A fun game. Different maps have different goals. Arena is a "Last Man Standing" ( Last Team Standing ) map. My favourite game mode is on Booty Island: the Knights start off with 6 treasure chests. If they hold them for long enough, they win the game. The Vikings and Pirates try and steal the treasure chests and bring them back to their hideouts. There is a countdown timer, so you are on the clock. Picking up a chest from the enemy base and throwing it, will delay the clock. Which is why you see me picking up chests and throwing them into the ocean, as a denial tactic. This game is for the mischievous.\n\nThe game has the same mechanics as Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, which makes me think that Torn Banner ( Chivalry ) borrowed the game mechanics. PVKII has faster running speed, slightly less finesse but not necessarily less tactical complexity - the battlefield is mayhem. What's refreshing is that there are no cheese / exploit mechanics like in Chivalry. I have 333 hours in Chivalry, so I'm not saying that Chivalry is a bad game, Chivalry just has some high end exploits that advanced players like to use ( duck + 180 degree spin swing. Honestly duck should be taken out of the game. ).\n\nPVKII is a fun casual game ( casual in the sense that games take 2-6 minutes to play. There are hardcore players in the game ). You only need a few players on each team, to play a game, so don't let the low player count deter you.","June 10, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

However, there is one major problem I see in this game achieving greatness, its VERY small community. That small community being made up of mostly veteran players, it turns off many new players from staying in the game, thus keeping the player base about the same level. This game would definitely rise in greatness if many of the new players were to stay, allowing following new players something to do other than wait in respawn. This would then raise the fan base encouraging the devs to realease more content more fluidly.\n\nSo, yes, I do recommend this game, in the hopes for a stronger future for it.","January 17, 2014","true","96.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was very excited about this HL2 version pre release already, it is totally worth it. And the amount of players is actually high compared to the old days.

This game really a lot of fun, the voice lines are hilarious, the combat is genious, and the maps are amazing. I don't know why the playerbase is continuing to be french if this game is free, I guess kids these days don't look well enough or they just don't want to improve on this game, but really, this game is just to pull your competitive spirit out but not turning you into a silent tryhard. Overall, this game is so amazing, it never wears out because there are servers that host custom maps. At first, the combat may seem difficult, but the more you play it, the better you get, just like any other multiplayer PvP game.

As for cash shop or anything of the sorts, i didn't reall see one which in my opinion makes the game good by far. except ----v\n\nNegative Review:\nAs i mentioned above this, the hit detection is quite a bit off and can be quite annoying, and also there is the server problem, i picked the server that has good ping "or so it says" and when i joined everyone has 150 - 300 ping... making it almost impossible to hit anyone.... but everyone can hit you...\nanother problem with the servers... they are pretty much empty... now idk if it is because im US East or not, but there were only 3 games out of....50 servers? give or take 10.... 1 had 6 players, 1 had 2 and one "which had the worst ping" had 26 players.... i tried them all, and i could hardly kill anyone, out of my 0.7 hrs of play i got 3 kills or something around that and north of 20 deaths... i know maybe i could just suck at the game...true, but my chiv record says otherwise.\n\npersonal thoughts only:\nI didn't mind the game, but it's not for me... I'll stick with Chiv, but don't let this have you shy away from the game, no no no... give it a try this is just my personal thoughts, if the game looks interesting to you, go ahead and download it, it doesn't cost you anything and there is no cash shop as i mentioned. who knows you might be really good and love the game.","September 25, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The game is plagued with horribly unbalanced teams. Unless you're a Skirmisher, Sharpshooter, or Archer, you can expect most of your game time to be spent chasing after said enemies who can damage AS they outrun you, and they will. Maybe once in a while, you'll get a good actual fight in, but the times you spend being frustrated just overtakes it. It's fun if you can play with a bunch of friends who would abuse this imbalance, but otherwise I definately won't be coming back until this is fixed.","June 17, 2015","false","22.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

It does feel as though the game was made with love, but it's still an awkward, clumsy, and unpolished combat experience. I'm easily satisfied when it comes to melee combat but this game was actually hard to enjoy. Fights are just people running around each other swinging and swinging and swinging their awkward weapons until they die. They're long and unfulfilling.\n\nIf you're using one of the weapons worth using (as in, non-ranged and not one in which you hold down the attack button to repeat the little "chop-chop" animation), you look in a direction to choose which of your three attacks you're going to do, and there the weapon stays for as long as you hold that button. The idea is this "charges" your attacks, which is a welcome mechanic, but all it does is slow down your attacking. There is no flow, no comboing, no way to mix it up. You have three attacks that won't ever change and they're all made for a very small hitbox. You really can't drag it around either as you can in the aforementioned games, leaving you feel less like a warrior and more like a theme park robot. And in the event you raise up a fully charged attack, know that you aren't going to kill anyone. Everyone has what is effectively a dual health bar - one for health and the other for "armor" - and you'll be hacking at even an archer for quite a while before they die because of it. Seriously... You'll take your greataxe, walk up to an archer with a fully charged attack, bring it down on their head, and they'll just look at you like you were stupid to try it. Then they just walk away as you try to hit them the 3-4 more times it takes to kill them.\n\nThere exists a parry system like that of mount and blade, in that you must look a certain direction to ready the right parry. It's potentially nice if you have the presence of mind to use it, but in all likelihood, your opponent is going to miss that attack that you're prepared for, and most fights are just exchanges of swings. Parrying only seems worth it if you're incredibly practiced at it, and if you're using it in a duel, otherwise you just want to get out as much hitting as possible.\n\nEveryone is appropriately mobile, at least. The base run speed is quite fast and perfect as such, and everyone has a nifty little roll they can execute, although I'm unsure of how applicable it really is in a fight. You can't roll and transition smoothly into an attack.\n\nAre the teams balanced? I haven't played enough to say for sure, but it seems the pirates generally come out on top. In a game where hitting people to death is a tedious experience, the characters that can just shoot you as well as place powerful explosives are probably going to have an edge.","September 7, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

They try and make the game realistic by making a shield brake system and faction based classes, but then they fly off the reality track and make rifles 5 shot kills and swords are 10 hits.\n\nAs far as balance goes, dudes with diamond armor and 30ft. longswords plauge the game killing everything that moves, while guys with shortswords and shields struggle to see over their shield, and when they hit, its barely even noticed.\n\nUltimately, my rating for this game is a 4 out of ten, painfully average. it would've been lowered to maybe a 3 had it not been for the hilarious fart trick and the somewhat attractive gunplay.","April 10, 2015","false","3.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

It was fine in mount and blade because mount and blade is a single player game so winning isn't as important, but here it can be extremely frustrating to go into a battle knowing you are going to lose because the opponent reacts faster than you.","May 30, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

This birthed a group of legends who could have insanely sophisticated battles while parrying and attacking in a way no other game could even come close.\n\nThen one day the developers slapped all the loyal players across the face by removing the complex attack/parry system and made it "automatic" to accomodate the new players which is fine.\n\nBut they could have at least given servers the OPTION to have a "Hardcore" mode for the truly loyal veterans.

Stealing maps from ex-devs who left years ago, but claiming it a NEW map (check the REAL author for tortuga and when it was made, you will find it was created around 6 years before it was actually released as a "new map"), constantly desperate to take maps made by the community and make them official so the dev team can avoid doing any real work, even if said maps don't fit the theme in the slightest, or are fugly as hell and need dozens of revisions (which plenty of the official maps already get anyway which says a lot about their confidence in the first place) and to top it all off, the dev team has had a LOAD of behind-the-scenes drama with each other AND its own community. The biggest of these countless examples would probably be them giving the finger to the ORIGINAL CREATOR OF PIRATES, VIKINGS AND KNIGHTS on the goldsource engine, ultimately showing zero respect for authors of ACTUAL creativity (as is still practiced by them with their map theft and content-copying) considering the majority of everything created was based off of someone else's work, including multiple maps, biggest example obviously being bt_island.\n\nAvoid this ♥♥♥♥ at all costs. It is garbage, and is made by the embodiment of quite the same.
