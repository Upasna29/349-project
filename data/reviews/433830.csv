But this adds to feel of being cut off from the world in a hostile dungeon and living on what you find/magic up.\n\nI like the humour and the UI is quite easy to pick up, I also enjoy that the hand holding stops quite early on and the game just lets me figure out my own way to do things.","February 7","true","9.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There's plenty of secrets, interesting items, alchemy recipes, multiple approaches to the combat, different level-ups to suit your gameplay style and awesome 4th wall breaks. Highly recommended to any fan of Grimrock, Eye of Beholder, and any dungeon-crawling game, really!","April 26","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
