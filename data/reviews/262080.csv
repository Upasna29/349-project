Why does this even exist? How is this not priced lower? The sound design is literally painful enough to make one's ears bleed, the gameplay feels stupidly broken, enemy AI just stands there and shoots or gets shot by you. The damn computer voice that talks to you every 2 minutes sounds like he's trying to be funny, while going through puberty. This game is worse than torture, and nobody should have to suffer through it.\n\nStay away.\n\nStay far away.","February 26, 2014","false","0.7"," 566 of 637 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","566","637","18","51"

The only good thing I can say about this game is the concept sounded interesting. The game play is awful. The story line is childish. It's seriously repetitive. And what's the deal with that Jar Jar Binks sounding professor? Was this someones high school science project? Thank God it was on sale. I'd be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I'd payed full price for this. As it is I'm just sad that games like these exist on Steam. Maybe I'll finish it someday when I'm really, really, really, really, really, really, really bored.","March 15, 2014","false","2.3"," 95 of 103 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","95","103","7","0"

Oh, and don't look at my achievement, bug did it.\n\nAnd when i was progressing the level 2, i can see the "level select" has it, but the next day i wanted to continue, i selected the "Campaign 1" thoughtless, then i returned to menu, the level 2 in "level select" was gone, so i had to play level 1 again, "THAT" is bad, dude.\n\nAlthrough this is a indie game, but i think you can do better than this. there are some examples i think you can learn something from them: ME series, Magrunner: Dark Pulse, Alien rage, they all use UE3 Engine.\n\nAll in all, this game is "not bad", not great, not good, just "not bad", I hope the next game you can do better.\n\nBtw, this is my first review, sorry for my bad English and non-professional comment:P","March 11, 2014","false","3.0"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","51","57","0","0"

Robot is as cool as it will get, and this game is as Indie as it gets. Not to mention the old door opening and closing sounds, which are definetly from the first half-life games as it is. As well as the lab sounds. Combat broken.

Visually, it looks great, the reason why I was so excited to play it. However, upon playing it, I found a game riddled with plenty of technical and design flaws.\n\nI really wanted to like the game, but it was just too flawed. The voice acting is terrible, the optimization is terrible, the gunplay is below average. There’s just too much wrong with the game for me to like it. The concept was nice, and the visuals certainly back up that claim, but what use are visuals if the game can’t run on a high-end machine?\n\nYour money is best spent elsewhere.","April 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","0"

I'd been depressed for a long time, and my life was spiraling out of control. I was unemployed, spending all my time alone. I got to the point where I just wanted to end it. I was eating what I had planned to be my last meal with Steam on in the background. As I am tying the noose around my neck, tears rolling down my cheeks, I glance once more at Steam, my greatest source of company during my darkest moments and what do I see?\n\nIron Souls: 50% off.\n\nI thought to mysef: 'This is what I have been searching for, this is the answer'\n\nI removed the noose from my neck, eyes full of tears again, but this time they were tears of joy. I stepped down from the chair and immediately paid for and installed the game. I spent hours on my computer completing the game many times over and over. I had become one with the game, my souls had truly become Iron.\n\nI have since bought hundreds of copies to gift to anyone and everyone that I come across on Steam, to hopefully make their souls iron, as mine is.\n\nIron Souls gave me cancer and then subsequently cured my cancer\n\nIt saved my dying great uncle, got me a degree in Soul Ironing and got me over my heroin addiction.\n\nDont waste your money on rubbish like GTA V or DayZ. Get Iron Souls for a fraction of the price!\n\nGod bless you Iron Souls.","April 28, 2015","false","0.1"," 35 of 64 people (55%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","55","35","64","62","2"
