Then I played Crusaders of the Dark Savant and realized I was good at following the bread crumbs that easy to moderate RPGs lay out for us.\n\nThis game was incredibly difficult in the era when there was no gamefaqs.com to download walkthroughs on. When FAQs became a common theme, I re-installed and found it was still pretty tough. That being said, it has a unique world setting, a greatly diverse character class and race structure, and an extensive story-line that is unique and engaging.\n\nWizardry is not a world for the feint of heart, but for those who embrace a challenge, love RPGs and have an affection for Old School gaming, Crusaders of the Dark Savant is a challenge you must embrace. A stellar game that received far too little fanfare in it's day and is deserving of re-incarnation.","December 29, 2013","true","0.6"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","43","49","3","0"

You get more stuff with GoG.\n\nPlay the DOSBOX version if you can because Gold is very crippled by age and does not perform right on Modern machines. For example, the game screen is stuck at a 640x400 size... you can't change it sadly, unless you put the games shortcut in Compatibility mode, and force windows to temporarily resize your desktop resolution down to 640x480. Not a pleasant solution in my opinion.\n\nOther than those gripes, if you're not familar with old school CRPG games, you're going to ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game, because it is hard. Long. And unforgiving to noobs.  It ain't Final Fantasy. And it ain't Skyrim, scrub.\n\nHere's what not to look forward to:\nNo automapping- Nope not in this game kid. Back in my day we had to do this ♥♥♥♥ with grid paper and draw the maps ourselves. Good luck figuring out where the hell you are in the game. *Psst Gamefaqs got yo back G*\n\n♥♥♥♥ Stat Rolling system for created Characters-  Believe me, you will be doing this alot the first few times or so because the way the game is set up. You get 1 shot for stats per character creation. At the end of character creation, you either accept what you've rolled, or delete it... thus bringing you back to the character review screen where you'll have to go through the entire character creation process. It's an exhausting process,\n\nThousands of ♥♥♥♥ing words! - Hope you enjoy reading sport! Because that's what you'll be doing in this game. No voice acting here. The Gold edition does provide voice narration, but I honestly couldn't deal listening to the guy talk.\n\nThe plus to this game is the challenge it presents you. It's a very long dive.. if you do it right it could last you a month or so of game time.\n\nThe story is awesome! A mix of sci-fi and low fantasy. It's one of the few CRPGs that tied your party to the previous games. So if you beat Wizardry 6, and imported them into 7, whatever ending you got in 6 carries over into 7. It's pretty cool!\n\nI give this game 7/10 Donut Farts","March 19, 2014","true","7.9"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","39","48","4","0"

I hope you have played Wizardry 6 before thinking playing this Game. ;-)\nThis may have the better graphics and the sound is pretty amazing here, but rust me, play Wizardry 6 before or don't play this series at all.\n\nYou ask why?\nWell it's pretty simple while Wizardry 6 is hard as hell, I feel it's still waaaaay easier than this one. Additionally if you finish Wizardry 6 you can import your Party winto W7 and continue in this adventure.\nGenerally the Wizardry Series tend to be much harder than other dungeon crawler games, even the older ones, so if you're new to the genre, I really suggest you try Lands of Lore 1 and then Eye of the Beholder first.\n\nAlright, let's talk about W7.\nThe game is highly complex with a ton of spells, most of them useful in at least some scenarios. There are plenty of riddles in this game, a lot of them also requires to carefully read and note basically everything. A lot of information may just appear dead, but at some point, you need it.\nThe battles are sometimes tough and sometimes really easy. You can adjust the difficulty in some kind, that if the game gets too difficult you can change the classes of your party, which makes a lot of encounters trivial. But it may require some grinding at some point, altough I think you can make it through without senseless grinding. There are plenty of random encounters anyway.\nThe much harder thing in this game are the riddles and "quests". Did I mention that you don't have a quest book? Well you don't have one. The good thing is: You have a minimap. Well kind of. You have to raise the card drawing skill first and even then, it's not a full minimap.\nThe riddles and dungeon mechanics are so hard that I think if you play this game the first time without consultating a walkthrough you probably end up with 750 - 1000h of gameplay.\nThe game content is about 3 times as big as in Wizardry 6 and the map is huge. Additionally there are plenty of dungeons and they have some of the most annoying mechanics I've ever seen, which requires some map drawings even if you have the minimap.\n\nI really suggest this game to anyone who likes dungeon crawling games and is looking for a real challenge. This is as hard as it can get.","January 15, 2015","true","94.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","1"

It's also incredibly difficult.  Use a walkthrough if you ever get stuck (I recommend tk421.net/wizardry/wiz7walk.shtml).\n\nVery very basic tips:\n\n1) Initial party composition should have:\na) 2-3 melee fighter types (Fighter, Valkyrie, Lord, Samurai, Monk, Ninja).  I always recommend Valkyries over Lords as they are functionally the same class, but Valkyries gain levels faster.\nb) a defensive caster/healer (Priest or Alchemist)\nc) a thief-type (Thief, Bard, or Ranger).  I highly recommend a Bard.\nd) an offensive caster (Mage, Psionic, or Alchemist)\n\n2) Save often, and make backups of your saves.  It's easy to irreparably ♥♥♥♥ something up in a wway that will make you glad you had a save from 45 minutes prior.  Also, QUIT-NOSAVE if your friend.\n\n3) Many skills gain points on successful use.  Important ones include Skullduggery (gain a point when you successfully pick a lock or disarm a trap) and Ninjitsu (gain a point with every X number of succesful Hide attempts).  Ninjitsu affects your Monk/Ninja's intrinsic defensive ability.\n\n4) Crucial spells to gain access to: Heal Wounds, Cure Lesser Condition, Cure Poison, Identify.  Identify items before equipping/using them whenever possible.\n\n5) Quest items cannot be sold, but they can be dropped.  Do not drop anything unless you're pretty sure you don't need it anymore, and drop used quest items in a safe and easy-to-remember location in case you're wrong.\n\n6) There's a Journey Map Kit in the forest behind your initial spawn location.\n\n7) Explore and enjoy!  The game world is huge and immersive, and the humor is perfectly tongue-in-cheek.","September 18, 2015","true","41.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bought it again so I could finally finish the game. A thoroughly enjoyable, but very difficult, crpg.  The amount of race/class combinations and abilities is astounding.  The puzzles are almost impossible to figure out without the hint book.  Luckily, you get the hint book for free in the program's file folder.  Expect to reload saves often.\n\nI imported a party from Wizardry 6.  One downside is that it took a very long time before I found weapons and armor better than what I had imported with my party from the previous game. So a lot of the early treasure seems a bit worthless.\n\nIt takes a long time to finish this game.  Especially if you don't download one of the many save game file editors that are available. Expect to spend years trying to beat the game if you don't use the hint book. Some of the mazes are extremely complicated.\n\nYou certainly get a sense of accomplishment when you finally do complete the game.\n\nRecommended if you like Dungeons and Dragons, but want a few more options when leveling your character.  If you liked "Eye of the Beholder" or Wizardry 6, you'll probably like this as well.  Just keep in mind that the puzzles and mazes are significantly more complicated than "Eye of the Beholder."   Certainly beatable with the use of the hint book.","May 23","true","96.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
