"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanzlerin_maud/recommended/400020/","kanzlerin_maud","Glimglam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanzlerin_maud/","587 products in account","Why yes, I have played Atari today.\n\nAnd it was amazing.\n\nAs a collection, it's a great value. Contained within the Vault are faithful emulations of the original Atari arcade games, such as Asteroids, Centipede, Missile Command, and my personal favorite, Tempest. It even introduced me to a few I'd never had the chance to play, before -- Crystal Castles, Black Widow, Liberator, and Major Havoc are great fun, and I'm happy to have had the chance to try them out. Heck, even the original Pong arcade cabinet is here.\n\nThen you have a selection of perfectly-emulated Atari 2600 games, complete with 3D models of the original boxes and scans of the original manuals, to boot. (Even the aforementioned arcade games are represented with 3D recreations of their cabinets, too!) Many of them play best with multiple people, and thankfully, Atari Vault gives you the option for not only local multiplayer, but online multiplayer as well, on top of high score leaderboards.\n\nControls for each game are fully customizable, from a gamepad to a keyboard. Which is great, considering that a few of these games used to be controlled with a trackball or paddle. I used a Steam Controller for most of these games, and the touch-sensitive circle pads actually worked really well for paddle controller stuff. I found it could be somewhat over-sensitive at times, requiring me to adjust the settings a lot, but it wasn't a terrible inconvenience or anything. And -- I'm not sure if this is a bug or what, but -- on a few games in particular, pressing a button that is normally bound to an action (fire, special action, etc) causes it to open the game menu AND perform the action. That proved to be rather annoying, but it only happened a couple of times to me.\n\nAs for the overall game selection? Good, for the most part. While there's a few stinkers in there -- mostly a few of those sports games, painfully-boring "learning games" intended for very young children, and I'm not sure why an intriguing but nigh-unplayable prototype of Tempest for the 2600 is stuffed in there, but yep it's there too -- a lot of them are good, simple fun, which offsets the bad. Warlords is a blast, Yars' Revenge is a classic, Millipede is great fun, and Asteroids... well, it's Asteroids. It's hard to screw up Asteroids. The arcade versions of some 2600 games are obviously the superior version, but I like playing both of them, just to take note of and enjoy the differences. Though it's definitely missing a few 2600 games I would have liked to see (no Jungle Hunt? Battlezone? Berzerk, even?), it's a great collection on its own, even if most of the better 2600 games were produced by other companies or based on licensed properties.\n\nCriticisms? Well... emulation quality is fine, sound is okay, the menus and options are fairly easy to navigate... I suppose some of the manual scans are a bit on the fuzzy, low-res side, so it makes them kinda hard to read at times. And the "soundtrack" isn't very prevalent anywhere except the menus, where you are bound to spend essentially 5% of your overall playtime in. It sounds fine, if a little forgettable. Maybe an option to include tunes (or your own personal songs) during gameplay would be welcome? (I for one like to play the Tempest 2000 soundtrack while I'm playing Tempest, but that's just me.) These aren't serious or grating issues for me, though.\n\nNow, despite my glowing praise, I would have to say my recommendation is "conditional", in a sense.\n\nBy all means, these games are classics, and I believe it's important to preserve and remember them. Reintroducing these titles to the newer generation is also something I enjoy the prospect of. But, well... if you aren't nostalgic for these games, then you should be aware that these are from a very different period of videogame history. These games are very simple, both in concept and design. Reading the manual is usually required. They may confuse and frustrate you as easily as they can inspire and entertain. They can potentially offer hours upon hours of enjoyment, or you can play them for five minutes and get bored. Yet, at twenty dollars for a hundred games, there's not much risk involved. Why not give it a try? Set a few high scores while you're at it, too.\n\nTL;DR, a great collection of Atari classics and an excellent value to boot. You really can't go wrong.","March 24","true","4.4"," 111 of 123 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","111","123","10","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mkohary/recommended/400020/","mkohary","Karma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mkohary/","353 products in account","Disappointing execution of some classic games.  The biggest issue is, sigh, as always, controls for the trackball and rotary dial games like Tempest, Warlords, Centipede, etc.  It's simple, right?  Map the mouse to act as a trackball or dial?  It shouldn't be that hard.  It ISN'T that hard, seeing as how many other pieces of software manage to do this just fine.  But not Atari Vault.  Either the mouse can't be set to be sensitive enough to make the game playable (even at the highest sensitivity setting) or it just flat-out doesn't work.\n\nThat said, the joystick games work just fine, either mapped to a keyboard or with a variety of gamepads.  Even there, though, you cannot turn v-sync on and so most games exerpience "tearing".  Just really lazy execution here.  The in-menu extras like manuals and PR documents are cool, but are scanned in low-res and sometimes aren't even legible.  The overall presentation is slick enough, but there wasn't enough attention paid to detail and the result is that this product feels slapped together as just another lazy appeal to nostalgia.\n\nWhen will game companies give us an alternative to legally questionable means of playing these classic games?  And I don't mean packages thrown together with a few games (or even 100, which is still a fraction of the number of games available for the Atari 2600 alone), but a truly viable commercial option for playing classic games?  If you were hoping Atari Vault would be the first one, no dice.  Save your $20 and stick with alternative options - you know what they are.","March 27","false","1.8"," 119 of 154 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","119","154","9","4"

Each game is represented by a Cabinet, complete with the original art that you would find right on the real thing. Getting into a game of Black widow to check out the graphics of one of the games, It looks exactly like how I remember it from the good ol' arcade down memory lane. You can clearly see what represents what, and best thing is: It all runs clearly on your computer screen. I ran this on a plasma screen TV, and there was no quality loss on the resolution. For other things, you also getbonus Art from the original covers, and even the Manuals for the games for newcomers, Or if you're like me, for Nostalgia-driven Nerds. Loved looking through them then, and I still love looking at them now.\n\nSOUND: Just like I was stuck with awe at the menu, the theme for it is fantastic. Something I will never get annoyed with. Going into black widow again, the sounds are spot on. All those beeps and blips from the good ol' days are back again, and they sound fantastic. Nothing to complain about!\n\nGameplay: Now here's the Shining Jewel on the Golden Crown: The Multiplayer Capabilities, and the Leaderboards. The Leaderboards are just what you expect: They show all the top scores out of your friends, AND in the world. Wanna be the best? Better get crackin' at those Top scores! There's 100+ of these games, so you're in for hours of fun and hard work! And the biggest, and greatest change, is that you don't even need to be at your friends house in order to whoop him at that game of Warlords! Yup, there's ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. Me and a buddy both got the collection and tried a game of Asteroids to see the lag issue, and I can safely say there were no problems on either end. It's seamless, and it works perfectly.\n\nControllers are no problem, either! like using a Mouse and Keyboard? GO ahead! Xbox One controller? No problem! I spent a few minutes testing a bunch of controllers I had, including the Keyboard, Mouse, Xbone controller, A U-TRAK Arcade Trackball for Missile Command (Just for that authenticity, and my Very own USB Arcade stick, and ALL WORKED FLAWLESSLY. No input lag, not even on the trackball which I was worried about the most!\n\n\nOVERALL: Guys, even if you're a Gaming Veteran like me, or even a gamer starting fresh and new, this has fun to be had. It's One hell of a collection that I myself, am glad Atari brought over.","March 25","true","0.9"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","59","67","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/recommended/400020/","dreadjester","DreaddJester","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/","321 products in account","Come to relive the classics, stick around for 3D Tic Tac Toe and Video Pinball!\n\nNo course in the history of video games would be complete without this collection of games.  As you play each game you'll recognize bits and pieces that helped shape the games we play today.  Personally, as an old fart gamer, I remember each and every one of these.  I played them all for hours on end.  I know for you young pups it's hard to understand how anyone could spend hours playing most of these games but in their time they were the most awesome games ever!!\n\nSo what do you get for your hard earned money here.  Well you get 100 classic Atari games.  A handful of them are Arcade versions but the greater majority of them are Atari 2600 games.  Controls are a bit funky but they were with that Atari joystick that we had to keep taking apart and fixing all the time too.  There's certainly some standout games like Asteroids, Centipede, Missile Command, Tempest, and Crystal Castles.  There's some seriously retro ones for you game historians that want to say you've played the earliest of games like Pong, Breakout, Outlaw, and Combat.  Then there's a host of ones that have been forgotten Yar's Revenge, Sword Quest, and Haunted House.  I think there's literally something for everyone in this package, if you like seriously retro games.\n\nTrouble is, most of them you'll end up playing long enough to remember the game or see what it was like, then never play it again because the new games have so much more shiny lights.  There are however a handful of games on here that might keep you coming back.  3D Tic Tac Toe is an awesome game in concept.  When I told my 20 year old son about it (he'd never even heard of it) and explained how to win he asked why nobody ever picked up that game again and remade it.  For all you pinball fans out there you have to try Video Pinball.  I think it was one of the very first video versions of pinball ever.  I remember literally sitting for hours playing the same game.  If memory serves me correctly I maxed out the score once.  BTW pro-tip on that one, you can nudge the table and it's helps, a lot......  Checkers, Chess, and Combat might be fun to play online or locally with friends.\n\nAt the end of the day it really depends on who you are and what your gaming tastes are when determining if you should get this one or not.  If modern graphics and depth of gameplay are super important to you then I'd say don't get this.  If you hate grinding or repetitive gameplay then you probably shouldn't get this.  However, if you love retro games, seeing where your modern games started from, or are an old fart like me that wants to relive a little of the old days of gaming this is a great gem and should be in your collection.  Personally, I love it and recommend it.  Your mileage may vary.","March 24","true","2.2"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","41","45","3","3"

Hopefully, other publishers like Midway, Capcom, Techmo, Taito, and Activision will follow suit and release their classic arcade and console collections in a similar manner.\n\nNote:  Overall, I've found that the games in the collection work better with a Steam controller than an XBox 360 controller.","March 24","true","2.8"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

So if you read a review writing about control issues, be aware that most of them are patched already.\n\nPing\nEver wondered if could you play Pong against one of your friends online? Loved watching Sega Fanboy Mark of Classic Game Room playing Centipede and Missile Command and eagered to do the same? Well, now you can. And it would be a huge mistake not to do that.\n\nAtari Vault brings you hours of fun. In the last two hours I realized how I suck at Breakout, still it's fun to suck at it. A great collection of Atari 2600 and Arcade cabinet games for a fair price.\n\nThe devs did a good job here. You can play two-player games online with a friend, however, you should know that there's not a large chance to just find an online game with some random folk to play with, so you have to discuss it in advance.\n\nThere are only a dozen of achievements, but when you get them you can feel like you really achieved something. Even if it doesn't seem so by just reading their description. Like "Clear a screen in Super Breakout". Doesn't sound too hard, does it? How hard can it be to clear a screen in a breakout game? Well, it is. So you'll find a good challenge here.\n\nPong\nPros:\n\nA great collection with nice emulation and a lots of fun\nNo FPS-lock (sadly it has to be mentioned)\nSteam Controller support!!! With different pre-set profiles for the games.\nLeaderboards and achievements\nOnline play\nGreat menu music\nIt has a neon grid intro. Neon is the future! Or at least it was in the 80s!\nYou have an Atari logo on your screen when you start it. At that very moment you already feel it worth the price!\nBe aware:\n\nThe graphics options are a little bit "barebone", all you have is resolution, bezel art on/off and vector emulation style. However, the latter is a nice touch!\nThe main menu is not too intuitive to navigate\nUnless hundred thousands of people buys this, be aware that you need someone if you want to play online. I don't think there would be a great chance to just hang out and wait until someone plays Pong with you. It's sad, but multiplayer CoD is somewhat more popular than multiplayer Pong.\nBonus City\nSure, the graphics in the 70s and early 80s weren't that good, and the games looks simpler in today's standard. Still they give you a great challenge and hours of fun. Get it if you can enjoy a game without fancy 3D. Then feel rad when you spend hours playing Super Breakout on your $2000 gaming rig. :)","March 26","true","10.7"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","27","34","4","0"

IT ONLY NEEDS A JOYSTICK AND 3 BUTTONS and the 2 gamepads with a joystick and 8 buttons each apparently isn't enough!!\n\nIssues I came accros within 20 minutes:\n-Player 1 and 2 are swapped with no way to change the order.\n-The UI interface is not allowing me to use the joystick to navigate and is asking for a D-Pad that does not exists forcing me to connect a keyboard and mouse.\n-The button configuration does not allow me to to change what button starts a game, it wants the Xbox Start button which does not exist on the JAMMA arcade controllers attached to the cabinet. so the only way is to connect a keyboard and hit esc to start.\n-It crashes about every 5 minutes.\n-Half of the games I tried did not work because they required a D-Pad instead of the joysticks for what ever reason.\n-The menu's often freak out and don't allow selections to be made after swapping menus a couple times making it impossible to switch off the side options panel until restarting the application.\n-Some of the games simply don't load, it just silently closes the application.\n\nThis makes me extraordinarily sad because I was extremely excited to run this on my arcade cabinet and play these amazing games.

Upon first loading I intended a quick 5min look, 2hrs later I was still glued to my screen. "They don't make them like they used to". While some other packs might nickle and dime, Atari provides great value for money with a well arranged group of classics. Some may only entertain a few minutes for nostalgia sake but I can all but guarantee others should keep you coming back for more. Personally I feel there's enough to justify the price with the included 'arcade/cab' games.\n\nFew things that made it stand out was UI. Both clean and quick to navigate with some well thought out categories. Most games instantly loaded and I was able to drop back to the main screen without troubles. Didn't have many issues with controls but I agree with some other recommendations in saying rebindable options for certain games would be nice. What impressed me most was the overall 'performance' and when I say this I mean how things looked on modern screens. Often when emulating older games I've run into issues with screen tearing and otherwise. Not only was it smooth but currently using a 120hz panel that some modern games have had issues with.\n\nInclusion of leaderboards and local/online multiplayer for many of the games is just the icing on the cake. Atari Vault gets my recommendation as one of the best retro collections on steam and is well worth checking out or adding to your wishlist.

You can kind of navigate in the menus with an Xbox360 controller, sometimes I had to use the mouse, but probably because I missed all what I can do with the controller, I guess.\n\nNostalgia at its best, in a modern presentation. You can host a multiplayer game or join some, probably more for friends than randoms, because there won't be thousands, even hundreds, playing them in multi or hosting a game and waiting for someone...\n\nI've bought it for Breakout and Yars Revenge (it was a blast playing it again!).\nI would recommend it for a nostalgic trip only, not every old good Atari games are there but there is enough for a couple of nights trying some. If you don't understand them, there is scanned manuals that you can read and zoom. I would have liked modernized manuals instead of scanned ones, because sometimes the fonts are hard to read.\n\nThere are some games that either with keyboard, mouse or Xbox360 controller, the contols don't feels right. Especially Breakout, the paddle feels like mouse acceleration effect, not very good. But this is saved because there is other games... I read somewhere that they recommend the Steam controller, but anyway I would say be aware that you can have some frustrations with some controls in certain games.\n\nYou have a leaderboard for 17 of the 18 arcade games ( Pong have no "score").\n\nI have bought this on another website and it included 20 Intellivision games pack and 40 Colecovision games pack, so I could not be disapointed with Atari Vault price for sure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/400020/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Atari Vault is a collection of over 100 Arcade and Atari 2600 ranging from sports to blowing up asteroids in space. With this massive selection of games to choose from you will likely spent hours just trying all the games and staring at the included scans of the box art, arcade machine or cartridge for each title. It is both a love letter to those that loved the old Atari company and a great introduction to games of the past in one convenient package. These are quite clearly decade old games with no graphical improvements whatsoever so they will obviously look outdated and the only addition to the graphical presentation are some nifty borders unique to each game. The biggest feature to this collection of games is the ability to use controllers for each game and have custom bindings on a game per game basis which really helps keep you playing as you can fine tune to your liking and never worry about it again.\n\nMost of the games had optimal controller bindings but games like Brickout or Warlords that require a paddle simply do not play well on a controller and makes precise movements much harder. Along with the controller you can use either mouse or keyboard which can also be rebinded however you please. For games that were originally for the paddle using the mouse is really the only way to properly play them if you plan on being any good at them. Now highscores have much more reach than bragging in your local arcades hangout as each game has their own leaderboards to compete against your friends or people around the world. The second biggest feature of this compilation is the ability to play with your friends or random people online though I was sadly unable to use this feature over the course of four days testing as no one plays online. You can be the host and try to set up a match while still being able to play games which is nice but without a community it is kind of pointless. Hopefully it gathers a following in the future but if you are looking for online play you will need to find a friend with this title as of now.\n\nWhile the games themselves have no improvements I was pleasantly surprised to see the Atari Vault running at 2560x1440p @ 165hz. It makes little to no real difference in the games but it's always nice to have it running at your monitors native resolution and not locked at 1080p 30fps like so many modern games. With Arcade games you can change the lives, difficulty and various other factors while the Atari 2600 games require you to first boot up the game before being able to change anything. It's a nifty little selection screen that is a far better alternative than getting up, flicking the “game select” switch on the console and wondering just what it did if you no longer had a manual. For those that don't know, most Atari 2600 games had multiple modifications to the core gameplay that you could choose from in order to keep the game from getting stale. It also retains the Atari 2600's feature of being able to choose whether to display in color or in black and white if you so choose.\n\n100 games is quite a lot of content no doubt but keep in mind that these are very old games where the point of them is to play for fun or for the highscore. It is primitive compared to today's games and most don't even have music, only bleeps and bloops. With that out the way they are still as fun to play now as they were back then. Even without the realistic graphics and captivating soundtracks of modern games there is still something immensely charming about a pure focus on gameplay and sound effects so primitive that you can't help but kick back and relax. These are the type of games you'd play when you are short on time and want some quick fun. Get in intense dogfights in the Red Baron, continue to suck at Centipede and out drive bandits in Fatal Run all before work or school. With 97 more games to try out and plenty of them having different modifiers to the gameplay you’re bound to find a couple of games that will have you hooked and wanting to make your way up the leaderboard. Atari Vault is definitely a must buy title if you have fond memories of playing Atari's 2600 console or arcade machines and a perfect title for those wondering what gaming was like back then.","April 5","true","2.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

If you want to experience some of the oldest entries in the Atari arcade and 2600 catalogues, you've come to the right place. If you want to experience what many consider the best games on those two platforms, maybe not so much.\n\nThe package of Atari Vault itself is largely excellent. Code Mystics specialises in bringing retro games to modern systems and they did a great job here. The emulation is excellent, the presentation of the menus and the bezel artwork is well done and there are a bunch of visual historical extras you can look at, though the scan quality varies. All the games that support two players have full local multiplayer capabilities and to my great surprise, online play! I have no idea how well it works as I unfortunately couldn't find any games. The arcade titles also have online leaderboards which is a very nice value add.\n\nThe controller support is a bit of a let down. Controllers are indeed supported and you can remap the buttons to boot but navigating the menus with a controller is clumsy and unintuitive and there's really no reason for it. You'll often find yourself getting frustrated trying to figure out how to get them to pick the thing you want. For a collection that begs to be played on a TV, this is kind of ridiculous. This can definitely be patched and I hope it is.\n\nAs for the games, they're some of Atari's oldest offerings. Many of the arcade games are vector based and look quite good, plus Code Mystics added some options to adjust the vector display intensity. Some true classics like Tempest, Major Havoc, Asteroids, Crystal Castles and more are in this lineup and they play quite well for the most part. This is the part that really impressed me. The Atari 2600 line is decidedly more of a let down for me. There's some gems in there like Yar's Revenge but to me, most of the best 2600 games came from third parties like Activision and this being an Atari published package, you aren't going to find those here. Many first party Atari 2600 games haven't aged well at all and if you really are gushing with nostalgia for them, you'll find them pretty rough to play and largely uninteresting.\n\nOverall, this is a very nicely put together package that's had more effort put into it than many others. Whether or not you like the games on offer is going to be down to what you like so take a look at the list first and make sure it's what you want before putting down money. If you are into those games though, there's no better way to play them.","April 7","true","1.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","2"

For almost every game here, there are probably dozens of games that do it better in every way for FREE available online.\n\nIf you are wanting to buy this to try and re-create all the fun and joy you remember having playing these games back in the 80's, like I was hoping for.. you might feel disappointed.  However, if you go in understanding that this collection will really only hold a significant value as "nostalgia", then it might be worth the price.\n\nI used to be a Missile Command and Arcade Asteroids fan back in the day.. but this collection while true to the original games just didn't have anywhere near the same appeal today.  This collection was a refund for me, with the possibility of picking it up again if it goes on sale at 50% to 80% off.. should that ever happen.\n\nHope this helps someone make a choice while not making too many people shy away from a purchase.  ..Remember that you always have 2 weeks and 2 full hours of game time to refund this collection if you decide the value isn't there, just like I did.","March 28","false","2.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucksfaninrowx/recommended/400020/","bucksfaninrowx","Tempest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucksfaninrowx/","41 products in account","I purchased Atari Vault only for the arcade games.  The initial release was unplayable, but there have been two major updates that have improved the product greatly.  Any reviews prior to update 1.0.2 are obsolete.\n\nFor Missile Command and Millipede, there is still a significant issue with the trackball control in that if you roll the trackball fast and let go, the object that you are controlling with the trackball will sail too far resulting in imprecise control.    I have tried to change the settings for the mouse in Windows 10 OS to a slower movement, but this did not help.  There is a "follow mouse" option, which annoyingly shows the image of the cursor, and is therefore worthless.\n\nFortunately, the trackball works fine as a surrogate spinner in Tempest, Pong, and Super Breakout.  Tempest has a cheat mode that allows the game to start at any bonus level without the need to earn the level, just like in Atari Anniversary.\n\nThe games that use only buttons, including Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Space Duel, and Gravitar, are perfect as far as I can tell.  Asteroids Deluxe even has the option to hide the background.\n\nThere are other emulators, such as Atari Anniversary, Atari 80 Classic Games in One, and others, that for the most part handle the trackball issue better than Atari Vault, although Missile Command in Atari Anniversary moves the site in a diamond when you move the trackball in a circle.\n\nThe developer is very responsive to feedback and is courteous.  Issues with the trackball notwithstanding, I still highly recommend Atari Vault, because Tempest, Asteroids, Asteroids Deluxe, Space Duel, Gravitar, and Black Widow are awesome and work perfectly or essentially perfectly, the developer is committed to Atari Vault, and because most of the other emulators will not work on Windows 10.  Hopefully with enough support, this fine developer will bring more Atari games and perhaps arcade games from other companies to Steam.\n\nI love the music in the intro.","May 7","true","25.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Full steam controller support is nice, though.\n\nFirst, almost all of the 2600 games are shovelware while most of the ones you hope for are missing due to licensing. You don't get River Raid, but you do get... Concentration. Yay.\n\nThe nice part is that every game comes with the original manual/flyer. It's really awesome to look over this classic stuff. You can also look at the full boxes for the 2600 games and the cabinets for the arcade titles. The manuals for the 2600 games are especially important, as you'll have to read most of them before playing the game. They might be simple, but they are NOT intuitive.\n\nBut that little bit aside, it's a disappointing collection. Weird resolution options, game glitches, and lack of display options hold it back. It does keep things at the right ratio by including nice bezel art, but why the lack of screen filters? Why make me select the options for the 2600 at a menu instead of flipping switches on a 2600 itself? That would have been an awesome touch!\n\n","March 30","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The claim of 100 games is a little loose, but that said still good value for money.\n\nA lot of the games port well to the PC and the controller (I think a game controller is pretty much a must have), but unfortunately a few port very badly.\n\nBack in the day you had analogue controllers with dials on them to adjust bat position in games like pong and breakout.  Unfortunately this doesn't translate well to a modern controller and the speed sensitivity is terrible.  There's a few games of this style on the compilation and they fall into one of two categories, either the bat moves so slow it's unplayable, or the bat moves so fast, it's unplayable.\n\nMoving past that you'll find some true gems, a few versions of asteroids, some truly unique arcade hits like Gravitar and Black Widow as well as yes another version of asteroids called space wars (we got colours).  Classics like Crystal Castle port very well and are pretty much as addictive today as they were.\n\nSo in short, do all games port well?  NO.\n\nIs there enough that it's worth the money?  YES in my opinion as I'm a fan of many of these games from the 70's and 80's.\n\nYou'll need to be patient, you'll need to learn how to play the games but they're still great fun the mechanics in many of them are sound and there's something soulful in playing the predescessor to modern RPG's, Adventure.","March 26","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The emulation is more accurate than previous attempts and the HD display configurations really make for a crisp look.  It's hard to go wrong with a collection of 100 games such as this.  at $20 or less.\n\nThat said, I hope the following items will be patched soon:\n-Some of the sounds are still off, emulation wise.  My prime examples include Major Havoc, Black Widow, and on the 2600 side, Circus Atari (how you can mess up the sounds on that one, I do not know).\n-Trackball/paddle control.  Horribly innacurate and imprecise.  Not sure how the Steam controller works with it, but it can't be much better than the actual mouse.\n-Since emulators can do the controls and sounds more justice, you would think that a collection you're paying money for would be able to do them at least as well.\n\nThis is still, by a wide margin ,the best compilation you're going to find on Steam, and better than any previous Atari collection yet seen.

For instance, you select the different games by rotating through a lineup of either the arcade cabinets or video game boxes, both being historically accurate. There's also included scans of the instructions, and nice touches like being able to select between a modern options menu, and one that looks like the Atari 2600 switches (nice bit of nostalgia).\n\nIf there's any downside, it's that this doesn't really capture the range & quality of the Atari 2600 library, but in all fairness, that's due to the fact that these are all games made by Atari, rather than 3rd party licensed games like ones from Activision (which was an *entirely* different kind of company back then). I'm obviously not faulting them for this, but I am naturally inclined to want to play those games now. That said, the game selection is really the best that Atari had to offer, and it's a fantastic lineup.\n\nIt was easy to get sucked in by the gameplay of classic arcade titles such as Centapede & Asteroids. It goes to show the appeal that action-arcade games had back in the 70's & 80's of very short, but fast paced intensity that uses a risk vs. reward system to encourage your skill level to determine your score. Speaking of which, there are leaderboards, both local & worldwide, so you can see how terrible your skills of deterriated from age... Or maybe that's just me. Either way, this is a collection heavy on the nostalgia put together in a nice package. Worth picking up!","March 27","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Dozens of the game can be played online, and it really breathes new life into old classics.  Games like Combat! Outlaw, Surround,  Bowling, Basketball, and even 3D Tic Tac Toe feel new and vibrant when playing against online foes.  I have not enjoyed these games this much in 30 years.\n\nThere are few bugs though.  Some games offer multiplayer whre there is no multi-player to be had (i.e. Basic Math). Also, games exit out abruptly and don't let you see the final score.  This is espcially apparent in mutli-player games where there is no option to rematch or replay, and the game ends before you can even see who won.  However, even with this issue,s it's a great package and shows a lot of promise if Atari can keep it going.\n\nFor an update/DLC/version 2.0 I'd suggest adding any Lynx games Atari has the rights for, as the Comlynx games would play well here.  Also, any classic 8-bit Computer games would be nice, including Star Raiders, Caverns Of Mars, etc. Ditto for 5200 and 7800 games.    Also, 2-player cpin-ops like X's and o's Atari football would be awesome to play online.\n","March 27","true","297.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But playing Atari games locally with a second player is more fun as you can laugh at each other failing at retro games and the keyboard/mouse controls (which probably don't hold a candle to the original controls like steering wheels ...)\n\nThe Bad:\nWould be nice to offer updated graphical reimaginings of the original games as a display option, like the Atari classics collection on PSP. (not sure what it's called, but it was a solid game with good design)\n\nApparently won't work with "arcade controllers" according to hardcore fan who tried to put this in an arcade cabinet.\n\nDoesn't have Battlezone. Red Baron is fun, but Battlezone is a great game that should not have been left out.\nNo E.T. or Indiana Jones for the masochists.\nDLC anyone?\n\n\nConclusion:\nIt has a nice interface to choose the games from at main menu. Box arts and manuals are nice. Games are fun. Multiplayer is good idea if it works.\n\nBUY if you just want something to play while waiting for the next Hitman 2016 episode to come out, or if you're like me, spend that some that large sum of money you got from your Hitman refund when you found out about the always online DRM policy.\n\nBUY NOT if you already have a source for the original game files and you can get them running on modern or retro hardware of your choice","March 28","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Running it in it's native resolution would be nice as well as I owned an asteroids deluxe for a few years. also, the game freaks out if you try adjusting the resolutions. a glitch maybe?\n\nGraphical settings are malfunctioning.

I used to play Warlords on the Atari 2600 with my sister and father many many years ago. We had 4 paddles. It was great fun.

Moving of the sheilds was originally done by paddle on the Atari 2600. A mouse doesn't work properly in Warlords. It barely moves the shield. Even it at it's at maximum setting.

Warlords  can sort of be played with a joystick, but doesn't campare to what it was like playing it with the paddle.\n\nSuper Break out somewhat well with a mouse and it set to it's maximum setting.\nCentipedes doesns't work well with mouse.

Using a mouse in "Paddle" or "Trakball" mode in Centipede, Millipede, Super Breakout and Pong is not nearly senstive enough to be playable, even at max. Analog controls for Tempest are barely senstive enough at "10", but then the sensitivitiy will randomly change between levels. This otherwise seems a great collection, and I was looking forward to playing these analog-input games with a mouse, but this entire part of the experience seems broken a the moment. There is a "follow-mouse" mode that works well enough for some of the games (not Tempest), BUT you have to look at a flickering mouse cursor OVER the game, which looks bad, and should also be fixed or removed. Fixing the software so as to be able to control all these games correctly with a mouse, and without looking at a mouse cursor at all should be a priority, IMO.\n\nEdit: As of v1.0.2, mouse controls for Pong, Super Breakout, and Missile Command are fixed and beautifully responsive. The mouse controls for Centipede, Millipede and Tempest have also been changed, but they've gone in the complete opposite direction to a fault.  All settings except "1" and "2" seem too sensitve, but more importantly, the controls for these three games seem too loose, no matter the setting, having a bit too much interntia. Playing these three games on original hardware, or even old Windows versions is still feels much more precise than this collection. A shame, because it's these three games I would love to play with great controls the most. Unfortunately my top three reasons for wanting this product are still spoiled.

DUH--- I just needed to change my template from the official template to the keyboard and then map to my hearts content. I think this will resolve my complaint. If it does work I'll likely change this to a thumbs up.\n***EDIT END***\n\nA don't buy if you love to use your Steam Controller and not having the expected customizations will make you disappointed in the games delivery even if the games themselevs are as great as they have ever been.\n\n---Edited/Added part ---\nLet's be very clear. I have had two responses that were trying to blame the steam controller. This is definitely not an issue with the controller it is an issue with how Code Mystics created the "vault", wrappers around the games and the controller mappings. Steam nor the controller has anything to do with the fact that if you choose the controls menu in the game if you are running a steam controller it will not let you select a basic gamepad, keyboard or mouse and that the game doesn't recognize if you change the controller to use the "legacy" controls such as a scroll wheel for a paddle even if you map the motion to "move up" "move down" etc.. Once you select something outside of their custom input types which have no or little settings for sensitivy etc. the game no longer responds to input. This is entirely an issue wiht how Code Mystics implemented the game interfaces. The games themselves are fine just don't be a person spoiled as am I by my Steam Controller and adjusting it infinitely because this game does not allow you to do so. I can certainly map thrust to left trigger in Asteroids and that works fine. Most things it doesn't matter. These games were played with a joystick and 1-4 buttons and that was it. But when I want to adjust the sensitivity on the stick or pad I expect to be able to do so.\n--Edited/Added part end\n\nI have yet to play this much but I am very disappointed in how it handles the Steam controller. Maybe I am missing something but they made the steam controller into a dumb device. At first I was stoked to see an action set for each game. Nice! was my thought. Until I tried to play Pong and decided I wanted to use the left haptic as a scroll wheel, you know... like a paddle and change the sensitivity. Again, maybe I am overlooking something but it was a no go. I went in to change it and it woul dlet me change from the supplied custom layout to a "legacy" layout which is just the normal Steam controller options. If I choose to use it as a scroll wheel I tried setting the clockwise to down and counter-clockwise to up (or vice-versa) and adjust the sensitivity but when I went back into the game it didn't work. The pad now did nothing.\n\nI decided I would go into the control options for the game and tell it to treat it as keyboard input and map the keys to the controller. Nope. If you are using the steam controller it closes off that menu andsays you can't set for keyboard and use your steam controller like a native steam controller. Whoever set this up doesn't seem to have ever really played many games with a steam controller because as far as I can tel they made it into an almost worthless appendage.\n\nI will keep trying. Maybe I missed something and if I did I'll uupdate this review but this is truly sad otherwise.","March 25","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

It's a pretty broad selection with several 3D arcade games I've heard about, but never played. For example, Major Havok is an insane genre mashup and is seriously worth checking out to see how ahead of its time it was. Some games are hillariously bad simulations or brain teaser quests that require you to read the manuals (which are included).\n\nThe UI is weird and bubbly, but does a nice job of labelling all the mode selection. Mouse input does ok for replacing paddle wheel controlls, but doesn't feel right in the trackball games. Overal a very well tought out and excellent preservation of the good and the bad.","May 28","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
