Oh wait, yes I can [puts finger on it]---it's repetitive and dull.\n\nThe Good:\n- Decently fun weapon selection.  Infinite ammo on basic weapons.\n- Decent graphics.\n- Big explosions. Big booms.\n- It has a partially destructible environment, which gives you a sense of your firepower.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Bad music.\n- Enemies are repetitive and there's little enemy variety.\n- If you took out the cutscenes you'd have no idea you're on a different mission.  They're all the same and look the same.\n- The plot was... Wait, was there a plot? I think I was trying to save someone from something.\n- To get weapon upgrades you have to collect money. The only way to get enough money is to break open the crates and boxes strewn everywhere.  That's just boring.  It's also why I stopped playing Hammerwatch.\n- The variations in difficulty from one area to another can be immense, and inexplicably so.\n\nI wanted to like this game, I miss the old school run and gun games, since I am of The Old School. But this didn't scratch the itch at all, it only made it itch worse. I don't recommend this game.  It's fine for an hour or so, but doesn't deliver longer than that.\n","October 9, 2014","false","0.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

So $1.25 an hour is a good deal. Also, the multiplayer is unplayable because it constantly crashes so I can't play it with my friend online and have to play single player only, which sucks because it is the most fun with a friend. But it is still a blast single player. It is like a combination of the oldschool arcade shooters NARC and Smash TV. You get to mow down hordes of bad guys and say hilarious badass action movie one-liners such as "explain that to your wife". You can blow the fk out of everything in sight and there are explosions everywhere like nothing you have ever seen before. ♥♥♥♥ gets bonkers fast and every level is like that from start to finish. The only downside is sometimes it can get stupidly hard but those parts are passable after only a few retries. I can also easily see how a lot of people would simply just not be able to beat the last boss because of how completely nuts the fight is. I got him on like my 5th or 6th try. The absolute best help you can give yourself in this game is to use a controller like I do (using a wired xbox 360 controller).\n\nIf you are lucky enough to play multiplayer with a friend, good for you. If not, it is still worth catching on sale for an absolute blast of a time. 0/10 unplayable MP, 7/10 SP. And if instead of blowing up huge stacks of cocaine bricks you could dive into them face first while inhaling deeply, it would easily be a 10/10.","March 10, 2014","true","3.8"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","27","51","0","0"

Maybe not the best ever but it's definitely worth the asking price and it's a steal for $2.49 I paid in the Lunar New Year sale.\n\nI've only played single-player so I can't speak to the multi-player, local or online co-op.  Also, I've only played with a keyboard and mouse but I'm going to try a controller to see if it's any different/better.\n\nAt any rate, I highly recommend this game if you're looking for some explosive top-down, twin-stick mayhem.","February 11","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(See: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/all_thumbs for a list of titles) If you have them all or are not looking to spend a lot of money for, waves of enemies, lots of explosions, lots of bullets, co-op action, and decent graphics, Narco Terror is a good choice to satisfy that need.\n\nOverview\nGameplay: Co-Op Twin Stick Shooter.\nGraphics:  Decent - it even ran on my HD3000 GPU laptop on lower settings.\nSound:  Good - Though cut scene voice overs and cliché story were weak.\nReplayability: Not much - I got 5 1/2 hours of gameplay and getting to the last boss was fairly easy, from there it was a whole other game. Co-op gives this a little more value if you have (a) local friend(s) that will join in blowing things up.\nOverall: I'd give it a 6.5/10 - The only thing this game has going for it is the gameplay. Cut scenes are irrelevant, enemies do get repetitious and shot angles are awkward with enemies at times. Though, still a fun little shooter. Buy it on sale.\nRegardless, if you’re a fan of twin stick shooters like I am, this one is a good addition to your collection.","November 3, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You just need to kill bazillion of them as you fight your way through various objectives. There's thin veneer of backstory about how the Narc Cartels want you to stop the Drone Strikes by kidnapping your daughter, but of course you aren't going to listen, right?\n\nThe game is a little clunky at times, as the animations are not smooth (being an old game) and moving WAY TOO fast at times. Enemies come at a decent clip, but the enemies gets REALLY annoying when mortars started appearing, which means you can't stand back, but must rush into the enemy and kill the mortar guys first or get killed immediately.\n\nBetween missions you can "upgrade" your guns, but you only start with pistol and shotgun for the first few missions, even if you upgrade them a bit, even as enemies started appearing with chainguns and worse.\n\nYou should probably play one of the more modern games instead.","October 29, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's only problem is a few "difficulty spikes" in levels where just one section of a level was way harder than everything around it -- causing a couple sections to require lots of continues (for me) and other entire levels where I never died at all.  The final boss fight was another area that was "impossible" until I learned you can (and how to) upgrade weapons.  Yeah, I really wasn't paying attention during the game :-P   Even after upgrading weapons during the final boss fight, it took over a dozen "continues" but I finally made it.\n\nOverall, lots of shooting, lots of satisfying explosions, lots of eye-rolling dialog, and lots of one-liners from your character... perfect!   Well, 85 out of 100 "perfect" and was good for just over 4 hours of the campaign.","August 15, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I recommend you watch a review of the game or TotalBiscuit's "WTF is...". If that doesn't turn you away from the game you still might want to wait until Steam or a key reseller discounts the price 70% or more.\n\nThose difficulty spikes I mentioned come from the difference of evadable bullets and kite-able enemies to situations where you encounter drop-in invisible walls preventing you're retreat and no place to go where you won't get hit and then you die within seconds. Such a situation then repeats again and again (die-continue cycles) until you randomly are lucky enough to make it through.\n\nDisclaimer: I was almost always playing with mouse and keyboard because I felt like the mouse gives me better aiming or rather enemy selection. Also, trying mouse plus controller doesn't really work because controllers are designed to be held with both hands and feel inconvenient otherwise.\n\n+ Some dumb fun\n+ Not too long (apart from die-continue cycles)\n+ Exploding environment\n0 Dumb shooter\n- Invisible walls\n- 3D with side-scroller mentality making use of walls dropping in "behind" you\n- Enemies dropping in "behind" you, sometimes right next to you\n- Avatar's (presumably funny) remarks not audible over the sound of gunfire\n- You can take damage within the no-control scope of cut-scenes\n- Auto-aim is helping somewhat but also often prevents you from\n- You can jump 95% of the height of a container but not get on the container\n- Avatar usually doesn't look in the relative direction of the mouse cursor unless the left mouse button is  pressed\n- Shooting goes in the direction he avatar is looking (see also last point) resulting in shotgun shots sometimes going off away from the enemy\n- Grenades are thrown in the avatar's looking direction requiring you to shoot your gun in order to be able to use grenades\n- Playing with mouse you see the OS mouse cursor (which can become sort of invisible in fire fights)\n- Almost always linear levels\n- Irritating camera movement, sometimes used to let you walk into a trap or prevent you from sensibly aiming\n- Sometimes you just can't see your avatar\n- Vanishing items, it seems only a small number of items can be active in a level at the same time, lures you into running for medi-packs and actually taking more damage then health recovered\n- No upgrade preview\n- Boring, generic story\n\n.. and a few other things.\n\nYou probably should go and look for another game.","June 30, 2015","false","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
