(If you are non-Steam DvDrum user, you know that feel)\n\nPersonally, I think the main focus on this "game" is customization.\nYou can customize your desired keymap for your controller, customize your drum kit that will be displayed, and also customize the sound set of the drum that included in-game sound mixer (screenshot provided in Store Page).\n\nThis game is good for practicing drum, so some feature are:\n-In-game metronome, you can set your metronome so you can practice at your tempo while you drumming.\n-Embed music, while you playing drum, you can add a music in game and played it on background. Perhaps you want to practice covering some song? (Beware, if you playing with keyboard, some song is too hard to cover)\n\nOther than that, the in-game drum sound is so great.\nAlso, MAY causing lag in the "game" window when you played and/or recorded it with video recorder software. Be sure to close unnecessary background process.\n\nAnd here's my personal feedback/suggest:\nMore simplified the UI (Also, the fonts too, if possible. If not, then it's okay)\nThe main menu song is too loud!\nTaking screenshot with Steam doesn't work, even there's Steam Overlay. (There's a taking image, in-game feature, but that's limited to taking drum kit screenshot only, not the whole screen)\nYou can record your "game"play (video/audio), but you must set it first in main menu Settings. Also, you must have your own video/audio recording software, seems that this feature is useless[?].\nWhen you open this "game", then play it, the keymap doesn't load properly. Sometimes, the keymap back to default. The only thing to solve this, is to open the Keys >> Settings >> Return. Then it should set to your own saved keymap.\nMaybe the option to change resolution?\nAdd shortcut/fix about placing/moving drum/decor part, I don't know, maybe by dragging middle-click?.\nWhy? For example, when you "accidently" move your Toms beside the Toms panel like this: http://s6.postimg.org/s3qfh09dt/Screenshot_1.jpg , I can't move it again, probably because the button is conflicted?\n...\n...\n...","September 5, 2015","true","118.9"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","3"

That way you could actually learn how to create music on your computer.\nAnd this shouldn't cost more than 3, maybe 4 euros.","February 19","false","0.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","1"

The only thing that may turn people away is that the game looks like a crumby java game. Hope they update the interface to look better. I'd also like it if they would remove that rock music at the beginning. I don't have anything against rock; I just find it out of place.\n\nThis game actually has tons of options. It's great! You can fully customize your drumb kit. There's even a record option in the game, so you can create some nice music with this. ;)","September 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","16","23","3","0"

I play drums for hobby. And have done so for years.\nMeanwhile I've also accumulated a huge collection of audio software (VST, DAW, fx, etc) and misc instruments.\n\nReview: Is this a game or music software?\nShort answer is neither.\n\nFor a game there is no actual gameplay. And is therefore classified as a “simulator”.\n\nAnd for a virtual instrument (VST) it perform very bad. Focusing more on the visuals of the drums rather than the sound.\nI have yet to try and use DvDrum with any of my midi instruments and controllers.\n\nIf you want to make music. Then you are better off buying something else. Such as EzDrummer which is cheap, and easy to use.\nDo not BUY.\nThere are better options for free..","October 14, 2015","false","0.1"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","28","46","3","4"

The sound is good, and i can even use multiple drumsets for more drums and have a full set.

It's completely not integrated into the actual program. What's more, the "drumless" audio tracks are not drumless at all but just clumsily filtered tracks to reduce the volume of the drums a bit. Also, given the fame of the bands they are using I can't imagine they actually have permission to use these tracks: Blur, Dylan, Sabbath, Beastie Boys etc. There's just no way they are doing this legally.\n\nSimilarly, the recording features are not in the program itself: instead you can set the program to launch an external exe to record video or sound.\n\nThen we have the quality of the program itself, which is also, surprise, suprise, bad. You can select different samples for each drum but once you have selected one, that's it: you will get the exact same sample played at the exact same volume every time you trigger it.\n\nYou can play the drums with your computer keyboard or by clicking on them with your mouse. The mouse clicking is massively inaccurate: there are tons of places you can click on the drum and nothing happens. As far as I can tell you can't use a midi keyboard or other device like launchpad, maschine etc.\n\nThe mixer has terribly unintuitive controls: instead of clicking and dragging to set the on-screen pots you have to left click on the pot to select it and then use the scroll wheel to set it, then click left again to exit!\n\nThis program is utter garbage. It does next to nothing and what it does do, it doesn't do right.","October 14, 2015","false","0.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","12","22","5","0"

Not saying this isn't a good drum simulator but that is pretty much all it is.  You have to train your fingers just as much as you would have to train yourself playing an actual drum kit.  Its not easy and most of the options in the video are not accessible.  It is very eary access.  For now I do not recommend this unless you are just looking to bang around some virtual drums and practice for fun or to just goof around.","October 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","5","22","2","0"
