It covers many aspects of horse life that other games do not usually include. These aspects include, but not limited to, horse riding, horse caring (beyond just cleaning and feeding), training, working with multiple horses, breeding and selling said horses, and running a profitable stable yard (where guests can rent your horses).\n\nIt takes a realistic approach to horses where it can while keeping in perspective that it is still a game. Some of these realities are the fact that your horse does get tired if run for too long, can get stressed, and even sick if not properly taken care of.\n\nThe in-game books (used for increasing skill levels) are not limited to in-game information, but rather information on the game's aspects in general, such as actual horse care, behavior to be taken when caring for a foal, etc.\n\nAs far as the technical aspects of the game goes, there are many positives. The graphics are not as realistic as most modern games, however, what it does have is beautiful. The controls are extremely simple, even if the concepts of the game are more for children 8+. The game restricts the player to an "8 hour day" where it will auto-save at the end of said day, so no night rides.\n\nI would recommend this game for children 8+ and can go as high as teens to twenties. Definitely a fun, well rounded game for children and adults of all ages.","June 18, 2014","true","59.9"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

She started playing and I was amazed at how excited and happy this game was making her, so I purchased it for myself too. I am usually the kind of guy who plays RPG's and Resident Evil like horror games and so this is really not the kind of game I would usually go for. After 10 minutes of playing though, I was hooked!\n\nThis is a wonderful game that touches on many aspects of owning a horse in real life, and most of all it relies on teaching you how to manage your time. The horses are animated beautifully, and in my honest opinion the horse models are much better than much recent and bigger budget games like The Elder Scrolls Online, or Lord of the Rings Online. Some of the mini games are very fun to play too, like cleaning the horses hooves or hosing them down. I have found myself addicted to this game in a very short amount of time!\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who has a passing interest in horses, and also to anyone who just simply enjoys simulator style games as the main story mode has you rebuilding your business by training and selling horses.\n\nConsidering I had never previously heard of this game, nor even the company who made it, I honestly believe that this game deserves a 10/10 for playability and value for money.","July 16, 2014","true","9.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

I've played many horse games over the years, and this is one of the best. That said, even the best wasn't that great. It might just be that I'm picky, though. It IS the best horse game currently on Steam, in my opinion.\n\nNote that this review is from the POV of an equestrian, and is probably best targeted at someone similar. This is mostly me being picky.\n\nThings I like:\n\n- I like that you can lead your horse. It takes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ forever, but I recently realized I could speed up the game (hotkey 1 to speed up/slow down) while leading my horse or doing other similarly slow tasks to speed them up.\n- I like the upgrades to the facilities even though it's slightly linear as to what you can do, and when\n- I like the animations, which are very good compared to many other games with horses in (though not necessarily horse games)\n- I like the riding activity. I've only got the first field unlocked, but it's nice, and I like that there are bonus points scattered around for you to find.\n\nThings I don't like:\n\n- You can tell whoever they hired is not totally on the up-and-up on all things horses. This list is primarily going to revolve around that.\n- Lunging foals that look like they haven't even been weaned? And on tiny circles? If you did that in real life you'd have a broke-♥♥♥ (and not in the good way) horse within a year. Their joints would just disintegrate (not a technical term) with the stress.\n- There are only three breeds. Hanoverian, Friesian and Andalusian. Not bad breeds, but who the hell's idea was it to put Friesians in the game? Friesians only come in solid black, in reality. It's kind of their thing. In this game, they can come in any damn colour. NO. NOT RIGHT. WRONG. D: Hanoverians and Andalusians do not come in cream, either. Totally inaccurate. Not even close. They could have improved the realism tenfold just by adding a few more breeds, making them actually look like those breeds, and STICKING TO REALITY. Having a gray (white), palomino or spotty Friesian is the equivalent of having a purple polkadotted pony. It's not possible.\n- Only being able to gallop over jumps, when in reality you want to NOT speed over jumps, usually. That's how you break legs.\n- Lack of show jumping or dressage. The best horse game I ever played incorporated all three branches of eventing. Sadly, it lacked in other areas. I have yet to find one that hits every note.","December 4, 2014","true","1.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This one, however, is surprisingly good. The graphics are quite nice and the minigames are just challenging enough. There are fairly difficult long-term goals--I've played 13 hours so far and not beaten the game yet. The controls are bit odd, but once you figure them out they are not hard to use. I would recommend this game to any horse-loving kid OR adult. I would have adored this game as a young girl and still have gotten quite the kick out of it as a 25 yr old.","July 31, 2015","true","18.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

That being said I've tried a variety of horse type games (very few on Steam, mostly off Steam). While this game does allow you to interact with, care for, train,  and ride your horse it's not the most enjoyable horse game I've ever played (actually far from it). The pacing for the story and time it takes for each task to be completed is... well... awful. In that respect they have achieved making every activity/chore feel tedious if that was the intended goal. In comparision to similar games the gameplay is very lack luster, and the overwhelming amount of positive reviews has me wondering if we in fact played the same game... I do have to commend the creators on their efforts to provide educational information on horses and realism in their care, however despite that I could not in good faith recommend anyone to spend time on this game.","January 24","false","3.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

One of the most impressive points for me was the riding. It's not perfect, but the horses look better than in any other horse game I've played. Their gaits look realistic and when you turn them while trotting or cantering their heads actually look pretty. Their legs don't look all wonky and weird. The riding controls are very simple- click the left mouse button to speed up and the right to slow down. You don't have to make the horse jump yourself, but you do have to set them up right for it by taking them straight at it (most of the time, sometimes they jump at crazy angles) or the will refuse the jump. There are so may aspects of horse care (grooming, bathing, picking hooves, massaging), growing your farm (building a training facility, therapy center, guest house, and breeding center), and riding and competing ( There are 3 races in each area. The areas are the field, forest, and mountains). It is a very involved game with more goals than simply competing and brushing your horse. You earn money by training foals, massaging client's horses, breeding foals for clients, and booking guests. You can also breed your own foals and sell them. You can buy 3 different types of feed, supplements, a general vaccine, and a myriad of other medications to cure your horse of ailments (you'd only need them if you didn't keep your horses' health up, and it's very easy to keep them healthy). You can also buy show coats, boots, saddles, casual clothing, and books (which increase the amount of money you earn for each activity). Your focus it to achieve the next star rating by meeting all of the requirments for each level. It is very addictive and very fun!","January 15, 2015","true","25.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The only negative thing that I can say about it, for me at least, was that I didn't know how the star level worked, but I found the game's manual so that cleared it up. Plus, after 20 hours, I lost all my saves... but it's not the game's problem, just my computer's. But yeah, you should get it.

It gives you a series of instructions to complete ‘when you feel like it’ and turns you loose.  It lets you get your feet without pressuring you overmuch… but it’s also not challenging.  You learn to feel for how much time your tasks take and plan around them, you learn where everything is so you don’t waste time going back and forth and back again because you forgot to do something in one area earlier.  (Eventually. The map’s not very easy to read.)\n\nThe HUD’s pretty awkward to manage too. There’s a function where if you click a certain button it’ll bring up your current attributes, and if you walk near a horse it’ll show the horse’s stats.  The only problem with this is that it takes up half the screen and doesn’t show anything relevant about the yard – the horse section’s pretty good, but having the human one show how much feed you had, the overall dirtiness of the stable/horses in the stable/tasks completed for the day would actually have been useful. I can think of like six ways off the top of my head that could have been implemented better.\n\nThe minigames are dull and unrealistic in terms of actual horse activities. I won’t bicker too much about them as I realise there’s a limit to coding, but there’s a hell of a lot more involved in foal training than making it walk in a circle, and I’m BORED.  It’s kind of like level grinding in terms of boring and pointless.  And the less said about the breeding mechanics, the better, though I suppose for a beginner it would be more than enough.  It’s certainly interesting… Let’s just say the system isn’t based on genetics as I know it and leave it at that.\n\nThe controls are clunky and unintuitive, but they’re not *broken* or anything.  You’ll spend about half an hour cursing out your monitor every time they introduce something new and then you’ll get the hang of it, still mumbling occasionally about how idiotic the control scheme is. I have never before wished with such fervour that a game had been made aware of the WASD system.\n\nIt doesn’t help that the game isn’t very good at explaining what it wants you to do, though, and isn’t always that good at responding even when you are using the right combination of keystrokes, though maybe that’s just my keyboard.  Protip: when the game tells you how to do something, take it with a grain of salt, and experiment, because chances are it forgot to tell you how to do B and C while vaguely instructing you on how to do A.\n\nThe soundtrack is uninspired and highly repetitive but at least not catchy enough to drive me crazy. I turned the music off and played my own for background.  In another case of being somewhere in the middle of the scale the graphics aren’t cutting-edge but they aren’t hideous either.  I have some issues with the horse movement models they use, but again, it’s functional. There’s *some* customisation available for your avatar and horse, but not much. Coat colours and patterns are limited and use terminology that makes my head hurt with its inaccuracy, but it’s a kid’s game, so I can cope.\n\nAnd frankly when I bought this that was what I wanted.  A silly game that didn’t ask too much of me while still managing to be interesting enough that I could kill a few hours when I got bored with studying.  This fits the bill.  It’s not amazing, but it’s playable.  If you’re thinking of buying it, go watch someone playing it on youtube for half an hour or so – that will pretty much tell you if it’s what you’re after or not.  If I was recommending it to someone my age, i.e. an actual adult, I’d give it a 4/10, but for a kid twelve or under it’s a 6 if they're horse-crazy.  It’s not great but it’ll keep them amused for a while.","October 26, 2014","true","31.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You can do this by doing rides with it. The more skills the horse gets, the more races will become available. The races itself are pretty simple, since the horse jumps himself. The only thing the player needs to do is make sure the speed is good enough, and that the horse won't run out of breath.\n\nLater on you can earn money with training foals for others. Make sure you always have 3 carrots from the garden with you, and after the foal did 3 good things, give it a carrot. Else it will get bored, and will start to disbey you.\n\nWith the money you can upgrade/renovate buildings, buy new horses, clothing or items.

Then this game is the best horse related one on Steam. The horse and rider customization is VERY limited however, you get to pick your riders hair colour, shirt and pants and your first horses breed which there is only 3 choices dissapointily Hanoverian, Friesian and Andalusian. There is a few coat colours to pick from as well Black, White, Grey, Bay, Cream, Palomino and Red (Chestnut).\n\nYou can pick what 'pattern' your horse has such as dapples, pinto markings, socks, blaze, snip and so forth. Horse can only have one 'pattern' so if you one a horse with a blaze and socks you're out of luck, one or the other here matey.\n\nThis game is all Cross Country, I found that somewhat a let down since I'm a Show Jumping fan myself and the races are very easy, I was able to beat all on the first try, but I'm older then the target group so I will find it easier.\n\nYou have to take care of your horses daily or they will fall ill, this includes feeding, grooming and mucking out the stables. It is also reccomend you put your horses in the pasture or they will become stressed.\n\nYou earn money by training foals, breeding, selling horses, winning races and massaging horses for cilents. You can also have guests rent your horses for the day for some extra money, but guests only come if you have horses in your stable, pasture horses do not count.\n\nThe animations when riding are quite realistic to compared to other horse games, the rider even holds the reins like a real rider would!\n\nI'll reccomend this game to any Equestrian who is looking to pass the time while away from the Barn or is unable to have the real thing at all.\n\nNot the most in-depth horse game ever, but for it's price it is worth it, would keep a horse crazy child quiet for a weekend..and horse crazy adults too.","October 9, 2015","true","11.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Don't love the actual gameplay so far. Graphics and sound are wonderful but when you start out, you have to train foals in order to earn money. So if you fail at foal training then you can't buy anything. Like horse food. So your starter horse will get hungry and sick. You can't do anything with a sick horse except maybe brush and rename it. You won't be able to afford medicine or a new horse. Plus you won't be able to upgrade anything - which prevents you from being able to try earn income in other ways. If the foal training was a bit easier or if it wasn't the sole source of daily income for a beginner, that would improve theis game a lot. If there were sources of food to be found around the ranch - visit a fruit tree while out riding or add a little match 3 mingame or let us actually farm that garden behind the house or something - that could also be very helpful both in making the game more survivable and making it more fun.","May 5","false","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good balance of challenge but still quite forgiving.\nSome good features that really allow the kids to suspend disbelief and get into the whole "horse" thing.\n\nWas a bit fiddly until i found the option to turn the tutorial hints on locked. After that, never looked back. Best stable-management-horse-breeding game I've ever played.\n","February 14","true","107.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The horses are quite realistic and pretty to look at, you can customize your own character and later you can buy some new clothes, and even the saddles and the reins are realistic. The graphic itself is very neat, as you can see from the screenshots.\nHowever, if you're expecting some competitive races that are actually challenging, this game doesn't have any. As long as you have a strong horse, pay attention to its breath and manage not to get stuck anywhere, you're gonna win every single race. After all, this game is not even about races at all, it's about looking after your own stable. Also, this is not a Barbie kind of game, it's not childish and it's not completely covered in pink. As such, I'd recommend it to kids as well as adults.","June 14, 2015","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you need something for a quick equestrian fix, it does the trick. Gameplay does get repetitive very quickly, horses get dirty doing nothing and require endless bathing and brushing, and there is not enough in the riding side for the more competitive types looking to improve their skill in a game. Good for younger children and teaching the aspects of finances or time management as well as basic horse care but definitely would not recommend for the older horse savvy person unless you're looking for very casual gameplay or just NEED an extra horse game because you've exhausted every other one on the market. Fun enough for the price, not worth any more but recommended for horsey people nonetheless.","December 8, 2015","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
