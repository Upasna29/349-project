Decent enough being the key words here. In a world where indie games come in job lot, decent is barely enough. Of course, it already has a solid enough mechanic, decent graphic, simple control, a game that you can get into without much problem, but that's it. Since this is an Early Access title that does better than many of its broken brethren, I'm inclined to give it a benefit of a doubt.

I wish there was a wider variety when it comes to guns. Having some creative weapons could really up the replay value, and pushing people to fight over those and maybe some useful powerups around the map could make the game more intense.\n\nI really do enjoy that you can destroy the environment. The voxel maps are perfect for that, and allow for some cool tactics. However, as I said before, the game becomes a bit boring after you've played it for a while.

You liked that mechanic? Then go and buy this game!\n\nGunjitsu makes a lot right. The whole game is built around the grappling hook and that is, how a game should be. Take the the mechanic that brings the most fun and add some features that support it. The swinging around works great and is really fun, once you figured out how to use it best. Generally, the movements in this game just work. Swinging, jumping, dashing, it all makes you feel like some sort of sci-fi ninja. Awesome!\nThe shooting part is a perfect addition to that. You quickly pick up all the controls you need and can start playing with bots or online with friends. While it's easy to learn the basics, it will take some time to master the controls and perfect your timing. I had not a single frustrating moment in this game, even when I died several times in a row, as it is very fun to watch. Getting shot with a pumpgun in the middle of a jump let's you skid away like ragdoll.

It isn't a bad game and I would say worth $3-5 if you like the genre and had regular friends to play with.  As is, my opinion is it is a bit overpriced and not many people are playing.  There isn't really a goal and I think that would help it somewhat as nothing really stands out here from the crowd of other similar shooter games.  Adding something like scoring goals on top of the battle or maybe a capture the flag mode might help.   Also needs some different environments as the platforms here are all pretty much the same.  Overall I will give it a recommend if you can pick it up on sale based on how it currently stands even it wasn't developed any more.  As it is still in early access, further improvements could possibly justify a higher price as there is that dreaded word that applies here....it has "potential".","September 19, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's a game I plan to spend more time with for sure in the future.

Platforming in the levels are not smooth ( as in movement fluidity)enough in it's current level to compare to other games making the battle arena stale. Needs better level design as well with better thought out destructible elements (at the current rate, everything is destructible at a slow rate making it pointless). Grappling hook is broken as well when sticking to multiple points. Granted it is in early access, hence it can be fixed. However, the game being a battle arena requires players in it.

Because no one ever plays at all, so all one can really do in this game is the tutorial (see review update). There is no singleplayer content whatsoever.\n\nBesides the obvious lack of players the part of the game that I was able to play (again, just the tutorial) was really just dull. The mechanics are really just a bit dull and feels a little chaotic instead of intense.\n\nThere is much this game can learn from SpeedRunners a similar game.

These drawbacks include the following:\n1) Hardly anyone (if anyone at all) is ever on multiplayer.\n2) I often find myself having a hard time walking over uneven terrain.\n3) Considering the lower graphic quality of the game, it is very laggy. The game could be optimized.\n\nI do want to say that I really enjoy grappling. I like the fact that you can shoot while grappling. I also managed to kill a bot in midair with a grenade while in midair myself, which I thought was pretty sweet. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone personally, but if you enjoy these types of games and don't mind the things I mentioned then I wouldn't discourage you from playing it.","October 2, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dashing mechanics also feels off with Keyboard controls.

There isn't a lot to Gunjitsu, it's just a really solid sidescrolling multiplayer shooter. But it's the few extra little things sprinkled on top that build on the simple core gameplay to make it really enjoyable. Destroyable pixellated enviornments are a splendid touch that sometimes adds an unexpected dimension of fun or strategy to the match. The vertical arena layout makes kills extra satisfying, making blood and corpses tumble downward in copious amounts. While I hesitate to recommend a multiplayer game with a non-existent online playerbase, I found the bots to be surprisingly worthy foes. As amusing as Gunjitsu is, it can only benefit from additional development, so I do hope this one doesn't get abandoned.","April 12","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
