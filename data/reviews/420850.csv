It looks like a challenging retro-modern and old-school graphics, in the same time relaxing and entertaining. The graphics aren’t modern, but for this kind of genre, they are pretty well designed. The atmosphere takes place in the space, where you will travel across different planets and rocks (you can jump on rocks to get to other planets which are too far from you.) The audio is simple, but in the same time, well made. This game has a lot of beeping, indeed. The gameplay is pretty much going around the planets to get to the rocket, but you can change your character as well. How do you get characters? Well, in some missions, you optionally can take over characters (they will bypass your area, you must get in the rocket to get the character). The story is about a character who just arrived in space, and he must complete all the missions, to compete and eventually win against his competitors. The engines are pretty good, what I don’t like about the engines are the controls and the fact that it’s a bit hard to switch from right to left and vice versa. And it’s also hard to reach the rocks, in order to jump to planets which are too far away to get directly jumped on.\n\nStrong PointsSimple but retro-modern graphics\nMany levels and areas\nChallenging gameplay\nTwo different game modes\nSchool measuring system (it makes you to retry the level for a better grade)\nMany enemies and obstacles\nPretty good engines\nNice old-school sounds\nWeak PointsThe controls\nThe menu-changing styles\nSometimes it can get a little frustrating\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nAudio: 8/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nStory: 8/10\nEngines: 8/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 8/10","April 18","true","1.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","2"

The response is inconsistent and unpredictable, which is unacceptable.\n\nPlus, the game crashes if the resolution is changed before setting it to full-screen.. then keeps on crashing on each subsequent startup.  A registry edit resolved that issue, however.\n\nBut hey, at least the music is nice..\n\nUpdate: The Dev has been working to resolve the issue, so kudos to them.  I will update or remove this review if in the future these problems are ironed out.","March 19","false","2.5"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/420850/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","Cosmic Leap is a planet platformer with plenty of space-based obstacles. The majority of levels can be completed in less than 10 seconds, but that probably won’t happen until fumble your way through the first time. Sounds a lot like every sexual experience I’ve had… Erm, regardless of the small size (dammit) I did have a lot of fun completing my Cosmic Leap review. The controls are absolutely abysmal, but I was pulled right back in by the likeable aesthetic and the bevy of unlockable skins for both your ship and your character. For the small price, Cosmic Leap doesn’t disappoint.\n\nTrying to explain what makes the controls so bad is quite difficult. Running to the left or right is done automatically. However after you’ve stopped, starting again in the correct direction becomes extremely frustrating on both a controller or a keyboard. Planets are divided into quadrants and the controls invert themselves depending on which quadrant you are currently standing in. The wonky nature of the controls were bad enough to effect the both the difficulty and fun factor scores in a significantly negative way. If concise controls are what you’re looking for, Cosmic Leap will leave you in a foaming rage.\n\nThings are not all grim, luckily. The story isn’t extremely developed, but it delivered much more than I expected for a game of this scale. There are plenty of big-brother elements that strike a chord with me. Having such creepy elements done in such a cutesy style only serves to add to the feeling of dystopia. The music is, for the most part, wonderfully on point. The soundtrack features a down-tempo electro sound that I personally can’t resist. The music did lose a point because it didn’t make me feel like I was in space at any point. All I’m saying is there is a surprising lack a theremin music in space games these days.\n\nThe massive amount of unlockable skins is what really saved this game in my opinion. If you don’t share the same weakness, you might be disappointed by Cosmic Leap. The levels are tiny, the obstacles are relatively generic, but the wonderful aesthetic and sky-high replayability score lead toward this game having a lot of potential depending on your personal tastes. For me? It came in about average. My first 30 minutes were frustrated by extremely simple levels, but the difficulty did ramp up nicely though mostly because of the botched controls. Still not a bad first game from Michael Hall, and for the price? I’d say it is worth picking up for platforming/speedrunning fans.\n\nSummary: Bite-sized momentum-based platformer with tons of unlockable skins.\n\nVerdict: Not a gem, but for $2 this game delivered a bit more than I’d expect.\n\nFull text review available here: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/cosmic-leap-review/\nFull video review posted here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKLBBOTfj38","April 23","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","2","3","5","0"

"Only", because this is a very fast game, where levels should be finished in under 10 seconds sometimes. So 50 minutes is a looong time for playing this game and feels like 5 hours or so.\n\nWhether you are looking for a few minutes of distraction or want to try a speedrun after mastering all levels forth and back, this game is well worth its small price.\n\nPro:\n- Each level is more or less easy to win, but hard to nearly impossible to master\n- I like the school grade measuring system for level success. Makes you want to try it "only one more time" ;-)\n- the retro-modern, cathode-ray tube, 8-Bit, pseudo-3D graphics\n- Support! The game creator/programmer was able to help me with a specific technical issue within hours. Double plus LIKE!\n\nNeutral:\n- the storyline. Not every game must have one. This one fits into the overall game look and feel, but I would not have missed it if it did not have one.\n\nCons:\n- when playing for a while, the music may get a bit monotonous. This is my personal experience, which may not be applicable to other players.\n\n[removed]Cons: - possible issues with screen resolution in full screen mode. Unity does not remember the set screen resolution. This is a Unity platform specific flaw on some systems (like mine, unfortunately) for which the programmer cannot be blamed for. Windowed mode works fine, so this is no real issue.\n[Edit Mar 24th: solved. The game creator reactivated the Unity config screen which allows to set fullscreen in the correct resolution. Again: double plus LIKE!]","March 22","true","1.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Cosmic Leap is in incredibly fun game is which you jump from planet to planet trying to reach your rocket-ship. The game (haven't beaten it yet) I imagine will get a bit harder as the ways to jump from planet to planet should continue to get more complex. The puzzles of jumping to planet to planet are challenging but not to the point of being unfair, and the soundtrack is incredible. The game also gives you a wide variety of characters (40 of them) to unlock as well as 9 different rocket ships. It works great with a controller and has a very fun retro feel and style to it. If you're looking for a fun, colorful, slightly challenging game to play than this one is for you! Plus, how can beat a price of $2? 10/10 looking forward to playing much more!\n\nFor those looking for gameplay before buying it, you can find my playthrough (1080p, 60 FPS) of the first couple levels here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeGEkw00YN0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1Xrrnp24U\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWWZlNCz-rk\n\nEDIT: It's to bad the majority of you don't find my view helpful but I really do think this is a game worth playing. And no, I'm not a dev for this game in case you think my review is a bit over exaggerated. However when I see a game I think deserves attention I try to sell it as hard as I can. If you thought I oversold then I apologize but I call how I see it, and I see a great game here.","March 17","true","3.0"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","12","30","2","1"
