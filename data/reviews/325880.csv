It's impossible to slow your character in the air. Instead, he conserves momentum and reverses at full speed in the opposite direction. If you want to land a jump in one of the game's many awkward platforming moments, you must zig-zag back and forth and pray that you'll hit the target. I'm unable to comment on the rest of the game because the fundamentals feel so awful I can't bear to play it further. The developers should check out any decent platformer since the first Mario Bros.","January 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 59 of 78 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","59","78","3","0"

This is the exact the kind of spirit those of us who hold video games dear to our childhood miss these days.\n\nThe uniquely themed stages feature a consistently high challenge and although they can be tackled head on, exploring your surroundings is imperative to your success. Though you can prepare yourself with extended exploration and discovery of supplies the stage's boss cannot be defeated by means of grinding, but instead with reflexes and skill all brought out in full force.\n\ntl;dr\nIt's tough. You'll give up. A lot. But it's that ridiculous difficulty, that seemingly unsurpassable moment in an old arcade game that had us returning to it so many times throughout our lives and that's the same kind of yearning I get to go back and play Crystal Catacombs, as hard as it may seem.","January 19, 2015","true","1.8"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","36","44","5","2"

The controls have been tweaked which makes them perfectly tight and the jumping motion is twice faster now.\nA tip to those who still complain: just because you're too lazy adapt to a different system it doesn't mean it's bad.\n\nMoving on, the gameplay is notoriously hard to master. Each different area has its quirks and distinctive enemies you have to learn, and it requires a fair balance of cautious gameplay vs fast-paced movement in order to stay alive and still beat the clock. Some would call it brutally hard – especially in the beginning – but once you get the hang of it you realize it’s exceptionally well balanced and rewarding.\n\nThe loot is sparse, but rightfully so. As you make your way through the gorgeous procedurally-generated dungeons you’ll find amazing artifacts such as jet packs, fanny packs, plasma guns that shoot through walls, whips and alien bombs that can be used in many creative ways. A few noteworthy aspects of the game are the ingenious enemy design and variety; enemy friendly fire; being able to adjust the screen zoom; getting a checkpoint once you clear an area; and the fact that weapons level up as you use them.\n\nRoguelite fans who seek a challenging yet rewarding experience will love it to death. The game will crush you hard, you will definitely rage, but you won't be able to stop until you reach your final goal.\n\nEDIT: For those wondering how long it takes to beat the game it should take you around 8h to beat the game for the first time in nomal mode.\nOnce you know what you're doing, a good run can take you as little as 3 hours if you're lucky with the items and you don't die to bosses. But the average run should be close to 4-5h. There's also plenty of "replayability" with harder modes and especially the survival mode.","January 15, 2015","true","15.5"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","31","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/325880/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","Crystal Catacombs is one of my favourite style and genre of video game. It’s a random 8bit, dungeon, platformer. However, even though it’s my favourite style it saddens me that the game didn’t live up to expectations.\n\nBefore I get into the Pros and Cons here is what some people say about the game. Some say this game is difficult and that’s what makes it fun... I say there is a difference between difficult and unbalanced and it’s clearly difficult because it’s unbalanced which shouldn’t be the case. It should be difficult but balanced where the enemies and players scale properly per character level and game level which clearly isn’t the case.\n\nBut here’s what I found Positive and Negative:\n\nPros:\n\n♦ Epic Concept (Random dungeons, items and different every play through makes it epic)\n♦ Epic Sounds/Music\n♦ Okay Graphics (I know these are old school 8bit graphics, but they could be better)\n♦ Idea of Monster Cards are cool but should have more details on the cards (Cards spawn at random for killing a certain enemy to get their card. This is a cool concept that makes the game interesting as you can find out about the Monsters. However, the problem here is the cards don’t tell you anything except show a picture and a brief description. In my opinion, there should be more details on the cards like amount of health, damage and maybe a weakness?)\n♦ The ability to zoom the camera in and out is really nifty\n\nCons:\n♦ Levels and enemies don’t increase in Difficulty per level (You can be on level 1 and level 5 for example and enemies will still deal the same damage)\n♦ Leveling only increases Health and MP (Doesn't seem to increase Defense which is lame as more health doesn't mean much if you still get hit the same amount of damage)\n♦ Enemies are unbalanced compared to your Character. (For example your Character at level 1-3 is really weak and can’t do anything and then when you reach level 4 which gives you a skill point, if you put it in Attack your character is OP)\n♦ Some really Strong units appear out of nowhere throughout levels and instantly kill you if they land a shot on you\n♦ Some Biomes have enemies that blend in. For example: 90% of Pitt Monsters and Blue Batts and Worms on Ice Fortress (This is terrible as you can’t see the enemies to attack them)\n♦ Deep Darkness Biome has an unkillable flying Pink Bombs that explode if touched causing you to lose a quarter health (These are annoying as they make you unable to do anything as you have to stand still to dodge them every 2 steps or so)\n♦ Enemies spawn in weird places forcing you to hit them and die (This is really noticeable on The Pitt as enemies spawn on ledges just after lava, thus if you jump they push you into the lava which does a considerable amount of damage. Also enemies like to spawn in spots where you can’t dodge them so if you want to move forward you have to hit them)\n♦ Weapon leveling is pointless and takes years (This is a nice feature as using a weapon gives it xp and if it levels up it becomes stronger. However, it’s way too slow and you’re far better off spending Skill Points on Attack which serves the same purpose)\n♦ Gold seems pointless as shops are rare and expensive (You normally have far less gold than you need to buy something)\n♦ Bosses are way too strong (They can kill you in a few shots, compared to you having to hit them numerous and you spawn in a small room with no platforms or ledges, so jumping over a reasonably large boss is hard and you are guaranteed to get hurt or die. Only way I killed one was with an item I had)\n♦ Bosses don't give you anything you can't easily get in normal levels (This is lame as it makes them seem pointless)\n♦ There are pointless rooms with ledges you can stand on to activate and the room lights up. (This is cool looking, but they don’t seem to do anything at all... Why put something in that doesn’t do anything?)\n♦ Very repetitive (Each level is the same just different sizes until you get to a new biome or a boss level (Some levels may have a shop in them but that doesn’t really add anything new).\n♦ Number of items are limited (I’ve picked up about 5 different items in 2 hours of play...)\n♦ No Trading Cards (Could have updated to add some pretty awesome backgrounds, cards, badges and emoticons etc)\n♦ No Global Highscores (Could have added Global Highscores for Survival mode where the person to reach the highest level was recorded etc. This would only work providing Survival is Endless, which I think it is.)\n\nOverall, the game isn’t terrible in concept, the main problem is that it’s not very well scaled, balanced and the difficulty doesn’t seem to increase as you progress through which ruins it. Like if you can survive long enough to level your character 4 levels and get a Skill Point then from there on all you have to do is level up Attack and you’ll be fine until you get to a boss which in my opinion due to unbalancing you’ll get wrecked no matter what you do. Therefore, on a whole, with some improvement to the negatives... this game would be a pretty decent game. However, due to not being scaled, the unbalancing and the repetitiveness then I can’t recommend this (It’s fun and it’ll make you want to come back and play it... Although each time you do come back you cringe a little more at how repetitive and unbalanced it is).\n","April 4, 2015","false","2.8"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","28","38","0","0"

Great stuff.\n\nThe Pixel art has character and the music is cracking, there's not much wrong with it and the diverse locales and nice attention to detail ensures plenty of procedurally generated play time can be spent comfortably with-in the 'Crystal Catacombs' - which is just as well, as the challenge on offer is substantial.\n\nThe only thing that frustrates me is the jumping - no, not the unresponsiveness, that has indeed been addressed - specificially, the forced angle of decent when jumping left or right. The problem (for me) is that after jumping in a direction, you still continue in that direction, even after releasing the stick/key. Attempting to correct yourself means (most often) a desperate zig-zagging affair, which 90% of the time results in missing the platform completely. If only you fell straight down when jumping (unless holding a certain direction) then things would be perfect.\n\nIf Rogue Legacy, Spelunky, Vagante et el is your cuppa Tea, then you should consider this puppy..\n(..if, whilst considering, it comes up on sale, stop considering, smile and throw money at the man)   :approved:","January 15, 2015","true","0.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

You can explore the vast levels... but why? There's only two important things per level: The Treasure Chest room, containing the level's one unique item (which is usually a one-use special attack or potion, in my experience), and the key, which you need to progress to the next level. Aside from that, there are scant few other chests, all of which seem to contain money, which you'll NEED to use at the rarely appearing shops, because enemies only drop money one coin at a time, and never drop things a lot.\n\n-It's a Megavania style game: Yeah, it's got the level template of 'big sprawling level you need platforming to get through'. But god, everything about this aspect of the game is poorly done. The controls are stiff and slow. Wall-jumping is extremely finicky. There's no incentive to explore, or any sort of map progression. The 'Warp' system is nearly entirely wasted. The enemies are hard to see against the rough, grainy backgrounds, and deal way too much damage to fit in with the game's unforgiving starting stats and low drop rate of any sort of healing.\n\nIt has possibly the strangest jump physics I've ever seen: When you jump, you're 'set' in an arc, but not how you'd expect. You can still turn around in mid-air, but you retain your speed, now moving in the opposite direction! So if you jump, and then want to fall STRAIGHT DOWN, have fun turning around repeatedly in order to land steadily. And don't even get me started on the ice level. Picture this: you're standing still. And you want to jump straight up. You press the button... and instead, you jump in an arc, right into the enemy you're fighting. It's a complete mess.\n\n\nWhile it is better than it used to be, it is still unacceptable to call this a 'complete' game. I expected better.","January 18, 2015","false","1.8"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

This is a side-scroller from Hell, but man is it fun. The game play reminds me of a cross between Zelda II (trying jump while attacking, for example) and Commander Keen (jumping on platforms while dodging or attacking enemies, with the goal of finding a key that allows you to exit the level). The graphics are bright and, at times, feel more inspired by Atari than Nintendo (I love the jumping spider...ish...y looking thing) and the music is bass heavy and interesting enough to keep me from turning it off, as I usually do.\n\nIn terms of the difficulty level: If you're familiar with older, brutally unforgiving titles such as Hydlide or Heroes of the Lance, you'll feel right at home here. Each touch from an enemy or certain environmental features depletes your health bar, while others affect you in other ways (such as slowing your character down). Some enemies, once dead, leave behind nasty residual auras that can kill you if you're not being careful.\n\nThe controls are responsive and immediate (at least when using the keyboard, as I've not yet tried a gamepad). The most common complaint is that the jumping is slow, but I don't see it that way. Rather, the jump executes as soon as the player presses the appropriate key, but the arc in which your character falls is slow and wide, meaning you'll actually need to plan each jump and practice enough to become skilled at it. This is definitely a feature I remember seeing a lot of back in the day. Come to think of it, the PC in the original Pitfall (which this game's Jungle level reminds me of quite a bit) jumped the same way, and that's going back to the Atari 2600. Falling after missing an important jump can be incredibly frustrating, but I can't ever say it's unfair, and it's always my own fault.\n\nThe thing to remember is that Crystal Catacombs may appear to be a colorful platformer (even it's name sounds generically retro)...but it wants you dead. You need to crush your desire to burn through each level, take your time, and kill it with fire. If this kind of repetitive pain sounds like it's as much fun for you as it is for me, then grab it (especially if you can find it in a bundle or at a discount).

Also I experienced game breaking glitches only 2 minutes into my play through: one where my character hovered to the right and phasing through all the walls without me being able to do anything and one only a few minutes later where the game constantly thought I was in quicksand after leaving some quicksand. 2/10.","May 30, 2015","false","1.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Much like Xeodrifter, it promised to be a Metroidvania, but turned to be a pixellated mess of ridiculous difficulty. I'm not a fan of games with pixel "retro" graphics, and this is no exception. It just seems to me that the developers were too lazy to create unique characters or enemies. All they look like is cubes and blobs, the main character included. Sure, this game takes some cues from Metroid and Castlevania; there's the wall-jumping, leveling up, exploration, items, etc, but there's almost no story at all, and it's more frustrating than fun. Enemies appear out of nowhere and shoot you before you can get out of the way or attack, traps kill you instantly, and most of the time you accidentally touch an enemy because of bad hitboxes. The game does NOT even save your progress until you complete a stage. There are five levels and a boss in each stage. Good luck getting that far. Poor design decision, if you ask me. If you like games that are ridiculously hard, then you might enjoy this. Otherwise, I'd say pass on it and get Valdis Story: Abyssal City instead, a much better Metroidvania by far.","April 18, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/325880/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","Crystal Catacombs is, in many ways, your typical roguelike game. As Captain Vasil Ravencraft your out on a journey to discover the treasures that dwell deep within the fabled catacombs, but your quest will not be easy, as is always the way with these things. Evil creatures and demons haunt the catacomb’s various lairs, which each have their own theme, and will make your life difficult. Ruthlessly difficult. Nobody has ever returned from within the catacombs to tell their tale, but if you can master this cursed place and destroy the creatures that haunt it, maybe Captain Vasil will be the first.\n\nThe developer, Super Fun Games, describes Crystal Catacombs as a “megavania”; a mix between the exploration-based action of Metroid and the relentlessly challenging platforming battles from Megaman. Having tested my mettle against its various lairs it is, most definitely, a fair analogy. The catacombs feature five different areas, which you can tackle in any order you like on normal difficulty, but all are as challenging as each other. Catacombs is reminiscent of Spelunky with its procedurally generated locations and immense difficulty, but it is more stripped back than that, with an old-school flavour that runs all the way through to its core.\n\nAfter choosing the area you want to start off in you are thrust straight into the action; there’s no tutorial, so you will need to think on your feet and acclimatize to Crystal Catacombs‘ control scheme. Vasil moves with the arrow keys, and you can press the ‘A’, ‘S’ and ‘D’ keys to use items from his hotbar. Just like Samus Aran, he can do a sweet wall slide to gently glide down long passages, and he can also wall jump to propel himself upwards. I was extremely impressed with how responsive and tight movement felt, but was quickly reminded why that would be essential.\n\nThe Crystal Catacombs have a diverse and abundant wildlife, and are filled with spiders, gelatinous blobs, bats and demons, all of which are out to get you. Fortunately, Vasil is quite talented with a sword and can tear those nasty mobs a new one. Quick reactions are important and you will need to get used to each enemy’s movement patterns and attacks if you don’t want to die over and over again. You won’t last long if you just go rushing in with your sword waving, instead, if you can kite your enemy away, whilst taking a quick swipe, you will in most cases be successful. Unless that enemy can fire lasers, then you are screwed.\n\n\nCombat is fast and fun and becomes even more exciting if you can find the various weapons and spells that are scattered throughout the catacombs. Using a sword is great and all but how about a bow, or a rocket launcher instead!? Successfully killing mobs and bosses rewards Vasil with experience points he can use to level up his hit points, magic points, attack and defence;  so, while it is possible to speedrun your way to the randomly placed exit, it is not advised.  It is really easy to get ahead of yourself and become cocky, blasting your way through the map at a swift pace, only to become a puddle of goop moments later. I highly advise taking things slowly and checking out all of the possible pathways open to you. If any particular passage looks too dangerous or crowded with enemies for you to make it through, it most likely is. Trust your instincts and look for another way around, otherwise you will pay a hefty price.\n\nMy only gripe with the game is its miniscule amount of graphics options. You are given the choice of a few low screen resolutions  and that’s your lot, you can’t even change to full HD. Surely it wouldn’t be too difficult to include a wider array of resolutions, at the very least?\n\nNonetheless, I have only begun to scratch the surface of Crystal Catacombs, here; it’s a content rich game for those with sufficient gaming skills to see it all. If you loved Spelunky or Binding of Isaac you will be well equipped for the task of conquering the catacombs. Me on the other hand, I’ve succumbed to far too many premature deaths and am in need of a lie down now.\n\nA special shout out also needs to go to Crescent Moon Games who have been publishing some absolutely stellar titles on Steam recently. Crystal Catacombs will fit right in alongside The Deer God and Mimpi.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks to Crescent Moon Games for the promotional review copy.

Crystal Catacombs can be quite difficult but, unlike many rogue-likes, is seldom unfair. The controls might take a little bit of getting used to (jumping is a bit floaty) but once you get over that minor hump the game is a blast. I really like how the save game functionality works. Similar to Rogue Legacy, whenever you defeat a final boss (i.e. complete one of the 5 worlds), that world is marked as completed even if you later die. However, progress within a world is not saved so you do have to complete each world in one go. I think this strikes a great balance between real challene and a sense of progression. If not for this feature, I likely would have given up due to the difficulty of the game. Being able to save completed worlds really gives a nice sense of relief when you have a good run. I would definitely recommend Crystal Catacombs!","February 28, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is -almost- good. The jumping mechanics almost seem to work until you start trying to dodge any enemy projectile or cross any of the numerous platforming sections the game throws at you. Fighting enemies ranges from responsive to downright frustrating, and on numerous occassions I found myself inching at enemies because of their rather enormous attacks compared to my meak little blade. The randomization is pointless, all the levels feel the same in their respective dungeons. The graphics also range from terrible to stylistic and well-done. The main character would be the worst, looking more like a twig than an actual man which makes it all the more difficult to see since you rarely stand out from the lo-fi pixels.\n\nOverall, this game is utterly forgetful. You might (and fairly so) argue that my 30 minutes or so of playtime isn't an accurate amount of time to dismiss/review a game such as this. And you would be right. But, judging from the other reviewers lack of playtime, even the positives, I can safely say there's not much staying power to this game. Go play any of the other numerous rogue-lite platformers, I'm sure you'll find one better than this game.","February 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It runs sluggish even for a game whose highest resolution is 720.  But that doesn't really bother me as much as how impossible it is to play.  I first tried playing with a USB controller, and immediately noticed when binding my buttons that left and right in the menus don't work.  They don't work with my keyboard or with a gamepad.  I exited to the main game to see if I could move left or right at all, and I couldn't.  Then I messed around in the menus and came back and I could.  But that's how the bugs in this game are.  I eventually figured out that hitting the left and right arrow keys AT THE SAME TIME let you move the menu cursor over so that you could access the full menus.  Then I finally started playing the game.  I made it all the way to level 3 of the first area before I started getting suspicious that I wasn't leveling up.  I didn't know what the green bar was under the health bar because the game is devoid of tutorials or a manual.  While mashing buttons I froze the game by hitting the map button.  But I also noticed that I leveled up.  After mashing buttons again hoping that the game wasn't frozen I realized that hitting the map button moved the game forward by one frame each time.  So I rapidly started smacking the button until I was in the map menu, then started doing it again until I was back in the game.  I kept playing and sure enough, when my experience bar maxed out again it just stayed full and I didn't level up.  So I hit the map button again and just like the first time I leveled up by going to the map screen.  But after I got back in the game I looked in the inventory menu and saw that I was still level 2.  The next time I leveled up I correctly went up a level.  So I started to wonder if all of these problems might be from the controller I was using, so I whipped out my Steam controller.  I reset my buttons, and started playing.  Leveling up worked perfectly and besides not having a good d-pad, at least the game was somewhat functional -- until I died the first time.  Then jump no longer jumped.  B was now the jump button instead of A, and Y was now the attack button instead of X. I went to the bindings menu and everything looked normal, but I reset the bindings to the default anyway (by going to the keyboard and hitting left and right at the same time since you can't do that on a gamepad.)  Thank sweet Jesus this fixed it -- until the next time I died.  4 deaths and 4 binding resets later, you could say I'm... frustrated.  On top of everything the game just isn't that good.  Leveling up isn't satisfying because you don't immediately see any effects of doing so.  I think that your weapon has an experience bar, but I never got it to the second level, even after getting to the end of the 3rd level.  You have a mana bar, but I never picked up anything that used it, and I picked up at least 4 powerups.  I also never got a ranged weapon which made some big enemies almost impossible to kill without getting your health bar destroyed.  Don't get me started on the ice level with the most slippery ice you've ever experienced.  It's some mystical ice that defies the laws of physics and you never stop sliding.  And by reading the reviews I found out that this game was MORE buggy before, and that the devs haven't updated it in a long time.  Also, the soundtrack IS good, but there's only one track per area (not level, AREA) so in a game where you will be dying constantly you can look forward to hearing the same track for a long, long time.","May 13","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a frequently occuring gamebreaking bug where the physics stop working and your character gets trapped in an invisible wall. There are random massive frame rate drops that can cause the physics bug. If either of these things happen, you have to quit the game. If this only happened once or twice, no big deal. This happened to me roughly 15 times in about an hour. I was NEVER able to complete a single stage because the game's unstability became unbearable. This is only the major problem. There are other minor bugs like enemy animations/attacks not working properly, character randomly changing directions, attack buttons sometimes stops working... Outside of bugs, the controls are abysmal. Stiff and clunky are words not strong enough to describe how bad they are. Jumping is a nightmare, which is a big problem considering its a platforming game.\n\nIf the game functioned properly, I would recommend it even with the bad controls, but the game does not function. It seems as if the game was never properly tested or even played before being released. Hopefully a bug fixing update will save this game, the potential is there.

The game is super pixelated, so much so that you can't see wat is part of the background and what isn't. There is no direction and no explanation of game features, mechanics, what you are looking for, or where to go. You wander around until you die and then repeat. The enemies are terrible. They are always too low to hit without crouching, but when you do they jump at you, because you have a sword so you have to get close.
