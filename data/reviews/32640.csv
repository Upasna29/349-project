Shame I cant show my game time from back then because I pretty much lived on this game when I was not at work or some place else. Bought the CD like 8 times because people kept jacking it. The last time after I begged Novalogic to add it here on Steam I destroyed all my game CDs or Gave them away & bought my games that were available here on Steam. No more jacked disks, scratches, or lost disks. Wooo whooo! Don't show much play time on Steam because the game runs smoother on XP then other later versions of Windows. Runs pretty good on Linux too but I prefer Windows for gaming. If you have Windows XP & a decent video card for the games time then you might enjoy this game. I don't think they have any rated servers anymore but you should still be able to find quite a few player based servers some of which have their own stats servers. One of the best Squads I played on was KOP which I got into by a friend I played Co-Ops with all the time "Drippen KOP". Any way if you want a good FPS try it out!","December 17, 2013","true","1.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","1"

With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.","April 2, 2011","true","9.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/32640/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Delta Force Land Warrior (just DFLW from now on) is basically Delta Force 3, a slight refinement of their "voxel engine" ground based games (which includes a tank game as well as previous DF games, and the Commanche helo game), with a pretty long campaign, some single mmissions (which includes many of the campaign missions), plus the real reason to play DF... multiplayer mode.\n\nI will be mainly discussing SP because I generally don't play MP.\n\nBeing a 14+ year old game, the poly count on the characters and structures are bad, and buildings are almost always at right angles to each other.  However, the ground is gorgeous, with smooth contours that you can jump, slide, crouch, even crawl and sometimes, swim through. (Yes, there's some water levels, like island map or swamp map).\n\nYou are limited to what you can carry: 2 heavy weapons, 2 long guns, one pistol, some grenades, and optional equipment. Heavy weapons are AT-4 rockets, satchel charges, or claymore antipersonnel mines. Optional equipment would be extra ammo or kevlar vest for a little more protection. Two long guns are plenty, but basically its one for long range work (sniper rifles or LMGs) and one for medium/short range work, such as assault rifles, SMGs and shotguns.  There are occasionally supply cabinets where you can requisition extra stuff (i.e. change your loadout) within the mission. There's no scavenging off the enemy or such. If you used up all your ammo, you're done for except for your knife.\n\nAnyway, as said before, the beauty is the terrain, as each map is HUGE. MUCH bigger than most MP maps. While the ground is not really textured the contours are such that you don't really feel what's missing. The hills, islands, or little bayou feel "real" (or real enough) and the fun part here is water, as there's more water-related missions such as island (and you can take a dip by swimming underwater) and swamp (lots of little ponds to hide in).\n\nThe buildings didn't get any upgrades, as remain as they are in previous DF games... Mostly sharp angles much like Castle Wolfenstein, but with true multiple levels, and enemies possible at all levels. AND there are possible underground elvels where you get even more stuff. There is no underground passages map... All you get is this little "radar" which doesn't tell you any levels. And sometimes, you don't get even that (i.e. no satellite coverage for you!)\n\nAny way, the game basically boils down to two phases... From long distance, snipe everybody you can see before they shoot you (enemy snipers are rare) preferably with a silenced weapon so they can't find you. Circle the entire enemy camp and repeat (and take out the surrounding patrols). Then go inside the camp and clean it out in CQB with your silenced SMG or silenced pistol. There really is no point playing it any other way, no matter which type of operator you pick, at least in SP.\n\nWind and bullet drop at distance are simulated, so you have to account for wind and measure the distance (read it from the scope), or you can view the bullet impact and adjust manually, if you shoot that far. Hypothetically shots of 1000 meters is possible if you get the sniper rifle with the most powerful scope (14x), the Barrett M82A1 .50 cal sniper rifle, but in practice most shots will be at about 100-300 meter range.\n\nThe missions will have you travel to various exotic locations, from sands of Egypt (Sphinx and Pyramids) to jungles of Colombia to deserts of Mexico (complete with a ghost town and church) to snowy hills of Europe to little islands of Micronesia. Of course, visually they are roughly the same, albeit with different lighting levels and ground colors. :D  (and structures and vegetation)\n\nYou will encounter dozens, perhaps hundreds of enemies, many of whom are equipped as good as you or better. And they are capable of one shot kills. And sometimes, you'll even run into enemy gunships.\n\nWhich brings us to some oddities of Novalogic games: the key bindings. Basically Novalogic seems to be allergic to use conventional key bindings. There's no "grenade" key. While they use WASD, everything else is weird. Save key is F11 and Load key is F12 (which of course, conflicts with Steam's screenshot key). And there is no AutoSave or Checkpoint save. If you didn't manual save and you die, you start ALL THE SAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING. And you are only allowed 3 save slots per mission. (and some of these missions can run VERY long, esp. if you do it the slow and careful way)\n\nThere is that feeling of accomplishment though, when you managed to clear the map and depopulated it of enemies all by yourself, by sneaking left, and right, and sometimes, right under the enemies, and shoot them in the back or the sides, often when your teammate (AI bot in the script) sometimes don't even survive that far.\n\nThe game sometimes do throw you a curveball or two, such as scripted events when you get to a certain point on the map, like spawn new enemies. There's a mission where I need to lase 6 enemy attack helos. Got that. As I went for extraction, my extraction chopper got shot down (scripted). I ran for the chopper, found the pilots escaped unharmed, tried to lead them to secondary extraction zone, killed a patrol, when 4 paratroopers dropped in front of me (from what? There's no more helos and there's no planes overhead...)\n\nAs this game is almost before the wheeled mouse, mousewheel adjusts the shot compensation, not zoom level. This is part of the other interface quirks present in almost all Novalogic games.\n\nAll in all, DFLW is an old classic. It's redone as Delta Force Xtreme a few years back, so you should get THAT instead of this game. This game is NOT recommended except for nostalgia or complete a collection.\n","January 3, 2015","false","18.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"
