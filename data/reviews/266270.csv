"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobearGWJ/recommended/266270/","RobearGWJ","Robear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobearGWJ/","588 products in account","This is a card solitaire game in which matching cards allows your offense or defense to do their job in the game.  Match enough and you'll have the forward motion you need for a first down on offense.  On defense, you'll stop the opposing player's advance.\n\nHaving to draw a card carries the possibility of a "Big Play", a short text event that can end the play or change it significantly.  And it might not end in your favor!  Your draws are unlimited on offense, with a high possibility of a Big Play, but on defense you have a limited number, with a lower possibility of the play ending suddenly.  This makes for an interesting dynamic, with poor play leading to even good defenses collapsing.  The mechanic forces you to allow your opponent some gains, and hopefully you can hold them to less than they need for a first down without drawing.\n\nAnother mechanic has you attempting to guess your opponent's play call (run or pass, it's not complicated) before each play.  Each team has stats for running, passing, special teams and the like, so you can predict somewhat how they will play.  If you guess correctly, you get an extra card slot for the play, which is a big advantage.\n\nTeams are tracked through a season and rated relative to each other.  Don't pick a weak team hoping to play it up, at least not to start with.  That's a sure path to disappointment.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels, which affect the basic yard totals for plays based on your play guessing, and this is a solitaire game, so no multiplayer.\n\nThe football mechanics are notional - you need forty yards to complete a first down.  Why?  Because this helps shorten the game so that a hand of solitaire is not an hour long.  :-)  There are still halves and quarters, and punts and field goal attempts.\n\nThis is a fun game of football and cards, enjoyable whether you understand football or not.  Buy it!  You'll like it.","January 22, 2014","true","3.5"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","41","45","0","0"

[www.oneguytoomanygames.com]\n\nI didn't really have any expectations going into Gridiron Solitaire. I knew a little about it, but none of the details. For such an abstract representation of football, it does a great job at capturing the flavor. This is one of the more enjoyable games I've played for a game with such simple mechanics. While I thought the matching mechanics were too simplistic, managing the Big Plays was great fun. I was getting excited both when things did and didn't work out for me. Bill Harris included so many little touches that just tickled my shoulder pads - not the hideous 1980s women's shoulder pads, but the cool football ones.\n\nMr. Harris does have plans to continue to improve the game, but I don't have any details about what may be included in the updates.\n\nIf you sometimes like to relax with a more casual game and don't mind games with a good chunk of luck, consider purchasing Gridiron Football.","January 26, 2014","true","30.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

How do I even begin to describe such a game? It took me quite some time to grasp just the bare basics of the game. The game is a bit difficult to explain, so please bear with me.\n\nThe game essentially combines solitaire and football. Yes, that sounds a bit strange, but it surprisingly works, no idea how the devs managed to pull that off, but props to them for doing so. Basically, you have to match cards (against the opposing team) in order to get the offense/defense to do their thing.\n\nThere's also a "Big Play" mechanic, in which you're able to draw a card during your turn, placing another card onto the field. This mechanic can tremendously change the outcome of  a play, in either your own favor, or the opposing side's favor. When playing offense, you can use as many Big Plays as you wish, but you only have a limited number when using them as the defense.\n\nThe game has three difficulties to choose from. I went with the normal difficulty, which may have been a bad idea for a complete noob to the game. The game also goes deep into team customization and rankings. The teams are tracked per season and compared against each other for that specific season.\n\nFor someone who does not care for football, I thought I had figured out the game just fine during my play session. I'd recommend it only to those willing to learn how to play it, as it's quite difficult to understand going into it.","February 3, 2014","true","0.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

No more, no less." It's literally a game where you match up cards, hope that the RNG (Random Number Generator) is good and try and out score your opponent. Most of the time it does seem that the RNG is definitely NOT on your side, especially when you're on defense or it's late in the game and you're trying to mount a comeback or stave off one. If you're looking for a good time waster and/or a game that you can play without thinking to hard, this is for you. However, anyone looking for a true tactical and/or a true American football like experience you'll be mightily disappointed.","June 15, 2015","true","43.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

On defense it is supposed to be the same. But it doesn't work that way. When on defense, and you guess wrong, the computer opponent STARTS OUT with a 25 yard gain, and it takes solitaire matches to reduce it. But there are very few matches. Even when you guess right against the computer opponent, it STILL starts off with a 12 yard gain that you have to whittle down, again with very few matches available.\n\nNow when YOU are on offense and the computer guesses wrong against you, for a pass, you start at zero yards, and MUST get THREE matches in a row before you gain a paltry 8 yards. Subsequent matches add yardage, but again they are few and far between. When you run the football, and the computer guesses wrong, once again you start at zero yards, and add 4 yards for subsequent matches. Now if the computer guesses right, it is that much harder to gain any yards.\n\nAnd the computer sneaks a peak at what you choose as well, I purposely ran nothing but pass plays for three possessions, gaining some yards, and figured now I'd start off witha run. Of course the computer 'guessed' right on run, when there is absokutely no possible way it could have, based on previous play calls.\n\nIf this game sounds interesting to you, wait until it is at least 75% off, and be prepared for a mountain of frustration. Even at 75% off you may very well regret your purchase.\n\nNOTE: A new update to the game was applied on July 4. It added kickoff and punt returns, plus penalties. Penalties reduced your chances even more of getting matches, and running plays now only gain 3 yards per match, instead of 4. Also, when you guess right on defense, the computer opponent starts off with a 15 yard gain now, rather than the original 12.\n\nI also noticed special teams plays result in TDs (for the computer opponent, of course) more often, plus more turnovers (again, for the computer opponent) when the player uses a Big Play, regardless of weather.\n\nBottom line: Made an already extremely frustrating game even more so. I now wouldn't even recommend buying it even at 75% off. Save your money and the frustration.","June 11, 2014","false","14.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","2"

The lead designer turned me onto Fairway Solitaire long ago, and that became a favorite of mine.  I'm about three hours into Gridiron Solitaire now and I'm not disappointed.  I think the most interesting thing to me is the uncanny way that this card game feels like football.  Something about the rhythm of it feels right.  I would not have believed that I could feel a sense of tension while playing solitaire, but when I used my last defensive Big Play of the game and saw the computer drive to the end zone in disturbingly short order, I started to panic that my 14 point lead might not be enough.

Yet, the only time that information is available is in the pre-game "broadcast" -- once it's underway, you'd better remember what it was, 'cause there isn't any way to see that stuff (at least that I can see).  If it's that important, why isn't it in the main game UI anywhere?\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game, there just isn't enough game there for the ten bucks IMHO, especially given the low-budget look and feel.

I hope the Dev's  do more of these and add the other sports like Basketball, Soccer, Baseball, Boxing ect. Also I wonder if you can do a multiplayer version.","October 11, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However, its important to potential buyers to know a couple of things.  First, its almost completely luck driven.  The AI seems to pick defensive and offensive plays at random, so there's little to no strategy involved in play-calling.  Then, of course, there's a the luck of the cards themselves.  Secondly, there are a couple of very strange design choices.  Offensive passes need 3 matches to be complete.  But when the opponent passes, its automatically complete.  Its just a question of how many yards are picked up.  And the "unlimited" Big Plays on offense are ridiculously limited.  Most often, you don't even get a card.  Why it wasn';t handled like it is on defense is beyond me.\n\nI desperately wanted a truly good football strategy sim.  This isn't it.","February 11, 2014","false","8.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

The football mechanics are more relevant though than the golf is to Fairway Solitaire as you've got real decisions about run vs. pass given yard and down. The big play mechanics throw a bit of resource management into it.\n\nIt's absolutely not a football simulation though. It's a solitaire game with an extra layer on it. It's also something you can sit down and play for 15-20 minutes and complete a game, so it's a great option when you've got a short time to fill.","February 18, 2015","true","26.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You may just be clicking cards, but you'll quickly find yourself on the edge of your seat trying to convert on 3rd and long or trying to stop your opponent on 3rd and short.  You'll leap for joy when you run back a kickoff for a touchdown or when your defense gets an instant sack.  You'll find yourself managing the clock, trying to run down the game when you have a comfortable lead, or sprinting across the field with a pass heavy attack when you're down by two scores with the 4th quarter winding down.\n\nIt's amazing how much emotion this game can pull up from clicking on cards.  If you're a fan of football you will have a lot of fun with this game - it's well worth the normal price of $10, and it's an absolute steal if it's on sale at all.","May 22, 2015","true","67.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
