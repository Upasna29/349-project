The graphics are good without being too demanding so heavy fighting hardly slows down at all, making for some seriously nasty battles.  It feels balanced and the ship modification adds a real personal feel to what I do and how I play the game.  The only time I failed at a mission so far was due to the tricky nature of disabling a ship without destroying it, as you need lasers or boarding drones which turned into a bit of a game of hide in the bigger ship's blind spots.  The learning curve can be a little hard but if you played and loved games like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident, Freelancer & Independence War,  then this game is right up those lines.\n\nFor the new players, heres a few quick things I learned that were the most useful starting out:\nCreate a group for your ships with ctrl+F1-F4 to make fleet orders easy, else you will have a lot of trouble with collisions and having to give orders multiple times.\nDouble right-click is your friend, it tells your ship(s) to fly in a given direction relative to themselves until told otherwise.\nNav points / points of intrest are the best way to travel.  Full of loot?  Just set a point of intrest where you are, then just order your ships to jump to the nearest station.  Its faster than normal speed and your ships WONT CRASH enrout!\nTurrets are picky, make sure you dont buy a FIXED weapon (instead of a turret) or the wrong size for the mounts on your ship.  Its a costly mistake to make.\nRepairs are a big deal, so think about having a ship just for utility drones if you dont have any.  They can fix as well as mine for the minerals used to repair your fleet, plus you need them to grab more booty!\nAs with any game, there are bugs and issues to be sure but so far none have been game breaking or even all that troubling.  A few graphics oddities with the tactical view for instance, or autosaves in the system view getting bugged.  Nothing that impacted my enjoyment even a little, so way to go testers and devs!  Compared to some reacent big name games, thats actually saying something, keep up the great work.","October 17, 2015","true","67.6"," 87 of 96 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","87","96","4","0"

I can only guess I'm doing something wrong, whether in map mode or in 3d space, I can't seem to get my ships to arrive at the right x,y,z coordinates without major headaches.\n- Interaction with objects is difficult as well. Non-ship interactible objects seem to be the worst offenders.\n- NPC Ships can (and will) follow you across the map. While I don't generally mind that idea, it only leads to frustration. One time I was trying to read quest text, and a bunch of little drones were swarming me, so I bolted away, then started reading the text again. They followed and blew me up. Several hours lost since my previous auto save. Another time I had traveled to the main space station. I was docked with it, changing loadouts when I was attacked and destroyed by... Well I have no idea what it was, but it wasn't fun.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n- I'd be more excited about the game if it were early access so the "ugly" issues could get addressed, I don't feel this game reached the quality level that you would expect for an actually released title. (indy or not)\n- If you can get over the old-style art and initial learning curve, there could be dozens of hours of fun.\n- If the game were $10 I'd probably give it a thumbs up, but only for those who are system design nerds and/or are into sci-fi ship management.","October 17, 2015","false","6.8"," 115 of 173 people (66%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","66","115","173","10","2"

There was always something missing.\n\nWhen i first started battle, i did bite off more than i can chew.\n\nUsually i would just have given up.\n\nBut i was playing Ceres - so i turned my armor towards the heavy hitters, where it was thickest, moved all power from weapons into engines and systems, and commanded the crew to focus on repairing the most critical parts of the ship, while preparing to jump the hell out of here.\nI send all the drones to attack, hoping they would catch some of the fire, and took over control of the ship manually - there were heavy slugs incomming, and someone had to dodge them after all.\n\nWith my mineral resources used up by the repairs, the energy almost out and modules in critical damage, i got just enough space in between me and the bulk of the enemy fleet, to speed up for the jump, except for the pesky frigate that was fast enough to catch up with my ship. But this was one of the possibilities, that i had accounted for.\n\nSome hours before all this mess, i was sitting, docked, at the nearest station, browsing through the shopping list for the latest ship AI, that would give me just the right edge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morimur/recommended/351300/","morimur","Mordekai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morimur/","577 products in account","The Bad:\nBugs, and lots of them.\nMost of them aren't game-breaking, but they range from annoying to downright obnoxious (e.g., duplicate "outlines" when in tactical mode, formation bugs that prevent you from placing ships properly, drones stuck hovering ~100m off your ship that won't return, mods that stop working, repair systems showing offline even when idling at shipyard with no damage, etc.). I did encounter one bug on the final mission that did break my game, and reloading from saves didn't resolve it. GG I suppose.\nPoor Optimization\nGenerally the game performs well, but send out 20-30 drones, or turn on tactical mode with active scan up during a larger fight, and I've found the game will often slow to a crawl. There also seems to be an issue where the game becomes painfully slow regardless. My only recourse has been to save/load which fixes it for a time.\nShip Control\nIt's VERY difficult to manage your ships properly aside from pausing and issuing orders one by one. The fleet formations don't work very well, and something as simple as jumping to a location or ordering your fleet to follow something will cause untold numbers of collisions, to the point I almost lost one of my battlecruisers during a fight before I realized two of my ships were tangled in a dance of death.\nThe Mediocre:\nNot Early Access\nI know, I KNOW! In the age of early access letdowns, I too hope the next person to say "this game has potential" dies in a fire as much as the next guy, but this game does have potential, and if it were in early access I'd definitely recommend watching how it turned out for anyone even remotely interested. Unfortunately, it's in a relase state so I'm uncertain how much effort is still going into it.\nMediocre Story/Voice Acting\nTo each his own here, and while I consider myself pretty forgiving, the story/voice acting are both very underwhelming. The story overall is your typical  save the human species  trope which is fine, but it's telling is mediocre at best.\nThe Good:\nCustomization\nOne of the places this game really shines is how much customizing you can do on your ships. It's almost too much for me, because I got OCD about that ♥♥♥♥, and spent way too long on it. XD\nBoarding Mechanics\nWhile it needs a little balancing (boarding and capturing a ship is too easy to accomplish once you figure it out), it's incredibly satisfying to snag a top tier ship in a fight where you managed a lucky hack and if you miss your next hack you're very likely to get obliterated before you can successfully capture the disabled monster in front of you. Epic stuff.\nCombat\nThe combat is fun, to a point. It becomes slightly monotonous later in the game when you're fielding a fleet than can wreck an entire zone even if they rushed you all at once. Still, firing a beam of megadeath right through an enemy frigate is absurdly cathartic. Overall I enjoyed it.\nSounds/Music\nThe sounds and music, while not top notch, fit the theme well and add to the atmosphere. They won't be winning any awards for it, but that doesn't mean they're not enjoyable.\nGraphics\nThis area I considered placing in mediocre, but I can't bring myself to. Yes, it's what you're thinking, it's exactly because the game is indie that I consider them good. There really aren't any issues with them, and while it's easy to make space beautiful, they're still good for what they are.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe game could do with some polish and bug fixes. I realize it's just the small (I think one-man) dev team working incredibly hard and I respect that, but that should never be used as an excuse. Besides, I voted with my wallet here, and I sincerely hope the guy behind this goes on to make bigger and better worlds.\n\nOverall, buy this game if you're a fan of the genre and are a patient person. Just remember to save often, lest the bugs eat you. If you're on the fence, or are not a forgiving person, either wait til it's on sale or pass on it. Either way I recommend following the team behind it, there's clearly some talent there.\n\nPotential FAQ\nQ: "But why did you put "the bad" up front if you're recommending the game?"\nA: "Because I want people to know what they're getting themselves into. It takes effort to look past those issues and still enjoy this for what it is."\n\nEdit: Formatting","February 28","true","40.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

This game is HUGE, by that I mean in depth. Yet it still manages to deliver a huge open world.\n\nYou are able to trade, Mine, Bounty hunt, Take missions, Retrofit your ships, Hire mercenaries, Captains, Crew, Train crew.\n\nThere is an entire fleet system mechanics, Formations a loot system and there is what seems to be a very indepth Drone system that I haven't even touched yet... I'm addicted and haven't even scratched the surface at how much depth this game has. For example there is a very fleshed out character progression system in game where experience points can be converted to skills, the system is incredibly similar to how fallout 3 handles this, with each interest having a skill point from 0-100 and then perks for each captain in individual ships of your fleet.\n\nIt's a fully 3D game with Homeworld esque style controls, However it's more centered on individual ships and the mechanics therein.\n\nSo far, I'm intrigued by the story.\n\nIt's got beautiful fleet combat, epic brawls and the combat is very stylised. Some might find it very difficult, So tactics is everything.\n\nOnly downsides thus far is dated graphics which can improve and the need for more optimisations to allow a lag free environment with lots and lots of individual ships.

In this respect, this game deliver fully its potential.\n-Second, this might not feel as much of a big deal, but the developers of this game is working one polishing the bugs out at a very fast rate(one day after release theres a patch and then 2 days later theres another one). This game is going to be awesome(future tense), all it need is the support the player gives(by buying it of course). Just take it as another investment.

It starts off slow because there is a learing curve involved with playing this game. Any hardcore players will love this, while casual gamers will probably have difficulty paying attention for 2 seconds. Afterwards, it gets easy because you get a feel on how to navigate through open space (watch out for those radiation clouds - yikes). There are loads of missions for you to do, ships to hire, missions to accept, items to be bought and sold, commanders to be trained and equipped for each ship where each ship has its strengths and weaknesses. There is a lot of content in a seemingly easy enough concept of a game. I absolutely recommend this game.\n\nThere are a few problems that aren't really game-breakers, but would greatly improve the game if implemented.\n\n1.) While thrusting through space at max speed, I find going up and down difficult (even though there isn't a up and down in space). Which means it's easy enough to travel left to right, but if I want to get a better strategic position behind a asteroid or to flank an enemy from below, it's quite difficult. I know that you have to hold shift while commanding your ships to travel, but it seems rather strange to me. For me, it would be much simpler and enjoyable to just point and go. Meaning wherever I point in a place in space, I go directly there.\n\n2.) I only played for a bit, and maybe I missed it but I find maneuvering in space combat a hassel. It probably doesn't matter because all of the pirates have homing missles and lasers to shoot you with dead accuracy. But when I was in a firefight with the enemy, I couldn't move and fire my weapons at the same time. It would be nice to be able to fire weapons while going to different position at the same time. If there is a way to do this, or if it has already been done, that would make battles very intense and awesome.\n\n3.) When I first started playing this game, I went straight towards the tutorial. Call me a noob, but I actually want to know how to play the game. Now, I don't have the worst eye sight in the world, but much of the HUD, or symbols and text on the screen was very - VERY small. I found that I would go full asian and squint like I'm staring directly at the sun just to see the text and symbols. If there is a way, or if it's already been implemented, it would be excellent to have resisable text and symbols in the game. Or at the very least, re-write the code to make the display size for the text and symbols at least 4 times larger. This is especially important when staring at hundreds of items in your inventory and you have to grab a magnifying glass to look at your computer screen! Bigger the text, the better!\n\n4.) Maybe I'm a sucker for sound, but I like music in game. Maybe you can come up with some unique songs in a DLC and import them into the game. I have no beef with the tracks that play over and over again, but there needs to be some variety, at least in my stupid opinion.\n\n5.) Lastly, this is a little bug in the tutorial. When I started firing my rockets at the dummy targets, I accidentaly blew a gaping hole in my A.I.'s ship. Because the crew didn't feel like dying that day, they moved from where they were, to inside of the particle cloud. Now, the particle clouds make it so that no one can see them or track them. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for one of the tutorials being how to trade. I couldn't get the ship back into visibility and thus, couldn't do the trading tutorial. This is because to do the tutorial, you need that ship to be available - which it wasn't.\n\nOverall Awesome Game! I can see this getting a lot of attention and fame. I totally dig it, and it was worth the money I spent.\n\n"10/10" - Would hug the producer.","October 19, 2015","true","4.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","1"

Even in its unfinished state it's better than some of the similar games from large, well-funded operations.  It's the small developers that are willing to risk trying new things if buyers are willing to take a chance on them.  It's an investment, and as with any such, you win some you lose some.    The missions are complex, the scale of the game is huge--which accounts for the learning curve.  Part of the entertainment value of such games is the chance to help in development.

This game could have been extremely fun. It has so many wonderful things, that you could say were borrowed from other games, that the Dev added to his game, that really brought life to the game.\n\nI love so many things about this game, from the leveling up of captains, using skills and perks (Very similar to Fall Out's skills and Perk system btw) to the ability to hack other ships to disable them, and using drones to fight or just board them and take command of them. You can train your crew, increasing the bonus they provide to your ship. You  get so many options on weapons, and different options for system modules, like drone controllers, cargo bays and different bridges or A.I.\n\nWith all these things, you really must be asking, why don't I recommend this game, right? Well in it's current state, the game is unplayable for me. I have literally spent more time in loading screens, saving and loading the game, than I have playing it. The bugs are plentiful, and game breaking at this point. I lose ship modules such as the bridge on my starting ship, and the power plant on the cruiser I purchased. My engines randomly stop providing thrust to my ship, the game decides to turn off my weapons for no reason, even though I have enough power for them. My fleet screen goes blank, so I cannot turn the weapons systems back on as well. The ships refuse to take orders at times, and the game decides to stop auto following a ship you double click on. The drones also decide not to return to the ship all the way, they just sit outside running into the ship, so I cannot launch more, nor do I get the supplies they were sent out to retrieve. Also loading a save with drones outside the ship, often times removes those drones from the game, so you lose them for good.\n\nI wish the game did not have so many bugs, nor such devistating bugs. At the moment, I am stuck between praising the dev for the ingenuity for making such a neat game, and cursing him for frustrating me to no end, causing me to spend more than half my time reloading my save, hoping my ships will follow my move orders, that my drones will return to my ship, that the ship I just boarded and captured, will let me sell it at the space station. I am about ready to give up on this game until some serious fixes come down the pipe-line. I know the dev is a one man show, but that is no excuse. If you can't handle putting out a quality product that is not broken, then don't put out the product at all. You lose the one thing that you cannot fix so easily, and that is your credibility, and right now, this dev is just about all out with me.\n\n\nEDIT 10/26/2015:\nUpon the request of the dev, I gave this game another shot, after the most recent round of patches, that he said fixes the problems with the game. I played for about an hour and a half, and it crashed to desktop twice in that time, which was quite an improvement over the last few times I had played the game. But I crashed to the desktop twice, in under two hours. That is much better sure, but it shouldn't be crashing at all. The movement system is still very clunky, and the captains still decide to ignore your move commands sporatically. Well at this point in time, with the bugs reduced to an unhealthy couple, as opposed to a cancerous truck load like before. I can recommend this game now, and if the dev keeps his word to continue to bring improvements to the game, then it should only get better from here.","October 18, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Save / load during quests is IMHO not recommended as it may trigger issues.\n\npros\n- Story is original and doesn't feel generic.\n- Ships have large degree of customizability (each ship have slots for weapons and internal components which can be fitted as desired, oh the choices, larger weapon which drains more power or more drone bays ?)\n- Captains, each ship can have captain which increases (or decreases) ship effectivity, Too bad maximum level is 25, here I was hoping for superman and xman combined.\n\nneutral\n- Combat could be really fun when You decide to go tactical instead of buy that battlecruiser and obliterate them all. IMHO game should allow buying/capturing larger ships based on progress to enforce some tactics. But that's just opinion as some of You want to exterminate those little pirate, cyclops or mars forces, dontcha ?\n\nnegative\n- All those insects are getting squashed.\n- Commanding multiple ships in fleet kindof sucks for now, but it's on list of things which will be fixed.\n- Game allows too many exploits which will make Your gameplay easier however will decrease fun factor. Some principles should be made less tedious (why is moving captured ship so freaking slow while capturing is quite easy ? why ismoving cargo between ships so tedious - drop into space and load by drones etc...)\n\n\n\nIn the end all the bad things are not that bad and You'll get around them, because You will love and hate this game at the same time.
