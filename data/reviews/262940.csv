Finally they dropped that ugly looking 3D graphics and annoying controls and got back to the roots.\nThe game looks amazing, beautifully drawn environments just makes you take screenshots.\nFrom the very beginning you can feel that broken swordish atmosphere and hear the great music, nostalgia conquers you and finally you start your adventure with George and Nico.\nThe story is good as always and it's very broken swordish too. Religious symbols, some legend, people who want destroy the world, you know.\nGame has been split into two parts. First part feels easier (at least for me), second part has some more action and good puzzles which could take some time to solve. Overall game is not very hard. Old school hardcore gamers probably wouldn't like it. But in my opinion the adventure game cannot be very hard when it has a logical solutions to the puzzles. I don't like when you need to do absolutely stupid and illogical things to solve something, so i'll better have an easier game but with logical puzzles.\nEveryone who played the old Broken sword games should remember the damn goat. I remember it. It was a pain. Guess what? The goat is back! Of course people who didn't play the previous games probably will not be happy seeing all those characters from Georgie and Nico's past and will not understanding some dialogues and jokes, but don't worry, George has a new friend - Trevor. He's cute, he likes cookies and is very brave, he risk his live for George and he's a real hero.\nSorry i'm very biased towards this game series, it's my favorite. It's hard for me to say something negative about it, but i'll try. In the second part there're couple lines of subtitles missing. Ok that's enough bashing this game.\nIf you like adventure games i'd say this is a must have and if you liked it you should play previous games or at least 1 and 2. Yes they're old but still looking good, such games doesn't get old.\nSo get this game, go on adventure, save the world and eat a doner kebab.","August 18, 2014","true","18.1"," 53 of 63 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","53","63","0","11"

Following George and Nico in their adventure of murder and mystery (with a touch of history) is as enjoyable as ever while solving puzzles to help progress the story.\n\n# Candy\nClassic 2D hand-drawn locations are here once more, they are beautiful and it is what we love in Broken Sword combined with recognizable music that fits the scenes and events perfectly yet unobtrusively. Both characters and voice acting are well done and the story is decent. Favourite detail which I have to mention is being reminded on the puzzle from the very first Broken Sword which I'll never forget due to frustration and relief after solving it. While it is hard to talk about replay value in this genre or the lack of it - I can see myself playing through the game a few times either because of achievements which are a nice addition or simply because I want more Broken Sword.\n\n# Chilli\nThe story is the only thing that left me a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong - it is a decent story but when compared to the first two Broken Sword games they seem deeper, fuller and their puzzles seem more challenging.\n\n# 7.5 Point & Clicks out of 10\nFor fans of the genre - you don't want to miss a game this good. For those who are new to the franchise - play the first two prior to this one.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520990738","September 18, 2015","true","13.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

However, if I'm about to be fair, it's slightly above average. Adventure games aren't that common these days, and if you've never heard about Broken Sword series, for the price, it's not that bad.\n\nSynopsis\nBut if you're a Broken Sword fan like me, I would either not recommend the purchase, or buy it, thinking of it as kind of spin off game that has little to do with what made original great. For me particularly, it's the writing, acting and music.\n\nStoryline & characters\n\nVery uninspired and lazy. Dialogues are not funny, painfully cheesy, stuff happens solely for the plot to continue further, characters are (with some exceptions) quite bland, even George (!!!) and you can spot every cliche from miles away. "Hey, this place is not safe, let me tell you all that important stuff at much safer place, and count on me not to get killed on the way there!" Original Broken Sword was playing it seriously, but was packed to the top with dry humor that was fitting perfectly. Here, it's nothing like that. Goofy, lazy, stupid and only here and there you'll catch a glimpse of something funny. A lot of old characters that have been brought back are just pointless cameos without any reason to be there, plus they've all lost their charm. (Moe is nothing like the funny goofball he used to be, now he's really just a guy. A guy without any personality.)\n\nVoice actors are also really bland. They all play it safe, so you'll never get a really bad impression, but you'll never get an impression that they beleive stuff is happening around them. Compared to how amazing they were in first game, once again, it's just a letdown. I personally blame whoever was in charge of voice acting, because actors can only do so much on their own, if they're not told what kind of vision director has. And I don't think they're bad, just badly utilized.\n\nMusic and graphics\n\nMusic is also somewhat of a letdown to me. Broken Sword 1 had amazing and memorable orchestral soundtrack and each track was carefully selected so it really had a meaning and helped out building atmosphere. Here, it's sometimes decent, but overall I just felt like in case of Fable series, where soundtrack never got any better than the first one. Plus I'm missing those little musical cues when something was happening, again, it's here and there, but not enough. Not terrible, but not amazing.\n\nAnd graphics - I'm a big sucker for traditional 2D animation, not cell shaded 3D graphics like this one has. It's awkward. But I can understand that once again, budget issues wouldn't allow for traditional animation, or perhaps Revolution thinks this look sells more. I've always adored cutscenes from original, because some of them were like something out of Don Bluth movies (and if you don't know who he is, do some research), here for obvious reasons, it isn't like that. And don't get me wrong, the game isn't ugly, but it feels phony. Also, there is almost nothing going on in background. Remember the rich and animated backgrounds in original? Compared to traditional animation, it's just cheap and once again, takes you out from the overall experience, but compared to other things, it doesn't bother me too much.\n\nIn the end, I'm happy for Revolution that they can continue doing what they love, it's better to get something than nothing and frankly, as I've sayed, it's at least an average game. I just wish it was better, and I'm still hoping that one day we'll get that Broken Sword game that will be just as awesome as the first one was.","June 13, 2014","false","25.4"," 76 of 119 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","76","119","0","0"

Aside from The Walking Dead, Broken Sword has always been an exception to that rule. The first two games featured great puzzles, snappy dialogue, and intriguing mysteries. But after an awful third and fourth entry into the series, I was afraid the adventure genre was dead to me.\n\nThen along comes Broken Sword 5: The Serpents Curse. It does away with the horrendous transition to 3D and instead returns to gorgeous 2D backdrops. Back again is the clever dialogue and intriguing but not too obscure puzzles, and it's back one more time for another clever mystery. I really, really cannot reccoemend this game enough. You don't need to have played the others in the series, so it won't hurt to start here. If you love this game, go back and play the first two.\n\n-I opened a skylight with a bottle of diet cola and mints, then used a grappling hook made out of a dust cover and a crowbar to escape a building.  10/10","February 15, 2015","true","9.7"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","0"

The game made me laugh. Thumbs up.\n\n… Well, if you want a little more detail than that, fine, I guess I could try to expand upon why it won me over.\n\nI first learned that the point & click game series “Broken Sword” existed because of my cell phone actually. I had a smart phone. I had no games on it that would hold my attention for more than 15 minutes or so. And, at the time, I had a three-hour flight. Dreading boredom, I browsed games until I found Broken Sword 1.  Then a month later I bought Broken Sword 2. By that time I become a casual fan of the series so of course I bought Broken Sword 5.\n\nIt took me a bit to understand WHY this point and click game stood out to me. It wasn’t exactly ground breaking. Each game had a mystery plot that had the characters adventuring to new locations and trying to solve a murder that revolves around historical artifacts and each game had puzzles that made you think outside the box. The art was great and the voice acting was wonderful. The plot was  humorous and filled with fun loving characters.\n\nIt was good on all these levels, but there was an additional something that just makes it more noticeable to me. I still have trouble putting my finger on it, but I can only described the feel as a serene level of calm pleasantness. Playing Broken Sword 5 (as well as the other broken sword games) was like picking up a favorite book again or going fishing with some buddies.\n\nThere was no feeling of urgency to complete the game, no over exotic melodrama, no underlying political messages, jarring scenes of violence, or crazy car chases. I didn’t play this game because everyone else was talking about it or because it was on the latest and greatest tech.\n\nIt was a  casual player’s dream. To play a game just so it can bring out a chuckle and a stress dissipating smile, during those times when a person only seems to have a half an hour a day or so to themselves.","August 23, 2014","true","13.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

It was fun, it was exciting, it was groovy! This will be a love fest of a review since, for me, everything was perfect. The game is gorgeous. Seriously, it is one gigantic screentshot, with the beautifully drawn characters and locations with a hint of 3D to make them three dimensional. The detail and the color in this game never drops, whether you are on the streets of London and Paris, or a dingy shop on the outskirts of town, or a dank and dark cave. This game is eye candy. The characters are top notch. George and Nico are in top form. We have a great cast of supporting characters as well as familiar faces from previous Broken Sword games...and for all of you who played Broken Sword 1, the goat is back! The actors, the script, and story all come together to create an experience that hails back to the original Broken Sword. The music that was composed for this is very cool. I found myself dancing in my seat to the cool 1970's jam sequences. Now for the mechanics side. The game is a true point and click, with no keyboard interference. Every action has an animation, so sometimes George and Nico have to watch a side character, or listen to a side conversation before being able to act. This can be a tad annoying, but it helps focus attention in the right place. There is a wonderful hint system so that way you don't have to get stumped and search a walkthrough while in game. This game was made with wanting players to have fun, not to get irritated over puzzles. I would say that if you have never played any of the Broken Sword games, this could be a good start, and then go back a play the first game in the series. Also, I would vouch to say that if you like a good detective/adventure story with religious conspiracy themes, this would be worth picking up, even if you don't usually play point-and-click adventures. If this is the last game in the Broken Sword series, I can't think it could have ended any better. I am very glad I played this, and know that there will be another playthrough in the future.","January 31","true","16.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","4"

Not to mention the return of Barrington Pheloung on soundtrack duties. Meanwhile voice work is largely of a good quality, spear-headed by Rolf Saxon's now iconic performance as George Stobbart.\n\nHowever, it's the story that really starts to let things down, with the plot taking some silly turns that push the player out of the narrative, keeping you at arm's length from really engaging with the events unfolding on screen. There are also a handful of puzzles that are frustrating in a way that stops you feeling like you're really experiencing the thoughtful adventure, meaning that you spend ages pursuing an idea that seems right, receive no confirmation that you're making any progress, and then feel lost, only to realise that you were right to begin with... and not in some sort of rewarding "I'm a genius!" fashion, sadly.\n\nIt also feels terribly anti-climatic, though that's been a problem of every single Broken Sword game, but, for fans of this series, this is a much appreciated step back in the right direction, and undoubtedly the third best game in the series, though that's both high praise and something of a back-handed compliment.","December 4, 2015","true","7.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

However, in terms of overall continuity it feels a little bit out of touch. It feels like as if it was meant for especially newcomers of the series and for those who want to get some old nostalgic vibes from it.\n\nThe playtime was in my opinion acceptable. It took me nine hours to beat the story, allthough I missed a few achievements. About same amount as in the first and the third installations.\n\nThe story was as fascinating as one could expect from a Broken Sword-game, with religious mysticism and conspiracy, with some twists and funny references.\n\nAll in all, I prefer the first and the third one (I know that this is an unpopular opinion) over this, but I still recommend it to everybody.","June 14, 2015","true","9.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The graphics are awesome, even if some of the animations are a little stiff and awkward. The voice acting for the most part is superb with standout performances from george and nico. The story is amazing and is right up there with broken sword 1 and 2. Now for some basic pros and cons.\n\nPROS\n1. voice acting\n2. overall story is very well done that kept me engaged the whole way. I always loved the Indiana Jones aspects of the broken sword series and this game is no exception. its full of intrigue and suspense.\n3. puzzles for the most part are well thought out and not too hard, but as in any adventure game there are some hard ones and some solutions that are basically just trial and error. there is a built in hint system that can help you, im pretty proud I ony had to use it on two puzzles. overall I give the puzzle difficulty of it a 6/10 in the fact that for the most part they will challenge you but not frustrate you.\n4. The hand drawn backgrounds all look fantastic, and I mean FANTASTIC.\n5. The length of the game is also really good, I beat the the game in about 12.5 hrs, which I think is the perfect length for a game.\n\nCONS\n1. Animations are a little wonkie and im not a huge fan of the 3d models they used for the characters, I wish they were hand drawn like the backgrounds\n2. Humor and jokes while at times are truly funny, I believe this game misses on the jokes more than they hit. not a huge deal but I wanted to point it out.\n3. While the cutscenes still look good, they are no where the level they were in broken sword 1 and 2.\n4. the game for the most part ran smoothly but did crash on me twice, the good part though is it does auto save frequently, so was not a huge issue.\n5. While I love the fan service and cameos I thought they had too many cameos and returning characters, and one to many goat puzzles lol.\n\nCLOSING COMMENTS\nThis game is great I got it on sale and I cant reccomend it enough to anybody, especially if you played the other games in the series and enjoyed them, or if your an adventjure game fan in general. Although you should first play broken sword 1 and 2 bc even though this is the 5th game in the series, im pretty sure it follows the events of broken sword 2. they are also on sale right now. Broken Sword 5 is a great entry into the series, if I had to rank my fav broken sword games in order it would go\n\n1. broken sword 1\n2. broken sword 5\n3. broken sword 2\n4. broken sword 3\n5. broken sword 4","December 24, 2014","true","12.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

George and Nico are second only to Guybrush and Elaine.  I tried not to mind too much when the series shifted to 3D and some action for the third and fourth installments because Revolution were clearly handling the games with care and love for the genre.  Still, I was thrilled when it became clear on Kickstarter that the fifth game would be 2D and action-free.\n\nThe artwork in the game is about the best of this style that I have ever seen in a game.  Scenes are beautiful and detailed (and that really helps when you have to notice a slightly pink spot on a sort of orange spot).  I had to resist taking screenshots because they would all be spoilers.\n\nThe game presents you with pretty standard environment, inventory, and dialog puzzles, but they all work pretty sensibly, even the decrypting puzzles late in the game.  I never got stuck due to some ridiculously obtuse puzzle structure.\n\nThe worst I can say about the game is that there are so many spots to interact with, so many comments to hear (although still less than in a typical Daedalic game, by comparison) that you can progress pretty slowly and it's possible to get bored.  Still, the story is well written with a typical Indiana Jones plus reluctant hero approach as in the other Broken Sword games.  I did find it to be slightly less boring than the fourth game (which is finally on Steam, by the way).  The religious aspect of the story focuses on a conspiracy-flavored long line of Gnostics protecting an artifact that could upset the balance of Jehovah and Lucifer, so you kind of know the story will take you around Europe and eventually to the Middle East.\n\nSo if you like the very best that standard point-and-click gameplay can offer, reasonable puzzles, and the best 2D artwork anywhere, this game is a must-play. Depending on your ability and your choice of pace, it's about a 12 hour game at least, possibly as much as 14 hours, longer than that other crowd-funded classic adventure game two-part installment that still isn't finished (ahem-cough-Broken-Age-cough).","December 30, 2014","true","15.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It's evident a bit of care has gone into the storyline and I'm keen to see if they keep the quality up through both episodes.\n\nAs this is quite a nostalgic game, it will feel quite dated, particularly to those who have't invested in the series previously. Unlike current games it's very much on rails and doesn't include faux interactivity though moral choices, not that this is necessarily a bad thing. It's very much a straightforward puzzle point and click adventure game.\n\nI'd certainly recommend the game to would be buyers, but would advise new people to the franchise to try to get hold of the original Broken Sword and give it a play through. I went back to it recently and it has some very clever puzzles of the right kind of difficulty, almost a more logical Monkey Island, (which I also enjoy of course!)\nPerhaps look for the original version if you can, as the Director's Cut has had a very mixed reception).\n\nThis new game comes into an time where there's more of a walkthrough culture in games where there can be a focus on 100%ing, getting all achievements and all that jazz. I'd really recommend bucking this trend for this game to just jump in and work through it at your own pace.","December 5, 2013","true","15.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

I'm really happy to see extremely detailed 2D backgrounds. In my opinion, this is the only right way to do classic adventure games. I haven't ever seen any 3D backgrounds that could rival the 2D ones. The voice acting and the music are of the best quality too.\n\nThe only disappointing thing is the characters. They are not in 2D, sadly, and look even worse than 2D characters featured 17 years ago in the original game! Well, the character models are actually made in 3D and then pre-rendered and put into 2D frames, they are not processed in real time. Nonetheless, they are much-much worse than authentic 2D models. A good example of how the 3D characters ruin the whole feel of the game is the introduction movie. The intro clearly takes cue from the first game in the series but looks worse than the original 17-year-old movie, even if you put them side by side now. Only because of those 3D models which stand out too much and not in a good way.\n\nOther than the 3D models, I couldn't find anything I didn't like about the game. It's absolutely gorgeous. I was one of the backers behind it and I wouldn't hesitate to back any of Revolution's other games.","December 7, 2013","true","29.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

When i can't solve a puzzle and i decide to read the solution to solve it (this works for any game i've played in past) there are 2 different situation, the situation number one is when after i discovered the solution i realize i did not find it cause of my personal mistake, in this case i pity myself but then i not change my opinion about the game, the situation number 2 is the one when after i read the solution i realize the puzzle was not clear, not logic, and bad built up, so basically was not my fault but developers one who ruined totally the fun for me for that game, sadly in this adventure i discovered one of those (the only one i had to read hints for) and is the puzzle of the damned GLYPHS, was totally illogical and nosense and i pray DEVS, for their next adventure, to avoid to put such puzzles in their beautiful advntures cause they ruin the fun, i don't mind the challenge of an hard puzzle, but it have to be logical and intuitive enough, if it is totally obscure it is no more funny, i can't talk about it here for obvious reasons but who encountered it understand very well what i'm talking about.

It can be said, and it's also true that, the art style is hindered by the addition of 3d characters, yet it somehow works. The latest edition to the Revolution repertoire really outshines its recent predecessors and welcomes back some very familiar faces. For fans of the series, this is a must buy. For newcomers, this is a must try. You'll find yourselves delving deep into a conspiracy that scopes back thousands of years. You're a donkey, and the story is a carrot on a stick - Revolution are holding that stick, and they're not letting it go easily.\n\nWith an updated interface and an addition of a 'hints' system, which is sometimes so blunt they may as well have put a blinking fluorescent 'Click Here' sign on the screen, the game has become much more accessible. The biggest downside to the game so far is its length, which is average at best.

The game is pretty nice, well done and polished in all general aspects, without being anything incredible it is, in the end all that it was expected from a broken sword game, and above all, everything that it's developers and charles cecil himself had promised from the very beginning. That's why this game is so satisfying: it's the closest thing to play and old adventure in the present (something that, the other devs and it's crowdfunding projects had tried with different results, not quite achieveing their original objectives, or just failing, miserably)\n\nBroken sword 5 is the second best of the series (After the first one) and that's saying a lot:\n\n*The backgrounds are hand drawn. The characters and it;s animations are not.\n*The music is the same style from the first two games, playing very subtetly while progressing.\n*The voices for the character are perfect. the voice for George, the main character, it's the same from previous games.\n*The story while being pretty average, it manages to capture some spark from the first installment and does service.\n*The places you visit during the adventure are beautifull and inspiring.\n\nAs a negative point i would say the puzzle loose some logic by the end of the adventure. Personally, i had to resort to a walkthrough to be able to solve them.\n\nA pretty good  game, and after playing the other kickstarter adventure games from 2014, i would say this the best all around.\n\nUPDATE 24/03/2016:\n\nI would say that, of 2014 Sherlock Holmes Crimes & Punishments is the best adventure game , but off all kickstarter adventures Broken sword was the best .","February 23, 2015","true","34.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So that's how!" as I did in the previous games.\nIn fact a lot of times things looked very far-fetched (like dropping a hammer on a guard from 5 meters above and actually hitting and knocking him out).\nThe menus weren't as responsive as they should be.\nAnd if there was a way to make George walk faster I couldn't figure it out.\nSo it was a bit boring at times. What kept me going on was the story.\nThe characters weren't as charismatic as in the first 3 broken swords. But they were nice. I specially liked the weird barista guy but he didnt show up much after the first act.\nCome to think about it. There wasn't much interaction going on. There were a lot less different characters for each location than in the previous games (specially the first too).\n\nSo all and all, I would say this was as good as the 3rd one. But still one of the best adventure games out there.\n\nI didn't find the story very compelling, but the history piece that they picked (gnostics/cathars) was really really interesting.\n\nTy for making this game guys,","October 11, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ingame UI is the standard backpack inventory which should be well known to every gamer that likes point and click adventure. Sadly there seems to be no option to open the menu with a mouse click/wheel action. So you have to move your mouse to the icon on the bottom left side of the screen.\nWhen hovering over a usable object the UI will present you with the right (=only) action you can perform. In addition to that you can inspect every useable item to get a response from your active character.\n\n\nVoiceover:\n\nThe german voice actors are really superb. George got his old voice actor and Nico got someone who almost sounds exactly the same as her usual voice actor. If I hadn't known beforehand that Nico got a new voice, I wouldn't have noticed it. The other characters got pretty good voice actors as well and those that made an appearance in a previous installment of the Broken Sword series seem to have their original voice actors as well.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe backgrounds are beautifully hand drawn and look amazing. Seeing those backgrounds with George and Nico really took me back to the old days. Sadly the animations aren't on par with the backgrounds. Don't get me wrong they aren't bad but compared to those backgrounds they just lose.\nCurrently the supported resolution of the game is only 1280x720. But they promised to deliver a 1080HD patch.\n\nPuzzles:\n\nThe puzzles so far have been good (=fun) and till now I havn't encountered an illogical one. The puzzles range from dialogue puzzles to item combination puzzles to the likes of reconstructing a destroyed message. If you're an experienced adventure gamer you'll probably have no difficulties solving those. But I still had fun and enjoyed them.\n\nStory:\n\nA painting is stolen from a gallery and during that a man is killed. Nico and George happen to be there and are trying to solve the robbery/murder. While doing so they discover that the painting has a special history and that it wasn't just a regular robbery.  During that they meet some old friends and visit different countries.\n\nBugs:\n\nWell I havn't ecountered a real bug till now but there are some things like e.g. really hard to spot items or a big item where the mouse courser has to be at a specific spot to make it useable (like a whole blank page)  which could frustrate you. Other than that I havn't encountered anything.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm loving the game but I'll be honest here and tell you that I'm a fan of the "Broden Sword" series. So I might be a little biased here. Revolution Software delivers a good (definetly better than 3 (ugh) and 4 but not as good as 1 and 2) sequel to the Broken Sword series and every fan should get it asap if he hasn't already. Every other adventure game fan should ask himself if graphics (UI/Animation) is really (!!!!) important to him and if so he should maybe stay away from the game. All those that value gameplay and story more shouldn't wait and get this game. With that you'll support one of those developers who still make adventure games.\n\nWarning: The second part will be released at a later date (January). If you buy the game now you'll get the second episode as soon as it becomes available. So you'll probably have to wait till then to experience the full story. On the bright side the game will be complete with the second episode and the wait isn't a long one.","December 5, 2013","true","28.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I completed the game in little less than 15 hours and despite cutting a few lines I had heard before during trial and error, I wasn't really in a rush.\n\nPuzzle-solving Adventure games are always a little on the edge, because developers have to come up with new puzzles and find a way to balance them and incorporate them into the natural flow. Being an Old School Adventure player I found a lot of things to be quite intuitive and straightforward, but there were also a few very complicated puzzles and some that were too hard for me.\n\nBS5 have added a gentle Hint system, that you can access whenever you feel lost, that nudges you in the right way with each option until it completely spoils you with the last option, but there were times when I found the spoilage to be just as cryptic as the problem itself. Even with the solution at hand I know there are puzzles I would never have guessed at all. There were times when it was hard to resist using the Hint system, but I really recommend not using it too much, because it is a rather short game and relying on hints too much dulls your mind to the point where you are almost completely dependent on them.\n\nThe game looks and sounds pretty nice in the Broken Sword 2D style and the resolution is pretty high too, but there are times when the generally nice and smooth, but sometimes too flat and bland graphics worked against the puzzle solving of the game, it simply doesn't support the needed attention to detail and there were times when I really wished there had been more controls than just the mouse to move parts of the game.\n\nThe one thing this game really required of me above all else was PATIENCE! I often found myself to be quite annoyed with the slow mechanics of the game. The slow movement of the characters, the repetitious nature of problem solving like the repetition of the same walk, talk, action and 3-4 mental notes that kept popping up in boxes like bubbles in a club soda was really straining my decreasing patience a lot. Phew.\n\nI think the price of the game at $14.99 is a actually a bit too high, $9.99 would probably be too little, but I wouldn't have had any second thoughts about the worth of the game, because even though it's really a nice game the constant challenge of my patience really detracts a lot from my joy of the game, but I had a good time and in the end game there was a nice crazy turn of events and a romantic touch, that saved the day.","May 30, 2014","true","21.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The Serpent’s Curse is a successful rolling reboot in that it has taken on so much of what made the previous titles special, but is trying not to allow itself to be anchored to the past. It’s still a story-rich brain teaser, but now it has new layer of accessibility that the hardcore faithful are able to turn off and ignore. Even though it’s the newest title, it doesn’t have all those negative modern touches that ganged up to bully the last two releases; no awkward 3D controls, no dumbing down for obvious console ports, no clumsy block puzzles and no insulting 30 second ending. It’s as strong and charming and wonderfully offbeat as any of its predecessors, a comfortable familiarity born of something both unique and sentimental.

I loved this game series as a kid. My parents bought the first game for computer when I was 8 or so. We played it together, and we had a blast. I remember being stuck on the Goat in Ireland. In the original game it was a very tricky puzzle to solve. We loved that game, so to see a modern iteration, with HD graphics and superb voice acting, it really makes me truly happy.\n\nWe got the second game for PS1 one weekend, after I had injured my leg and was laid up. Once again, we loved it. Another masterpiece. The third game lost us, we couldn't get into it, and the 4th game seems so incredibly rare to buy, I didn't know it even existed until I heard about this game being the 5th in the series.\n\nI've played about 2 hours of The Serpents Curse so far, and I am really enjoying it. The humour is as sharp and witty as ever, superb voice acting by Rolf and the rest of the cast, which we shouldn't have expected it to be any less than perfect. Good to see George and Nico back in action, and its also good to see some characters coming back, like Seargent Moue and Laine. I'm sure as I progress further through the game, it will surprise me with more cameos.\n\nIts also good to see the game return to its Point and Click roots. The main reason I never played the 3rd game was because of the controls. It wasn't familiar, and so I assumed the 4th game followed the same convention.\n\nSo if you're thinking about buying this game, and you enjoyed the first 2 games or even any of the game in this series, you should definitely get it. Especially while its 20% off.","December 6, 2013","true","10.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

You will follow Nico and George around Paris and other locations investigating a art theft that they witnessed.\n\nThe game is very short for a experienced player. ~9 hours. And it ends just when things are getting interesting. There will most likely be another game to follow up on this great and intriguing story.\n\nIn my personal opinion it's just to make more money. But then again, the game is rather cheap, so it would be better if they said from the start that it was going to be "Episode" based or something. Just like other games are now days.

Characters are really fleshed out and every one of them has memorable personality unlike many other games. I also liked how dialogue listening payed off because conversations gets you clues about how to solve puzzles. And really clever humor was in there - I found myself laughing many times. Story is good so far - what starts as simple museum murder slowly becomes mystery which later turns into dangerous religious conspiracy and I bet you will enjoy the ride.. which ends in half indeed but with proper and rather satisfying closure - and you shouldn't be disappointed.\n\nTechnically, there are still some bugs that needs to get patch soon, like occasional missing lipsync or 1080p assets but while some little polish is still needed this is really nothing game breaking. Graphics are top notch, mainly some hand-drawn backgrounds and cell-shaded characters are done pretty well at least. First I was afraid that it ruins the atmosphere but I got used to it rather quickly. You can also switch to old-fashioned subtitles instead of comics bubbles and turn off hint-system (which is something I really recommend as the game isn't too hard and every puzzle can be solved rather logically).\n\nIn the end I have to say the folks at RevSoft managed to bring Broken Sword back to its glory and now I really can't wait for their next game.","December 6, 2013","true","23.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The atmosphere is great, it's visually pleasing to look at and the voice acting is really well done. The puzzles are, at the start at least, well done and requires quite a bit of 'out of the box' thinking.\nOld characters return, which is always nice, but some are just there to be there and be even more ridiculous than before.\n\nAnd here comes the part... Later in the game, it doesn't just require the player to think outside the box, it actually gets down to, should I say, ridiculous puzzle solving. Trying not to spoil too much, I managed just fine on my own with the game, until there was a puzzle that just made absolutely no sense (to me) in any way. I thought that was fine, but then came another one and... Dare I say, even another one. Sure, not all puzzles are meant to be easy, but I found these to be a bit too over complicated, as if the developer thought they were clever.\nAnother gripe I have is that the voice acting of minor characters is off. A french person with an american accent or a rather obnoxious actor trying to imitate spanish. A pet peeve because it started off so well, then this happened.\nWhen acting with a certain object, it sometimes doesn't even change to be interactive until the playe has looked at or interacted with something else. At the start, it's very minor, but later, it became a bugbear.\nThen the typo's, there are so many in this game that it became bothersome.\nThen there's the pacing. There's no quick walk or sprinting at all, nor double click to skip to next scene. Everything is very slowly paced and even the dialogue sometimes waits for several seconds to actually start. It drags the game out so long for no good reason.\n\nAnd it's a shame, because the first half of the game is really damn good. After that, it starts to become a drag. I wanted to get on with the game, but it wouldn't let me. Throw in some obnoxious puzzles, have backwards logic, like not being able to interact with something when it made sense and that's pretty much Broken Sword 5.\nI would commend it for being rather true to what it started out to be in the past though, but I simply can't recommend it like this. There are many point and click adventures out there that make more sense while having puzzles that work outside the box (Book of Unwritten Tales) that actually work.\nIf you're a fan of the series, it's a rather good addition to the series, but I'd suggest waiting until it's in the bargain bin.","October 6, 2015","false","10.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"

The Broken Sword games so far have seemed to follow the opersite rule to the Orginal Star Trek Movies with Broken Sword 1 and 3 being great and 2 and 4 being good but not as great as the the odd ones.  Well for 6 sake I hope the rule does not contine but I can say 5 keeps to it delivering a great game.  Classic Point and click style with a mix of hand drawn and computer generated many where worried about the art but the computer generated mixs in just fine and the graphic are just perfect, and the puzzels are adventure games at there best, was stumped a few times but if you do not want to just leave your brain to go over it there is a hinting system in the game and if you are used to adventure games the puzzels are just perfect level of a chanlenge but nothing to keep you stuck in one place, could do with something like Monkey Island 1 and 2 remastered where it shows you all items on screen as the few places I was stuck it was for not finding something I needed but apart from that just perfect.  With only 50% of the game out now I will redo this review once part 2 is out and I have finished that, but for now I only have two things I want, first for part 2 to come out NOW, and second for Revolution to do a kickstarter for there next game so I can give them more of my money to make something great with.

I'm so happy they went back to their roots and made it in 2D. very gripping story and the main characters (George and Nico) are very lovable.

Inspector Moue makes another appearance, he was also in the first one who almost arrests you for blowing up the Cafe. Fleur the flower shop lady was also in the first who insists that he'll see George again and he does in this one. Also Lady Pieremont makes a brief appearance.

Its great to see one of those kickstarts finally deleiver a top notch adventure game, and a true adventure genre point and click it is!\n\nFirst playing this, you automatically feel like your playing one of the first two games in this series.  The graphics are great and I really like all the hand drawn and painted backgrounds in some of the scenes.  Voice acting is superb and UI has two modes, being Modern and Classic.  The Classic version for the UI allows you to move the mouse cursor to the bottom of the screen so it pops up what you  have in your inventory.  The Modern UI setting shows your bag in the bottom left, you click on that to open your inventory.  I do prefer the Classic UI setting.  Also there is another text as Modern and Classic.  This time Modern shows dialog (subtitles on screen) in a comic book style, with a large white box for each person's dialog as they speak.  Classic  mode shows the text like the old school adventure games, just a regular subtitle look with text only on screen as they speak.\n\nIf your fan of this series, this is a MUST BUY!!!\n\nGreat job Revolution Software, thanks for doing another chapter in this series and please don't make this the last one.  You've got my support if you go ahead with another game in the Broken Sword series.\n\nSCORE: 5/5","December 5, 2013","true","3.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Good. I've  got to say I've been waiting for this game to come out for ages! And can say I am thoroughly happy with it... I don't think you have to have played the earlier games but it would certainly help as there are characters which are in it from the previous games (definitely play the first two the others BS3 and BS4 I liked, but think it lost a lot of it's charm going 3D, intoducing sneaking, etc) sufficed to say I like the move back to the hand drawn look and proper pointing and clicking. I have noticed lip syncing issues and animation clippings... and one time George did forget how to walk and started to glide across the floor, impressive maybe he was trying to moon walk (but forwards). Delays between conversations can be a bit jarring at times too.\n\nThe story is good though (only half way through though it could change I doubt it, but you never know) it's typical conspiracy theory plot has been a joy to play. And I have had quite a few good chuckles at Georges and Nico's exploits. I can overlook all these weird graphic anomlies, as the voice acting is great and the graphic are really cool a really nice throw back to it's roots. Sure it could been polished a bit more but it adds to the character of the game.In adventure games the story and characters are key for me, I really like the characters and really like the story I would give it 9/10. Where it fell short were the glitches I encounted but they aren't game breaking, half mark lost for the graphical glitches and half lost for the awkward pauses in certain conversations. Get this game we need more games like this, instead of the endless BF, COD, Halo type of games, you may say... oh but this is the 5th game... don't forget this series has been going on since 1996, rant over... sorry.","December 8, 2013","true","22.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Its up there with the first 2 games in terms of storyline, atmosphere, art style, excellent voice acting and gameplay. The game hooks you right from the first scene with the mysterious murder all the way up to the climactic ending. One thing I will say is that the puzzles in this game are somewhat easier than the those in the other games in the series, which according to your taste may be a good thing or bad thing (I personally find this to be a positive, this is the first Broken Sword game and point-and-click game where I was able to finish the whole thing without using any hints or a walkthrough). Every single scenario or puzzle in this game had a reasonable or logical solution, provided you have the patience to inspect your surroundings and items and give it some thought, which is unlike some other games in this genre which contain truly senseless puzzles that dont make any sense (hence the need for a walkthrough).\n\nIf you are into point-and-click games, a fan of Broken Sword, or looking for a game that plays like an interactive movie, there is no reason why you should not pick this up.

Worth every second and centimes playing the games\n\nWhy should you consider buying it?\n- Genuine and original story\n- Lots of fun jokes from the main characters\n- Beautiful design, using 2D classic backgrounds\n- Interesting puzzles, and great hinting systems in case the player got stuck\n- Last of all, the game has received lots of support from its long-time fans, Definitely a great game\n\nTry it, and have fun, may you learn a lot of new things!","January 31, 2015","true","25.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

For everyone else who isn't struck by nostalgia I think that it's an average adventure game. The first half (episode 1) is at least mediocre, the story is so boring I forced myself to continue it, with easy puzzles, corny dialogue / jokes and hit 'n miss voice acting for most of the characters. The second half (episode 2) gets more interesting plot wise, it has more challenging puzzles and different locations to explore than the overdone good old Paris.

When I saw it out for sale, I couldnt resist. We are greeted by pretty new graphics, yet familiar faces and voices with a story that seems promising.\n\nIf you are new to the series then I would suggest getting the triple pack of 123 together, however, if you are familiar with the series and want intrigue adventure and fun, well, so far, BS5 has the potential to 'deliver' but right now, it doesnt. The locations you visit are few, the puzzles are easy, straight forward, almost idiot proof (prompts and hints are too readily available too), humour is few and far between, or simply not funny and you only get a few hours worth of game play.\n\nThough we are promised a new chapter early in the new year, the first part of the game simply seems like a prolouge, does that mean after the next chapter they will start charging for the follow ons as DLC?\n\nBS5 promises a lot but has delivered very little... so far... all it has done is set out a mountain of promises and I really hope it doesnt break them.\n\nIf you are a die hard fan, then you will likely jump on this game regardless, however, right now it isn't complete, feels far from it, feels unengaging and plays more like a Japanese animated novel where you simply click the screen repeatedly and make a few choices now and then, with that in mind, they may as well had turned the whole broken sword franchise into an animation, at least it would have removed the 'chore/bore' from the game. There are no random choices with consequence, no alternate ways to solve puzzles.\n\nRight now I hope it gets better, I will always hold broken sword with eager eyes to 'reinvigorate' the genre again, but with games such as 'The Walking Dead' out there, there will be many people disappointed with this game.\n\nIf you are a die hard fan, look into it, they may pull something out of the hat yet, but if you are new to the series, AVOID AVOID AVOID play the first and second game then maybe follow on.\n\nP.S. hurry up and get BS4 on Steam already Valve!!","December 21, 2013","false","11.7"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"

Still, I will give the game the credit it deserves and say it is aesthetically very pleasing.\n\nI've always played Broken Sword, however, for the script as much as anything, and I found the humour which I'd so enoyed in earlier games sadly flat, as well as a storyline which failed to truly engage. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend the game to those with good memories of the early games (particularly if, like me, you actually enjoyed BS3 and 4).

In this respect though, I am somewhat disappointed with the end product.\n\nMy first gripe is, of course, that this is actually not the end product - this is supposed to be just half of it. If you're new to the franchise DO NOT buy this game until you've played BS 1,2, and 3 (I don't believe 4 is in Steam) - it is much, much, much more value for money.\n\nOf course, I read the update saying that there will be another episode in January (free for me, yay!), but when I saw that I have completed nearly half of the game, I thought that it was half of this episode - and it feels this way! this game is just so short, I was a bit dismayed even when I was thinking I did 1/4 of the story, not half of it! SPOILER ALLERT! BS5, as it is right now, is really just a murder investigation. I cannot help but compare it to the original Broken Sword, where the story just began as a murder investigation, but unfolded to be about much more! This time, it felt as if I was jumping down the rabbit whole... to find it painfuly shallow! I really hope that the second episode speeds up the pace and present and reveal more secrets for us to solve!\n\nFinally, I really hope that there will be more locations in the second episode - in this one there were only five locations for us to explore. Again, a comparison to the original Broken Sword does not make the Serpent's Curse look too good. I can only assume - and hope - that we will be given more than just Paris, Spain and the promissed in the kickstarter campaing Middle Eastern/North African location (these are a must, of course!).\n\nFinally, the reason I compare this game so much with the first one in the series is because the Serpent's Curse is made as mainly fan-service to the die-hard fans. 1 of the frequented locations in the game (that is, 20% of all of them) is an old one and a large portion of the characters are from the previous games. Nothing wrong with bringing old characters back, but the new ones are so few!\n\nAs a conclusion, you'll see that it says on Steam that I'm recommending this game. While this is true, it applies only to people who have played the previous installments - it is, after all, a Broken Sword game and the story looks promissing, so I am having high hopes for the second episode. But if you've never played any of the previous games - please, do, before bying this one! The story stands alone, you are not going to miss anything - however BS5 just does not provide as much value for money.","December 8, 2013","true","19.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It shows it's a labour of love, with little nods to past games that fans of the series will surely appreciate.\nThe story is engaging as it ever was and the characters are colorful, well developed and nicely voiced, with some surprising appearances along the way.\nThe puzzles are well balanced and satisfying to solve without being too difficult or really obvious.\nIf you get stuck in any puzzle the hint system is really helpful and well designed, gradually revealing the answers to the puzzles so you can figure it out for yourself and won't need a walkthrough if you get stuck in the game.\nAll in all a great adventure game and a must have for adventure fans.

I love it, the two protagonists are back,Nicole(Nico) and George, a parisian reporter and a californian dude that just met by accident at a crime scene in the first game and went on all kind of adventures to find clues, places and knowabouts the criminals and they kinda fell in love (they kissed at the end) but they just call in "friends" (i think they're more than that ;) ) and now i'm playing the last episode(episode 5) and everything is just as good as before,even better. The cartoony graphics of Paris and the voices are just perfect and they go together just as perfect. if you ask me i give this game and series a 10/10 for being my favourite point&click adventure game of all time, by all it has to offer, the puzzles not being that kind of puzzles that are impossible to solve, and if you get stuck you have infinite very useful hints that get you out of trouble.

To those of you who have not played any Broken Sword games I would recommend you play the first two or three that are also available here on steam, although not required the game makes references and jokes that refer to previous games and will make the overall game much more enjoyable.\n\nFor those of you who worry about the game being of the same quality as the fourth installment do not let that alone stop you from buying the game.  Broken Sword 5 does a wonderful job of mixing the classic 2d elements of the first two games and bringing in fresh new models for characters.  The game also goes back to the roots with its dialogue, the game is nicely written with excellent full voice acting.  Although not my favorite soundtrack for Broken Sword games all the fresh soundtracks are still solid, and I was excited to see a few of the soundtracks were recycled.  They even have an option for the option between new or old style dialogue bubbles, they successfully made a game that uses fresh ideas and still has that classic feel to it.  For those of you who are fans the game in many cases lives up and brings back the classic gameplay which has been missed for so long.\n\nAlthough I loved the game I do have a few things I was dissapointed in.  I felt like although the game was very well written that it wasn't as well written as the first two games, maybe that is me just having a bias towards the first two games.  The game has many references to the previous installments, though I admit a lot were pretty funny sometimes there were just to many references so close to each other that it kind of took the feel that it was its own game away at times.  Some of the puzzles did not live up to my expectations.  The game for me was easier than the previous games but that was not my real problem, my problem was that some of the puzzles would involve luck if attempted in real life, I do not want to spoil anything so I will not use an example but it in a way took away from the game for me.  Most of the characters were very enjoyable but I did not like Inspector Navet, I thought he was just a silly character that just did not seem to fit in the series in my oppinion.  Lastly I would have liked to see an option to use classic style characters, although I enjoyed the new character designs it would have been nice to see the old style, yes I understand it would be hard and yes I know it would take more space I am just being honest on what I would like to have seen.  I really enjoyed this game and if you went through all of my review you noticed that my complaints were pretty minor as I didn't find anything really fundamentally wrong with the game and had to dig pretty deep to find negatives but most of them are from comparisons to the previous games instead of the game as a stand alone.\n8/10","January 8, 2014","true","22.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Quite often the game restricts where you can travel as a way of helping you progress. I understand that it’s not fun to travel all around the map looking for that item you need to progress. I do think though there is a balance between puzzle difficulty and trying to prevent players getting bored. BS5 seems to be too far on the side of trying to stop you getting bored, perhaps a  difficulty system would have been a good idea.","December 6, 2013","true","15.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Episode 2 will be delivered as a free update to Episode 1 in Q1 2014."\n\nThe main menu UI feels stiff (there's plenty of room for polish here), but the game itself should be familiar to adventure gamers out there.\nThe graphics is gorgeous, a mix of 3D characters with 2D painted background. Feels like playing an animated interactive movie.\nVoice acting is top-notch as in every other "Broken Sword" game, and there will be plenty of familiar characters in this one too.\nThe story is as you can expect from a "Broken Sword" game, there will be plenty of secret society stuffs and magical artifacts.\n\nCan't wait to play the 2nd part of the game and will update this review until then.\n\n[Part 2 Review]\nSomehow part 2 felt short. Wished that they had include more alternative solutions to move forward with the story. Some of the solutions some times a bit too hard to guess.\nAlso there is a part of the game where you can get stuck, and you can't rely on the autosave to restore.

If you are a fan of broken sword as I am, you will like the game like me. If not you might get really bored while playing the game.\n\n\nFirst of all the story is very boring and uninteresting. The story is very similar to the first game. Also I started to get boring that the story always ends up with some secret societies trying to take over the world or things like that. If the series is going to continue, it has to be an original idea, not some templars or similar things.\n\n\nThe characters are so dull and stupid. I think the developers thought, stupid characters would make the story interesting but it made the story realy boring. I don't want to see past games' characters like moue, duane or pearl. They are not interesting, they are really BORING. When I see them again something inside of me dies. The only character I want to see from previous games is André Lobineau and he is not in the game.\n\nThe humour in the game is horrible. There used to be some funny dialogues, sarcasms in the broken sword series but they expect us to laugh some guy burping to us.\n\nDialogues in the game are so boring. They are not funny, clever nor interesting, it just keeps the story going. Probably the worst movie in the world has more interesting dialogues than this game.\n\nNico in the game is so useless. She used to solve the problems and help us in the previous games but in this game it does not help to the story at all. I like Nico but it is not the Nico from previous games. They could have added some extra parts for Nico, send her to somewhere else or divide the puzzles between george and nico. She does not have to be with george all the time. This way she wouldn't be so dull and stupid like the other characters.\n\nI think there could have been more cutscenes. The previous games used to have a lot of them and I loved them. I think they did not want to bother with cutscenes so they took the easy road out.\n\nSo finally, if the game was not rushed it could be a lot beautiful but now it is just OK. If you like the series or point & click games you would probably have fun. Just don't get your hopes up.","August 24, 2015","false","14.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was jumping with excitement. What did I think of it when it came out? It was good..... That's basically all I can say about it. I really wanted to say more about this because I was expecting more, especially after a hugely successful kickstarter campaign making more than double the original target. I loved all of the broken sword games, I even have a disagreement with how people treat the 4th game. But it just seems to be missing the charm the other games had, the same goes for BS4. Whereabouts does this game rank along with the broken sword games, it ranks 4th. It's better than 4 but not as good as 2,3 or 1.\n\nMy one gripe I have with this are the puzzles seem way too simple and straight forward. Same thing as the director's cut of the original. They dumb down the puzzles so that people with half a brain could do. You just need to do the basic adventure things in order to do the puzzles. It doesn't really do much to stand out from the crowd. They also have the hint system make a return from 1 and 2, but unlike them, the hint system seems unnecessary. Again because of the simple puzzles.\n\nThe artwork is beautiful, as usual for broken sword. But the artwork in this seems better than the other games, especially the dated graphics of 3 and 4. Movements seem crisp and smooth which is a huge improvement of the awkward movements of NPCs in 1 and 2.\n\nDialogue is basically the same as the previous games so not much to talk about there.\n\nCharacters are again your typical broken sword characters. So not much to talk about there.\n\nI think a few of the critics are missing the point of this game as well as other point click games. They're saying that it's timeless. Any point and click game can be timeless as long as it's done right. Point and click games are similar to old Atari 2600 games and nes game. They're so simple by today's standards but if they're done correct they can leave an impact on the gaming community as a whole. Easy to make but hard to master.\n\nI love the idea of resurrecting old franchises as it appealsto all sorts of gamers. Newer gamers grab it because it looks new and interesting and older gamers grab it for the nostalgia. That's why I just love the feeling of playing another Broken Sword game and it was a good experience. Now I just need to wait for the next Monkey Island.\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","January 11","true","14.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The clues to each puzzle were just non-existant after the first half.

I think that this is a fantastic puzzler, and a great U-turn back toward what makes (made?) the Broken Sword series so good back in the day. However, when coming toward the final act of part two (roughly 80% into the game) you are faced with an extremely taxing puzzle that slows the pacing of the game down to a crawl. Upon completing this puzzle you are then faced with a situation where your antagonist miraculously knows off-hand all the information that you just toiled away to figure out, from the remains of a person who (literally) took the secret information to his grave. This scenario had me so irate that I began to pay attention to the flaws in the game: the way that characters turn their entire morality upside-down with little effort, the lacklustre voice acting from the supporting cast, the crutch of returning characters from the first two games in the series that the game leaned upon the entire time, and finally the extremely anti-climactic ending that isn't without its fair helping of cheese.\n\nI feel that Part one is fantastic: the puzzles are exciting and the pacing of the story is well maintained. I only felt aggrieved toward the end when the dialogue practically vomited out all the loose ends that needed to be resolved in Part 2 (back when this title was split) like a cat regurgitating hairballs. It was poor writing and it left a bad taste in my mouth. Part 2 felt very rushed in comparison; I'm not sure what deadline the team were under, but the story was leaping from location to location at an uncomfortable pace and the puzzles became less about solving riddles and using logic and more of the classic point-and-click trope of "try combining all your items in your inventory and see what ♥♥♥♥ sticks this time".\n\nDespite all that I will recommend this game to lovers of the point-and-click adventure genre. It has its great moments, but is let down by the pacing and disappointing conclusion. At times it really does remind you that it is a Broken Sword game, but when you try and compare it to the original and its first sequel, it sadly falls by the wayside. Broken Sword 5 takes bronze in the series.","July 2, 2014","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

It suffers a little bit from being split into two parts. Imagine a sequel took place immediately after the original with many but not all of the cast returning. A bit disjointed, right?\n\nIt is far better than Broken Sword 3 &4. It suffers a bit in comparison to Broken Sword 1 for reasons that aren't really the developers fault. In the original Broken Sword, you were a tourist. So when odd things started happening, it was never quite clear just how far down the rabbit hole you were going to go. On the other hand, when Broken Sword 5 rolled around and introduced George Stobbard as an insurance salesman, my immediate reaction was "yeah, right" so some of the magical discovery was gone. For the same reason, the instant I saw the spoiler, I began perusing it for clues and was not the least bit surprised when a character later told me the spoiler had clues in it.\n\nBut do not let these nipicks steer you away from a solid adventure game","August 7, 2014","true","23.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also I love the character models , they were nicely done\nDecent storyline - To be honest the storyline isn't bad at all. I had to google up and it made to learn about culure and all.  i have  noticed a lot of people here commented that the script is nowhere close to the first series [which i think i should pick up and play]\nTutorial and Hints System - It just makes it easier for people who are new to this genre and for those who are stuck at some puzzle (like myself). The Hint system is just amazing , I like the way how it is designed. It gives you more clues  untill you hit the final clue where it gives you the solution. Ideal for the puzzles that you are stucked (which I faced a lot)\n\nThings that I didn't like\nAlternative Path - As someone suggested in the comments , they should have given an alternative path. At times you were given an option to tell the truth or lie , if you have picked one or another , the consequences would be different and the game outcome would have been different. It would have given another reason for people to replay and experience the story differently\nChracter Development - I find it too bland , Nico and George had great potential.

For such art that is well done, this was greatly missed.  There are a few key places with cinematics but for the most part there are far too many "A few minutes later" scenes.  I'm guessing this is related to funding but I wouldn't have thought it would have impacted the game that much.","July 8, 2014","true","25.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I heard this was in development I was very excited and did not hesitate to buy this and it really does deliver. Going back to the orignal the good old point and click system instead of third person works so much better. The story is awesome really feels like the original games even the characters have not changed.

I think it could be months before they are all found\n\nAnyway, Die hard BS fans will jump at this, new comers should maybe play the first 2 as they are cheaper and similar experiances.","January 2, 2014","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's as if time stood still and you're still in the 90s, only with 21st century technological advancements! All of the charm, wit, humor, storyline, voice acting, and attention to detail is still there!! Pretty remarkable because most devs ruin classic franchises like this. Rolf Saxon hasn't lost a single step (to the contrary, only gained a few), his voice acting is top notch with his signature delivery and clever comical inflections. Emma Tate's Nico is wonderful, the character is true to form and hasn't lost a bit of appeal.\n\nWhile the story is excellent, compelling, and altogether engaging, the return to 2D is exactly what was needed to move the series further. You will notice unbelieveably fluid, life-like, and beautiful character animations. It's something I have never seen in any adventure game and I play a lot. So what you have in the end is a beautiful 2D game combined with animations forged in the 3D gaming world. Really slick.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.\n\nLooking forward to Part 2!","January 10, 2014","true","33.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is the 5th part of a series with ups and downs and it is definitly not one of the downs.\n\nObviously some people learned their lesson after Broken sword 3 which always seemed like a very weak action adventure in some parts but still had a decent story and Broken Sword 4 which was clearly one of the worst adventure games I ever played. Broken Sword 5 is obviously "back to the roots". No more crate puzzles, no more running aroud using your keyboard with messed up controls to escape someone you can't even see properly because of the bad camera position... Just simple and plain point&click!\n\nThe story is clearly told and makes some sense (to be honest I didn't understand all the twists of Broken Sword 4 and it had some logical flaws, so this is a point I realy appreciated) although of course it has some mystical components (this is a Broken Sword game, after all).\nYou will meet some old faces, of course. I don't think I will spoil all too much if I say that Pearl and Douane have their appereance and, other than Douanes appereance in Broken Sword 4, this appereance isn't utterly nonesense.\nThe graphics are beautiful. The music is good enough. The german dialogues were mostly well translated.\n\nAny cons?\nWell, the solutions to some of the puzzles are a little bit stupid. And I hated the one music puzzle. But fortunately, they re-inserted the hint function which gives cummulative hints until you get the solution, so you won't ever need to watch a walkthrough and spoil your fun (because most people will rely on a walktrough once they have googled it).\n\nRecommendation?

(Remember to check the Director's Cut versions of those games!) #3 and #4 changed the art style (to 3D) and lost some of the magic in the process, although those aren't bad games either. After that, it took a long, long time for the fifth game (back to gorgeous 2D) to come out. Based on the middling reviews, I wasn't expecting much. Luckily I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe new 2D art is beautiful. More importantly, the opening scenes in Paris re-capture the atmosphere of the early games. The characters - George and Nico et al - remain the same, love'em or hate'em.\n\nThe game feels stuck in the past. That is not ENTIRELY a bad thing. However, it means that the interface is clunky; inventory is messy; puzzles can be obtuse; there's even a goat puzzle involved (!). Luckily there's a VERY useful hint system incorporated. Whenever I got stuck (every 30 minutes or so), all I had to do was to click the "hint" button.\n\nIf you don't like old-school adventure games, this game is probably not for you. If you have no prior experience with the series, many of the inside references and jokes will be lost on you. And you should really start with the first game. That one's a better game. But this one FEELS right, like an authentic Broken Sword game - even down to replicating the flaws and quirks of the original.

No disappointment here, it has been like a trip back to my early teens when playing such adventure games (BS, Longest Journey, Monkey Island...) were like truly transporting yourself into a parallel world for a few hours. And you never wanted it to end...\n\nNicely rendered characters in gorgeous 2D frames, long-lost witty dialogues found again, reasonably difficult puzzles and chains of choices to achieve certain objectives... I cannot recommed playing BS 5 enough to any "stick-in-the-mud" gamer out there; but I especially recommend it to those who didn't grow up with the compelling magic of early computer games.

There were so many potential jokes and quick one-liners they could have put in, and that I expected to be said, but didn't. That's the one reason why I was quite disappointed.

There are truly gorgeous scenes in this game, I couldn’t believe just how beautiful it came out. Visually I can’t fault this title for anything. Everything from the character animations to the dialogue boxes, to the in game interactivity is executed fairly flawlessly.\n\nSound wise the music is beautiful, changes according and well composed. The voice acting is spot on and never feels off. The mixing is brilliant and the mastering feels very on point as well.\n\nGameplay wise I found myself involved in the game, I found the puzzle made sense, and the characters were really dear to me and believable. I found myself getting lost once or twice, but the guide put me right on track again, I never felt like I needed one next to me.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I felt bad that this game didn’t get as much money as it should have. I really want to see another Borken Sword game, maybe with this exact engine. There was very little to take away from it, I only wish there was a little more. The expansion although it was interesting and unique, I wish it added a big city or town.\n\nOverall 4/5, excellent game, well worth the money, buy it.","March 9","true","55.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On one hand it's an ok adventure that has it's moments but compared to Broken Sword 1+2, and even 3 its outright boring. Uninspired set pieces, uninteresting characters and the worst you have to wait so much time that George does anything. He always has to move to someone to speak with him. I would say out of my 12 hours playtime at least 4-6 hours are just watching George moving from A - B, doing some talking and then going back. This completey destroys the timing and sense of action you had with the former titles. There are also no real story highlights.\n\nWhat BS5 does reallly well is the hint system. It's starts with giving you vague clues and then reveals details after details. That's really great if you are stuck. I also like how some running gags from previous titles have been transfered to this one. It's an OK'ish game and if you have played the other BS titles you might enjoy this too. Otherwise I would everyone suggest to play number 1+2(essential), may the 3rd one too, but then you should look out for other great adventures on Steam and skip BS5.","May 30","false","12.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At first, I wasn't disappointed; the graphical style was spot on, and Rolf Saxon was back voicing the main character, with a similar witty approach.\n\nHowever, that's where the similarities ended. I started to notice a lack of variation in the character animation, and when interacting with objects, mimed with empty hands instead of holding them. The cut scenes were ok, but some of the 2D style backdrops made me feel motion sick as they 'moved' to create a sense of perspective in panning shots.\n\nThough the voice actors put in a good performance (mostly), that can't overcome the poor quality, amateur-ish script. A lot of the dialogue was clunky, and any humour felt false and out of place. The overarching story started well, but by the end was just over-the-top stupidity. The ending felt like the writer had had enough and just stuck any old crap on the end just to finish the game. Details such as how the police acted were also badly written, as if the writer didn't have the first idea of what police officers actually do. Yes, those characters were supposed to be a bit silly, but it crossed the line into ludicrousness.\n\nIn short, the only thing that got me to the end of the game was my love for the original two games. Although that was clearly what the developers were going for, that is all they went for, not quality or originality, but a pastiche with many original characters stuck into the game just because they could.\n\n","July 2, 2015","false","10.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I wish there was a neutral button. That's what I'd hit. Since there isn't one, I have to go with the negative evil thing: The bad just outweights the good.\n\nI want slow adventure games to succeed. I really, really do. I love stories. I love characters. I love puzzles. I love getting involved into fantasy stuff. I love... ermm.. slowness in games? The Serpent's Curse managed to drag me into nostalgia, I suppose. And it's very much like its predecessors, almost like a copy. Still, things just don't add up anymore nowadays. It's like the devolpers haven't learned anything since 2006. How long can you drag nostalgia out?\n\n\nThe good:\n\n- It's fairly heavy on story. I'm not at the end yet but still wanna find out about those mysteries\n- It has beautifully drawn background graphics\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Oh god, the voice acting. Nothing feels natural. I tried three different audio languages and I'm still lost here. In German (1st language), it's like listening to 3rd-graders reciting a play. English audio has hilariously spoken accents everywhere, Even I could hear the fake, and that says something. Finally I tried French and... well scratch that, my French has somehow dissolved over the years. Hopefully you'll get luckier with your audio.\n\n- Holy hell, the puzzles. I forgot how annoying these can be sometimes. You often know EXACTLY what you need to do: Talk to this guy, give him that. Repair the machine using X. But it's never that easy, isn't it? Things have to be complicated. THEY HAVE to be, because point'n click adventure game. Oh man. I'm writing this review from a point in the game where I definitely know that I have to drive a frigging seagull off a lamppost by honking a horn. Problem: I have about 0,5 seconds to make three things at once happen. Even with a guide at hand, I've tried seven times so far. This whole situation is horrible. I hate guides. I don't wanna use them. This game gives me no choice though. I don't wanna run around offering everyone a banana for five hours and hope it'll stick. So, there's that.\n\n\nConclusion: This game is heavily outdated and only a thing for hardcore nostalgists. or masochists. Or people who like to google for solutions. Or ones who like to do the same things over and over again.\n\n","July 10, 2015","false","24.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

I feel that it's too "episodic", and I don't like the pseudo-3D characters (much rather have the painted 2D from BS1-2). Soundtrack, although I love Barrington Pheolung and his work, was a rehash of BS1.\nStory is intriguing but not original enough. There's not enough stuff to keep me hooked or interested, and the final third felt like a drag: no world wide threat, no actual "danger", no real "international threat", just a few baddies, really awful jokes, and poor animation and cutscenes.\n\nI guess if you're a die hard BS fan (eg you liked 1 TO 4, including the 3D ones), then you'll also like 5.\nIf you like BS1 and 2, but not so sure with 3 and 4, then you may enjoy 5.\n\nPros: Locations (the very few ones), goat(s), some of the puzzles.\nCons: THE puzzle that makes no sense, and even after having looked at a guide, I still don't know what's the "right" way to solve it, soundtrack, animations, cutscenes, story a bit meh.","December 15, 2014","false","9.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I've followed the series and played them all. Fond memories from my youth and all that. But this game was just... painful.\nMy biggest complaint is pacing. It is slow. Painfully slow. Every single sequence takes SO long to complete because of the ridiculously slow movement speed (seriously, guys, a jog won't kill you) and the stilted, meandering dialogue.\nThe puzzles lack any of the clever ingenuity of the early games. In this game they're reduced to lucky combinations of items, or downright nonsensical logic. It's no surprise they incorporated a hint system, because so many of the puzzles make zero sense.\nThere are many more issues, visibility of important puzzle components, janky mechanics, a frustrating inventory system, poor dialogue, but I think the biggest is just, the lack of a strong plot.\nThe whole thing is poorly written, and totally cliche, downright stealing elements from earlier games and just rehashing them.\nDespite my love for the series, I can't recommend this game. It's janky, slow, poorly developed, and lacks the charm that really helps you put up with the bad. The plot isn't compelling, and there's really no incentive to see it through.\nI'm disappointed.","January 27, 2015","false","6.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shakeman/recommended/262940/","shakeman","Shakeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shakeman/","128 products in account","I will preface this review by saying that Broken Sword 2 was the first video game I ever played when I got my first PC about 17 years ago. It left a huge imprint on my gamer psyche and made me an avid fan of point and click adventures. After finishing The Smoking Mirror, I went to the original installment and my mind was blown - it was even better. The old games didn't have the best graphics in the modern sense, but their world felt rich, alive and intricate. Every character felt real, tangible and memorable. I never felt as though I was only playing a video game - it felt like an entire new world, with its own characters, stakeholders and conspiracies. Every location was a treat and seemed alive and genuine.\n\nSadly, not many of these things can be said for The Serpent's Curse. The game attempts to cater to the original fanbase by doing a lot of fan service, such as reintroducing certain characters and puzzles from the previous games, but it fails miserably at evoking the feelings of The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror. The few locations that are introduced feel bland, static, unalive and uninteresting. The characters are even more boring and lifeless. The game attempts to buy cheap points by taking us to familiar locations such an art gallery in Paris and an old mansion in Spain, and this particular manipulation is obvious from the very beginning. The whole world of BS 5 feels static and fake. Sure the graphics are nice, but that's not enough to offset the constant feeling of emptiness and as though the game was rushed in order to maximize its profit margin. The ending is particularly bland and disappointing, and it's hard to imagine that such poor writing actually made it into the game.\n\nWhether I recommend playing The Serpent's Curse or not depends on what you're looking for. If you want to relive the experience and memories of the old games, give this one a wide berth. If you're simply looking for a somewhat decent pont and click adventure, it might be worth a playthrough... but keep your expectations in check.","April 12, 2015","false","14.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I YouTube'd the ending, out of curiosity, and am glad I didn't bother getting there myself. I'm a big fan of BS1 and 2 and I backed 5 on Kickstart. I'm glad that point and click adventures continue to get made and I've got my fingers crossed for a Beneath The Steel Sky 2, but I found Broken Sword 5 to be rather limp and flat. I can put up with some silly puzzles if the writing and humour are there, but they weren't. It was all pleasant enough, but I think the game played it very safe; there was no cheeky spark or wit. I found myelf playing the game with the sound off, while having one eye on whatever was on the TV in the background. That was when I realised I should play something else.\n\n(Mild, but possibly helpful spoiler!) And acknowleding the infamously unfair goat puzzle from the first game with... an unfair goat puzzle? You establish that George isn't an action hero, and that the game isn't a third person action game, so why can he suddenly do certain very physical things mid game that he couldn't do before and with very poor signposting? The game breaks its logic to have a laugh about the logic breaking in the first game. (spoiler end)\n\nLovely backgrounds weren't enough to make me care about the story or its flat delivery. It's the first BS game where I didn't care much about any of the characters either. Currently the game is overpriced too. Might provide a pleasant and undemanding Sunday afternoon for someone who's bored and happens upon the game during a sale. Alternatively, try the superior BS1, 2 or a good book.","April 12, 2015","false","21.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In terms of the puzzle design it feels a little dated and some of the recycled characters feels a bit too much like fan service but the puzzles are good examples of their type and the story is compelling. The biggest selling point is the visual design which is stellar, a marked improvement over recent Broken Sword games. My only real bugbear is that like all of the games in the series the comedy can fall flat in the face of the darker elements and I wish it played a little more seriously.

Withold-school click&point mechanics as well as handdraw 2D-backgrounds, revolution games revives the spirit of the first two games. Murder in Paris, George and Nico and conspiracies this part of the series has it all.\n\nPros:\n* Nice puzzle design, with some really challenging bits (Decoding an encrypted telegramms for instance)\n* Lovely drawn background\n* Exciting, fast-paced story (at least after it picks up speed in the second half of part 1)\n* Funny characters, conversations and refferences to the old games\n\nCons:\n* 3D Character-models and lazy animations. (There are severall glitches due the mix of 3D-models and 2D-Backgrounds)\n* Magic doors - I just don't get it, either you don't use doors (or at least not normal doors that need human interaction) or you animate character to open the doors, but doors magically opening and closing themselves just looks lazy and broken at the same time.\n* Lame voice acting, that seldom feels like conversations but like everyone needing to take a peek at their lines before responding.\n\nNevertheless it is worth its money and a must for true fans of the series.","April 21, 2014","true","17.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But I think the creators delivered a nice adventure game with an interesting story - even though it's a bit short on plot twists - enjoyable characters and puzzles (thank god, no crate pushing though). The story is the typical Broken Sword conspiracy/cult/historical/mythical adventure, what is probably what you've bargained for if you buy this game.\n\nBeware though, that Broken Sword 5 might not be the best game to start playing the series, as the game draws a lot from the player recognising characters or incidents from previous Broken Sword games. The main plot however can be understood without knowing any previous games though; a lot of jokes will just go over your head.","April 21, 2014","true","17.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I do hope to see the second half. I think going half way was annoying and it seemed very short as a result. I do hope for Broken Sword 6 as well as the second half of he production. Before starting this, I would recommend playing Broken Sword 1 and 2 for a new player to gain some of the flavour.  Hope to see many of the recurring characters as well in the second part.

But that was not the case, the game has a weak story, still not terrible and at some points I actualy found it intresting.\n\nBut the thing that gets this game from a decent game to a bad one is the game mechanics, several of the things one needs to solve is just stupid, one have to do it in just the "right" way, some items you cant pick up before doing someething other first. Wich makes one to belive that one wont be able to pick up that item at all. So you sit there thinking you are stuck because you need just that thing that you erlier could not pick up for no reason at all.\nAnd the gameplay is horrible slow, there are several places where you just have to click throught badly written dialog with no usefull content at all, just to be able to pick up something that was just obvius that you should get. But alas, you had to go throught the dialog first.\nAnd if that is not enought, some places you have to do a series of thing, but if you just forgot one of them the game will play out a sequence that is minutes long with just a character moving just to see that you need that one more thing, it's extramly frustrating. Like rotating staues, the animation for it is extreamly slow, and if you go one step too long you have to spend another minute or so rotating it..\n\nAnd last but not least, even if this game did not have these flaws, itäs still not worh €23, maybe €10 without the flaws, as it is now dont but it for more then €2.\n\nAnd honestly, dont buy it at all, buy one of Daedalic Entertainment games insted, they know how to make these kind of games.","August 10, 2014","false","11.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Yes, the original is still considered a classic and I urge you to go play it now if you haven't already, but gamers loved it for its characters, mystery and charm, not for its overwinding historical lesson of the Templars. The Serpent's Curse is trying to simulate everything that made the first game a runaway success, down to bringing back the same characters, the same locations and the same jokes. Even a goat makes a comeback, for eff's sake.\n\nThe game is also too long fro its own good and about halfway-through, started getting dull and repetetive. Even the puzzles started becoming needlessly dreary and complicated.\n\nIs this game better than the last two? Most definitely. Does it outshine the original? Not by a long shot. Is it a good adventure game for fans of the series and those just getting into it? Probably, and sadly, no. You will get some entertainment out of it, but it's too busy being stuck in the past and will never really launch for you to embrace it fully.","February 23, 2015","false","14.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

Another bad thing is the fact that some objects you have to interact with are just too small to be visible on the background, making you frustated on an enigma when all you had to do was interact with it (there's a point when you have to interact with a notebook, and it is literally two pixel wide on a game that is 1080p...).","June 10, 2015","false","9.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The animations were extremely shoddy and lifeless, and looked terrible at 2560x1440... With a glaringly obvious line around each character's neck, being visible in most scenes (which I presume the models were designed to rotate around). Everything also seems optimised for 420p, with the hand drawn pre-rendered backgrounds looking far less sharp than the glaringly obvious 3D character models... Which don't really fit with the style of going back to the game's roots. The few 3D mashup cutscenes were also jarring, considering this new / old combination style.\n\nPuzzle wise, everything you need is usually within your immediate environment and they require little to no thought. Some of the solutions are also pretty absurd, with the attempts at humor being a letdown this outing. I remember actually being challenged by the original games, which is sad. Also, did I mention the backtracking? Don't expect many new environments. The things you can't interact with on your first visit signify multiple visits to the same location.\n\nAll of the usual charm and the bones of an interesting story are all there, but I'd avoid this until you can get your hands on the full version, or at least at a Steam Sale discount. The price is far too high for this level of quality. Let's hope the second episode is an improvement.\n\n5/10.\n","December 8, 2013","false","6.8"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

If you are going to get into the Broken Sword series, then I suggest you go and check out the first game, which is available in an updated and still-beautiful edition on PC, Mac, DS, iOS, Android... probably GameBoy... uhm... yeah. Go play that. Then the second one if you feel you're enjoying yourself. And so on.\n\nIf you've played and enjoyed Broken Sword before and have since forgotten about its existence, I am not sure if I could outright recommend 5. I did have fun, and much more so in the second half of the game. It's definitely a Broken Sword game, and there is plenty to like, but I am not sure it's worth rushing your wallet out. It's a return to the older-style point-and-click of the first two games, and it's good enough for getting your Broken Sword juices flowing, but really...

As I noticed I can leave a review about it, I thought why not. As the game forces you to use steam, I have included reviews of steam. As I do not have time to make it unique I will use many parts of an Amazon review I wrote for the same game.\n\nPrior to this game I had never come across this "Steam" software. I had heard of it but never came into contact with it (I am it seems a bit of a dinosaur when it comes to PC games). I knew the software came with a Steam key, but was hoping steam would not be that bad. After all if I was going to play one of my favourite series of games I had to use it anyway.\n\nSo my new game comes and I place the DVD in the drive. Instantly I am harassed with the requirement of installing Steam. Well I knew this in advance so I thought that's OK.  I provided some personal details such as email which I would rather not have supplied and went about installing the game. Installation went OK I suppose, although no better than a normal installation. Then Steam asked me for a code which I entered from the booklet inside the case and the process was complete.\n\nThe process was not so pleasant, with registration and the annoyance of adding software of absolutely no benefit to me. But on the bright side that was all over now.\n\nSo I double clicked the icon and steam loaded. Not quite what I had expected, I do not practically like when a program is simply wrapping another program, it uses up resources and provides no real service in return, well of no benefit to me anyway. Not too bad I suppose but another minor annoyance, which is by now adding up. Anyway a few moments later I am presented with a blank screen, so I continue to wait patiently. I hear some music so continue to wait. Still nothing happened. The music continues but I get no picture.\n\nSo I closed the program and I loaded Steam. Loading steam I was presented with an advertisement. There is probably a way to turn these off but that is beside the point, I purchased the game so in my view I shouldn't have to deal with adverts. Even if I can turn them off, they should be off by default, or at least a question on install "Would you like us to bother you with advertisements when you finish playing a game?" would be nice. I mean surely this is obvious? Some game makers allow you to play games for free if you have the adverts enabled, and charge you to remove them.\n\nAnyway I started to explore steam, which is not too badly laid out so soon found a way to get to the exe location and I tried again. Again it failed to load. I noticed a BS_5FF.exe and tried that. It loaded a splash screen then failed to load any more.\n\nThinking it may be a resolution issue I checked the box for resolution requirements, and found nothing. I then proceeded to try all available resolutions on my laptop. And still nothing. I browsed the internet for an hour or so trying various fixes, none of which worked.\n\nI also emailed Revolution, which wasn't the best experience. Hopefully they will be able to help though.\n\nI tried again today (just in case it was a steam issue and they had solved the problem) and I got the error "steam could not connect to the network" and it closed. I tried yet again this time it did connect to steam (I guess it did anyway because I did not get the error) and once again nothing. However when I closed the game steam was quick to advertise to me.\n\nSo now I have a DVD, for a game I cannot play. I could try on a different PC however installing steam to another device makes me feel a bit sick. I could give the game away as it appears good for nothing else, but oh no it is locked to my account so that option is out.\n\nMy only hope is I come across a fix, or Revolution gets back to me. However I do not see myself "working" to fix the issue as it is becoming a chore and because of the experience, most excitement for playing this game is now drained away.\n\nThe only good thing I can think of with regards to this game is that I know to stay clear of games presenting the Steam logo now.\n\nOnly advice I can give is avoid this game really.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs steam limits my comment length a reply to totally free of skills message:\n\nOf course it is not a review of the gaming aspect of the game. The game will not work. More than likely due to some hardware requirement the publishers did not bother to note. My graphics card looks suspect in this and they didn't bother to publish graphics card specifications.\n\nYou could argue I shouldn't down vote a game because of this, but to be quite honest it is an underhanded tactic by the developers, since they have deceivingly low specs for everything they bother to list. Seems convenient the one thing I do not have is the one thing they don't list, probably the one most likely thing a user would not have to be honest.\n\nAlso as it is incapable of working it is still a review of my purchased "Broken Sword 5" product. The only thing I can review is the steam aspect as steam is forcefully installed to me it is a part of the package I would otherwise not have. Steam also has made sure I am stuck with the useless deceitfully advertised software which I can not even give away without the hassle of passing my account on to someone else.\n\nSteam provides NO benefit to me and yet it FORCES me to have it installed. This is therefore to me bloat ware. All of this to prevent copyright. I can understand the desire to protect a product from copyright, and as a product should be protected. My issue is people illegally obtaining something like this would have no steam bloatware, they could install and run without need for internet. They have no fears of steam closing down, or something happening to their steam account. Hence in my opinion having a better product than the paying user.\n\nFurthermore if my game did work and anything happened to steam. Then again I cannot use my product. Maybe steam would provide a key, maybe not. Really it is not worth the risk.\n\nI see where one might like steam if they wanted to play a multi player game (which this is not) or to see "offers" (which I do not care about). Other than that I can't see anything I could not get elsewhere (and both of the previous things I probably could find elsewhere).\n\nMy review may be useful as you put it. If I can convince just 1 person to boycott this software. Then I would be happy. In fact I have already put one person off with a different review elsewhere, and as most of it was a copy and paste job it has been of use.","July 26, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","4"

It ran fine on my PC, because it hadn't demanding graphics. The first thing, that got my attention, were the hand-drawn background images. I have rarely seen so beautifully drawn backgrounds in games. I also felt nostalgic about the past, when there were much more point-and-click adventures!\n\nThe puzzles were not that difficult.

Beautiful 3D models with 2D and just as beautiful background, no pixelated images and a tasteful color palette... Graphics are simply superb.\nAs for the gameplay, they went back to P&C. The game has almost the same gameplay as the first two. They polished some rough edges of course (but completely ignored making a double-click function to make the characters move faster). They changed the second lead character Nİco's voice yet again, thankfully not for the worse,  and I'm starting think they are doing this on purpose seeing as no voice was used a second time but I'm missing the point of it entirely. Anyway, puzzles are a delight for the most part. There are still overcomplicated unimportant puzzles like every adventure game ever but most of them are just as they should be especially the second half of the game(Yes there are two main parts).\nStory is also the best in the series imo. I love christian mythology (no I'm not a follower of the religion) and this is one of the best ones I've seen. The symbolisms, the background, the puzzles... They really connect and you can see they really put effort in it. But the other guys in the story department clearly didn't do as much. Not surprising twists are not surprising, bad guys are cliche at best and ending is disappointing (still better than slaying ♥♥♥♥ing dragons). All in all it's a fun story.\nTo sum up: I you liked the previous ones you ARE going to love this one. If you didn't like them or didn't play them it's still a good game worthy of your time.","March 23, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I already knew what it was all about and I wanted it to end and it didn't for some time still.

While there is a lot to like about this game -- the art, music, story and puzzles (in the latter part of the game at least) were well done -- by the time that it got interesting the game was almost finished. The main problem with this release is with its first half, as it spent far too much time self-consciously trying to reassert itself as an old-school point and click adventure game, which made it feel a little tired, like an old band trying to make a comeback after many years out of the scene.\n\nIn saying that, I still really enjoyed it but am not sure if I would have persevered past the first quarter of the game if I wasn't such a big fan of the series.\n","September 20, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A peaceful afternoon in France is quickly transformed into a murder mystery... The story beats are classic Broken Sword fare; a crime is committed, there may have been a deeper motive behind this crime than is first apparent, and digging deeper begins to tug at the threads of a historical conspiracy.\n\nAt first glance the 3D models used for the characters draw more attention to themselves than their hand-drawn and animated sprite counterparts of old, but this passes quickly. The background art is bright and vibrant and characterful, reminiscent of the previous old games (1 and 2, in particular). Voice actor Rolf Saxon returns for George Stobbart (and let's face it, it wouldn't be George without the same voice!), although Nico's voice actor has sadly been replaced. I must admit, however, that the change for Nico is not particularly jarring, with the new voice fitting in alongside George's well and you'll quickly forget that her voice was ever any different.\n\nI found the puzzles mostly satisfying, only getting stuck a few times over both episodes, and fortunately the game has a built in hints system that works really well. It's a tiered system, first offering a vague hint, then building as you ask for more info until it just gives you the complete solution. I feel this is the best possible system a point-and-click game can have in place, allowing you to still feel like you've solved the puzzle on the first few hints, and ultimately saves you alt-tabbing out of the game for a guide in the worst case scenario. I felt comfortable negotiating most of the puzzles myself, but a few tricky and obscure puzzles had me stuck until a few hints pointed me back onto the right path.\n\nA must-play for Broken Sword fans, and a great point'n'click game for those new to the series too. A few in-jokes may be missed, but you'll still enjoy the ride.","August 13, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then the fourth one came out and I only played it once and there was some bimbo blonde instead of Nico, and then Nico shows up with this weird voice actress and just doesn’t look like herself and it’s probably the weakest episode in the series, so no wonder Broken Sword gets quieter than ever. But somehow, even without my knowledge, the guys do a crowd-funding of this one, and, as it should, it drives nostalgia like a new muscle car. The dorky humor of both protagonists is back, it gets the classic 2D point and click treatment and the logic of your tasks is mostly within reason. The game doesn’t do anything special or revolutionary (hah, the irony of that, considering the studio), but we all know how that turned out last time, so that’s all cool. The weird cell-shady 2D/3D aesthetic took a little time for me to get used to and frankly, the animation is sometimes hilariously bad – namely mouth movements and occasionally the way the characters are stood when talking to each other. The puzzles are sometimes dumb as all hell, though that may be intentional in an attempt for subtle humor (whether that works for you or not is another thing). But the voice acting is good, the story intriguing and it is definitely one of the better Broken Sword games.","August 2, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Broken Sword games as a whole have been compelling and number five offers many  thrills, much humor  and suspense, albeit in a small package. A few more locales and characters to interact with would have made this installment better. The hand drawn illustrations are some of the best I have seen in a modern game, if not rather unexpected in the digital age. The dialogue is both funny and charismatic. The mystery of the murders, the Tabula Veritatis and the ancient connection to Jehovah and Lucifer are interesting and may appeal to members of gnostic and catholic faiths.\n\nThe ending is good, but brief. If George and Nico's outing had been shown, it would have been a satisfying finale. As the conclusion is, it leaves players wanting more, but also wishing the story had lasted longer.\n\nAll in all, Broken Sword 5 is a fine game, worthy of praise, but a little lacking in depth.

It's also probably not a great adventure game for 2013, nor a proper evolution for the series and its characters.\n\nIt is nice to have Nico and George back, personally I could never go through the 3D games in the series (even though I heard 3 is actually rather okay), dropping them pretty early on and Director's Cut of the first game actually made the game slightly worse due to rather weak additions that broke a very good pace of the original. But updated second game and rather promising start of these made me want to expect more. Yes, the art is sometimes crappy, all pre-rendered cutscenes look horrible due to very-very bad compression, but overall the style, the controls and the feel of the game Revolution were going for is great.\n\nBut then comes a weird feeling that all excitement from the game comes only from the fact that Nico and George work so well together and some interesting religious themed mythology conspiracy is just a potentially good topic to explore, but... it's like that's what the entire game hangs on. Puzzles themselves are rarely "what now" or feel needlessly hard, but the NEED for those puzzles seems weird. You need to remove a roach that doesn't even try to hide, but instead of just crushing it and swiping remains under the table, you need to complete a puzzle and use 2 items to catch that roach, just so he would then hang in your inventory for most of the game to be used in a single puzzle, many events later, in a completely different part of the world.

The Broken Sword games as a whole have been compelling and number five offers many  thrills, much humor  and suspense, albeit in a small package. A few more locales and characters to interact with would have made this installment better. The hand drawn illustrations are some of the best I have seen in a modern game, if not rather unexpected in the digital age. The dialogue is both funny and charismatic. The mystery of the murders, the Tabula Veritatis and the ancient connection to Jehovah and Lucifer are interesting and may appeal to members of gnostic and catholic faiths.\n\nThe ending is good, but brief. If George and Nico's outing had been shown, it would have been a satisfying finale. As the conclusion is, it leaves players wanting more, but also wishing the story had lasted longer.\n\nAll in all, Broken Sword 5 is a fine game, worthy of praise, but a little lacking in depth. What it offers is interesting, but if the game had had a little more depth, it could have been as notable as the first.","July 4, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A peaceful afternoon in France is quickly transformed into a murder mystery... The story beats are classic Broken Sword fare; a crime is committed, there may have been a deeper motive behind this crime than is first apparent, and digging deeper begins to tug at the threads of a historical conspiracy.\n\nAt first glance the 3D models used for the characters draw more attention to themselves than their hand-drawn and animated sprite counterparts of old, but this passes quickly. The background art is bright and vibrant and characterful, reminiscent of the previous old games (1 and 2, in particular). Voice actor Rolf Saxon returns for George Stobbart (and let's face it, it wouldn't be George without the same voice!), although Nico's voice actor has sadly been replaced. I must admit, however, that the change for Nico is not particularly jarring, with the new voice fitting in alongside George's well and you'll quickly forget that her voice was ever any different.\n\nI found the puzzles mostly satisfying, only getting stuck a few times over both episodes, and fortunately the game has a built in hints system that works really well. It's a tiered system, first offering a vague hint, then building as you ask for more info until it just gives you the complete solution. I feel this is the best possible system a point-and-click game can have in place, allowing you to still feel like you've solved the puzzle on the first few hints, and ultimately saves you alt-tabbing out of the game for a guide in the worst case scenario. I felt comfortable negotiating most of the puzzles myself, but a few tricky and obscure puzzles had me stuck until a few hints pointed me back onto the right path.\n\nA must-play for Broken Sword fans, and a great point'n'click game for those new to the series too. A few in-jokes may be missed, but you'll still enjoy the ride.","August 13, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also probably not a great adventure game for 2013, nor a proper evolution for the series and its characters.\n\nIt is nice to have Nico and George back, personally I could never go through the 3D games in the series (even though I heard 3 is actually rather okay), dropping them pretty early on and Director's Cut of the first game actually made the game slightly worse due to rather weak additions that broke a very good pace of the original. But updated second game and rather promising start of these made me want to expect more. Yes, the art is sometimes crappy, all pre-rendered cutscenes look horrible due to very-very bad compression, but overall the style, the controls and the feel of the game Revolution were going for is great.\n\nBut then comes a weird feeling that all excitement from the game comes only from the fact that Nico and George work so well together and some interesting religious themed mythology conspiracy is just a potentially good topic to explore, but... it's like that's what the entire game hangs on. Puzzles themselves are rarely "what now" or feel needlessly hard, but the NEED for those puzzles seems weird. You need to remove a roach that doesn't even try to hide, but instead of just crushing it and swiping remains under the table, you need to complete a puzzle and use 2 items to catch that roach, just so he would then hang in your inventory for most of the game to be used in a single puzzle, many events later, in a completely different part of the world. George is a collectathon enthusiast, sure, but why would he even consider doing something so complicated and pointless, when he's on a very tight schedule and things are quickly getting out of control? And that's what happens with quite a lot puzzles - they just feel forced in just to be puzzles, which feels old even compared to some classic adventure games.

The Broken Sword games as a whole have been compelling and number five offers many  thrills, much humor  and suspense, albeit in a small package. A few more locales and characters to interact with would have made this installment better. The hand drawn illustrations are some of the best I have seen in a modern game, if not rather unexpected in the digital age. The dialogue is both funny and charismatic. The mystery of the murders, the Tabula Veritatis and the ancient connection to Jehovah and Lucifer are interesting and may appeal to members of gnostic and catholic faiths.\n\nThe ending is good, but brief. If George and Nico's outing had been shown, it would have been a satisfying finale. As the conclusion is, it leaves players wanting more, but also wishing the story had lasted longer.\n\nAll in all, Broken Sword 5 is a fine game, worthy of praise, but a little lacking in depth. What it offers is interesting, but if the game had had a little more depth, it could have been as notable as the first.","July 4, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Light_Grenades/recommended/262940/","Light_Grenades","JohnnyKooch [TunnelSnakes]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Light_Grenades/","105 products in account","I give it 7.5 Kooch's out of 10.\nIt is a solid return for the series, bringing in homage to it's classic roots.\nThe game's plot format is familiar; George is a bystander and witness to a murder in Paris, team up with Nico Collard, learn that the murder is tied into a string of religious conspiracy that has been ongoing for centuries, goats, code deciphering, etc.\nThat said, the plot still has its own twist and turns you may or may not see coming. However, one of the first issues I have with the game is the voice-acting.\n\nBroken Sword has always had interesting and entertaining voice-acting, and I believe it to be one of the most important aspects of a modern adventure games. This game features a lot of recurring characters making come-backs from the first game, yet they are missing the matching vocal chords. I can understand this, really. But the replacements voices fail to sound anything like the original incarnations, inluding dialect. I'm not sure if the developers meant to completely re-imagine many of the returning characters, but it seemed that way. Most of these are minor characters, who sometimes save the day for you. So you can look past it a bit, maybe. But Nico is a major character and sounds bored and uninspired in every single line.\nGeorge Stobbart is the same dude he's always been, and that is a positive thing. Rolf Saxon delivers the lines true with consistancy.\n\nAs far as the split episodes go, I found the first episode more entertaining than the second, but that's kind of what is expected to happen when you release half of your game first. The first epsiode had a decent pacing with mostly interesting puzzles. Some puzzles were a bit hard to conclude, and still lacked a bit of sense when revealing the answer with the appreciated and optional 'Hint System'. You can chalk that up to me being dumb, the game having questionable build up, or anything in between> Its probably safe to say it was me.\nBut in the second episode a lot of the puzzles were about deciphering code. Some are complex with take a while to solve, but eventually you might get wore out when you're deciphering another coded letter or word problem after just finishing a decipher puzzle after just finishing a decipher after just finishing.....\nBut it clears up by the end of the episode.\nWhich brings me to my last problem. The ending.\nI didn't like it. The last few endgame puzzles you solve are arguably simpler than 75% of the game. The exchange between you and the enemy, the way it appears visually on screen, the terrible rendering of the cutscene (and all others for that matter), and the extremely dull conclusion leaves a horrifying taste in your mouth.\n\nAll in all, it's good to see Broken Sword back again, but I'm hoping the next entry is more lined up with funding and can come back with more finesse and polish in a lot of places.","February 21","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
