There are some tech issues in joining a match lobby and Devs are working on it and on keyboard controls and further customization. Now is the game good at basic? I think yes. It has potential to be very good and is even now quite fun and I fear addictive. Its Combat arcade meets RPG Fantasy. A Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter in fiery pits of hell and fighters from fantasy epics meets survival. Its simply a fun multiplayer combat game set in RPG mould. I found it simply fun and addictive. Even at early stage its deeply satisfying. Menu is simple and easy to follow. Graphics is quite good. Its a dog eat dog ruthless world. The environment, the players everyone or everything is your enemy. You don't just have to beat the enemy players in rapid deathmatches or the Bosses that jump in simply to kill all, you have to survive also the hostile environment while trying to stay alive and thats both challenging and fun. There are no friends here or even temporary allies to face bigger enemies. You are on your own all the time and anything that can move will certainly kill you. Between friends this will be a kind of extremely fun vs mode, if you are bored of shooting folks down or sniping them in normal vs games. Have fun guys! I look forward to playing this more in coming days.","May 30, 2015","true","2.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","4"

Good GFX. That said, once I got to play a few rounds i think it was awesome fun and can be a great hangout for friends who want a new flavor in deathmatches. Kill each other, kill big bosses and try to top the round at same time even as the maps can make you do suicide if you don't watch out. Layers of challenge and all fast paced. It can only get better. Yes lots of work left to do but it seems to be going in the right direction.

Skill based games have gotten scarce over the last few years. Multiplayer gaming is being dumbed down to an extent, where there is literally no learning process required anymore. I think, that for players looking for a game, that's demanding to learn and hard to master Skara could be a blink on the horizon.\nAt the current state, there is only a sneak peak offered I guess but it gives quite a good insight of the games feel. As far as I have seen know the Devs are sticking to a regular pace, when it comes to updates. Personally, I have big hopes for this game. Many of the negative reviews are kind of misleading imho. It's a multiplayer arena game, if you don't like arena games, don't buy it and write a negative review for gods sake.\nSo basically, if your into the idea of a skill based, multiplayer arena game you should deffinitly give this one a closer look.","March 1","true","2.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/recommended/274620/","maximumslothfulness","Maximum Sloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/","618 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n**Edited 9/18/2015\n\nI would like to start this review by commending the Development Team for being extraordinarily involved with the community and quite friendly. I asked a question before purchasing the game and the creator of Skara The Blade Remains, cromlech_, responded in a detailed and helpful manner. He then proceeded to invite me to his friend list and took the time to chat with me about my opinion regarding the game. This Dev team seems to be trying really hard to engage the community, be transparent, and take all of our suggestions to heart, and it's wonderful. For anyone interested in Q&A about the game etc., I recommend asking on the forums about when there will be Dev streams on Twitch. After the Q&A they will also be playing the game, so you can watch live footage straight from the Devs. See the TL;DR at the bottom for a short summary of my review.\n\nNow, for the actual review- which I will likely edit as I play more of the game, play more characters, and as the game evolves:\n\nAs you would have likely noted, this game just released in a true Alpha state rather recently(about 3-4 months ago). Currently, since the announcement of true alpha, there has been at least one update a month; the last two updates added a playable tutorial, some new skills, bug fixes, implementation of suggestions by the community such as keybinding etc., This game is still in early Alpha - and I repeat, IT IS EARLY ALPHA. Do not expect a fully fleshed out game yet. The framework is there, and it looks quite promising. It will be free to play in the future, so if you would like to wait until its full release to play, then by all means, please do so. That being said, right now your job if you purchase this game is to test current balance between characters, test maps and game systems, and make suggestions on how to improve the game - because the Devs will listen and almost always respond.\n\nGeneral Gameplay - This game has a ton of potential and will be ludicrously fun once all the features are implemented. Right now there are 3 maps, one for each game mode, with plans for more. Some have lava(fall in it and you die) and levers that activate certain map effects. For example, in one map there's a ring in the center that gives way if you hit the lever and this leads to you, or your enemy, tumbling down into a pit of lava. There's also a huge boss-like monster that arises from within the depths of an arena. Currently this monster is an NPC and will attack every player that comes near it - players get extra points for hitting and killing it. A clever player could just stand back as his/her feeble opponents attempt to battle it..and pick them off as they back away in horror. Alas, you will respawn after perishing..so find solace in that.\n\nThere are 3 game modes. Team deathmatch, free for all, and duel. They are fairly self-explanatory. - I will update this section further the more I play, if I notice any notable deviations.\n\nEach character, as you level up, has a set of skills the player can pick. Hold down RT or RB on the gamepad to execute said skills. Shinse has a skill that makes her invisible for a short period of time, and a teleportation ability that switches the player's position with that of his/her target. Also, the devs recently added an ability called, "forest wind," basically you can dash forward in a straight line, damaging any opponents in your path. They also added 1 new skill for the other two currently playable characters, which you can unlock through progressing(leveling up). There are plans to add passive skills and more primary skills.\n\nThere will be a store where you can buy costumes and weapons with in-game currency as well. These costumes will modify stats.\n\nThere will be daily quests/missions, factions, gems to modify stats and more in the future. There are placeholders available for them in game already, but they haven't been implemented yet.\n\nFor new players - There is a playable tutorial right after you create your first character. It explains basic attack, movement, and how to utilize your special attacks. You'll also be able to test out your skills at the end of the tutorial against a few AI opponents.\n\nMost of the above systems are fairly barebones at the moment, because, well, it's an early alpha. Once they become more fleshed out, the game will have far more depth. I say that to warn the people expecting some kind of fully fleshed out product, in the hopes that the people purchasing the game will do so knowing that they are helping develop it with their suggestions et al.,\n\nCombat Gameplay - Each character utilizes a string based on heavy/light attacks. I use an Xbox 360 gamepad so this would be RB and RT. I have played Shinse, thus far. She is a quick assassin-like character.  Her attacks feel appropriately light and heavy depending on what combination of attacks utilized, and they also look nice. Each character can also throw projectiles, a limited number, per life using the A button. Blocking is here too, but blocking attacks drains stamina - and you do NOT want your stamina drained or your block broken as you will be brutally punished by the AI or other players. That being said, the AI so far is kind of placeholder - For example, if you stealth as Shinse the AI will just stand there until you appear again. The last of the controls I will mention here is the "dodge" ability(B on the gamepad), which effectively...dodges. How effective the dodge is depends on your character - some of the heavy characters are a bit slower to dodge.\n\nThe devs also added 3 new abilities - one for each class, so far I have tried Shinse's out and it is mapped to the X button(again, using a 360 gamepad) by default.\n\nGraphics - The game is optimized fairly well for an early alpha, though with recent updates the optimization seems to have gotten a bit worse. That being said, I experienced no notable system lag with all settings maxed. It looks really nice too. I realize "nice" is a vague descriptor, but it's the best I have. To put it another way- this game pleases my ocular orbs.\n\nControls - They are quite responsive. There doesn't seem to be any noticeable input lag. This game does have gamepad (360/Xbox) support as well as keyboard support. The developer has implemented keybindings with update 0.5.3.\n\nCommunity/Online - You'll likely match up against the creative developer and creator of the game if you try out the online. Sadly, the community is fairly small at the moment and you may fight exclusively bots a majority of the time. I hope this changes in the future because these guys deserve both your support and your input as both will help make this game great.\n\nSo if the game is so early, why do I recommend it? Well, because I really like how involved the Developer is with the community, it shows supreme potential that I have no doubt will be met, and as a barebones early alpha, it's actually pretty fun!\n\nTL;DR - Right now you're buying into an early alpha, with an established framework(meaning there's stuff there, like characters, some maps to fight on etc., but it's basic at the moment. Many features still have to be implemented), to help test out balance, make suggestions for improvements, and support the developer. That being said, it's only a $5 buy-in, and it is indeed fun even at this early stage of development. ^_^","July 8, 2015","true","1.6"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","0"

You can really tell that the developers have a passion for the game and do their best to improve it. They are eager to hear what the community thinks and love to hear feedback of how to improve the game. They’re really putting that feedback to use by implementing and changing things suggested by the community. It’s one of the things that I can highly appreciate.\n\nThe design of the characters, environment and the concept art  is phenomenal. They definitely have talented people working on the project. The characters are all very unique and diverse which is pretty nice. Currently they have implemented two out of the five characters that they have announced. The environments have changed over-time quite a bit and are beautiful. You currently can play in three different maps and they’re pretty diverse. I like the fact that they keep things minimalistic yet diverse.\n\nThe game is in early access still so the game is far from being completed. If you’re looking for a well-polished and functional game I wouldn’t recommend the game in its current state. The combat, user interface and some technical issues are the biggest problem right now and they still need a lot of work. Because there’s still quite a bit of work that has to be done before the game will become “good” there’s also a low population.\n\nIf you’re willing to see the project grow larger, test new builds and give feedback to the developers then I would definitely support the project.","December 26, 2014","true","34.2"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

It seems that the graphics and visual quality are extremely high, particularly for a 'to-be' free-to-play game once it is officially released. Despite this, I think there remains a fair amount to do for example improving the FPS levels and smoothing the motion of characters during combat. It would be cool to see the combat systems developed a little more also, particularly for the Kharn race which is a personal favourite.\n\nClearly this is a early-access version so i'm struggling to understand peoples complaints -  I'm assuming that's why the developers have uploaded it, to get feedback from the community.\n\nVerdict: by no means perfect, but a game that possesses serious potential - the UNREAL4 engine's graphics are quite astonishing.

Yes, the game is incredibly rough if you consider the devs' ambition, but, seeing the amount of polish put into the game in this one update (i.e. there were no options at all and now there are enough to (maybe) satisfy most (for now)), I am incredibly hopeful. If you approach the game at face-value - as an arena fighter - you, too, will no doubt see only potential and spread the word that "Hey, there's something to this game."\n\n[[I am friends with one of the dev's because they friended me after I posted in a discussion, where I complained (before this latest update) that I couldn't play the game. He reassured me that a new update would be coming soon that should take care of it. Skara is, at the moment, an arena fighter, capable of supporting single player versus bots, but meant for PvP. My endorsing of the game might seem like advertisement I was paid to do. It is not. It is simply my recognizing that without a community, Skara could go nowhere. I want this game to be successful. *spreadin' the word*]]\n\nSkara definitely seems like a prime example of Early Access done right - invest in the game and watch it get better and better. Currently there are three maps and two characters with three different Armors/Skins (one of these cosmetics is "Coming Soon"). The basics of the fighting system are pretty well done; Skara is not a button-masher, so be decisive in doing what you do (the only complaint that I have with the controls is that the Lock-On (using a controller) seems unresponsive at times) - this is to say that if you get your fighter into a combo, there really doesn't seem to be a way to cancel out of it. Rolling might work, but the camera (whether you're locked-on to an enemy or not) seems to get locked, or at least stiffened, while you're in a combo too.\nPlaying as the Gladiator, I get destroyed by the Assassin, who is much quicker and can teleport (not necessarily hinting that there is a balance issue, because I really think the game is pretty polished thus far - except maybe the fighting being a little too stiff(?)).\n\n(Perhaps too) Optimistic (that word usually goes as well with Tynon as "cold" goes with "fire," so hopefully that's a good testament), I think that there is zero chance of Skara being perverted into a bad game that disappoints. The developers truly want to make a great game; they are eager to play with people who post "Multiplayer game with no players?" just waiting for that word of mouth to help Skara take off. With devs as invested as these, yeah, Skara will be big.\n\n\nEDIT: To clarify my "the fighting [is] a little too stiff" comment: Having played the game further, I now have a better feel for what exactly Skara is.\n\nIt is a deliberate, basic fighter.\nTo elaborate:\nHave you ever been playing a fighting game and just could not reckon it? There're the 88-fingered wiz's and there are those with, er, an eidetic muscle memory. Thus, there are those who mash buttons in the hope of achieving some awesome combo and there are those who attempt to memorize specific combo's (no doubt just to mix them up and fail).\n\nSkara is a deliberate, basic fighter. Though it could be argued that in those other fighting games you've only yourself to blame if you're not good - I think, in that case, it's either a lack of will or manual dexterity. In Skara, it is ONLY up to your ability to anticipate and react. There are no 4-line long combos. There are no cheap Hadoken techniques. So if you're not good at Skara, it's either because of lag in hand-eye coordination or because you're approaching it wrong...\n\nMy complaining that the combat might be too stiff was misinformed. I was expecting some sort of flighty fighter; Skara is more akin to a heavy-weight chess match. You really do have to plan and counter with the quickness - it's hard (if even possible) to cancel actions so as to reinforce this: If you make a mistake, you will pay.\n\nSo. If a game of pure skill is what you're after, as opposed to games in which a certain Champion has this one power they keep spamming / a certain Killstreak keeps decimating you / a certain tactic is abused, rendering the game a "Wait out the clock for inevitable defeat because there's no defense from that"...\n\nSkara - The Blade Remains","March 1, 2015","true","6.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Unfortunately this game has failed to catch my attention as it is an Arena game, in an Arena game players JUST fight each other inside an arena and that is it. It is a good bid because most gamers nowadays use consoles and the personal computer is NOT on their wishlist (just speculating but it might have something to do with having to think when having a computer while having a console you just need to know how to turn it on), so if you want to make a quick buck on the console market this might work. I am an extremely complicated person and I LOVE a challenge in complete contrast to most players who are just looking to let off some steam. In a perfect world this game would be more about using the flow of movement to defend or attack an opponent, just look at fight scenes in every movie you've ever seen where the hero is fighting with EVERYTHING available to him/her. Using elbows, knees, shield and staff end of a spear and much more. Now if there is any way to implement this kind of detailed fighting THEN I would certainly look into this game once again but for now it is MAINLY a game for consoles and it doesn't peak my interest.","May 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I probably will not come back and correct this review later.\n\nMostly positive? Yeah right.\n\nI can tell that the game at its core seems fine. Decent animations, blocks, rolls, attacks etc. But when I got on, there were only two matches available with "-1 ping", whatever that means. That is not how ping is measured, but either way, it means that it's unplayable. Massive 1-2 second input lag and rubber banding was happening during all my matches, I even got booted to main screen a couple of times.\n\nMy net runs fine and smooth, so the servers are not great at the moment. I am sure that this game will be fine on release when it's got everything polished, but it's absolutely not worth a buy right now. I kind of regret spending $1 on Humblebundle because this was the only "decent" game in the bundle.

Waited ten minutes for the game to start. Got a message with a ludicrous number of errors. Game proceeds to shut down.\n\nI got this game for free and I feel ripped off.\n\nNone the less, I pressed on, if for no reason than because ten minutes isn't enough to get a single card.\n\nMy first problem is how long it takes to get to the options menu.  My computer can't run the game at all at full graphics, so it was really annoying that I had to: 1.Create an account.  2.Select a character.  3.Go through the tutorial screens.  4.Access the menu WHILE A GAME ALREADY STARTED AND WOULD NOT PAUSE DESPITE BEING AGAINST THE AI!  Option access should be the first thing I can do in any game, and barring that, it should be the first thing I can do after I create an account.  At full graphics, the game runs on my computer at an amazing 3 frames per second, so I'm sure you can imagine how frustrating it is to turn the graphics of the game down WHILE IT'S GOING!\n\nSecond, and I can't really blame the game on this, there seems to be no one online whatsoever.  The most fun I had with the game for a straight hour was when I got up from it to make a grilled cheese sandwich.  Twice.  I don't think solely online games like this should be released without a lot of advertisement.  The actual gameplay is fine, but even on the lowest graphic settings, my computer simply can't handle the game, despite the fact that the graphics are somewhat comparable to Dynasty Warriors, a game that purposefully uses lower end graphics to have a lot of characters on screen on a time.  What is using up all of this?\n\nThe game is kinda fun on its own, but I honestly can't recommend this game to you unless you have friends who are willing to get on at the same time.  And since not everyone has this luxury, there are some people who simply can't play the game with other people.","June 19, 2015","false","13.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonicbomb77/recommended/274620/","sonicbomb77","◢kris◤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonicbomb77/","1832 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTo start, I had a LOT of trouble getting this game to load (it would be nearly two months before I got to finally try the game). Once I had the chance to try it, I saw why everyone was reinforcing the "Early Access" Label. It is an Early Access release, but while it seems to still need a lot of work it also has good potential and has some fairly active developers - so it seems promising to follow.\n\nThe game is an FFA/DM multiplayer arena fighter with a neat collaborative boss to fight at the end (so far only available in one particular level - I suspect the other levels will also have a collaborative boss eventually).\n\nGraphically, the game has the effects and character design and landscaping of a promising game; it's really pretty. My immediate thoughts from previews and screenshots was actually reminiscent of Vindictus by Nexon/DevCat - the theme and scale feels similar in some ways and I rather liked that.\n\nThe animations and mechanics still feel a bit clunky and restrictive of the player's options to adapt to a fight. A lot of the attack options you have are very linear and in-flexible and you can't intentionally interrupt them very well without cancelling the attack entirely. Additionally, once you are beyond a certain point into the attack animation, you kind of lose control of your character (so if your attack missed, you basically become fodder for spam attacks from the swarming bots as your character slowly recovers from the attack cool down).\n\nAfter a lot of practice, you might finally familiarize with enough of the animation procedures and timing mechanics to be somewhat effective in battle (or maybe discover an exploit similar to how the bots can spam you once you are knocked down) - however it feels more like a game about timing events based on your familiarity with particular model animations still. It doesn't feel oriented around counter attacking or flexible and dynamic attacks.\n\nThe male character has a clear advantage using a spear/polearm for their fast attack that easily outranges the dagger fast attack of the female character. Sure the female character can throw daggers and use a charge attack, however both have larger vulnerabilities and skill requirements that make them less effective than the ranged fast attack of the spear. I mentioned "[exploiting mechanics to win]" and that was the first one I quickly discovered and relied on.\n\nThe Arenas are rather big, but not entirely purposeful during fights yet. Once you are in a conflict with a bot, the rest of the Arena outside of attack range is just space that you are not using (unless you manage to dodge and sprint away, but even still that doesn't give the arena's scale much purpose)\n\n------------\n\nLike everyone says, it's still in Early Access. It does look like it has potential, but in it's current state it's very hard for me to recommend it yet as enjoyably playable. However, I would recommend following it as development progresses.\n\nIf I could make one request, it would be to expand the graphical settings to be more advanced. I had to play on low quality settings because one of the effects that automatically kicks on from Medium and higher quality consistently plays at nearly the same, very low fps. I suspect it's V-sync or aliasing maybe. Either way, it would be nice to break down the graphical settings to be more customizeable so I don't need to sacrifice all the other graphical features because of one or two particular settings not workign well on my GPU.","February 20, 2015","false","4.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

You will forget everything when the first "real trouble" comes, like the game say. I died 3 times in the "real trouble". (Real trouble is in the tutorial when you first encounter with the enemy)\n\nSo this game is about dying... Combat is really slow. The most difficult character (I think it's not difficult) is a stealth assassin, what include a bit faster combat but It's slow too... There's 3 available character in this game right now. Playing with all of them is great, but everyone of them are slow. By the way, combat and other things in this game is very interesting.\n\nGraphicsThis game is REALLY nice. But I couldn't experience this during this version. It's unoptimized. I have a computer what can be named high-spec computer. For a stable 30 FPS I should decrease my resolution and put the Quality to the Lowest one.\n\nOn Very High quality I had 2-3 FPS, but It was really nice and unplayable. On Low settings and Decreased resolution the "nice" game was just a bit "nice" but It wasn't bad. OK. It's a Beta game, but if I compare this "optimalization" to other beta games with nice graphics,\n\nIt will be the last on a scoreboard.\n\nMultiplayingI think this game have a great multiplayer section, but there's no player. My friends got this game, but don't play it.\n\nThere's 1-2 people on this game online, everytime. So I should play with BOTS. Bots are same, all the time. They are not very difficults and not easy, of course.\n\nOtherYou can see how many hours I played with this game. I liked it, but not at all... I couldn't play more than a half an hour. It crashed with a title "FATAL ERROR". Great, I said and restarted the game. Played another 30 minutes and crashed again, with a title "FATAL ERROR".\nMaybe some bug fixes can come too...\n\nBy the way, the game's loading screens were really slow. I waited 3 minutes/loading screens. It didn't matter which loading screen I had got. When I completed a match the loading screen's time was about 5 minutes.\n\nWhen I went to a match the loading screen was about 3-5 minutes. So if somebody have a lot of played hours on this game, the half of it is loading screen, or he have a REALLY-HIGH-SPEC computer.\n\nSummaryYeah, we came there...\n\nGameplay: 6/10 - A great fighting game, with a slow combat... Just increase the combat speed somehow...\nGraphics: 8/10 - It's really nice. But needs optimization, I give 8 because of Beta.\nSound: 6/10 - It's not bad, but it can be improved a bit.\nSummary: 7/10 - I liked It.

In no way am I saying that this is how I'll feel in the future. As it develops there is a chance that I could change my stance on the game. So in saying that let's get into it.\n\nCurrently I don't feel I can say this game is very good. There are certainly nice things going for it but not nearly enough. The game has a decent concept, though not the most original around. And it looks nice enough and the only reason to bash it is if you're a graphics wh*re. But that is about where the good stops.\n\nGoing back to the graphics, for what they currently are...the game runs terrible. I by no means have a monster PC but it's well enough that I have run nicer looking games on higher settings with less stability issues. It also seems hit or miss if the game will launch successfully on the first go. The combat, which should be the shining star in this game is the exact opposite. It's sluggish, slow and at times unresponsive. They claim you can't just spam click but with how it's currently designed, you very much can and still be successful. Connecting to a game is also a hair pulling task. It starts with not enough players. So most of the time you're stuck playing with bots or a single dude who has no place hosting with their internet and its a lagfest. No problem, you'll just play with your friend you might say. Good luck. There is no way to create a lobby and have your friends join. It's all just dumb luck and chance one of you gets a lobby instead of joining a random person and then they can manage to find your game via random clicking and crossing their fingers. I could type my life story about the faults but instead I'll link to a video I did talking about further issues that game has below. But in closing, I'd suggest staying away from this one until they put a lot more work into it. It wasn't ready for testing at all.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JVu-bVr5kXM","November 13, 2015","false","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

A duel game mode with 1v1 fights, a free for all, and a team death match.\nI've have played all three modes and due to the sparse playerbase I was only able to play with actual players in free for all.\nThe combat is really simple. There is a light and heavy attack a simple block and dodge system and a few special moves you can activate during gameplay. I personally would love to see some type of counter attack system intruduced as blocking did not seem to be as useful as just dodging an attack.\n\nNow this game is full of problems, I've had the game crash multiple times during my short playtime, but the worst problem with this game is that it is an unplayable mess.\nThe framerate is beyond awful. Just in the menu I was getting 14fps and during online play I was dropping down to 9fps. The camara tracking in this game needs a lot of work as well as it flips around randomly during play.\n\nRight now I cannot recommend playing this game. I hate to give a game in such an early state a bad review but there is just too much work that needs to be done with this game. If the devs continue work and the game become more stable I would love to revist it. But as of now just stay away.","November 12, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

So, I start into the tutorial all good and what not. Then I get to the final part where you have to fight the guards. Sadly, dodging and blocking are the most unresponsive things in the entire game. Once I finished with that garbage I went to play a free for all. IT WAS HORRIBLE. It  said I had 0 ping, but I clearly had over 300. I kept falling into the lava CONSTANTLY. The dodge mechanic is weak and needs MAJOR improvement for it to actually be a fun and strategical game. In this game current state I do not want to play it. It isn't very fun, there are only 4 characters with dull stories, and the servers are laggy as all hell. Luckily, this game was F2P, so I guess it has that to it. Please devs, refine your game and make the blocking and dodgding actually worth using. The bots could hit me faster than I could them.\n\n\nMARCH 28TH 2016 EDIT: So, I tried the game out again and surprisingly, there was allot less lag and the gameplay felt fun. Now, certainly not polished. The blocking in the game could really use some work, and the classes should get more health, so they don't die in 2 or 3 hits. That's just boring and no fun.","March 23","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

I´ve played Blade Symphony which is much better and will still be much better in 1vs1 experience -\nbut if you play Skara in Team Deathmatch it could be a different battle fight feeling. Team Deathmatch will come soon and some new characters. The camera view can´t be changed which should be fixed. Some performance issues and walking bugs (run stuttering) prevent fun in the game.

Or I think it was a game. It was against two players, and I was what I think is the spearman type character. I didn't pick that, I just hit play, and after loading it just threw me in. At first, my confusion was met with anger as I became the punching bag of two players, and the lag was so horrific that I could not even learn the controls before the game said I was dead.\n\nI exited and spent a few months ignoring it.\n\nJust recently, I saw it in my library and didn't remember why I stopped playing it. I just remembered that it looked nice. Lo and behold I make an account. And it comes back to me that I never did this before. Cool! I pick a spearman and get on my way.\n\nAnd then a bot kills me. Well damnit. As I learn the controls, I start killing the bot at least once in between two/three deaths. Then it becamse a sparring match, I kill him, he kills me, I kill him. Then I start getting the upper hand. Soon, I'm killing the bot several times over before he even gets me to half health.\n\nSo I start spending the brief period between the bot's death to explore.\n\nAnd that's when I realize I can't. I don't know what else the game wants me to do. Kill the bot? Make more characters to kill more bots or maybe one player? Why can't I explore? What's the point of this?\n\nIf I was desperate for a game, this could be a fun little time killer. But I am not desperate for games. I have plenty, I merely wanted to give this one a shot. And having no explanation isn't the worst. But I can't do anything but kill bots as far as I'm aware. I'll pass.","July 31, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","7"

I think this game has a lot of potential. There's some great lore, and thus, some great races to play. There's arena combat. Skara seems to be a quite beautiful continent too; hopefully that'll translate into beautiful, tactics-rich arenas.\n\nAnd they've got the graphics on their side. I say: A good game is coming.\n\nEdit: Testing the combat in 1-vs-1, I had a good bit of fun. Seeing everything is still very basic, I've got good hopes for the next update: 0.4.6.","April 8, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

After a few patches the game stops working right on startup and there seems to be no way of fixing this.

Probably because my computer sucks, but even then, they should have some graphics settings. I got stuck on the screen before you create your first character (I assume)\nI can't give this a true rating seeing that I can't even play the game, it's horrible.\nthank for reading.\n\n==Edit\nI was able to go into the config files and tweak some things, now I ran it in windowed mode at a lower resolution and lowered the graphics settings and whatnot, and I still get a message about my video drivers. So I went through the trouble of updating them, and it still gives me the message.\nmaaan I was so hyped to play this game.\n\n==Edit 2\nI got spooked by the developer of the game and decided to watch more gameplay to fill in the gap of me not being able to play. Still wish i could choose, "Undecided" though, because there's no real reason to give a true rating as I can't play it, but watching gameplay can always help me reach a reasonable conclusion.\nSkara looks like an arena/RPG based game that seems to use a fighting system that is somewhat unique in the sense that it helps with the whole strategy feel of the game. I can see the potential in this game as a whole, but as i said before, wish that I could have a neutral rating.","November 16, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

If, and only if, you have the minimum requirements, you should buy this game. Be awared, it really requires that much.\n\nThe game is actually good, the battle system flows well and the characters do seem responsive to your commands, although they aren't really charismatic at all. The graphics are nice also and it looks pretty good. The game apparently has some cool customization, like passive skills. I say apparently because the game is still not fully launched yet, it lacks some things in it that are with a "coming soon" sign. The game may be a pretty good arena fighting game. Also, the controls are pretty easy to get into, even in the keyboard+mouse.\n\nBut, since it requires a lot to play, the game doesn't have a large pool of players. It lacks players, it is hard to find players to play this game. And the bots become boring.\n\nMaybe they can still improve the game and get over these problems, maybe putting better AI or a single player system, but requiring that much, it can still be a problem for it, it actually makes it a pretty niche game.\n\nI recommend this game, it is not bad, it just have some problems to improve. If they manage to, it will be a pretty good game. If not, well, I may change the review again. But, remember, just get it if your pc can play it, it uses a lot of your pc.\n\n\nOriginal Review from 23/11/15: This game has some nice aspects to it, even if it is a bit too clunky.\nAlthough, I had a huge problem with the game that didn't make it run fine on my pc, even though it is a bit under the recommended settings. I can't quite recommend the game because of it, but I look for improvements in this game in all of these aspects and I may change this review later, since it is still not a fully launched game in the moment that I write this review.","November 23, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worst thing I've ever seen.\n\nCombat is pretty fun. Using range to your advantage, timing abilities, blocking and dodging, it's all there and it's well done. Controls are responsive, strong moves have good prep/reactionary periods, all that good stuff. As mentioned, the AI needs work (especially in pillar control, whatever that mode's actually called), and there are lag issues for actual multiplayer.\n\nHas potential, buy it on sale and hope they make the AI better? Something needs to tide people over until more real people are online.","May 31","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
