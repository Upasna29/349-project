The first friendly face in this game that can be bothered to talk to you tells you "LOLLIPOP COMPASS" and then twists her head around at inhuman angles as you back away slowly down the corridor.\n\nHonestly, that really sums this impenetrable madness up for me. You walk around, you find objects. Sometimes you can pick them up, sometimes they just mysteriously vanish when you go near them. You're never entirely sure whether you're progressing or just dying as the game seems to randomly regenerate the level each time you're killed by a tentacle or zombie hall monitor or jackass in a rabbit mask.\n\nI'm aware that me being unsure of what in the name of god this game is trying to accomplish is not much of a valid reason to vote it down but I walked into a door, the game froze for about a minute and then reloaded the same area with the Lollipop Compass madwoman standing mere feet in front of me and I'm having a hard time believing that any of that was intentional. Lollipop Compass indeed, my dear. Lollipop Compass indeed.\n\nBaffled progress below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqtHyDLxAwY","May 6","false","0.4"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","82","40","49","19","6"

You need to find the girl who asks for a lollipop, find the lollipop bring it back to her to receive a compass, the compass will then point you in the direction to where the exit is to complete the level\n- The level itself seemed to be the same on each stage, the only real change is the creatures which do increase in number, and become harder to sneak by. It just didn't feel like I was progressing, just playing the same level repetitively. There should have been more areas to explore.","May 31","true","10.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Navigation in the menues sometimes was buggy. Death sequences also trigger a load screen as if the game crashed.\n2. In the Rift, the game looks greyish instead of black.\n3. Locomotion feels very artificial and I also wished that you could turn by looking around (Ã  la Dreadhalls).\n4. The halls looks empty and repetitive (by design, I guess), interaction with the environment is very limited.\n5. Ambient music was good, but the sounds were not rich.\n\nThe developper mentionned updates and I will certainly return to the game to see them.","May 7","false","0.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","8"

The controls are janky as heck. You can't connect your controller and have it work without using the keyboard to pick things up. The ability to look around is very limited and when it does work it's very jumpy, there is no sensitivity settings for your controller to look around, so you are constantly trying to ease into whatever you are trying to look at or pick up. I honestly couldn't make it out of the first room because I couldn't even pick up the key. There is no mouse function that works to look around and when it does it breaks within 30 seconds. This game would be well suited for a person without a vr headset (those individuals who can't afford a $500 apparatus)  but the controls right now are just terrible. The help button doesn't work, the function buttons don't work, so in the end the only thing it currently has going for it is a cool main menu 1/10. This needs a lot of work guys i know this could be a good game just give it some love!","May 10","false","0.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","6"

It is classic indi-horror with thoughtful story. If you want to feel really scary, it will be enough to play it at night. I like horrors, but i play them only when it is not night, becouse i am scary, so as for me it was funny to find the exit on every level.\nBut one thing impressed me, and it was something which was looked like Bugs Bunny, but it wasn't kind. You will understand why. :D\nAlso game has trading cards and achievements!\n10 bunnies of 10","May 9","true","4.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"

However, my problems were swiftly patched by a new build and I was thrilled to redownload it.\nI find it's best to play standing with an xbox controller.\nI've had some startling moments. And the whole atmosphere of the game is creepy as heck.\nI'd recomend this if you need to fill that horror hole in your Vive library.","May 9","true","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

I'm sure those who are really into this genre will like this game enough, and the price is definitely right, but I had issues with it.\n\n- The "story" is in the store description, and not all that much is revealed while playing other than "secrets" you find that reveal things in the short notes of the acheivements earned. Strange.\n\n- The teaser trailers (not the one on the store page) show better graphics and have a lot more in them than at least the first hour of the game. Very misleading.\n\n- The key rebinding in the game's launcher is largely irrelevant, only the "jump" entry is actually used for item interaction in game. Confusing.\n\n- The mouse sensitivity is extremely high with no game setting available, so you have to adjust your own mouse dpi. Annoying.\n\n- I did run into a couple of bugs. One was an npc was stuck running into a wall; I could even put a barrel under him. Two was on the esc menu screen the mouse cursor disappeared, requiring alt+f4 to exit the game.\n\n- It really does look and feel like this game was designed for VR first.\n\nThis game seems to have an interesting backstory and all, but for some reason it's just not presented to you and wants to rely more on atmosphere and tension scares. So if you're just looking for scary, especially in VR, you'll probably have a better time.","May 6","false","0.9"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","10","28","3","2"
