It trumps Call of Duty, and even Battlefield, in my opinion. It will evoke the classic feeling of Star Wars inside of you, whether you're a new fan or an old one. The game is hilariously unbalanced and the AI is very broken at times, but the childlike wonder of being a jedi or being a stormtrooper almost always shields that from my sight. The space dogfights are awesome once you get the hang of them as well, and it's also very fun to infiltrate enemy ships and blow them up from the inside.\n\nAll in all, if I had to give it a rating I'd give this game a 9/10. It's definitely worth it's small pricetag.\n\nTO ANYONE WHO CAN NOT CONTACT KEY SERVER - I suggest opening a Steam support ticket.

See this lovely game called Star Wars:Battlefront II? This should be an example of what you ought to do in Battlefront 2015. This doubled the content of Battlefront 1 and improved everything. THAT is what you must do. Give us more so we don't have to play Battlefront II again. Take all maps from this and Frostbite them. If you have to delay it to do it, fine. If we have to wait for more years, fine. And look EA, if you ever decide to pull half the maps and modes from the game and sell it to us as DLC, if you push the game to release too early and the game is a glitchfest, if you remove bots, then I'll just stick to the good ol' Battlefront II; we have graphic mods for it.

While writing this review, I was at a loss for words in regards to the overabundance of joy that this game has brought me through the years, and I can proudly say that I own every variance of this game, including the PC, Playstation 2, and Xbox versions. Overall, I have spent more time playing this game than any other game in my library, which includes a massive set of classics such as the Jak & Daxter series, 007 Goldeneye, the Sonic the Hedgehog collection, and even the Pokemon franchise, which I have solely worked over hundreds of hours of play! I apologize that this review may not be as professional, and will be more of a fan’s remembrance to this awesome game. Before I begin, I would like to give a special thanks to some good friends-one being Lime Dorito-that put up with pre-reading this review, as well as my brother, Matthew, for playing countless hours of this game with me on the other ports.\nHere are some things that I love about Star Wars Battlefront II:\n\nGameplay - Star Wars Battlefront II is a war game, plain and simple. There are about six classes to choose from in each of the respective four armies, and playable Heroes such as Luke Skywalker and Boba Fett are available. This title also allows players to engage in vehicular combat, even hosting maps for dogfights in space against two rivalling fleets. Described earlier, there are several game modes similar to that of the Battlefield games, though Battlefront II has a unique game mode known as Assault, where Heroes from both the Good and Evil spectrums of the Star Wars films battle against each other. Overall, the game balances very well between aerial and ground combat, and evolves into a truly unique experience over multiplayer; unfortunately, the company that originally hosted the dedicated servers for Battlefront II, GameSpy is no longer operational, so other means of multiplayer is required on the PC port.\n\nGame Modes - In Campaign Mode, you mirror the Star Wars trilogy while playing as this group of soldiers as they influence the structure of the story that fans of only the movies know and love; this concept is similar to Star Wars Dark Forces in which the character Kyle Katarn is the one who was said to steal the Death Star plans for the Rebellion. Unlike the other Star Wars games such as Bounty Hunter and Dark Forces, Battlefront II maintains a focus on a specific group of Stormtroopers-rather than a single individual-infamously known by fans of the extended universe as the 501st, or Vader’s Fist. The Campaign introduces gameplay unique to the rest of the game in that it is objective-based, contrary to the usual skirmishes. For example, instead of a player dropping into a battlefield without an pretense as to what to do and why they’re fighting, the player is briefed on the purpose of the mission beforehand to perform a specific task such as protecting a Command Post for a given amount of time, or to locate a driver for a downed AT-AT that requires services.\n///  Galactic Conquest Mode is a change of pace, as players strategically maneuver battleships across a large map in an attempt to overtake all territories. This game mode features out-of-battle unit purchasing as well as upgrades that allow the player to determine how they want to progress in an all-out war  against a rivaling army; the opposing force depends on which era of the Star Wars universe you are in, and pits either the CIS against Clone Troopers or the Empire versus the Rebellion.\n///  Don’t want to worry about progressing through the story in Campaign Mode or strategically planning your way through Galactic Conquest? Give Instant Action Mode a go! Skirmish is exactly what it sounds like: you pick the game mode you want to play-between Conquest, Hunt, 1- and 2-Flag CTF, Space Assault, Assault, and Space 1-Flag CTF-and go from there. There are various settings for each, as well as playable Jedi/Heroes.\n\nClass System - Like Battlefield, this title has multiple unique classes that operate differently. Every class has their own unique appearance, primary and secondary weapons, statistics, and secondary equipment. For example, the Engineer class is much quicker due to his primary weapon being a shotgun. This class has a low rate of fire and a quick land speed, and is meant to splice into or repair vehicles with their Fusioncutters; it is played like a support class in most instances, but can easily clear singular enemies without a problem. The Engineer is also equipped with Detpacks-which are detonated remotely-and health and ammo dispensers.\n\nTL:DR - I had planned to write about weapon similarities between this game and the movies, as well as other topics, but if I had to talk about everything that is good about this game I would be typing for days. As you can tell from the above quote and through each of the screenshots, the Battlefront series does not look as polished in comparison to modern titles. However, this is just one of those games that stands the test of time with its amazing feel and fanatical impression. If you are a Star Wars fan, this title should not be passed up; if you are a Star Wars Battlefront fan, this installment to the series will not be forgotten.

A great addition to the Star Wars franchise. Being more based off of Episode III, it adds Order 66, the Grievous era??, and it adds heroes to the scene.\nStar Wars is a really good franchise, and games like these are the kind it deserves.\nI was looking forward to 1313, but now? I want the sequel to this the most. Sadly, as I've heard that EA making it... It's doomed.\nPros:\n+ A good storyline, sadly doesn't even finish the Emperor Strikes Back.\n+ Great music, but it's Star Wars music, so that was kinda obvious!\n+ Modding! You can mod the game! New maps, new classes, new weapons, NEW GRAPHICS. It still looks better than Watch_Dogs though. But what do I know, I'm jumping on the bandwagon.\n+ Storyline focuses on the clones, which is something we don't get much.\n+ The introduction of Hero characters, such as Jango Fett, Obi-Wan Kenboi, and my favorite, General Grievous! (Fear him you Jedi scum!)\n+SPACE BATTLES\n\nCons:\n- As I said in the pros, the storyline doesn't go past the Battle of Hoth. That's dissapointing.\n- No more multiplayer other than Gameranger...\n\nSo how about my final verdict?\nI really enjoy this game. It has a great campaign, great multiplayer, etc, etc. It's moddable too! Graphics outdated?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/6060/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","It is easy to rip on the Star Wars prequels. You can picket and cry foul that Lucas betrayed your childhood and that he turned a once revolutionary film series into a sameless Disney style toy template (Oh the irony). However, you should consider all the good it has brought as well. Cool music from John Williams, double lightsabers, awesome new spacecraft and Video Games.\n\nAmongst the heaps of shovelware Lucasarts published during the prequel frenzy there were a bunch of amazing gems. Like Episode One Racer, Knights of the Old Republic, Battle for Naboo, Galactic Battlegrounds and eventually: Battlefront. Based off the Battlefield: 1942 concept, Battlefront allowed players to experience the battles of both the prequels and originals from the perspective of the ordinary stormtrooper or battledroid. It was amazing, but was not enough.\n\nEnter Battlefront 2, the bigger, better and more amazing version of an already amazing game. Fear the day when stormtroopers suddenly learn how to shoot, because that is when you're really playing this game.\nIn general, the game is split in two different modes: Single and Mulitplayer. In singleplayer you play the tour of duty of the 501st Legion of the clone army, who after defeating the seperatist droid army become the elite troopers under the command of Darth Vader. The whole campaign is a short sequence with random objectives, but the whole is narrated by Temuera Morrison, the actor for Jango Fett and every Clone trooper ever. It adds some legitimacy to the whole romp. The other major single player mode is Galactic Conquest. It is a large scale turn based tactics game where you try to manouver your fleet with troops around the galaxy and subjugate (or liberate, if you're into that sort of thing; you tree sniffing hippie). You can employ bonusses, granted to you by owning certain planets.\n\nOn the other hand of the spectum is multiplayer; and this is the reason why we're here. Allowing 64 peeps to take to the field at the same time...that's real warfare. This game was at the frontline of modern FPS development. You'll see many mainstays of modern shooters make their debut here, such as endurance rewards, killstreak rewards and other unlockable perks. Most destructive of the lot are the Jedi units. The ultimate streak reward gives you access one of the saga's heroes and elevates your lowly soldier rank to harbinger of death with a lightsaber. The sheer terror, characters like Darth Maul and Mace Windu inspire is amazing as they cut through swathes of troops.\n\nThe real selling point though are the maps. The maps are open and wide to accomodate the massive amount of players. However, each map has a lot of secret passages and corridors that allow for exploration and experimentation. On top of that, the level of detail is amazing. Intricate care was taken to make all the maps look like they came right off the movie screen. You can run around the death star, from the hangar with the falcon, into the prison block, jump into the grabage shute, fight through the barracs, blow up the main laser, pace past the tractor beam generator, kick over the conference table where Vader expressed his opinion about a lack of faith and finally back to the hangar, all in one level.\nAlong side are the space battle stages. These battles are big, point based levels where you take to the stars in fighters, bombers and boarding craft. You either earn points by shooting down other fighters in dogfights or bomb their capital ships to bits, or you board them and start sabotaging their internal systems. It's a sweet change of pace, although it can be hassle to fly without a gamepad.\n\nIt's therefore a shame the game's description on the Steam store reads that all online functionality in dead as of this year's May. Which is pure bantha poodoo. You still get around with some trickery. Even better, at this pricepoint, you might just better off telling all your friends to just buy it and bring their laptop over (it's old enough to run on any potato at this point), and just host a massive LAN party to restore balance to Force once and for all.","December 13, 2014","true","9.8"," 256 of 276 people (93%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","93","256","276","42","9"

I, being a late-comer to gaming and Battlefront 2 being one of the earlier console games I played (along with GUN and I believe Flatout), can quickly say that this game is gorgeous and sold the industry to me.\n\nIt's massive, it's immersive, it's quick-to-play, and it's Star Wars! Who doesn't like Star Wars? Well, plenty of people, but... hey, you can't dislike the adorable Stormtroopers.\n\nYou've got all the stuff other shooting games do. Guns, people to shoot guns, and some extra things like vehicles. Then there's the space battles, which make an entirely different challenge and one of the most glorious flying experiences in gaming, and then you've got the tactical 'Conquest' part where you put around a giant fleet of spacecraft for your favorite faction in the Star Wars movies.\n\nRebels, Empire/Republic, CIS: You can play as any of them, which is great fun. Each have their own soldiers and classes, allowing different experiences for every team. It's especially cool to roll around as a droideka, then unfurl and be destroyed by a Jedi. At least you're the envy of your friends.\n\nThe battles themselves are manic and titanic. Hoth a devoid planet? Not when you're in the middle of a 100+ person skirmish between Rebels and Imperials. AT-AT action is amazing, until you're taken down by some jerk in a cheap snowspeeder. Maybe it was SKYWALKER?\n\nNo.\n\nThere's also that option to play as a Jedi or Sith or melodramatic bounty hunter popping up every now-and-then, but they're lame and die too quickly. I don't suggest them. Well, MBH is alright, but who wants to get eaten by a sandpit monster?\n\nThere's the few issues, like absurdly dumb AI and logical errors (downwards gravity in space?), but they're far and few compared to the joy this game brings.\n\nI couldn't recommend this enough. And it's only 10 bucks USD!","October 13, 2014","true","2.1"," 248 of 279 people (89%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","89","248","279","38","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/6060/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","NOTE 1: The game is OLD, being released back in 2005 so most likely than not you will encounter compatibility issues. I feel the need to point this out since it is not the game's fault that its 9 years old. There are 3 possible solutions to this:\n\n1. Right Click Battlefront 2 on Steam > Properties > Local Files > Browse Local Files, this will open the Battlefront 2 folder, Open GameData > Right click 'Battlefront II.exe' > Properties > Compatibility > Check 'Run this program in Compatibility for: Windows XP SP2.\n\n2. Plug in a microphone to your microphone jack, people on the forums report that this actually (usually) work.\n\n3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwR1i3tMCqA (Follow the instructions on this video, this worked for me).\n\nNOTE 2: The game supports 1080p resolution. Only the main menu, loading screens and pre-rendered cinematic are low resolution. The game itself, once you get it running, runs at a pristine 1080p, 60fps.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Star Wars: Battefront 2 is a first / third-person shooter game by LucasArts involving Star Wars' (duh) different histories ranging from the start of the Clone Wars towards Empire Strikes Back. It features soldier classes, hero characters, galactic conquest and a particularly fun space battle.\n\nThe campaign follows the rough history of the 501st Clone/Stormtrooper Legion, Darth Vader's personal bodyguards and elite fighting force. As already stated, this will involve the events of Episode II: Clone Wars, up until Episode V: Empire Strikes back.\n\nPROS:+ Graphics aged well: - The old Pandemic Zero Engine is showing it's age but is not about to go down without a fight. Animation Quality is fluid, character models are well made, texture quality are very good for its time.\n\n+ Relatively Strong Campaign: - Short but satisfying is what I would describe the campaign. Voiced by none other than Temuera Morrison (Jango Fett), it delivers the exploits of the 501st Legion in a very informative and fun experience. Unfortunately the maps are only multilayer maps with given objectives.\n\n+ Space Battle: - Nothing beats the excitement of piloting different kinds of fighters and bombers to attack key points on the enemy battleship or engage in open space dogfights. If that’s not your thing, then land your fighter (or a transport ship) in the enemy Hanger area and start wreaking havoc with the ship's internal systems. Or just steal an enemy fighter.\n\nCONS:- AI is too easy: - Way to easy once you get a hang of it even when fighting 'Elite' difficulty AI.\n\n- Campaign is too short: - Given that I already played it back in the day, it took me at least 4-5 hours to finish the story mode.\n\n- Hilariously Imbalanced in some places: - Not game-breaking by any stretch, but the game does lack the rock, paper, scissors element that usually balances out multiplayer games. Some of the maps tend to favor one particular faction than the other.\n\n- AI is annoyingly dumb: - Especially in space battles. I get that you're a Stormtrooper and can't shoot to save your life, but standing around the hanger just staring at the wall instead of boarding a fighter and helping me fend off the millions of rebel fighters bearing down on us is a whole new level of incompetence.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and lots of FUN. The PROS definitely outweigh the CONS and that it provides a cure for that need for a casual fast paced action game. The single player experience is enough to keep you satisfied if you lack the online capabilities or when GameSpy inevitably shuts down.\n\nWe can just hope that EA handles the franchise with care as the sequel for this game is already way overdue.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130236006/recommended/6060/","76561198130236006","Fid","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130236006/","68 products in account","I think the most efficient way to review this would be a non (slightly) biased comparison of this Battlefront (Lucas Arts / L.A) with EA's new Battlefront.\n\n-GAMEPLAY\nL.A take the lead with this one. Pretty easily to be honest. Much more game modes, maps, factions etc.. 1-0, to L.A.\n\n-GRAPHICS\nWhat do you expect. L.A's is 10 years old. 10 YEARS OLD. 1-1.\n\n-REPLAYABILITY\nWhile EA's multiplayer leveling system offer some replayability, L.A's wider range, and much larger density, of content give L.A the point. Also, and i will refer to this quite a bit, not everyone likes multiplayer. 2-1 to L.A.\n\n-SINGLEPLAYER\nEA doesn't really know how to create a good singleplayer. At all. In fact, it seems they've given up on the idea altogether. Rest in peace EA - post Battlefield 2 / Bad Company. The lack of singleplayer is a negative point for EA, and L.A's extremely well done singleplayer, including a campaign, critically acclaimed Galactic conquest, and instant action give L.A a well-deserved point. 3-0\n\n-MULTIPLAYER\nEA get a point by default, as L.A's multiplayer was decommisioned a while back. While i deducted a point from EA for not having a singleplayer, i will not do so with L.A for the lack of multiplayer as, a) there was once upon a time, and b) the expansive singleplayer more than makes up for it. There are dozens of singleplayer only games and L.A's Battlefront is one of the best. 3-1 to L.A.\n\n-MOD SUPPORT\nTime has been of L.A's side, with multitudes of mods being released, a lot of them can be considered as unofficial expansions. A conversion pack has been developed, adding the favourite instant action maps from L.A's 1st Battlefront. Who doesn't like free additional content. 4-1 to L.A.\n\n-PRICE\nL.A's Battlefront is $15 on steam (I got my copy on special for $5). Fair enough for an old game. EA's is around $80. L.A's has a LOT more content, + mods such as the conversion pack. 1/5 of the price for (in my opinion) a much better game. 5-1.\n\n-ACCESSABILITY\nI can run L.A's Battlefront with 128 bots, maxed settings, easily over 60 fps, on my laptop. While L.A's Battlefront is only available on steam, Xbox + Xbox 360, and PS2, EA's is only available on the newer platforms (so tough luck for fellow laptop users). Also, for console users, EA's is multiplayer only (effectively) so hooray for online costs. Close battle, but point to L.A. 6-1.\n\nOVERRALL\nIf this was a football match, L.A's Battlefront would be Barcelona, and EA's would be Norwich. EA has yet again disappointed with its money-mongering and lack of singleplayer ability. I'm pretty sure EA have just produced the 1st clickbait-like game, not sure why they didn't call it Battlefield: Star Wars and save the royalty costs. Congrats to L.A's Battlefront for beating a game 10 years newer,","December 8, 2015","true","15.4"," 132 of 142 people (93%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","93","132","142","40","7"

I wish that EA had not become the monster that controls the gaming world. I wish we could go back in time when you would buy an entire game upfront for one price. Or when you could play alone and escape the competitive moshpit of DICE/CoD games.\n\nMy heart was broken when I played BattlefieldDICE... Like when my dog died but with more anger and resentment, even a little depression cause I'm passionate about the gaming life and it seems that only corruption remains in the industry. How do we get people to pay us more for our game? If i wanted graphics I would watch a movie.\n\nBF2 is the last battlefront ever made in my eyes. It's a good game made by people who really put love into the game and considered what other people might think is fun. Pandemic Studios was defunct by EA in 2009 and I will never forget or forgive that mistake.","November 20, 2015","true","80.7"," 141 of 155 people (91%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","91","141","155","22","6"

It was fun, it had good gameplay, the story was alright, and the multiplayer was very fun. This was until June of 2014. That was when the multiplayer shut down, and I haven't played it since. Don't get me wrong, the game is still brilliant with all of its moddable content, but the multiplayer was the main focus from the get go. There are still servers on GameRangers and other places like that, but the connection and people just aren't the same, because the connection was never as good and there aren't as many people on the servers.. If you're willing to pay $10 and deal with the horrible pings from those companies, then go right ahead.

I have played many Star Wars games on different consoles and the PC and trust me when I say that this game is fun.  It is best played with friends, because you will have a lot of fun fighting with them for control of whatever planet you are on.  The campaign is OK, not outstanding, but not bad.  The missions are a bit short, but they can be fun even if you have played them a bunch of times.  You are rewarded for your work on single player with various abilities and weapons if you can reach "Legendary" status, which means you have got the medal 64 times.  You can get way overpowered weapons once you get "Legendary" on some challenges, but remember these only apply to single player games, not online.  The AI on normal is a bit dumb at some points, but the Elite setting is more challenging, but not impossible.  I would say overall it is 8.5 out of 10, but I would buy this game over and over.","December 3, 2013","true","29.7"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","44","47","0","0"

I also played some multiplayer with GameRanger. I now think I can wright a review for this game.\n\nWe will start with the pros and cons\n\nPros:\n-Surprisingly fun campaign: you play as the 501st clone division and soon become Vader's Fist. You play in a bunch of the iconic battles from the original series and the prequels.\n\n-All four armies: in this game you get to play as either the clones vs. the separatists (Robots) or the Rebels vs. the Empire\n\n-A lot of Heroes: you get to play as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, etc... There is almost a different hero for a different map.\n\n-Fluent controls: the controls in this game are smooth and it feels good when you shoot a rebel scum in the face with your E-11.\n\n-Space battles: The fact that this game had space battles where you can land on the other team’s ship and destroy it from the inside was ahead of its time and no other games captures space battles like this one. There are also different ships for different occasions like there is an x-wing for destroying regular enemies and y--wings to bomb their cruiser.\n\n-A lot of maps: There is a bunch of maps in this game like Endor, Hoth, Geonosis, and much more.\n\n-64 player battles: This is self explanatory\n\n-Modable: If you pair this game with mods you can have an even better time with this game and if add all the user made maps with the ones in this game, there are over 800 maps for this game!!!\n\nCons:\n\n-Aging: This game is 10 years old and there aren't too many people playing this game on Game Ranger. The graphics are out of date and sadly Pandemic studios went out of business in 2009.\n\nThat's about all the cons\n\nOverall:\nStar Wars Battlefront 2 is one of the greatest Star Wars games ever made and in my opinion, It is one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nThis game gets a 9/10. I highly recommend this game to any shooter fan and every Star Wars fan alike.\n\nI hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading!!!\n\nGame Ranger download for multiplayer: https://www.gameranger.com/","December 20, 2015","true","31.5"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","39","40","3","4"

I got it 10 years ago the day it came out on PS2, now just got it on PC in the summer sale and still has to be the most fun and best game I ever played. I hope the new battlefront though is as good as this one, (2015) release date. The campaign is OK, not outstanding, but not bad. Though the campaign is roughly 6 hours long, Galactic Conquest is what most people will enjoy. This game is wonderful. The graphics are beautiful even to this day and the environments are very inspiring. Every Star Wars fan should check this one out. You can either do 1st or 3rd person shooting which is really nice and most shooter games don't give you that option, unfortunately. 3rd person is one its key characteristics and I hope Dice and EA implement it into the new game coming out along with the new movie. The difficulty of this game isn't really too bad at all, it only picks up in the last 3 or 4 missions. So frustrating, but again, it's amazing because I felt the struggles the Troopers felt going up against the rebel scum. It wasn't a walk in the park and the developers make you feel it. That's something I personally don't get from games like Halo or CoD. Though I have nothing against these games) If you are a fan of the way those shooters work, you will definitely enjoy this. Very well done and it's very compelling really. If you like Rogue Squadron, then you will like the way these ships fly, to say the least. This game is just a blast for any Star Wars fans, or FPS fans in general. It has a very nice story if you are a fan of Star Wars or just want to get deeper into the universe. I just really enjoy this game and truly can't find a downside unless a story line is a big deal to you. I was never really disappointed with this game, the Campaign was very enjoyable (and a bit challenging at times) but a little short and the maps are very fun to play on and has huge variety (From the snowy landscape of Hoth to the murky Swaps of Dagobah).This game is one of the best games I have ever played and the multiplayer is my favorite part which by the way is still there. I don't know why people are complaining about the online multiplayer, yes it was run by GAMESPY, and yes they did shutdown; but there is still DEDICATED SERVERS that you can go and play on if you want multiplayer action, and you can still HOST games and have friends join your server; you can also use Gameranger and join through there as well. The space combat is just how I remembered it fun and very unique in there being different ways to approach and destroy your opponent's ship. This game is a masterpiece of its time and deserves to be in your game library. (Hopefully with hours played on it :)\nI give it a 10/10 for being one of the best and really only good Star wars game out there.","December 31, 2014","true","136.1"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","27","29","3","2"

I would also suggest buying this game so that you can really see how far the series has come when dice releases their battlefront.

It was the PS2 version, and I remember being blown away by what you could do in the game. Flying Tie fighters, riding a Tauntaun, delivery the force choke to lightsaber insta-kill with Darth Vader on Mos Eisley, and of course Hoth on conquest. If it was in the movies, you could do it in this game. What made this game so awesome was that every player could find a class, or role that worked for them. Everyone working towards the same goal of capturing the command posts. Support roles were important, not everyone had to be an all star FPS player to help the team. Well it's been 10 years, how has the game aged? Gamespy is no more, and playing online now requires VPN, or a third party solution for games over the internet. But this game still rocks the LAN party. The specs to run SWBF2 are so minimal it can run on almost any PC (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). Its just as fun as it was back then, and even appeals to the younger audience as well. My son who is 7 will ask to play this more than any other game in our Steam library. The game also supports full controller. It's listed as partial controller support by Steam, but I was able to map all the functions I needed to play without using a keyboard or Xpadder. With the release of SWBF3 I have to admit I'm disappointed to hear the class system is gone, space battles are gone, the campaign is gone, and the only way to play with another human being is to use an EA server. So again did SWBF2 age well? The answer is yes, and one thing is certain. Long after EA kills the servers for SWBF3, you'll still find a dedicated group playing SWBF2  online.\n\nOLDER GAMER APPROVED\nPOTATO PC CERTIFIED\nVisit our Currator Page","November 17, 2015","true","15.3"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","27","33","4","1"

Lower your expectations for the series reboot that took all the stuff you loved about the original games and threw all that s*** out of the window to make a battlefield game with a star wars skin."\n\n-Honest Game trailers, referencing Battlefront EA\n\nSeriously, if you want a real star wars game, buy Battlefront II. I'm pretty sure that the only better things the new game has is decent graphics and sound effects. Other than that, it's battlefield : stars wars edition (I'm not saying that battlefield is bad nor Battlefront.). And if you want some good graphics, go watch the movies, I'm pretty sure that even the movies has more content than the new game.

It lives up to the title. In huge battles, you can pick up from many types of troopers, after you picked a side. The variety makes the battles explosive, therefore you have the chance to play through the thrill you had while you saw the good action parts of the movies. Also, it's rewarding for fans and acknoledging for newcomers to play this game. Fun is the word I use to describe this game. No bugs, big battles, many troops, many weapons, and great heroes and villans are at your disposle. The graphics may be dated, but they are detailed enough for you to enjoy what it provides and at this price, it's a real bargain.

Well, let me answer you with the reasons SWBFII tends to be the only FPS game I will play with my friends on a regular basis. Let me start with the single player. As much as FPS games are not the best for their story, SWBFII takes it away with the story of the 501st throughout the Star Wars universe with objectives that can tend to be more than just "Take this point" or "Kill this person" as you would see in any other FPS. From the tutorial until the last mission in game, the story objectives will either frustrate you (*Cough* Order 66 *cough*) or make you beg for more. Then there's galactic conquest, which is outside the campaign itself. This lets you control the republic, CIS, rebel alliance or empire and go through different planets, taking them over to fuel your empire while you research upgrades and troops to use. Next, the troops you choose. Every class has the same equivalent on the opposing team EXCEPT for the special troops (Dark Trooper, Clone Commander, Imp Officer, Wookiee, Bothan, Jet Trooper, Magnaguard and the rolling droids, don't remember what they're called). Each side has a heavy-weapons guy, a medic/engineer, a soldier and a sniper as well as two specials which I listed. Next, multiplayer, it's much more organized and less of a cluster than CoD. Melee is non-existent and it's rather equal in terms of game-play... not in terms of skill. The modes are much more organized between CTF-1 (one flag both sides fight to capture), CTF-2 (Classic Capture the Flag), Regular (until reinforcements run out), assault (First to get certain score wins) and so on. Next thing I like are the heroes, If you have them enabled in multiplayer, you can easily destroy a team... if not focused... which always happens. Otherwise, great first-person shooter. That if you choose can be third-person as well. A buy well worth the money.","October 8, 2014","true","15.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Really old game, one of the games I played on my original XBox and enjoyed for years (until Star Wars Battlefront I + II were both scratched into unusableness). They play well and give you the option of 3rd and 1st player. Playing Vanilla is fun, but nowhere near as much fun as with mods, particularly the Battlefront Extreme (pretty sure it's Extreme) mod which adds a ton of new maps, classes and vehicles for all factions. Setting up a private game is super easy, taking only a GameSpy account and a few minutes, and bam, you have a highly customizable private (or public) game with maps and classes from mods (or a vanilla game should you so desire). You can have an hour long fight, where you can fight over a thousand enemies (changable before you launch your singleplayer or multiplayer game), or a quick 4v4 skirmish with less than a hundred reinforcements for both sides. You can also have a dog fight in space, using a range of Interceptor class fighters to Dropships, you can knock out your advesary's vital ship components or land your boarding party in their hangar and wipe them out from the inside. Because it's such an old game, you shouldn't expect much in terms of visuals but for how old it is, it's pretty good. The low price is also awesome, being only at $10. It may just be the fond memories I have of this game and it's predecessor, but I'd give it a 8.5/10.","April 16, 2014","true","58.5"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

As of July 2014 Multi-player was removed from this title but the singleplayer still provides hours of entertainment. What Battlefront 2 lacks behind in graphics it makes up with stunning gameplay. There is a variety of singleplayer gamemodes such as Instant Action, Campaign Mode and Galactic Conquest. Galactic Conquest is by far my favourite with it being much like a Star Wars edition of risk in where you command your space fleet across the galaxy defeating your opponent in both space battles and invading or defending a planet from a wave of attacks. However the campaign of this game is very short, easy and not the most entertaining with it only being about 2 hours long at most.\n\nOne of the best features about game is the ability to control your factions heroes from Mace Windu to Han Solo to Darth Vader. You can help your teammates on the battlefield (Droids, Stormtroopers, Rebels etc.) defeat their enemy with the power of a lightsaber or a scoundrel like Han (Who shot first!)\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is the lack of multiplayer, the graphics of this game are not the greatest but the game is still perfectly playable and will still provide hours of entertainment.\n\nIn conclusion this game is worth the £6.99 (Time of Review Price) and any Star Wars fan should pick this game up!","September 24, 2014","true","72.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

You're forced to download as mod.\n\n-No more the "yellow" faction: As you've read before, the removal of the Dune Sea, there are no more 3rd faction such Tusken Raiders, Gungan and such. Although there's hunt mode, this doesn't change that the game has became quite restricted.\n\n-No additional factions:  It's the same thing, really. They added 1 special class and re assigned some weapons but the factions are the same: Republic with Clonetroopers (Added the Commando clone with a gatling gun as seen in Mygeeto cutscene), CSI with the droids (Added the MagnaGuard as seen as Grievous's bodyguards but instead of electric metal pole, they've given a rocket gun), Empire with stormtrooper (Added the Imperial Officer with a soundblast gun), Rebels with the Bothan Spy (As also mentioned in Episode VI, they carry incinerator, cloak device and timebomb).  You can all fix this by downloading mods provided by the community.\n\nYou should play the campaign mode too! It has much of feels from the troopers of the 501st\n\nRegardless of all, it's a beautiful game worth to play. I've been playing it for years in my ps2 and now getting re addicted with pc version.

The first time I played Star Wars Battlefront II I was amazed by everything it has to offer. The game offers various maps based mosty off the prequel movies, but their are still a few sequel maps to play on. The game allows the player to switch between the Clone Wars and the Galactic Rebelion for every map. Every map comes with the gamemode "Conquest". Conquest is a game mode when both sides are fighting for command post to dominate the other side's  reinforcments. After the player has reached a certain amount of points, he or she can play was various characters in the movie like Obi-Wan and Darth Maul. Although, if you are playing with all NPC's the game is almost very easy and it won't take long before you reach a special character. Luckily Star Wars Battlefront II adds multiplayer and a ton of server to join. Sadly the community isn't as big as it might have used to be. You'll still be able to find a server with a good amount of people though. I have played this game a lot of times with my friends online and we all enjoyed the experience. Another cool thing about the game is that also include space combat when two sides try to take down the other's defences. The graphics are now lacking to today's standards but it's still fits the atmosphere of Star Wars. If you are a fan of Star Wars, this is a must have.","December 8, 2013","true","36.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

After Team Fortress 2, and dabbling in many other shooter games, it's still solidly second despite being nearly ten years old.  Its age does make it difficult to recommend to people who are both not Star Wars fans or have not played the game before, but if you are a Star Wars fan or have fond memories of playing this game in the past, you should definitely pick it up without hesitation.  It's aged tremendously well, and until (or to those of us who have heard about it being canceled and restarted numerous times, unless) the new Battlefront comes out, there is no other game like it.\n\nOh, but before buying, you may want to make sure you have a good amount of friends to play alongside with, because multiplayer is where this game really shines (naturally).  And you especially want to make sure you have friends who are close by, since the online multiplayer's going down on May 31st, 2014.","May 5, 2014","true","1.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

These maps can be either huge or small with many turns, corridors, and corners, or big open fields, with vehicles and infantry squads battling to take control of the planet.\n\nThe space battles are epic! The fact that you can get into 5 types of starfighters from the movies, and shoot down the other enemy command ship is really fun. And you can also land inside the enemie's command ship to take out some of its critical components such as the engine cooler, life support system, and shields.\n\nIf you get a lot of points, the game will reward you by letting you play as a jedi. Jedis can use their lightsabers to slice through units and their force powers to crush them.\n\nYou can also switch from a 3rd person view to a 1st person view at any moment in the game to suit your style.\n\nThe game also offers a campaign mode, following the story of a trooper in Anakin Skywalker's squad, which tells you about the story from order 66, to between episodes III and IV, and after episode IV.\n\nI really enjoyed this game and I recommend this fantastic game to any Star Wars fan, and any action fan. 9.5/10 if Star Wars fan, 9 or 8.5/10 if action fan.

YES, if you see this game, and are THINKING about getting it, STOP, click BUY, and thank me later!! ... you wont be dissapointed.\n\nEspecially if you're a Star Wars fan, but, if your a Star Wars, and you dont have this game, theres something wrong with you.\n\nMay I also mention that this game got me to make this review, thats something right? ...\n\n5 out of 5 Disembembered Droidekas\n\n","December 27, 2013","true","43.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Even if you're not into Star Wars - this game is really fun and recommended to play for family & friends. Although I didn't have this for Steam at the time, I soaked in thousands of hours in this game with It's modding capabilities.\n\nLol, and yeah - about the new Star Wars Battlefront by EA/DICE - Although their game looks well done, there are very serious flaws. This old gem actually offers a WHOLE LOT more than their game with the cost of moderate graphics and It's old gameplay.\n\nHere in SWBFII, you have:\n\n- The Clone Wars (Seriously guys, the Clones are better than Stormtroopers...)\n- Space Battles\n- 64 players, 32v32 - Including Multiplayer\n- Playing as Wookies, Ewoks and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ inhabitants!\n- Modding capabilities! That itself is like a HUGE ♥♥♥ DLC that will extend your game time with this old gem. All of it ranges from Space to Ground Battles to all the way to Zombies!\n- TONS of Maps. With modding capabilities, that alone can crash your game due to It's massive content.\n\nSounds awesome, right? Well, let's take a look at EA's new Star Wars Battlefront. I mean, I'm not saying I won't play it, I definitely will - however It is a big letdown.\n\n- 40 players only? You gotta be ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me.\n- No Space Battles? Well, that's HALF of Star Wars sliced down already. If not, most.\n- No Clone Wars either. What the ♥♥♥♥ guys? Seriously, Stormtroopers are ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So are the Rebels. If you pair a Clone against a Stormtrooper in a damn wrestle, I'd bet $30 the Clone would rip apart the Stormtrooper. Like, even the ♥♥♥♥ing Droids are better than them.\n\n- Barely any maps. Like 5-6 only, and the only map that looks worth playing is Hoth. That's another slice of Star Wars cut down.\n- Survival Mode... Oh my ♥♥♥♥ING GOD. If you two as Rebels manage to kill an entire ♥♥♥♥ing army of Imperials, it just makes them look even MORE pathetic than they actually are. Two or four people against an entire battalion of Stormtroopers and they would STILL lose.  LOL!\n\nThere's really only ONE good factor about this upcoming game.\n\n- Beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay, lots of detail into literally everything.\n\nAlright, time to stop nerding out, but all in all - this game is worth the $10 and even better on sale.

The game is from 2005, so there can only be so much, but what is there is amazing. The gameplay is good, the story is good, the level design is good. But there just isn't enough. Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend it, but there is not much to go off of. The thing that really makes the game, is mods, which the community loves, and therfore will hold your hand in installing them.\n\nIn the end, Star Wars Battlefront 2 is a great star wars game, and a good game. But get mods though, if you don't, the experience is going to get dry after about 8 or 9 hours.\n\nOh, and also, you can get multiplayer through 3rd party programs, I go with Game Ranger, great support. Don't worry though, you're not missing out on much if you don't play multiplayer, I never had much fun with it, and all the people who did played it to death, and they are really good. They'll rip out your ♥♥♥, suck on your hemroids like lolly pops, and trust me when I say this, not a pretty picture.\n\nGood value for $10, and one of the best Star Wars games ever made, and the best with mods.","October 25, 2014","true","36.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","12","15","3","0"

First time I got my hands onto this game, almost everyday was powering on my PS2 just to play this classic either solo or with my bros. Massive land-based battles, space battles, hero mode, campaign, and galactic conquest ate up most of my free time. There was no doubt that this was the best Star Wars game ever made, and if not one of the best games I had ever played.\n\n3 years ago...\n\nA new Battlefront game for the next gen was officially announced. Finally! I could look forward to re-living my childhood, but with some new twists. As more gameplay trailers were released as time went on, my hype kept building up, awaiting to be satisfied on the day of release.\n\n2 months ago...\n\nI finally got my hands on the new Battlefront. I powered up my PS4 in excitement, hands held firmly on the controller, expecting to satisfy all the built up hype that was stored for 3 years, and entirely focused on what I expected to bring back happy memories. As I pressed start on the title screen, the first thing I was supposed to do was to create an EA account. After 5-10 minutes of restless anticipation, I finally started playing singleplayer. Indeed, I had quite a blast on singleplayer, but there was still loads of hype that needed to be satisfied. That's when I started playing all the modes on multiplayer. Overall, I had an enjoyable experience on this next gen Battlefront, but unfortunately, all the built up hype still wasn't quite satisfied. In fact, this EA remake of the beloved Battlefront I grew up with didn't live up to all the childhood memories that I had been expecting to re-live.\n\nToday...\n\nSince my good old PS2 had been out of commission for over 2 years, I decided to bring back my childhood (Which EA Battelfront failed to do) by downloading the original masterpiece from Steam. To this day, it still holds it's title as the best Star Wars game ever made.\n\nI couldn't recommend this game enough to any Star Wars fan alike, let alone to any gamer in general. If you grew up with this game and are wanting to bring back pleasant memeories, put it in your Steam library now! If you still haven't played this masterpiece yet, please don't hesitate to give it a shot, especially while it's on sale.","January 1","true","22.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

Sounds simple right? Along the way your enemies be it online or in campaign have their own infantry moving towards you, vehicles of all sorts (I'm not a Star Wars fan so forgive me here), and a walker (?) thing you can jettison. I honestly love the depth of being able to fight on a planet or in the orbit of a planet.\n\nI'm not a 100% what the heck is going on in the story as I've never watched Star Wars but hey, as a first timer playing the game I can get into it.\n\nIf you are able to get through the out-dated graphics you're in for a hell of a game. .... oh and one more thing to add a bit of complication to your life.

It stands up tall alongside popular series like CoD and Battlefield, and provides a similar experience fine-tuned to anyone who loves glowstick swords and laser beam guns.  The atmosphere is great and nothing captures the feeling of playing a Jedi or a Stormtrooper on the battlefield better.  The vanilla game has plenty of content, but what really makes this title shine is the rich tapestry of mods and extra user-created maps that have been contributed over the past nine years.  That said, it's absolutely necessary to play the game with the Conversion Pack and Battlefront Extreme if you want the best experience possible.  There are also a bunch of great maps and mods to be found in the Community Hub here on Steam as well as on Filefront, so it's worth a look if you find something you like.\n\nDon't get too excited yet though, while it's a great game, I can tell you it hasn't aged amazingly.  The classes are noticeably unbalanced and there are glaring glitches present(one involving the infamous issue of the game crashing when Stereo Mix isn't enabled).  The servers aren't densely populated anymore and there are usually only one or two with around 40 players.

This is a fantastic game, I love it and it brings back childhood memories. I played this soooo much on the Playstation 2 and then when I moved to PC gaming and saw it on steam I had to get it. It was the first ever game I got and I am still not bored of it. There are so many things you can do on it from playing campaign, online, galactic conquest, instant action, modding, and much more. It is even worth the price it costs unlike... Star Wars Battlefront EA and I have tried it, trust me, that game is not even worth the money it costs. EA and DICE are just a money grabbing company and don't give a crap about you or the game. They don't even care about their employees as they under pay them.","January 14","true","326.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","10","13","5","0"

I played this game so much the disk wore out, just like I did the first one, and if you liked that then this is a no brainer.  It works as it should for keyboard and mouse, but also supports controllers, but you'll need to program each and every class individually, long setup, but worth it, though you'll still have to use the mouse during class selection, and the keyboard to talk.  A third person shooter at heart, the first person was added exclusively for pc gaming at  one point, so if you're worried it hasn't aged well, don't.  Allthough it ain't the prettiest thing out there, it's still got a decent player base and most of the models and textures are more than tolerable.  First person isn't bad either, though it does look quite a bit more dated than the third person models, it gets the job done, and it's still better than system shock 2's original fps models, no worries there. Allthough there's a lot of complaints of allied and enemy A.I. you mostly won't notice it at all because you'll be dying and killing so much.  You'll have the odd glaringly bad A.I. every so often, but you won't mind it at all if you decide to hit the multiplayer servers!  If you like third person shooters, first person shooters, online multiplayer, varied maps, engaging (albiet repetitive in long doses),  and starwars, this game is for you.   In fact if any of those reasons by themselves should merit a purchase, especially at the low price of 5.00$ it winds up being during most sales, and with the NEW starwars battlefront coming later next year, you'll be wanting to hone your skills again.  So pick up your blaster, polish your best suit of white armor, and strap in, it's gonna be a fun ride through the past.","January 10, 2014","true","9.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Sure not everything is perfect, But the fact that you can play as a storm trooper and drive a AT-AT just makes up for everything. It's like you're a kid again and watching starwars... Accept now you're that stormtrooper that can't hit a barn door. I rarely play the Mission stuff. The Skirmish is just endless fun, You can play Basicly any battle that was in the movie's.. And don't worry Luca's didn't edit this game.. So It's still awesome. You have a choice between the galactic civil war and the clone wars, Their is a huge variety of maps and gamemodes. You can ever battle is SPACE! Board the enemy cruiser and destroy it from the inside. You can also switch between Third and First person views. I played this so much when I was younger and I can still play it today and have just as much fun. I would recommend this game to any friend who has seen starwars or even hasn't. 10/10 Because you can play as a storm trooper. Oh and yes you can play as Boba Fett, Darth vader etc...","May 1, 2014","true","53.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

From there you are given different missions that start in the Clone Wars. Order 66 is given and you witness the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire and then the fall of the Empire. all of this while still a member of the 501st. The missions are straight forward and objectives are given one right after the other. Some are easier than others but over all, not bad. The only thing I would have changed is some of the space missions, but space missions are optional. Overall 9/10\n\nGRAPHICS AND THINGS OF THE LIKENESS\n\nGameplay is pretty smooth. I personally never had any issues, but that may be because of my pc. My pc isn't the best but it runs pretty good for me. No lag, fast loading. I have no complaints. Graphics wise, it's not that bad for a 10 year old game. It has that old game feel that makes you nostalgic. A somewhat blocky appearence to the maps but thats to be expected. The characters look very smooth for their time, not extremely blocky but not completely smooth, but like I said; Smooth for their time. Overall 9/10\n\nREPLAY VALUE\n\nThere are a few different game modes that I'm going to mention. First, and my personal favorite, Galactic Conquest. This is a turn based mode. You can play as any of the sides in the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. You take turns moving your fleet across a small galaxy, conquering the galaxy. You win when you have control of all star systems and elliminated all enemy fleets. This mode can be played 4 times before you start repeating. It's completely random which adds more to the fun. the only thing I don't like about this mode is the number of troops that you have in a fleet. 150 points to win on land and you need to score 180 points in space. The number of points you get for completeing "objectives" is a lot for the win point to be 150 or 180. So for that I give 7/10.\nThe other mode is Instant Action. Pretty straight forward. you can make your own map list and when you hit launch, it goes through all the maps in your list. It also allows you to edit some settings like the number of points you need to win, number of troops on land battles, how often special characters show up, and more. This is where I have the most fun because I can make a map list that will be exactly how I want it. Only complaint is you can't play both Clone Wars and Galactic Civil War on all maps. Some maps are exclusive to one era. for that 8/10. Overall for replay value I would give 8/10","June 22, 2014","true","86.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/6060/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nStar Wars Battlefront II was a first/third person shooter released to the PlayStation2, Xbox, and PC November 1, 2005 (Reference, Steam Store). The reason I state this is because "prepare yourself for PS2 and Xbox Generation Graphics.\nThe game plays like a capture the flag, base control, skirmish first/third person shooter game. Recently multiplayer was lost because of GameSpy's shut down, however there are ways within the community to bring back the multiplayer features. (check out the forums, Steam or Reddit)\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  In the game you can play part of the story by playing Campaign Mode, "A shadow looms over the Republic. The Clone Wars have torn a rift across the Galaxy, its populace weak in allegiance and resolve." Basically you play the game as a member of the 501st Legion, Get used to hearing that, the clones will be sure to remind you every time you have a cut screen.\nYou play from the Geonosis Attack, (seen in Star Wars episode 2), fight on Kashyyyk, Corescant Jedi Temple, Kamino, The Death Star Hoth, and a number of other locations seen in the Star Wars universe.\n\n(Having a star wars nerd moment, ignore if you don't care about the Expanded star wars universe)\nI do need to highlight a problem with the lore, the Clones received genetic alterations that made them age much faster than usual human beings, twice as fast to be precise. A clone surviving from the battle on Geonosis would most likely die of old age before ever reaching Hoth.\nGeonosis took place 22 BBY, Hoth 3 ABY, Most of the clones where in their 20's and 30's at the battle of Geonosis, so we're talking 60 to 70 year old cone troopers. But I digress, if you find this type of lore interesting I recommend checking out the Republic Commando books, I've read a great deal from them, I enjoy the Mandalorian back-story to the clone troopers.\n(End of Expanded Universe Rant)\n\nGame Play: The game controls like a standard first/third person shooter, the reason I refer to it as first/third is that you can change which mode you're playing with the options, I really liked playing in first person because the assault rifles would have scopes then. But to be honest third is probably a better way to play (you can see more).\nI've never played any other Battlefront games but I assume they all have very similar controls, in this one you can jump, roll, crouch, and sprint. Sprinting and rolling require stamina to use. Each class has its own different set of abilities, skills, and tactics.\nThere are two categories: Land classes and space classes. You can have space battles in this game. I'll stick to the land classes to give an idea of the diversity in classes: Trooper, Heavy Weapons, Sniper, Engineer, Clone commander (special class 1), Jet trooper (special class 2). the special classes change based on which faction you're playing as, you can play as the Republic, CIS, Empire, or Rebel Alliance. There are also heroes in the game, so you can get in on some awesome lightsaber massacre action.\nIn addition to classes, there are various game modes, you can play a command and conquer style game called "conquest" you can play through the campaign, you can simple play a sequence of matches against NPC's set to regular or elite difficulty (I generally just played offline matches against npc's).\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for this game.\n\nPrice: Star Wars Battlefront II $9.99, I recommend waiting for a sale, this is a very old game, and you can take your time on waiting for a great sale. I believe I purchased my copy at 75-90% off.\nThe number of hours shown on steam is a little bit deceptive, I might only have 15 hours at this point, but I first played this game on the Playstation2, I loved it enough to buy it on steam, but it wouldn't load on my computer until I installed Windows7. So I've easily spent double that time or more.  Additionally I do intend to play it more, it's one of those games where it's nostalgic value to me is high.\n\nConclusion: Remember this is an older game, wait for a sale, probably should be a star wars fan to enjoy it, multiplayer requires downloading third party software or you can just play against npc's. If you don't have a problem with anything I've listed, suit up trooper, the Battle awaits you! I recommend this game.","December 6, 2014","true","15.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

(Don't get the first game though, it stinks.)\n\nEdit: I look back on this, and realise that, this game is not perfect by any means. Sure, it is amazing, but it is not perfect, I recommend adding mods to the game, they are simple to install, just check out some guides here on Steam. Mods can add new eras, maps, weaponry, and classes to the game, all for free.\n\nAnd I withdrawl my statement on the first game, it's not bad at all.","November 27, 2013","true","80.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

You can choose from four classes including infantry and sniper, including special hero characters like Luke,Vadar, Windu etc. One of the best maps is Hoth, where you can defend the base against the galactic empire and use snowspeeders to take down AT-AT's. Overall a great tactical game with new maps and options that rivals the original. 84%","June 10, 2014","true","6.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

People need to get this game before it goes back up to its original price of £49.99, the game has no flaws and I am unable to find even one thing wrong with it, I am still shocked by the fact that this game hasnt won every gaming award out there. The graphics are easily 10/10, Battlefield and Crysis on the highest graphics have nothing on this beast. The sound is something out of this planet, the beautifully orchestrated music and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic sound effects are truely amazing 10/10. The final and greatest thing about this game is the fact that the voice acting is truly in a league of its own, all voices are perfectly alligned with the characters lips and the original voice actors are all used for there characters. Truly a perfect and pure game, if you dont own such a masterpiece then you are easily brain dead or inbred.","May 3, 2014","true","45.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"

On game pad it works great.\n\nThe one issue i have with this game is one-sided the AI is.

I'll leave it as that.\nPros:\n-The textures and models aged beautifully, and hold up well to this day, even rivialling the 2015 remake.\n-The campaign and Galactic Conquest are always fun, and propose a brand new layer of depth to the game.\n-No DLC ♥♥♥♥.\n-Controls are responsive, and make you feel like you're actually in the movie.\nCons:\n-Some of the faces look off, but this is a minor complaint, since they still look good and this was 2005 standards.\n-Lock on doesn't really lock on the target.\n-Space controls are really strange compared to console. This is once again a minor complaint, since controls can be changed, and plugging in an X-Box or Steam controller can fix this.\n\nOverview: The game is beautiful, vehicle combat is amazing, and a vast amount of heroes and maps make this game from ten years ago better than the one we have today. This game is a definite buy. If there's a sale, snag this game, because it's perfect for any Star Wars fan.

Battlefront II builds upon the already successful and fun capture-the-point aspect of battlefront I but adds an element of chaos with the addition of new vehicles, soldier type, and Jedi. The standard team versus team battles are fun and engaging. It is perfectly timed to let you have fun and explore new ways of winning but does not make the game feel tedious. Jedi versus Jedi mode offers new fun to the classic capture-the-point game type. The extra speed and abilities of Jedi's makes this game mode fast pace and exciting. With the ability to sprint at super speed, jump to higher length, and duel other players, Jedi versus Jedi mode is one of the most addicting and fun game types there is. Not to mention the space battles, which are very well done. The games offers enough control to the player where one needs to slow down, aim, and shoot to destroy the opponent's battle cruiser but leaves enough freedom where the players can achieve victory through different means. Overall, this game is a classic of the PS2 era and I would recommend everyone who likes a casual, action packed game.\n\nMay the force be with you","September 22, 2014","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Is it worth $10?  Yeah, I'd say so.  The graphics look good for 10 years ago.  The gameplay itself is fairly arcadey and simplistic (there are no unlocks, really), but the maps are fun to play.  On the whole, I find it to be an enjoyable casual shooter for offline play, particularly in the Galactic Conquest mode.\n\nAlso of note, here are things this ten-year-old version of Battlefront has that the new EA/DICE version does not:\n\n- A $10 price tag (less if you get it on sale).\n- An actual space mode, which also lets you attempt to board and sabotage the enemy capital ship.\n- Vehicles that let more than one player ride in them.\n- Spawn points that you can select, instead of randomly appearing on the battlefield.\n- More maps per game mode.\n- Clone Wars Era troopers and maps.\n- Soldier classes with different specific abilities.\n- Single-player offline mode against (admittedly rather dim) bots, where you can play pretty much the full version of the game.\n- A dedicated single-player campaign (although, really, it's just the same maps from multiplayer, with you playing as a member of the 501st with the odd cutscene here and there).\n\nSo, yeah, I'd say this is well worth your money if you just want a casual shoot-em-up to screw around with here and there.  Is it an amazing game to stand the test of time and be lauded for generations to come?  Nah, not really.  It's fun, but it's simple.  On the other hand, that's kind of the appeal.","November 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frannleman/recommended/6060/","frannleman","Frann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frannleman/","32 products in account","Nostalgic is the feeling that you should get when playing this fantastic game. This is the squeal to the famed and fantastic game, Star Wars Battlefront (1). The campaign takes place in the mid-late Clone Wars era. You play as a battle-hardened soldier from the 501st legion (aka Vader's Fist) lead by Jedi Knight/General Anakin Skywalker. The campaign takes you through multiple planets and systems such as: Mygeeto, Kashyyyk,  Felucia, Utapau, Kamino, Hoth, The Death Star and many other planets/battle grounds. Not only can you play as Clone Troopers, Droids, Rebels and Storm Troopers, but you can also play as many different Jedi and Sith. Gameplay wise, you are able to play as 6 Different Classes. These include: Normal Infantry, Heavy, Scout, Engineer, Special class 1, Special class 2 and Jedi/Sith (You will need to unlock these characters through points earned during the battle).\n\nDid I mention you can also use and command a variety of different vehicles? From small AT-RT's to Gigantic AT-AT's, these are only some of the MANY different vehicles that are able to be used. Having multiple tanks on your side can mean a swift victory for you and your team. But what if you are going against them? Well, mines and rockets are always available for your use in demolitions. In this Battlefront, you are also able to participate in space battles. They too, are fantastic and fun to play.\n\nMultiplayer wise, the Game Spy severs for this game have been shut down. Although, don't give up your hope. Third Party hosts such as Game Ranger allow you to host and join servers set up by other people. This can still supply you and your friends with the nostalgia received from this amazing game. Here is the Game Ranger site: http://www.gameranger.com\n\nEven the best games have a few little flaws here and there. A few things I think that should've been included in this game  can include more squad commands. In the previous Battlefront, there were 4 commands. They include; 'Follow Me', 'Move out', 'Hold Position' and 'At Ease'. These squad commands can prove to be extremely helpful for strategically capturing command posts and ultimately, winning battles. It also would've been good if they added commands for star fighters. For example, if you pressed the 'Follow Me' key, the fighter you were looking at would start following you and so on.\n\nAll in all, this game is very fun, balanced and extremely enjoyable for both Star Wars and Non-Star Wars fans alike. I can't wait for the next Battlefront game. If you do at any time, get bored of the same maps, you can always download mods from the Battlefront community. They can supply you and your friends with an endless amount of fun! I'll give this game a 10/10, it's absolutely fabulous! If you are a Star Wars fan and haven't got it yet, buy it immediately!","June 24, 2015","true","82.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The space battles are fun but hard as well just being beautiful even with out dated graphics and they feel like a genuine space simulator and not a stupid rail shooter.\n\nLast but not least; the Jedi battles.

Honestly this is one of the best out-of-box games you can buy. It gives you what you pay for 100%, especially at $10. The nostalgia is a big bonus for me but for any fan of shooters and/or Star Wars, its one of the best. And until the new Battlefront comes out, this is all you have!","April 24, 2015","true","30.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The space battles are fun but hard as well just being beautiful even with out dated graphics and they feel like a genuine space simulator and not a stupid rail shooter.\n\nLast but not least; the Jedi battles. Never in my life have I had this much fun with a lightsaber; not as a kid with toy, not as a teen with other Star Wars games and not with any other sword battle game; EVER! Whether you're in a normal ground battle literally ripping though squad after squad of droids or in the Heroes Vs Villians mode on Mos Eisley. It is in everyway the just stupid, dumb, amazing fun!\n\nNegatives:\n\nThere are only a couple reasons why this game is not as amazing (and perfect) as it's predicessor; one is the squad commands being missing for no reason and the other is the maps are not nearly as good as the original.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\n9.5/10 Amazing game, why have you not bought it yet?","January 10, 2014","true","15.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frannleman/recommended/6060/","frannleman","Frann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frannleman/","32 products in account","Nostalgic is the feeling that you should get when playing this fantastic game. This is the squeal to the famed and fantastic game, Star Wars Battlefront (1). The campaign takes place in the mid-late Clone Wars era. You play as a battle-hardened soldier from the 501st legion (aka Vader's Fist) lead by Jedi Knight/General Anakin Skywalker. The campaign takes you through multiple planets and systems such as: Mygeeto, Kashyyyk,  Felucia, Utapau, Kamino, Hoth, The Death Star and many other planets/battle grounds. Not only can you play as Clone Troopers, Droids, Rebels and Storm Troopers, but you can also play as many different Jedi and Sith. Gameplay wise, you are able to play as 6 Different Classes. These include: Normal Infantry, Heavy, Scout, Engineer, Special class 1, Special class 2 and Jedi/Sith (You will need to unlock these characters through points earned during the battle).\n\nDid I mention you can also use and command a variety of different vehicles? From small AT-RT's to Gigantic AT-AT's, these are only some of the MANY different vehicles that are able to be used. Having multiple tanks on your side can mean a swift victory for you and your team. But what if you are going against them? Well, mines and rockets are always available for your use in demolitions. In this Battlefront, you are also able to participate in space battles. They too, are fantastic and fun to play.\n\nMultiplayer wise, the Game Spy severs for this game have been shut down. Although, don't give up your hope. Third Party hosts such as Game Ranger allow you to host and join servers set up by other people. This can still supply you and your friends with the nostalgia received from this amazing game. Here is the Game Ranger site: http://www.gameranger.com\n\nEven the best games have a few little flaws here and there. A few things I think that should've been included in this game  can include more squad commands. In the previous Battlefront, there were 4 commands. They include; 'Follow Me', 'Move out', 'Hold Position' and 'At Ease'. These squad commands can prove to be extremely helpful for strategically capturing command posts and ultimately, winning battles. It also would've been good if they added commands for star fighters. For example, if you pressed the 'Follow Me' key, the fighter you were looking at would start following you and so on.\n\nAll in all, this game is very fun, balanced and extremely enjoyable for both Star Wars and Non-Star Wars fans alike. I can't wait for the next Battlefront game. If you do at any time, get bored of the same maps, you can always download mods from the Battlefront community. They can supply you and your friends with an endless amount of fun! I'll give this game a 10/10, it's absolutely fabulous! If you are a Star Wars fan and haven't got it yet, buy it immediately!","June 24, 2015","true","82.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrspigtastic/recommended/6060/","mrspigtastic","Nebula_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrspigtastic/","198 products in account",""Star Wars Battlefront II improves upon the original game's single-player experience with open-ended, mission-based objectives inspired from all six Star Wars films. The compelling storyline spans more than 12 new locations, many from Episode III, including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant. All-new classic movie moments complete the Star Wars Battlefront II experience, as players battle within the interior of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia’s blockade runner, the Tantive IV, as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope. In addition, at certain key moments within the battles, players can feel the Force as a Jedi. For the first time ever, Star Wars Battlefront II players can engage in space combat and, during the same battle, board enemy ships to attack from within. Starting on foot inside a capital ship, players can enter the spacecraft of their choice and travel into space to dogfight with the rival faction. From there, they can dock within the enemy’s capital ship, overtake the ship’s command posts, man its turrets to disable its shields and destroy it from within! Or, they can simply stay inside their own capital ship and defend it from attacks and enemy fire. The choice is theirs. The stellar online play that marked the original Star Wars Battlefront returns even bigger and better for Star Wars Battlefront II. Players can locate their buddies and track their stats as they battle alongside more players than ever" 9/10","March 29, 2014","true","25.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/syzigical/recommended/6060/","syzigical","Syzigical","http://steamcommunity.com/id/syzigical/","98 products in account","Since the new Battlefront game came out a month ago, I felt like it was absolutely necessary to rework my review. I've been playing this game since I first got my PS2, and for Nostalgia's sake, I bought it again for the PC. I must say that I didn't regret buying it again for another system because I feel like the price was worth it when I first bought it(Around 5 bucks like 2 years ago).\n\nEven though it's 10 years old now, the game still holds up as possibly one of the best Star Wars games to have ever been made. It has a variety of locations for maps, and allowed for single player action which spanned out into either Galactic Conquest, Campaign Mode, and Instant Action. While the graphics are certainly dated, the game is so much fun to play through due to how you were really thrust into the Star Wars Universe and felt like you were just an average soldier on some sort of galactic battlefield.\n\nAnother thing this game has going for it are the mods and community created maps. While Filefront is down, you can still find a large amount of maps made by the community and mods that vastly improve the game and make it look much better than it originally was. While I would say that the game survived so long was due to nostalgia, I'd have to say it's because of the mods. The amount of side mods(Republic v. CIS, Empire v. Rebels, etc.) and interesting maps made by the modding and mapping community just give you an infinite amount of possibilities with what you can do in Star Wars Battlefront II.\n\nI don't think any Star Wars game has had the virtue of having so many community made things for it to explore and try out like SWBII. Along with that, the fun gameplay, and nostalgia, this game is definitely worth the buy.","November 15, 2014","true","168.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The single player is flawless. Multiplayer not so much. It still runs on GameSpy servers which is probably why there will be terrible lag spikes here and there. When playing multiplayer you should really only stick to classes you are good with. I am saying that because people on there spam detpacks, rocket launchers, mines, and force push/pull.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/recommended/6060/","vmblood","VolkmasterBlood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/","222 products in account","This game came out during a really great time for Star Wars games.  It was surrounded by Jedi Outcast, Jedi Academy, Battlefront 1, Empire at War, Revenge of the Sith video game, The Sith Lords (KotOR2), Republic Commando, Star Wars Galaxies Total Experience, Clone Campaigns, etc.  And unfortunately, after 2006 there were very little Star Wars games that were any good.  So this game, to me, is considered one of the great ones of the pinacle of Star Wars gaming.\n\nThe classes are well balanced.  The special troops have very different styles of play, but are not op.  The Clone Commander might have a machien gun with unlimited bullets, but it has no grenades, and is good only for close up troop destruction.  The droideka is pretty awesome, but it has a completely different playstyle as well.\n\nYou have to get quite a bit of shots off the kill someone.  Even vehicles cannot one shot you.  The only one shots in the game are lightsabers and the sniper rifle head shots.  As it gets harder it definitely does get harder.  Space combat takes a bit fo a learning curve at first, but in one or two space combats you will be able to learn the gist of it.\n\nI would say the only major downfall is the AI.  They can literally hurt your game.  In one mission (the mission I always have trouble with) you have to defend the Jedi library from being destroyed by the Jedi (they don't want the Empire to get the knowledge within it).  With a close up shotgun to the head, you can kill them in two shots.  Otherwise, otherwise they take 2-3 shots to take down.  The AI would face off against a Jedi, shoot it once, and then run out of the room to some other place.  Seriously, the AI will force me to quit in anger.  Even the opposing AI is somewhat stupid.  But the online play fixes that.\n\nSo out of all the game, the only detracting qualities are the sometimes pathetic AI and the (expected) learning curve for the space combat.  Otherwise, this game is a mighty good farewell to a great generation of Star Wars gamers and games in general.","December 28, 2013","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somedudez/recommended/6060/","somedudez","Wang Dang Doodle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somedudez/","65 products in account","Star Wars: Battlefront II is no standard sandbox shooter; it creates a feel of huge cinematic battles, without forcing plays to take the game all too seriously and allow them to play the game tactically or freely.\n\nPlayers can select which map they wish to fight on. All the classics of each chapter of the Star Wars series are included, Hoth, Kamino, Jabba’s Pallace, Mustafar, there are a total of 18 different land maps and 6 specific space maps, most of these can be played on both the first and second trilogy.\n\nBattlefront II offers a variety of different game modes for the player to choose. Mainly there is the Conquest mode, and the Assault mode. In Conquest, the object is for players to capture all opposing bases, disallowing enemy troops to enter the field, or to simply keep shooting the enemy until their remaining troop spawns run out. Pending on which bases are controlled by either team, a huge strategic advantage can be seized.\n\nThen there is the Assault mode, which is the space battle mode. Players must destroy parts of the enemy mother ship (which is where players spawn from). This includes destroying enemy engines, life support systems, auto turrets, command bridges, etc. Not all of this offers an immediate advantage other than the points, which is still extremely useful as the moment the enemy team reaches the set limit of points (damage to their ship, or loss of fighter planes), they lose.  The area which the player is allowed to roam is massive. The lock on missile and blaster system works a treat and is still on par with new air combat based games. Assault also offers the ability for players to infiltrate the enemy ship, allowing an inside job on destroying certain parts of it!\n\nThere is also the Hunt mode, where players must wipe out the native species of the specified map, or must survive playing as it. Then there is Capture the Flag, which is your standard CTF mode where players must carry the flag back to their own base.\n\nThe infantry fighting in the game is good, as well as the vehicle combat found in land maps. There is both a first person and third person views, both can be used affectively and don’t hinder combat in any noticeable way. The infantry class system is relatively standard but works. There is your Assault, Heavy, Sniper, and Engineer classes. Then there is two unlockable classes for each individual team, which are unlocked once the player reaches the set amount of points. Each class is balanced well with the pros and cons, teamwork and strategy is paramount to victory.\n\nStar Wars: Battlefront II is one of the best Star Wars games and Sandbox shooters in my opinion. It holds its ground against those high budget new releases of both the Star Wars and Sandbox Shooter genre.","June 9, 2014","true","29.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In galaxy conquest you choose which faction you will be: Republic, CIS, Rebels or the Empire. You start out with the first basic class, and after wins and conquests of planets you buy bonuses and more classes! The great thing about this gmaemode is that it never gets old!

Although mainly a FPS almost identical to the Battlefield series in the terms of the amount of reserves, but in this game there are also dogfight space battles and more, and also a more tactical game mode where you are to conquer the galaxy.\nThe campaign is of a good length and covers the II-IV parts of the series, however you are able to play on any other planet that was mentioned in the series. The multiplayer is really fun, especially the Mos Eisley map where there is an option that every player is a special character. These include all the famous characters such as jedis, which are more powerful then the ordinary footsoldiers you get to play as in the singleplayer campaign. There are also bunch of other mods for these custom missions. The game is very fun to play with your friends, however the PC version does not include split-screen which is a shame, so you and your friends will have to play it online.\nThe graphics are still good, although aged, unless you are a whiney Crysis kid who values the game by its visual aspects only. If that is the case then this game might not be for you. However if you are not and decide to get it, you will be suprised that the game still looks nice, but that isn't why you bought it then.\nSome people might also find the game hard to play, since it can get pretty difficult, especially in the later levels.\n\nThe bad parts of the game is that there are some issues with newer versions of Windows, and that you might wait a couple of days before getting your CD key, since Disney shut down the magnificient LucasArts and we all know what Disney is about now : $$$\nThe story is linear, and so are the objectives that are mainly to capture an objective or to defend a position while killing the enemy, but the combat is fun and the missions are interesting.\nAlso the bad part is that there arent plenty of multiplayer servers (currently about 50) so you don't have quite a big choce, and most of them are filled with veterans who will dominate you over and over again, but when you are playing with friends you will probably host the game.\n\nI have played this game since it came out, and I have finished the singleplayer many times. If you have the amount of money it costs and you don't mind slightly outdated graphics, then immediately purchase this game and you won't regret it.","July 31, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For the review:\n\nTHE GAME'S AMAZING. Best. Star Wars. Game. Ever. Battlefront III is pathetic. Want those graphics in the much better game, this? There's mods.\n\nWARNING: MORE CAPITAL LETTERS TO GAIN YOUR ATTENTION: This game has trouble running on newer OSes, such as Windows 7.  Some users don't have audio, and I don't know how to fix that, the discussions should have you a fix.  Most of you want to be able to play your newly bought game, Battlefront II. To fix this problem, go to:\n\nControl Panel > Sound > Recording > Right click, select "Show disabled devices" > Enable "Stereo Mix"\n\nFor some reason,  that fixes the game.  Now you can play it.  You can also play it in glorius 1080p60FPS. For some reason, the main menu is still 600x800 or something like that. Don't worry, it goes to 1080p when in game (just change the options).\n\nFor more than compatiblilty, and base graphics, this game is better than Battlefront III in every way. Fine, online isn't great, but the game's 10+ years old. There's many Jedi in the game, when III has two. You can technically browse servers, but online is limited for a 10+-year-old game, where in III you can't. You're able to get in a ship, fly it towards the enemies, get out, and continue fighting. III just has a screenwipe to get in the ship (I'm unsure of how you get out).\n\nThe game is intense fun. Shooting wookies in the face, blowing up clone/stormtroopers high into the sky has never been so fun. Force Pushing someone off the edge into the bottomless pit of doom (or just "off the map") to save yourself the effort of lightsabering them hasn't been so . . . funny, creative, or nice.  I HIGHLY recommend you get this game.\n\nI  HIGHLY recommend this. Many others do too.\n\nAlso, don't give me hate for saying Battlefront III is a bad game. It's a bad game. This is so much better.\n128v128 is awesome. 20v20 isn't as cool.","December 3, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is also a first person mode for those who dont like 3rd person shooters and it also has controller support. So if you no longer own your ps2 copy this is a good substitiute. It's got better graphics and XL mode which is  a huge battle with a crapload of npc's and yourself running around killing each other. This game is a masterpiece and deserves to be played.

I played this game on the Playstation 2 when it came out and it was part of my childhood. I was never really dissapointed with this game, the Campaign was very enjoyable (and a bit challenging at times) but a little short and the maps are very fun to play on and has huge variety (From the snowy landscape of Hoth to the murky Swaps of Dagobah). My favorite is the Galactic conquest mode where you have to capture planets to win and each of the planets are worth a certain amount of points and there is also Instant action which is quick matches. I don't know why people are complaining about the online multiplayer, yes it was run by GAMESPY, and yes they did shutdown; but there is still DEDICATED SERVERS that you can go and play on if you want multiplayer action, and you can still HOST games and have friends join your server; you can also use Gameranger and join through there as well. The space combat is just how i remembered it fun and very unique in there being different ways to approach and destroy your opponent's ship. This game is a masterpiece of its time and deserves to be in your game library (hopefully with hours played on it :] ) and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!","June 27, 2014","true","29.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Along with story mode there are stand alone levels on various modes and galactic conquest where you pick a side and try to either conqure or free the galaxy.

Definitely worth playing 10 years later with no online. (Psst, even if the online isn’t available, you can still find alternative methods, google it.)\nIt controls well with a few tweaks, and switching between 3rd and 1st person gameplay is smooth and useful. Shooting people is satisfying, but the aiming in 3rd person is a wee bit off. Vehicles are a little wonky too, but it’s a lot of fun blowing people up with them, and the classes are varied and fun.\n\nBe wary about buying though, as the online is discontinued, and despite being able to revive it with external programs, the community isn’t exactly large, and you have the new battlefront coming out by EA, so there is that too.

Without this game, the genre of first person shooter would be very different indeed. Not only does this game offer some of the best team based strategic play I've seen to date, but this game also did it around a time when battles on a large scale were not something to be brushed off as ordinary. The game is very fun, even if you're not a hardcore star wars fan. Multiplayer was unfortunately taken down as Gamespy closed, but not to worry, gameranger has servers online as I'm typing this out, and gameranger is free. You will experience lag on gameranger servers, but if you have the proper bandwidth and hardware to support your own server, you will have the chance to play a game that becomes exponentially more fun the more people you play with.\n\n+Awesome Space Battles, Land Battles, and Land Battles in Space\n+Vehicle gameplay\n+Class counter-gameplay/Vehicle counter-gameplay\n+Capture the Point (Conquest) style\n+Plenty of awesome mods\n+Very solid gunplay\n+Galactic Conquest, a long term war to rule the galaxy (Evil laughing)\n+Choice between CIS (Droids), Republic (Clones), The Empire (Stormtroopers), and The Rebels (Watch the damn movie)\n+Upgrade/Mastery system on guns/classes\n+A.I. is pretty great for space battles\n+Multiplayer is still a thing\n+I could go on for a long time\n\nDownsides/Conclusion\n\n-This game is old, and looks old\n-You will experience bugs if you play long enough\n-A.I. are often easy even on the hardest difficulty for a person who has gotten used to the game (Doesn't take very long)\n-Overpowered advanced classes on some factions, underpowered on other factions, (The Bothan Spy really doesn't compare to the Empirial Officer, Shock Trooper way better than Wookies. Jet pack trooper and Clone Commander are really bad in comparison to the MagnaGaurd and Droideka and I could go on.)\n-Playing by yourself isn't very fun after a while\n-Playing with friends can easily be laggy\n-Steam doesn't always have this game on sale for 5 bucks (If it is on sale for 5 or really anything but ten, get it, it's worth way more than 5, but because of its age it really doesn't need to be priced at 10.)\n-Upcoming Battlefront 3 game may sweep the floor with this one, not neccesarily a bad thing if Battlefront 3 is actually good, but it is a bad thing if it sweeps this game under the rug for no reason.\n\nIn conclusion, you really need to get this game, and get your friends to get this game. If you haven't played it yet you need to. If you have played it already but don't have it, get it. If you have played it and have it, get another copy for your friend. If you don't have any friends and have it, get another copy and make a friend today.","December 23, 2014","true","21.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/6060/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Star Wars - Battlefront II is a third person shooter by LucasArts that puts you in the shoes of a common trooper or a droid while you reenact the greatest battle of the six Star Wars movies.You can play as the armies of the Republic, the CIS, the Empire and the Rebels, since the game covers both the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War eras from the Star Wars canon.\nBattlefront II spots a single player campaign revolving around a legion of elite clone soldiers, the 501st, as they serve the Republic during the Clone Wars during the last days of the democracy to later become one of the most feared army of the new Galactic Empire. The campaign takes place in several maps also available in multiplayer, but also tasks the player to complete several kinds of objective (like capturing a command post, destroying a target or defeat an enemy hero), so playing through the various missions feels like an unique experience and worth of a try.\nBattlefront II also introduces new maps where space battle take place: you can play as either a pilot or a marine from your faction, grab a ship (which can be either a heavy bombardier or a fast fighter) and try to severely damage the enemy fleet by either destroying its fighters or cripple its main ship either from the outside or the inside. While space battles always follow a strick formula with little room for alternative strategies, they are a welcome addition nevertheless.\nOne of the major improvement from the original game in the sequel is about the hero units: while in Battlefront they weren't playable, the second game allows you to take direct control of them, albeit for a short time (which you can increase by killing enemies). You can play as both Sith and Jedi and scoundrels and bounty hunters from the two eras, each with his/her own weapons and powers.\nAnother single player mode you can access in Battlefront II is the galactic conquest scenario: after choosing one of the four faction you are tasked to bring it to victory over its rival army and take absolute control of the galaxy. You have to move your army on a map of the galaxy and plan your attacks carefully. Winning confrontations grants you credits that can be used to purchase bonuses that can be activated for a single battle to enhance your armies (the bacta tanks perk will give your soldiers regenerating health, for instance).\nThe multiplayer mode returns in Battlefront II in full force, offering several traditional game modes like capture the flag or control point captures or hunt on a pletora of new maps. It's also worth mentioning that the game has a very dedicated modding community always redy to develop new maps from different eras of the Star Wars canon (the Old Republic, for instance) or add new heroic or normal units per factions.\nStar Wars - Battlefront II is often labelled as one of the best games with a Star Wars license and I tend to agree, due to the very interesting and catchy gameplay and the excellent use of the series' canonic materials","December 23, 2012","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For the review:\n\nTHE GAME'S AMAZING. Best. Star Wars. Game. Ever. Battlefront III is pathetic. Want those graphics in the much better game, this? There's mods.\n\nWARNING: MORE CAPITAL LETTERS TO GAIN YOUR ATTENTION: This game has trouble running on newer OSes, such as Windows 7.  Some users don't have audio, and I don't know how to fix that, the discussions should have you a fix.  Most of you want to be able to play your newly bought game, Battlefront II. To fix this problem, go to:\n\nControl Panel > Sound > Recording > Right click, select "Show disabled devices" > Enable "Stereo Mix"\n\nFor some reason,  that fixes the game.  Now you can play it.  You can also play it in glorius 1080p60FPS. For some reason, the main menu is still 600x800 or something like that. Don't worry, it goes to 1080p when in game (just change the options).\n\nFor more than compatiblilty, and base graphics, this game is better than Battlefront III in every way. Fine, online isn't great, but the game's 10+ years old. There's many Jedi in the game, when III has two. You can technically browse servers, but online is limited for a 10+-year-old game, where in III you can't. You're able to get in a ship, fly it towards the enemies, get out, and continue fighting. III just has a screenwipe to get in the ship (I'm unsure of how you get out).\n\nThe game is intense fun. Shooting wookies in the face, blowing up clone/stormtroopers high into the sky has never been so fun. Force Pushing someone off the edge into the bottomless pit of doom (or just "off the map") to save yourself the effort of lightsabering them hasn't been so . . . funny, creative, or nice.  I HIGHLY recommend you get this game.\n\nI  HIGHLY recommend this. Many others do too.\n\nAlso, don't give me hate for saying Battlefront III is a bad game. It's a bad game. This is so much better.\n128v128 is awesome. 20v20 isn't as cool.","December 3, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ever. With more replay value than over 10 games, There are hundreds of thousands of mods with completely new campaigns, maps, new skins, new characters completely including Jedi and Sith, soundtracks, Galactic Conquests, general patches that give fake console; a modding work of art and free camrea on top of being able to select any campaign mission without playing them. Did I mention there's still online via GameRanger and GameMaster? Only thousands of hours in that alone and something I have. I'm not biased or alone in saying this either. I have SEVERAL friends with hours that rank up in the thousands, one with over 20k! You could write a book on the strategy that goes into it as well and stands tall even after 11 years as one of the best gamer ever. Then we got Hero Assault; going past the average player who thinks it's a fun little side game mode, it's VERY complex with literally hundreds (I am being completely serious) of different strategies and a lot of different tricks and game laws for Hero Assault such as null; where you stop an enemy dash cold with percise timing. In the high level matches, you find yourself making about 20 moves a second and have to predict your opponents actions it's so complex and fun.","April 3","true","129.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/czeekykunt/recommended/6060/","czeekykunt","Holier Than Thou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/czeekykunt/","126 products in account","Star Wars - Battlefront 2 is an immensely fun game. While it doesn't necessarily compare to the first which was a bit better (sadly not on Steam), it is still a great experience. However, there are plenty of things like custom maps, unofficial patches, and conversion mods which can make it 10x more fun than either vanilla game. The added element of space combat makes it all the more fun. Plenty of awards to grind for and collect to make yourself an unstoppable brute. One meh thing is that the hero meter is very annoying that slowly degrades and is vampirically recharged to keep heroes alive and they could have done a smidge better with the saber combat especially since something like Jedi Academy came out two years earlier.\n\nSadly, multiplayer has been disabled, but is still possible through some third party programs or patches that support player made servers. Destroying ships and blasting away pesky droids with a friend is always great.\n\nOne complaint is that the shooting isn't the greatest with the huge reticles, all-over-the-place AI, and the aiming and even blaster bolts can act wonky sometimes. It isn't absolutely insufferable, but it has room for improvement. Otherwise, lots of fun, campaign centered around the 501st clone regiment, galactic conquest mode, and instant action with all the great Star Wars locations from the water planet twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze to the most wretched hive of scum and villainy on Tatooine.","September 20, 2014","true","134.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I mean, I really like the original movies, and i like all of the lore and the deep history of the universe, but its not like im buying all of the games and books. I had this game for the PS2 a long time ago when my uncle bought it for me. I played it a good amount, but never really was a huge fan. A couple days ago I remembered it and bought it 5 minutes after. When I played it I remembered everything i like about it. This is by far the best star wars game ever. The concept was so fresh and new for a star wars game, instead of being a jedi or a huge character for the movie, you play as one of the soldiers in the large scale battles of the 6 films. Each location is different and most of them are a lot of fun, the gameplay is an absolute blast, the heroes and jedi you can play as are awesome, i can go on and on about why this game is so good. So if you remember playing this game when you were younger, i strongly reccomend buying it. You wont regret it. Its great. 10/10. Yee haw.\n\n\n(P.S. I know that the EA game isnt going to be as good as the original, but could it at least be good and not filled with DLC? Could you do at least that EA?

Even better that the first one. It adds up more vehicles, classes and you can also play as a Hero (Jedi, Sith, Bounty Hunter etc.)! The graphics are amazing considering the time that the game came out.\nI love this game so much, I still have and play the PS2, XBOX and PSP versions of the game.\nHaving a huge variety of maps, the fun never ends, you can test your skills in instant action with four game modes (conques, ctf, heroes vs villians and assault),then you can conquer the galaxy in Galactic Conquest mode choosing from four (4) factions (Rebels vs Empire and CIS vs Republic).\nThe maps are amazing, really big, it's a war game afterall. You also have the ability to play space battles, something that the first game lacked (and the newest one...), your objective is to destroy the enemy capital ship!\nBut no, that's not all. Download mods and or maps (prefered) in which you play space to ground on the maps the game already has or new maps that fans made!\nPeople still play the game online so it's not dead! This is hands down one of the best, if not the best Star Wars game!\nThere are some glitches but not game breaking. Some characters are over-powered but they can be defeated if you know how to play well of course! The developers did a great job, but there are some stuff they could have added such as space to ground battles and the ability to escape enemy capital ships with an escape pod just like Elite Squadron.\nOther than that Star Wars Battlefront 2 is an amazing game and you should have it in your game library!\n\n9/10","December 19, 2015","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/6060/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Star Wars - Battlefront II is a third person shooter by LucasArts that puts you in the shoes of a common trooper or a droid while you reenact the greatest battle of the six Star Wars movies.You can play as the armies of the Republic, the CIS, the Empire and the Rebels, since the game covers both the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War eras from the Star Wars canon.\nBattlefront II spots a single player campaign revolving around a legion of elite clone soldiers, the 501st, as they serve the Republic during the Clone Wars during the last days of the democracy to later become one of the most feared army of the new Galactic Empire. The campaign takes place in several maps also available in multiplayer, but also tasks the player to complete several kinds of objective (like capturing a command post, destroying a target or defeat an enemy hero), so playing through the various missions feels like an unique experience and worth of a try.\nBattlefront II also introduces new maps where space battle take place: you can play as either a pilot or a marine from your faction, grab a ship (which can be either a heavy bombardier or a fast fighter) and try to severely damage the enemy fleet by either destroying its fighters or cripple its main ship either from the outside or the inside. While space battles always follow a strick formula with little room for alternative strategies, they are a welcome addition nevertheless.\nOne of the major improvement from the original game in the sequel is about the hero units: while in Battlefront they weren't playable, the second game allows you to take direct control of them, albeit for a short time (which you can increase by killing enemies). You can play as both Sith and Jedi and scoundrels and bounty hunters from the two eras, each with his/her own weapons and powers.\nAnother single player mode you can access in Battlefront II is the galactic conquest scenario: after choosing one of the four faction you are tasked to bring it to victory over its rival army and take absolute control of the galaxy. You have to move your army on a map of the galaxy and plan your attacks carefully. Winning confrontations grants you credits that can be used to purchase bonuses that can be activated for a single battle to enhance your armies (the bacta tanks perk will give your soldiers regenerating health, for instance).\nThe multiplayer mode returns in Battlefront II in full force, offering several traditional game modes like capture the flag or control point captures or hunt on a pletora of new maps. It's also worth mentioning that the game has a very dedicated modding community always redy to develop new maps from different eras of the Star Wars canon (the Old Republic, for instance) or add new heroic or normal units per factions.\nStar Wars - Battlefront II is often labelled as one of the best games with a Star Wars license and I tend to agree, due to the very interesting and catchy gameplay and the excellent use of the series' canonic materials","December 23, 2012","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
