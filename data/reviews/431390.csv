The miniature diorama menu itself is great, a really unique way of doing a level select in VR.","April 5","true","0.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","8"

Now that I can play it with HTC Vive it feels so much better since I can move around, look close at objects, and it has more view points.  I think for the low price it is a cool little experience to try out.  They have also made it so you can move between view points at your leisure.","April 21","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's nice having small areas like this where you can actually use your phyiscal playspace to really walk around it. It is super detailed and looks amazing in the Vive! Definitely worth the small asking price.","April 7","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The menu system at the beginning is very cool and mysterious.   very immersive just walking around in the room inspecting all of the detail.  This is my new getaway.\n\ncons: no Vive controllers in game.  I need hands!","May 23","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
