"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/202370/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Based on the graphic novel of the same name, ScaryGirl is the journey of a rather unusual little girl. Adopted to a giant talking octopus, with a tentacle for an arm and donning pirate attire, she's been having some unpleasant dreams lately and as such sets out to visit the Tree of Knowledge and discover just what they actually mean.\n\nThough it starts out strong with an unique premise and some highly amusing narration, the story loses its footing midway through as characters are thrust into the plot with no introduction, and ending on a laughable attempt of moral choice. If nothing else however it does act as a means to showcase a great variety of enemies and locales, and in that regard it does its job admirably.\n\nIn the fashion of games such as Klonoa and Kirby 64, ScaryGirl is a 2.5D platformer with an added emphasis on platforming, and it uses the perspective to grand effect. Paths wrap around levels in a visually interesting manner, and on occasion there are even multiple pathways through which was a neat touch. Though the actual platforming and beat-em-up style fighting are far from their most refined form, I nonetheless found it enjoyable...at first. The further I got into the game the more the many problems began test my patience, and during the final third I was almost begging for it to end.\n\nThe fact of the matter, as much as it pains me to have to say it, is that in nearly every aspect ScaryGirl feels half finished. Platforms are often poorly placed, there are numerous difficulty spikes, and noticeable input latency makes pulling off combos much harder than it should be. The presentation only makes things worse, with choppy animations, noticeably absent sound effects, and a complete lack of widescreen support of video options. I also ran into a fairly large number of bugs, from item counters breaking to health pickups not healing me, to having to re-enable fullscreen what most every launch.\n\nThough it's impossible to say with certainty, I honestly feel that given a few more months in development this could have been a much better game. Further testament to this is how infinitely more polished the early portion is than later levels, which leads me to believe they simply ran out of time/money and had to push it out the door in its current state.\n\nOverall I did have fun with ScaryGirl, but do to how very flawed it is i can't advise others to play it. My first impression was one of huge potential, from the fantastic art style to the interesting level structure, but that was quickly replaced by disappointment at the deluge of bugs, presentation issues, and bad design decisions. Like the girl herself ScaryGirl is pretty rough around the edges, but deep down you can't help but want to love her. Unfortunately in the case of this game, I simply couldn't. I applaud Square-Enix for taking a chance on a smaller indie title, but hope next time they take a bit more care in ensuring it's ready for release.","October 24, 2013","false","5.5"," 40 of 60 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","40","60","0","0"

But does that mean there's no room for innovation in platformers ? I'd say there's plenty of room; look at games like Paper Mario and Kirby's Epic Yarn. Excellent platformers with some great, innovative gameplay elements.\n\nUnfortunately, Scary Girl has zero innovation. But I'll be honest; I can't expect every platformer to do things differently. Scary Girl is an enjoyable platformer with action oriented gameplay. It all works fairly well. The graphics are charming and a bit moody, but the sounds are a bit underused if you ask me. Nothing alarming though.\n\nOne big flaw that should've been fixed by now is the fact that it only supports two (yes, 2 !) resolutions. Full HD (1920x1080) is not even being supported. Extremely disappointing.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","June 16, 2012","true","1.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It kind of reminds me of the style used in Tim Burton's works.  I'd even go as far as to recommend this game on the artwork alone, it's great eyecandy and done well. The creators included local multiplayer too for if you have someone else who wants to tag along. It's a side-scrolling platform game with collections and combo attacks built in. Some checkpoints are really stretched out, adding a bit to the challenge, but perhaps a bit TOO spaced out at times. I think the wrap-up ending animation/story was a little too short and seemed a bit rushed but the last level was a nice combo-gauntlet of previous levels.\n\n*(I can't imagine the time I'd need to finish collecting the 16,000 gems I'm short getting the last achievement so I'm going to let that one and the 'All perfects' ride)* For those of you going for the extras, good luck!","January 28, 2014","true","7.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbobw/recommended/202370/","jbobw","Bob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbobw/","247 products in account","This is a very endearing little platformer. You play as a little girl with a tentacle for an arm who is dressed as a pirate. The visuals are colourful and very stylish. The 2D platforming in a 3D environment works well. The gameplay is for the most part fun although some sections can be rather frustrating. You can use your tentacle arm to attack, fly and swing off things. As the game progresses you find health upgrades and can purchase new attacks. The story is entertaining although the ending is a bit weak. However I bought this game as I was looking for decent local co-op games. The co-op in this is akin to playing as tails during single player Sonic 2. Player 2 cannot do all the tentacle related moves player 1 can and they just end up getting left behind and respawing. This make playing as player 2 rather annoying. So I would recommend this if you are looking for a fun, quite challenging single player game not as a local co-op game.","April 14, 2014","true","7.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Very atmospheric 3D sidescroller that is both challenging and evocative. A lot of platformers try to affect a retro-look or feel that often falls short, but this game has an overall consistency--music, mechanics--that taps into that feeling of platformer nostalgia without specifically harkening back to an earlier era. It's fresh. Get it.","August 6, 2013","true","1.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The art style and stages themselves are competent, and there seems to be a decent challenge here, but there are other, much better games you should be looking at long before you reach the bottom of the barrel in which Scarygirl resides.","May 27, 2014","false","0.9"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

I expected a bit more derp give the theme of the game.  The game is well narrated, great sound track and great sound effects.\n\nControl wise, I certainly reommend a controller, especially some of the TRICKY jumps you have to do.  Overall controll was OK (5 out of 10), it could have been better.  Executing combo attacks was sometimes trival.\n\nI wish bosses had a boss meter sometimes it was difficult to gauge if I was hitting the dang thing or not.  The game is pretty short rounding to about 6-10 hours game time wise.\n\nStages and bosses were challenging and wasn't bad overall.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the stupid switch at times.  You'll get to tough spots where the game just throws nothing but a barrage of BS at you, which is frustarting.  Forentualy the game has somewhat decent checkpoint system.\n\nAn intersting gem, worth picking up if you get past these flaws, but I wouldn't drop no more than 10$ on it.  I spent about 3 on a sale.","June 11, 2015","true","7.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics are pretty good and the level and enemy design is great. The graphics remind me of Costume Quest which is awesome. The sound is good and the music is fitting. The controls are great and the combat is simple and fun. It is locked at 30fps which normally would make a game feel terrible to play but for this type of game it is totally fine. It only supports a low max resolution so I checked the forums and found a program that let me modify the game exe to make the game run in 1920x1080. The levels can be challenging and so far I have not regretted buying this. I got it for $1.50 on sale and that was a steal for a few hours of fun around halloween with a solid action platformer.\n\n8/10","May 13, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However, during times when the writers DID feel the need to convey a message with words, it's done ham-fistedly; the narrator just tells you what has already happened and what's going to happen, and he's bad even at that. The game's pre-press-start-to-begin cutscene would work perfectly well without narration (characters communicate via pictorial speech bubbles), so why couldn't they do that in the badly-narrated in-game cutscenes?\n\nGameplay; Fairly straght 2D platformer with a relatively detailed combat system. Problem is that there are oodles of bugs and bad design issues; Scarygirl doesn't become invulnerable when she's hurt, meaning it's really easy for bad guys to combo you into oblivion from full health (you never realise that CAN be a problem in games until you miss it). A lot of the challenges are overly difficult, and the level length isn't consistent, which combos badly with the poor checkpoint system.\n\nI wish, I wish, I wish this was a better game. I can't recommend it in good conscience unless the dev team come out with a BIG bug-fixing update.","April 17, 2012","false","3.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I will say that the world this takes place in, is interesting and unique at the very least, even if the cut scenes suffer from poor writing. The ending is a pretty big let down, even if you unlock the best one,. Its very short, and makes the final fight feel unrewarding. The world itself feels like Tim Burton meets Samurai Jack (old Cartoon()\n\n~Mechanics~\nStandard adventure combat, gain and unlock new abilities. There are also items you can buy that change your  abilities slightly, like slow but stronger attacks or faster swimming. The combat in this game is fine until much later in the game, you will realize that fighting multiple enemies at once is very frustrating and seems broken as you will be forced to rely on spamming the same combo to survive.\n\n~Length~\nShort. Its not super long, if you want to unlock everything it does add some time. A full play through will probably run you add about 8-13 hours, if you try to unlock everything.\n\n~Glitches~\nI found no glitches or bugs that cause problems for playing the game. However I did find that certain aspects are poorly coded and you can abuse it. For example there are three evil plants you have to destroy in order to progress, however I’ve found if you jump over them all you can just destroy the last on to proceed instead.\n\n~Overall~\nThe game itself is a cool and unique concept. Sadly It wasn’t executed in the best manner, and the game  feels like it wasn’t polished. Overall though it was still fun, and its well worth its low price of $7.00 USD. If you like creepy or unique games, I recommend buying it.\n\nP.S.

You have light and heavy attacks and grapples with your tentacle-arms like some kind of sidescrolling Tumblr Kratos, but enemies are standard walk-left-and-right fare so you're going to annihilate them no matter what you press. The levels are simple with very little to find, though some branch into multiple paths which could theoretically encourage replays. You pick up gems you can use to buy new moves and attack upgrades with, and fish which restore your health because you're weird and scary I guess. There's not much else to say about it, really... everything it does has been done better by some other platformer.
