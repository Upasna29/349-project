Due to a lack of a tutorial, and an incredibly minimalist HUD, this game can only be learned through trial and error. The AI has one difficulty, ruthless and expansive and will quickly outpace you if you waste too many turns. However, despite these faults, this game has the most interesting take of the economic portion of a 4X game I've ever seen. The entire goal of the game is to make a ton of money to colonize at least 50% of the galaxy. You make money by building mines that each specialize in the production of 1 resource. As you build up, you start to build factories which can create commodities which sell for significantly higher profits than just plain resources. If you don't have the required resource needed to produce the good then you buy it off the market automatically which, obviously, diminishes your profits. So you benefit by colonizing planets and varying what resources you're mining. To add on to this strategy, there is the Patent System. Summed up, this system means, if you have all the resources needed to produce a commodity, then you can purchase a patent on it causing your profits to increase by 500%. However, patents are in limited supply and there are only so many combinations of resources that can be patented meaning the faster you expand, the more money you make, thus the better chance of taking over the galaxy you have.\n\nNow there is a military side of the game where you build massive fleets to attack either independent worlds or AI controlled worlds which have the resources you need. However, fleets and militarys and even the research required to make them more effective are ungodly expensive! Even a small fleet of 4 frigates can cripple a burgeoning Company, so you only go to war when necessary.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, it's hard and can be incredibly punishing but anyone who is willing to take the time to play the game will quickly find a Gem amongst indie Space Strategy games.","June 2, 2015","true","1.4"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","38","42","9","2"

I clicked around for a bit and tried to find something online that explained how to do at least some basic stuff and couldnt find anything... Perhaps the developers should spend 30 minutes and write up a basic getting started guide.","November 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","1"

Maybe a new perspective, or something else, I don't know. And I've found this game, read the review and looked at the Youtube video. So I gave it a try.\n\nAnd I think totally worth it. It's totally different than other games.\nIf you like micromanagement, that's your game, you will face a lot. There is no summary the total energy, food, resources, etc. used or surplus if you have any. Just the credit balance. So I decide to make an Excel sheet to sums up things. And I also made a periodic table visual aid. And it's working for me. I'm working in production, so it's close to me.\n\nYou have to make high income to pay the fleets. The patent system will help you. Just watch the energy, food, labour, officers, and the resources and gases and etc. Colonize systems, build fleets to ( at least ) defend yourself.\n\nSo I was looking for something new, and I found it. It's harder than other games you can buy here ( someone says it's unfinished game, with features missing).\n\nIf you like micromanagement and galactic conquest in economic perspective, try this game!","June 15, 2015","true","9.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

When it didn't crash it got boring fast. Build, upgrade to limit of 5, defend against invading corporations, attack other corporate planets, mo money mo money mo mo money.  I hope the dev gets it right, eventually.  Not an expensive proposition.  You're an adult, the choice is yours, pick the blue planet or the red planet.\n\n\nI wish there was a "meh" recommendition instead of yes or no.","June 3, 2015","true","4.0"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","19","33","3","0"

It gets repetitive pretty fast. The graphics is minimal - though I agree that fancy graphics is not a necessity for a strategy game, this has a graphics like an early 90's game. Of course there is no tutorial, the UI is also very minimal. The price is low but you won't play this game for more than a couple of hours.","July 4, 2015","false","1.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The game play itself is simplistic, once the simple mechanics of the game are better understood. The interior workings are nothing but repeating formulas for the most part but they hold my interest in unraveling them. The game play as it is meant is actually good as well. Most comments I have read are negative but I am having quite a fun time playing this game.","September 20, 2015","true","7.5"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"
