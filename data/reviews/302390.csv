The publisher doesn't care for fixing it, instead they just gave out a save game for download that puts you at some place behind the broken part so you miss an important part of the story.\n\nThey show on the shop page screenshots of the HD iOS version, while the PC version they actually sell here still looks exactly like the original game from 2001. Also I didn't see anything about this alleged "Updates in this new version of Necronomicon".\n\nNormal thinking people would call this version of that game simply a fraud and Valve shouldn't allow to sell it on Steam.\nBetter just watch a Let's Play of it (of the original disc version) instead of wasting any money.\n\nUpdate: I've found a fix for the problem with the missing video sequences and the missing briefcase, check out this forum post for more information. Buy the game if you really want to and know how to two juggle with two files (wich is really not that dificult actually).\nMy rating stays the same as there is still no official fix, although it's actually that simple. Also the problem with the technically seen faked screenshots and the missing addtional content stays that way too.","October 3, 2014","false","9.4"," 139 of 149 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","139","149","4","0"

I like this game.\n\n(optional let's play footage)\nhttp://youtu.be/tOe1b9xBr5g\nOkay it is from 2001. But for a game that old I was really surprised by the presentation. It uses 2D images which appear to have been pre-rendered in 3D. I thought scenes would comprise of 2D landscape environments with 3D character and objects rendered over them. But the game is actually played from a first person perspective. You don't navigate a 3D environment like a modern (or even an old one) FPS. You move from one location to another i.e. different places in a room or the town and have different 2D panoramic views at each location. It's basically works like google earth street view where you can look all around from specific point. I guess this was the developers way of implementing the game that would run on the typical sytems that were available at the time. I'm not saying it's the best looking thing ever but I was impressed, I was expecting a lot worse. Yes the game runs in only 640 by 480 resolution so it's a pretty pixely. That didn't actually bother me But I've been playing games for over 20 years now haha. And you might think that some of the locations look pretty drab i.e. a town full of ugly brown wooden shacks and mud but it's typical of anything based on Lovecraft. I didn't mind the sound effects either, I like the creaking you could hear in your home while you were alone. The voice acting is mixed, some I felt was good other examples a bit lame but that just made it more amusing lol. It also has the occasional animated cut scene e.g. when you answer the door and speak to a visitor or approach a person on the street.\n\nYou can interact with certain objects and individuals you come across as well as picking up inventory items. Theres no tutorial or tips so you just have figure how to do things yourself. There's no journal or log to refer to for important information you have found or what your current objective is. There is no autosave, I think need to manually save using the menu.\n\nNot surprisingly being such an old game it has a few little issues. Not that these stopped enjoying it, but here are some of them. You need to wave the cursor around around the in order find things that you are able to interact with because unless it's really obvious there is no indication. The way you interact with you inventory actually and actually use items is a bit unclear. If you are able to take use an item seems to be completely situational. But it's doesn't prompt when you can't use an object when click on it in your inventory instead just exits your inventory. I found that if you are in the right the item will on appear on your cursor if you click on it in your inventory. Next you probably really need to be paying attention to dialogue and remember what is said in conversations so that you know what to do next. Otherwise you find yourself a bit lost. I was knocking on every door in town and wondering why the hell I was doing that lol. Unfortunately I hadn't saved the game before I died so without an autosave I lost progress. So yeah, save your game.\n\nI love Lovecraft and this is better than I thought it would be so far. The 2D panoramic view was a pleasant surprise. I think there would be plenty of people who might enjoy this especially if they like Lovecraft stuff as well.\n\nClick here for more letâ€™s play videos =)","July 11, 2014","true","1.6"," 114 of 155 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","114","155","9","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/302390/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","I am genuinely baffled by my conflicting feelings over this "Lovecraftian" adventure game. Okay, Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness is nothing miraculous. It's old, it's clunky, full of bugs with irritable animations... yet still manages to set an eerie enough atmosphere to drive your perception skills to its limits. For that account only, it is not possible to recommend this game to anyone. Even if one is to set aside the fact that the game is raddled with bugs, it would still be an acquired taste forced down your throat.\n\nIt's year 1927 in rickety village of Pawtuxet, Rhode Island. A silent afternoon is abruptly interrupted for young William Stanton by his friend, Edgar Wycherley. Edgar seems off, panicked and fearful. He entrusts William an odd pyramid shaped relic and asks for him to protect it, even from Edgar himself at all costs. Then, Edgar takes off as oddly as he appeared before William's door. Minutes later, Doctor Egleton, Wycherley's family doctor visits William to inform that Edgar hasn't been himself lately, consumed by his studies of archeology and asks William to inform him immediately if Edgar is to be contacted. After these strange visits, William decides to visit Edgar himself and learn more about these "studies" of Edgar's in hopes of aiding his friend. That's how young and avid William Stanton gets himself into an interplanar mess centering a quite specific book of occult: Necronomicon.\n\nSo far, so good. The story is interesting to begin with, weaved with mummies, strange disappearances, long deceased ancestors, sigils and summoning of spirits. Yet is the presentation of the story fulfilling and satisfying as the game progresses? That, I'd like to vote as abstaining. There is a great amount of lore thrown around for us to monitor and take note, but they are not processed as elegantly as possible in my opinion. Anecdotes keep coming to us without any time for us to digest any kind of on-goings. On that part, it is bad construction for a story revelation.\n\nThe game hailing from 2001, graphics are nothing extraordinary, a bit clucky and plastic even for character models. Aside oddly shaped characters, the basic environment presents a creepy yet dull atmosphere suitable for any gothic setting, yet it doesn't actually deliver the Lovecraftian elegance that one would be waiting. Voice acting is neat, with accents of the original time period, but without the option of a subtitle, and much information for you to pursue hidden in cinematic dialogues - without an option to record spoken information in game - ends up being a complete obstacle for progression. You have to play this game with pen and paper + earphones if you'd like to make something out of the story.\n\nWe are already used to the linear gameplay for an adventure game, but Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness takes this part a bit more seriously than it should. One of the main problems for this game, if you ask me, is that you are expected to complete one solemn action at a time, and unless you discover and accomplish that specific action, nothing progresses. You are allowed to explore on your own; it just won't do any good. That's why everything turns into an "action hunt" on a wide map for you to figure out quickly.\n\nPuzzles are another issue altogether. They are quite obscure even with the collectible information, asking you to run through a series of spiritual and occult references - most of them are authentic, by the way: kudos on that part - to figure out your next step. They are never easy and demands that you take notes in every step of your game. I'd love that if the lore that we use for puzzles would be at least somewhat relevant to the plotline that we are pursuing... It is mostly not. Oh, and remember "Old Ones" concept that we were so excited about, because, I don't know, this is a LOVECRAFTIAN game? It really doesn't deliver at all.\n\nCombined with a series of common bugs that would make the game impossible to finish without an exe. copy of an old retail cd - it is possible to reach one in the guide section of community - Necronomicon: The Dawning of Darkness ends up being a lame adventure game with some cool references thrown around. If you are a fan of Lovecraftian literature, sure, you can try. But even then, I'd doubt that you'd enjoy it much. I tried so hard to like this game but even as a Lovecraft fan myself, I sadly did not.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 15, 2015","false","6.0"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"

However, this game is the biggest brain suck I have ever come across and I felt the dying need to alert people to the waste of time and pennies they will experience if they buy this game. I could forgive the tired animations if it weren't for the dreadfully boring gameplay. As someone who is a big fan of adventure gaming, I am generally quite a patient person. However, this game forces you into such a linear pathway (only one action becomes available at any given time and you have to search through the game to find something that has become clickable) that I feel the problem solving has turned from an exercise of logic to a "search for the button" quest. Most actions that become executable wind up turning into a eyeball-tearingly long monolog from some dreadfully acted character that is supposed to advance the storyline but leaves you wondering where the heck the last half hour just went.

The puzzles are challenging, and interesting. It is a great hommage to the style of lovecraft stories, and very enjoyable to play. It is certainly worth playing, and I'm glad that I have done so. I do think it's important to note this.\n\nThat being said, the game is incompletable. As others has said there is a massive, leathal bug. A very large, and important cutscene, one that shapes the entire game, and gives the player direction in what to do next (as well as a huge part of the story, and reward for completing the puzzle which came before it) is missing. Also inventory issues, and not being able to access some items leaves the game incompletable from very close to the end.\n\nI do understand that meridian have offered their 'solution' which is to download a save game - which means still missing out on that long cutscene, as well as not completing a puzzle. Now that is no solution at all, it's basically a 'level skip cheat' It seems to be as though the developers really do not care about fixing this for the players.\n\nIt's an honest shame, because while the game is enjoyable - I would really not recommend anyone buying it. At least not until the developers actually care enough to fix this bug - and it is a bug no matter how much they want to deny that.\n\ntl;dr: Don't buy this game until they have fixed the MAJOR errors in it.\nOtherwise is really is a great game.","August 15, 2014","false","12.6"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","1"

Great, now we can talk about the game itself.\n\nWilliam H. Stanton, aka you, find yourself face to face with an old childhood friend Edgar, who seems very scared and gives you an item to take care of and keep away from him under any circumstances. Right after him, a doctor barges in to tell you that Edgar has gone mad and needs to report to him for a medical care. And of course, being the great friend he is, Willy goes on the quest of saving his friend from whatever madness he descended into.\n\nBecause the game is based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft, I was excited to play this game expecting an interesting and intriguing story. While the game does have it's moments where the story seems to be heading in the right direction, more often than not, it just makes no sense and is all over the place. One thing that I didn't like in the way storyline progresses is that you are always expected to do one thing and one thing only to keep the story going and until you do that you can't move on; it is very linear in the way of what you need to do. The puzzles are very difficult to understand and to solve some of them I had to look up a FAQ because I was lost.\n\nThe graphics are not very good, but considering this is a 15 year old game, that's not unusual. The voice acting is actually really good, but there are no subtitles, which can be a problem because some of the characters talk weird and you may not be able to understand them at times. The sounds of the game and the background music do a really good job of creating a suspense and eerie atmosphere throughout the game which is always a plus.\n\nI haven't encountered any bugs, apart from the one already mentioned in the link above, so at least that is not broken (too much). It took me about 7 hours to finish, but bear in mind I wasted at least 2 hours on the puzzle brainstorming.\n\n+ Good atmosphere and sounds\n+ voice acting\n+ H.P. Lovecraft inspired lore\n\n- linear and broken story\n- plastic graphics\n- difficult to understand puzzles\n- no subtitles\n\nI would only recommend this game to adventure lovers, everyone else should probably be better off playing something else.   5/10","January 24","false","7.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

You might be able to figure some things out by logic or just clicking around but sometimes they do give you hints that save you time. It's a good practirse to save all the time anyway if not have multiple save files. PS - I loved the part with the guy that gets angry at you for ringing the doorbell.

The game play  issues with the game are the problems towards the end where you cannot get an important piece from an alchemist set you find earlier in the game; it is EXTREMELY frustrating. Also it is point and click game with short cut aways. However with that said, I think people are being too hard on the game. If you have no experience in reading Lovecraft this probably is not the game for you. It is not especially violent or typical of most games that are popular right now, slow and lots of reading/puzzles but with a very well done creepy feel.

The overall game is pretty fun, though there are only what appear to be a few voice actors out of the 20 talking characters in the game, making it somewhat cheesy sometimes (Much like Lovecraft's work). There is also a game breaking glitch toward the end of the game making it impossible to finish. This isn't even worth the time getting it at such a low price.

Thrilling. Not.\n\nVery little guidance, no clues.\n\nThe puzzles, as other reviewers have mentioned are tedious. It's not that they require more attention or cleverness than other games, it is simply a matter of having to attempt everything that you can possibly attempt in order to advance to the next one. That is infuriatingly difficult because every scene looks identical to the next, every character has the same graphics, every voice has the same terrible voice actor. You'll retrace your steps many times, and eventually give up. This is not a game, it's a piece of software intended to induce anger.\n\nGo ahead, find this review unhelpful. In what way am I not helping you understand that this game is utterly awful? Do not buy it. Don't even finish reading this review, just run away.\n\nIf it's true that Steam are preventing the developer from making updates that is terrible. The fair thing would have been to remove this game from the catalog. Stop offering it in bundles. Stop selling it. It's just a testament to Steam's poor screening process from back in the day.\n\nI thought I told you to stop reading this.

At least that is, until it's patched (if that /ever/ happens considering this seems to be nothing more than a shoddy re-release of a game that came out 13 years ago)\n\nI will say I enjoyed the atmosphere of the game, and the tie ins to H.P. Lovecraft were great (this is why I bought the game in the first place). However, this left such a sour taste in my mouth (even for $2.99!). I ended up enlisting the help of a walkthrough about halfway through the game, which was noting cutscenes that weren't in the game. From what I can tell, these cutscenes and events made up the meat of the plot and eerieness.\nQuoted from the walkthrough, "Catch your breath, as this is probably the freakiest part of the whole game." I was excited, finally something was happening. Alas, all the "freaky" parts were taken out. Why even bother? This feels like a decent horror flick being shown on cable. It's there, you can watch it, but all the good stuff is censored or gone altogether.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the game breaking bug at the END OF THE GAME. I took my sweet time getting through this, reading all of the literature and enjoying the atmosphere, and finally the end was approaching. Except, I'll never get to see it. That's just icing on the cake. If this is patched, adding in the missing cutscenes and fixing the horrid bugs, I'll recommend it.

This game will sap your sanity and make you lose your mind, just like the works of HP Lovecraft it oft porports to be inspired by. However, this is not because the game is scary, but simply because it's puzzles are so mind-numbingly boring, tedious, and oftentimes unsolvable by way of infuriating bugs and awful game design. The characters in this game, such as they are, are even flatter and less believable than Lovecraft's own, with stilted voice acting and stuttering, puppety models that look like they were all controlled by tiny spiders, rather than any kind of individual personality. The most competently voice acting role in the game comes in the form of a brain in a jar, whose performance is the most human and sane of all of the characters. However, even a stellar performance (of which this was not) could not save the droning, boring dialogue the actor had to read.\n\nThe story, which I am assured exists, judging by the story credits that come with the game, is a completely incomprehensible retelling of the Case of Charles Dexter Ward. There are several discrepancies that point towards the creator of the game being ignorant of occult symbology, such as the inclusion of the Star of David as an evil, occult symbol. I am convinced that this was an inclusion made from a place of ignorance rather than malice, as there are no signs of any Zionist Conspiracy theory that I could understand within the game's text.\n\nThe graphics, though spartan and often incomprehensible, a running theme with this game, are also bland and inoffensive, lacking even the slightest spark of art direction or competency.\n\nThe most notable aspect of this game is the bugs. Several, large, game-breaking monstrous bugs that thankfully render the game unplayable past the library scene. Having watched a longplay of the remaining gameplay, I felt truly blessed that I did not have to suffer the game further.\n\nOn a more positive note, having played several other bad games recently, this game has made me think twice about their quality. They shine in comparison to this one, and I will count my blessings every time I suffer through another bad game, because truly they could not have been as bad as this one.\n\nLike the titular Necronomicon, this game contains ye liveliest awfulness, and perusing it for more than a couple of seconds will destroy a man's soul and render him insane. For that, I commend the creators, for they have crafted an experience of mind-destroying awfulness and incomprehensible realities which man was not meant to view. Beware, player, for if you dredge this awful beast up from it's essential salts, have on hand something that you can put it down with.","November 12, 2014","false","3.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
