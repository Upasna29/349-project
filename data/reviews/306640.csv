Infantry units can hide in forests, buildings and fortifications, from which they can only be seen if enemy infantry moves into an adjacent space, a rare scout unit moves in, or they open fire on an enemy that gets too close.  Infantry are also equipped with a limited number of anti-tank charges.  You can see where I'm going with this.  This system creates some of the most impressive and intense urban combat I've seen outside of an FPS, with machine guns and armor laying down massive amounts of supressing fire at suspected enemy positions while an infantry squad sneaks up to the building to confirm that the enemy is actually there and then assault them, clearing the way for the tanks to move down the road.\n\nBattle Academy 2 is a small-scale turn-based tactical game, where individual squads and vehicles are used on a square-based map, instead of the now standard hexagon.  but the different movement system works just as well, with the added bonus of not looking terrifyingly complex.  Come on, wargamers, you know your eyes bugged out a little the first time you saw a giant map covered in hexagons.  No, just me?  Okay...\n\nAnyway, despite the nonstandard level design, BA2's combat system carries itself very well, tracking everything from the varying thickness of armor on different parts of a vehicle to unit morale, which if reduced far enough can lead troops to hunker down, run, or even surrender, effectively destroying a unit simply by shooting at it enough.  Armored combat is very slow, with tanks rarely having over a 35% chance of destroying their target, and even that requires a good shot at the tank's side.  This then stresses the importance of infantry for getting in close and disabling a dug-in tank through close assault.  But then you have to decide between the long, hidden trek through the woods or the quick dash through the fields, not knowing weither or not the enemy has a machine gun team set up in that shack over there.  This game is about cover and concealment:  a rifle squad caught in the open is a rifle squad as good as dead, but a rifle squad tucked away in a house at an intersection is a roadblock that is going to make a serious mess out of any transports that happen to pass by.\n\nThe spotting system and the ability for units to fire during the enemy's turn if a target presents itself makes defense about positioning for maximum-range engagement, to keep the enemy in the dark as to your whereabouts, and offense about supression and movement.  Reducing an enemy's morale to 50% supresses them, which prevents them from employing reaction fire.  This means that one squad can keep the enemy's head down while the other moves up and starts firing while the other advances, bounding back and forth until they reach their target.\n\nOn the technical angle, BA2 is surprisingly well put-together for a launch-day game these days.  Five hours in and I have encountered three very minor bugs: a T-34 texture not loading properly, resulting in a cyan and pink piece of armor that I dubbed my party tank, a single line of text that repeats itself, and a minor glitch with the UI that makes the move/attack options menu deactivate if you scroll over an option that overlaps the bottom HUD (fixable by moving the camera so the space you clicked is closer to the middle of the screen.)\n\nOverall, Battle Academy 2: Eastern Front is a well-done game that stays out of simulator territory while still offering a large amount of depth on a small-scale battlefield where every unit counts.\n\nRecommended for: Hardcore wargamers, hobby wargamers, budding wargamers, WWII enthusiasts, Advance Wars veterans looking for something bigger.","September 13, 2014","true","12.0"," 64 of 73 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","64","73","0","0"

I've been playing it on the road for work and it has been consistently compelling and engaging.  Most of the battles last about an hour, which is perfect for those moments in between pressing responsibilities.\n\nIt's a Slitherine game, and though in the past its games have been known for their impenetrable 'hardcore' factor, BA2 is rather accessible.  I'm convinced that over the last few years Slitherine has begun a concerted effort to expand its playerbase.  Many hardcore wargamers are loyal to a fault and will buy anything it presses, but that's not enough to weather the modern global market.\n\nProbably the most significant element that sets BA2 apart from Slitherine wargames of the past is the simplicity of its UI.  Large, colorful, intuitive buttons with descriptive graphics allow you to move your units, choose their actions, track their ammo and morale, and engage their distinctive abilities.\n\nLike any Slitherine game, the math beyond the buttons is complex and somewhat deterministic- but you don't have to understand all that to jump in and play.  Every unit has particular strengths, weaknesses, and strategic or tactical significance- and you'll come to understand their uses through playing.  For example, taking low-effectiveness shots with a limited ammo unit generally does nothing other than expose your unit (which may be useful to draw attention away from your other units).  You don't have to read a huge manual, and learning the differences among the units is quite enjoyable.  If you find the learning curve too challenging, there are several lower settings to give yourself tactical advantages while you learn.\n\nSo what sets BA2 apart from the first game? That's a good question.  The first game is also brilliant and I also recommend it.  It may be worth playing it through as a beginner course.  BA2 has so much more content it'll make your head spin when you upgrade from BA1.  Many more units, many more battlefields- most of which come with the base game, though some extra campaigns require purchase- and most of the good community scenario makers and modders have moved up to BA2 as well.  The huge number of units and maps (including a map generator) makes for a much greater variety of gameplay, offering nearly limitless replayability.  The secondary objectives in the scenarios are often much more difficult than the primary objective and often require a few playthroughs to fully realize.\n\nBut the bottom line is that all these many precision gameplay elements come together to make a game that is consistently FUN.  It can be frustrating but it's never a headache.  The graphics are passable, the music is too, and every battle is full of that delightful tension that comes from victory never being a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe fact that this game is also available for iOS ends the debate over the worthiness of cross-platform games as far as I'm concerned.\n\n9/10- must own for wargamers, WWII enthusiasts (especially lovers of the Eastern Front), TBS lovers, or even squad-based strategy gamers.  Especially recommended for gamers looking for a welcoming way in to wargaming.\n\nNo Drama, Just Reviews","May 24, 2015","true","4.5"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","43","52","2","8"

Don't be fooled by the simplified graphics, the game has some excellent combat mechanics which allow players to apply real-world tactics of fire and maneuver.\n\nIn my opinion, the best additions to Battle Academy 2 were the addition of Skirmish Mode as well as Cooperative Multiplayer. I'm glad Slitherine has finally listened to its fanbase and added these two much-awaited features. After all these years of playing Close Combat, I can finally enjoy a game with friends - skirmish mode also adds endless possibilities of fighting with random maps and missions.\n\nHonorable mention also goes to the new soundtrack - a mix of strong and emotional music that I think fits very well with the harsh fighting of the East Front.","September 14, 2014","true","123.5"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

Initially the borderline cartoonish look of "Battle Academy 2" didn't appeal to me, however once I started playing I was completely hooked. I actually managed an eight and a half hour stream, a good portion of that was spent playing "Battle Academy 2".  For those of you familiar with "Pike and Shot" this game does have some similarities, particularly troop placement.  Although at first the artwork didn't appeal to me, after my first night raid as German Commandos during Barbarossa, I actually found myself slowly going around the map, just to take in my surroundings.\n\nAnother added bonus "This is major for me" is the ability to see your dead enemy infantry, as well as burning vehicles. There's nothing that bothers me more than to take out a tank in a WW2 game and for it to "Dissapear" suddenly. My defense of Voronezh left the field littered with frozen german bodies and the hulking skeletal remains of their torched out machines. I definitely recommend a buy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSaj0h2kypM","August 26, 2015","true","32.0"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","25","29","2","0"

It's ideal for beginners as well as experienced players, and while grognards may only play it with the curtains closed and everyone out of the house, they will enjoy it. It's the second game in the series, which started with western Europe and North Africa, and in this game branches out to the Eastern Front. Some UI elements are streamlined, and of course there are new units and terrain, but it holds to the same level of quality and engagement the previous game had.\n\nIt's a tactical turn-based game in the "I go you go" style. The maps are attractive and terrain is meaningful; units can be hidden in certain circumstances, and often benefit from the terrain they are in defensively. There are many different units, all rendered as if they were detailed miniatures, and loads of variety in the units, so there is always something different to each scenario besides the terrain. The scenarios advance through time in particular campaigns, and they portray the larger tide of the war through each tactical engagement.\n\nMostly, though, the game is *fun*. There's nail-biting tension as you realize you've over-extended and are being counter-attacked, and desk-pounding frustration as your third unit fails to take a strong point at the end of your turn, making a bitter counter-attack inevitable. The tactical problems are engaging, but not punishing.\n\nA great game for both avid wargamers and turn-based noobs.

I would rate this game at 8 of 10 stars.  First off, you must like the subject matter and genre to thouroughly enjoy the game, although you might aquire a taste after having played it and studied the history as well.\n\nThe game strong point is the challenging AI, I find it so well programmed that it is very entertaining finding a way to victory, hard to survive poor decisions as well. Don't lose that heavy tank or you're doomed, might be a concern in some scenarios. Very well thought out and 'realistic' in that sense.\n\nThe graphics are, 3D and top down as well, functional, but for me they're too "cartoonish", I'd love a top down with military icons with easier way to contrast units. Sometimes it is hard for me to find a unit behind the trees if I'm not careful.\n\nUser interface works well and is easy to learn.  Everything you need to do is easy to access. I do find having to use the keyboard for some functions an unneccessary chore that should be accomplished by mouse (rotating the screen clockwise for example).\n\nThe gameplay. It's wonderful and tough (how hard can be adjusted) and fun. Lots of units and choices to make before the battle starts. You can play a campaign, or go to skirmish mode - which in itself is quite flexible or you can even create and edit your own scenarios. If you understand how things work in WW2, you'll get an idea of how to use your units in this game. Every unit is important if you use it correctly. Air power and Air Superiority are included as options as well.  Overall this reminds me of an updated SSI title, Panzer Strike! Well done.\n\nIf I could change anything I'd change the graphics or at least offer an optional graphic format (perhaps 3rd party can do this too?), however it isn't bad, it's just not my preference. Otherwise great job, great game, this is an easy "thumbs up" - Greg","September 17, 2014","true","41.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

This is not a Gary Grigsby's War in the East or War in the Pacific style wargame - it is not daunting and it is not deep. They key here is that it is accessible and fun for everyone.\n\nA few quick examples:\n\n1. The scenario design is good, with significant variety between them all and presents unique challenges.\n\n2. The unit variety is also excellent considering the depth of this wargame. New people to the genre may have some difficulty with understanding the differences between the units, but the game does a fairly good job at explaining the units and their relative strong and weak points. The extreme history buffs will have no issue with this.\n\n3. The top selling point must be the skirmish feature, which allows a quick game over a beer after work and provides some great replayability after completing the campaigns.\n\nI don't think anyone will regret purchasing this game, I certainly haven't.\n\nThanks!\n","January 3, 2015","true","33.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

If you are looking for a good eastern front game with a half decent AI, that has turn based strategy-look no further.  This is the game for you!\nPros:\nThe sound effects and music are first rate.\nI love the simple but effective graphics this game has-the vehicles and units are accurate down to the ski-infantry Russian units.  Even on my low end computer the graphics are pretty good with burning vehicles and dead soldiers everywhere.  Beware this is not a "Put your head down close your eyes and go in!" type of game.  You have to use your scouts and recon units to find enemy units then know exactly when to fire on them.  I wait unitll my units can see "the whites of their eyes" before I let them fire and expose their position.  Once the AI sees your units look out it is like having Guderian chase you all the way to Smolensk.  You will have to employ tactices of fire and move otherwise your exposed units are at the mercy of German or Russian long range guns.  This game has an excellent in game skirmish mode.  I have tried to get it to generate the same map twice to no avail.  Allowing you to choose the size of the map, the year and the location-plains, urban, Russian snow has great advantages and replay value including allowing you to choose how many cammands points you can start with to purchase units with.  I have looked at the in game editor and it is great.  Just waiting for a good manual to be put out before I start putting together my first map.\nCons:\nHope the developers update this and allow units to traverse more rough terrain.  Tanks right now can't enter woods, cross hedgerows or destroy buildings and all units can't pass through each other on their way to the next hex.  It would be nice to be able to have engineers lay mines.  Right now they can clear them.  The AI can be a little predictable at times but otherwise not bad.\nDefinitely a game I will be spending alot of time playing.","April 19, 2015","true","78.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

I simply can't get enough of this World War 2 tactical sim. It has it all: Every flavor of infantry and every type of Tank, Assault Gun, and APC. It even allows you (and the AI) to call in Artillery Strikes and Air Strikes.\nWhile it is turn-based IGO-UGO, units belonging to the player who is not moving get reaction fire, so moving up to the enemy's position is tricky. You need to maneuver properly, using ground cover and even smoke to cover your approach. A little prep fire from your tanks, mortars and artillery isn't a bad idea either. ;-)\nThe AI is way better than average and at the normal level will give even the best player a bloody nose if they are not careful.\nThe game ships with several campaigns (2 as the Germans, and 2 as the Russians) and a skirmish mode so that you can fight random battles, so there's a ton of play time right out of the box. I'm playing the first campaign as the Germans and I'm 18 hours in and about half done. The publisher has also promised more content down the road.\nEach battle in the campaign so far has had a unique flavor. These aren't just the same battle fought over and over. And the historical context makes you feel like you're actually there, facing the challenges that a Commander in World War 2 would have faced.\nI have played most WW2 tactical games and believe that this is the best of them all. If you enjoyed Steel Panthers, Squad Leader, Close Assault, Conflict of Heroes, you will want to pick up this game.\nHighly Recommended!","September 24, 2014","true","177.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Do you remember Eastern Front and Western Front from Talonsoft back in the early noughties? Well BA2EF mimics these excellent games in many ways, but obviously modernises them at the same time. Historical realism is the major goal of the devs and is to be applauded, hence we have a game that is suitable for both the historical wargamer and newcomers alike - the latter will learn from this game what really happened on the Eastern Front.\nUnlike many games that solely concentrate on one campaign, or even just one battle, you get it all here - so you can play in any year with the relevant vehicles and guns between 1941-45. So you don't need to fork out a small fortune on dlc with this one - the only add on was the Battle of Kursk which as it was such a massive camapign is an understandable add-on. Hopefully more campains will follow, but I reiterate you already have most of the tanks etc and thanks to the brilliant battle generator you can use them without buying dlc if you so wish.\nCombat is deep and immersive and you really have to understand the succesful tactics used by both sides and play to their strengths - combined arms tactics are necessary to succeed. The maps and 3d units are impressive as are the damage fx. You need to take into account armour facing of tanks too.  Like I said at the beginning; it's almost as if Talonsofts Eastern Front has been reborn, but also improved 100%.

Battle Academy is not as deep as ASL, but it sure has a similar feel.  If you are newer to turned-based tactical war games then there is no better place to start than Battle Academy 2.  The design of the game makes getting into the fray relatively easy, but it at the same time allows you to discover the depth of the game the more you play.  If you are already familiar with the original Battle Academy then getting the newest version is a no brainer.  The skirmish mode itself is well worth the upgrade price, but even with that aside the additions of smoke, partial armor damage and overrun adds welcome detail to the original basic game.  I like the new realistic graphics over the more cartoonish original, but just the same don't expect a photo-realistic look.  BA is just not about that.  It will however provide some surprising nail-biting moments as you battle with a competent AI.  Use realistic scout, suppression and flanking movement or you will watch your squads melt away.  Support your armor in urban or forested terrain or you will fall victim to well placed AI ambushes.

The entire campaign is just pretty overkill and very long.\n\nOne of the best new features is the fan made maps and how easy it is for you to just install them. much credit for that little feature though I have yet to try it. Having a lot of fun with BA2 and its well worth its price tag","March 1","true","78.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Some enhancements, but generally more of what you came to the franchise for.  I was concerned that being stuck on the Eastern Front would be unpleasant (everyone on Hogan's Heroes seemed to think so), but it was actually interesting.  While not the most technologically advanced group at the time, the Soviets were very innovative when it came to thinking up ways to stop the German advance.  Molotov cocktails, tactical (prop-driven) snow-mobiles.  Good times.","June 12, 2015","true","47.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

At first look, this game is a simple grid-based turn-based strategy game -- move your units and shoot the bad dudes. At second look, it is an encyclopedia on armour penetration at different ranges. At third look, it is the logistical puzzle of keeping your troops in fighting condition while providing support via call-ins. The more you keep looking, the more aspects you realize. This creates an experience that is deep and immersive, while being easy to pick up and play.\n\nThis game boasts a great unit variety for Germany and the CCCP through 1940 to 1945. The Campaign carries you through the war as either of the two nations, allowing the user to keep units from mission to mission and purchase them at will. If that is not enough replayability, there is also a custom battle and map generator. The fun never ends?\n\nThis game has a comic book art style mixed with sub-par graphics and a tablet GUI. I do not like any of these creative choices. The comic book style takes me out of the wear-and-tear of the Eastern Front. The Tablet GUI is clunky and sometimes down-right infuriating. These issues are what prevents this game from being a classic.\n","May 26","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a fan of Epic 40k, Flames of War, etc, but I don't have much time to play with friends. I searched high and low for the closest thing I could find to a tabletop miniatures game, and Battle Academy is what I settled on.\n\nGlad I did. It's a great game. Tons of fun to play both the single player campaign and against other players in online multiplayer. The PBEM multiplayer interface is easy and seamless. Play your turn whenever you have time.\n\nI just love everything about this game. I paid full price for it and have no regrets.
