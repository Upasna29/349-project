I’d like to, as I quite enjoy FF5 and I was hoping for a nice updated version, but this has too many issues to make it worth your while. It isn’t that it is a mobile port, but a bad mobile port. It just does not look or perform that well on the PC. It isn’t awful, but I just don’t feel like it really justifies purchasing the “update” in this state.\n\nTo break down specifics:\n\nThe Good:\n--Nice updated sprites.\n--Supports keyboard and controller and does a decent job on both, they can both be fully remapped.\n--More features than the Super Famicom/PSX version.\n\nThe Mediocre:\n--No music remaster. The music is just a recorded version of the SPC700 soundtrack. They didn’t redo it using modern samples or a live orchestra.\n--Character portraits look almost nothing like their in game sprites.\n\nThe Bad:\n--Very obvious tile seams. The tile graphics were updated along with everything else, but they do not tile smoothly. You can see really, really, obvious seams between most tiles on the map.\n--Wonky fonts. The fonts are not anti-aliased for whatever reason, and they don’t line up well, so they look strange/jerky.\n--Problematic fullscreen support. On the system I tested it on, which is Windows 10 with a GeForce, it won’t go fullscreen. The game’s GL plugin NeHe GL says the fullscreen mode isn’t supported, no matter what that mode is, despite fullscreen working fine in other titles. Also, this means it uses OpenGL despite listing DX10 as the requirement.\n--Looks like it only runs at 30fps. I haven’t put a counter on it to confirm, but it is far too jerky when scrolling for a nice 60fps game.\n\nIt just seems really half-baked. It isn’t awful. If you want to play FF5 on your PC it’ll do the trick, but it is not a very competent port at this point. It looks like they just grabbed the mobile code and did the bare minimum to make it run on Windows. I’d give it a miss, personally.","September 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 660 of 950 people (69%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","69","660","950","26","57"

I would love to recommend it to newcomers, but this port is a mess.  I have high hopes that the fans will eventually polish it into something playable, but in its current state it's almost unbearable.  I'm fine with the new sprites and it's a joy to see such large Amano portraits, but there's an issue going on where literally none of the tilesets properly align.  Every screen is an ugly visible gridwork of jumbled tiles.  I don't ask for a lot when it comes to these lazy SE ports, but when even the shoddiest RPG Maker games look better, that's a problem.  That SE released the game in this state is shameful.\n\nIf they address this issue themselves I'll give it a proper recommendation, but for now I'd advise anyone on the fence to pass.","September 24, 2015","false","18.6"," 192 of 263 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","192","263","4","1"

While the plot is fairly bare, the characters are cool and the storytelling full of that old-school JRPG charm from the days before everything became about anime and angst. The gameplay sets it as one of the most-solid games in the franchise, both for its dungeon design and combat/skill mechanics. The job system introduced in Final Fantasy III returns here with a flexible cross-job skill system and there's a reason this same set of mechanics would appear in later Square games such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy XI, and Bravely Default.\n\nThe reason this review is negative is because of this port in particular. It could not be more obvious that the graphics in this version were designed for a smaller screen--at most HD-or-higher resolutions you can clearly see many of the seams between environment tiles, even in objects such as the skull-and-crossbones banner or the meteorite that crash-lands at the start of the game. The art style used for the character sprites is also weird and jarring when set alongside the animations used in the original FF5, which are almost entirely unchanged here to suit the art change. To cap it off, the jarring dissonance between the Yoshitaka Amano stylized dialogue portraits and characters' sprite designs, which bothered me in the GameBoy Advance version, is more obvious than ever here, in spite of some of the sprite designs having been altered to closer resemble Amano's designs (Galuf's new sprite, for example, has a mustache rather than a beard, and it looks pretty good).\n\nAdding insult to injury, Square once again couldn't be half-arsed to license a decent text font for the game, so as with previous mobile/Steam remakes and ports, the text font is jarringly stock and unstylized against the admittedly nice menu and textbox designs. Between this and the environment tile seam problem, this port of the mobile remake ends up feeling like an incredibly amateurish RPG Maker rebuild of the game.\n\nThankfully I haven't had any of the screen-tearing issues reported in other reviews and fullscreen mode seems to work just fine. (I am running an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760, for the record.) I need to play further through this version of the game to be one hundred percent sure, but it at least seems to be solid on a technical level, although it's definitely not playing at 60fps--not that this bothers me in a game where most animations are three frames long at best anyway.\n\nStill, if you're going for the all-in Final Fantasy V experience, you're better off playing the GameBoy Advance version--all of the content with almost none of the problems, and even the text font looks better. I sincerely hope Square pays attention to the negative reception this version has received and smooths out the graphics, but just in case... are any of you intrepid fan-patch-makers up for smoothing out the graphics, maybe?","September 24, 2015","false","2.7"," 165 of 242 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","165","242","6","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scauthra/recommended/382890/","Scauthra","Sly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scauthra/","141 products in account","It really bugs me that so many of the reviews that tell you to not play this game have placed less than an hour into it. I was a big critic of the art style when I saw FFV hit the Steam Store, but since it's my second favorite in the series I wanted a go at it again. I've played the GBA version and an emulated version. Now for some points.\n\nI can say with certainty if you liked FFV, you'll enjoy this adaptation. The artwork is not so bad after all. I have quite enjoyed the animations used. Watching Faris as a Monk using a spell. it just works. It does not feel odd or out of place. It does not feel rushed. Story animations are as funny or sorrowful as they were in the SNES version. The music is not remastered, but that does not take away any points. It's exactly the soundtrack you fell in love with before. And if you're new to FFV, you wont be dissapointed. People in the reviews encourage you to go emulate the game because it's better. At this point, it does not matter what version of the game you play, it's still FFV at it's core.\n\nIf you never played FFV, let me just say the job system will sell you on this game. It's fun, addicting and it will push you to mix things up. You unlock a lot of jobs really fast, so you're not stuck being just a simple mage, or just a fighter. Most fights can't just be spammed auto attacks and win, you have to go into them with some thought.\n\nBy the end of the day, if you like RPGs, depths, or Final Fantasy games. Get it. Enjoy it, and don't worry about the sub 1 hour reviews throwing a hissy fit.","September 25, 2015","true","39.3"," 214 of 320 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","214","320","6","9"

If the screenshots weren't indication enough, it just looks incredibly shoddy.\n\nI'm among the minority when I say I actually like the character portraits in the dialog boxes because that is the original art design for the game. It was hard to convey that level of detail in pixel form which explains why all the characters have wonky, vibrant colors on their clothing and outrageous hair colors. For example, Terra's hair in Final Fantasy VI isn't even green, it's blonde like Celes' but they had to give the character some kind of uniqueness other than the clothes they wear. Faris should technically look more like Edgar from FFVI as well but then people would get confused.\n\nUntil a true 3D remake is realized, this is as good as it's going to get. I can understand where Square was going with this, they wanted to keep the nostalgia alive and honestly, they did a good job on that front. The game literally plays identical to it's Famicom counterpart, the way the characters move, the way the cutscenes play out and of course, the untainted original soundtrack (which I'm actually thankful for because that Walse theme is tight)\n\nEnemy sprites are just insanely well done, the character sprites however are lackluster and that's really a shame considering how much exposure they get so quickly. You literally aquire all 4 party members within a half an hour of gameplay and aquire your first 6 jobs in about an hour. I always remembered switching jobs and looking different was a fun process but considering how tacky the models look in this game, some of the uglier job costumes look even uglier.\n\nIf you have an itch to re-play Final Fantasy V, then I would look for a discount, I got mine from GMG. You could also just grab an emulated version because the new jobs (from the GBA version) are garbage and you aquire them way too late in to the game for them to have any kind of relevant impact on your success. I never did like the tacked on crap that artificially extended the games beyond the final dungeons... that stuff is meant for newer age games, not retro stuff, it just doesn't fit and seems really corny. I was never a fan of artifically extending the life of video games any way... like collectables and junk... waste of time.\n\nIf you've never played Final Fantasy V in your life, I'd suggest getting it if you REALLY want the experience... however, I would recommened both parties not buy it at full price and try not to support this level of incompetence. We'll never get proper remakes of these games (FFV and VI) if people keep supporting garbage that's just barely passable.","September 27, 2015","false","21.0"," 127 of 191 people (66%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","66","127","191","10","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/382890/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Final Fantasy VDeveloper: Square-Enix\nPublisher: Square-Enix\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nFinal Fantasy V is the fifth and in my opinion a very underrated entry in the esteemed Final Fantasy franchise. It took the Job System introduced in Final Fantasy III and refined it, delivering a highly customizable and adaptive experience for the player. It also features a small handful of memorable characters, and doesn't fall prey to "the REAL villian comes out of nowhere at the end" trope that a handful of RPGs typically use.\n\nThe Steam version is based on the iOS port, and as such comes with the bugs, flaws, and complaints that version had. The most notable of which are the character portraits and character sprites. Put those minor complaints aside, and you have yourself a great RPG. Please do not let the graphics put you off of this grand adventure!\n\nGameplay\n==========\nAs said above, Final Fantasy V takes the Job System of Final Fantasy III and improved it. Instead of the formulaic, behind-the-scenes way FF3 handled how Jobs leveled up, FFV favors a simpler approach. After every battle you earn Experience Points, Gil, and Job Points. Every Job levels up a few times, and each level requires more and more Job Points. The first level can be anywhere between 10 and 30 Job Points, depending on the Job, and as they level higher, you may see numbers like 150, 200, or even 999 for a select few Jobs! As you gain levels in each Job, you learn an ability from that Job that you can then assign to your characters even when they are not using that job. This opens up a plethora of customization opportunites and different playstyles.\n\nAs for the game itself, the game utilizes the tried and true turn-based ATB system. When the ATB gauge fills up you are able to give commands to your party, then wait for the gauge to fill up again to take another action. Basic stuff, but it works very well. There are a lot of abilities and spells to learn, including White Magic, Black Magic, Blue Magic, Songs, Summons, and Time Magic. All of these can be mixed and matched in the Job System to create some truly flexible battle setups. While the game doesn't really present any truly challenging battles (apart from the super bosses), much of the game can be completed with a simple setup like 2 Knights, a White Mage, and a Black Mage.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThis version comes with updated sprites and character portraits. This is a point of contention with some of the playerbase, as many do not like the "new look". For those where this is a major concern, a mod was created that you can find online that replaced the character portraits with art that matches the sprites. Barring that complaint, the rest of the game looks okay. In some areas you can clearly see the borders of each tile, and in some places it sticks out like a sore thumb. This was another complaint. While not major, it's VERY noticeable, and depending on how you are or how you like your games to look, this may or may not be a problem. Check out the game's screenshots before making a buying decision.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nAnother game soundtrack composed by the legendary Nobuo Uematsu! Final Fantasy V has some iconic themes of it's own, such as Battle on the Big Bridge. Each track contributes to the situation at hand and enhances the player's attachment to the characters and story. This is music done right. Here's Battle on the Big Bridge:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0JnXdfoYpY\n\nSound effects are pretty basic, but do their job. Nothing really groundbreaking, but the soundtrack more than makes up for the shortcomings in the sound effects department.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nPC specs are on my profile. The game ran very well, no major problems occured. It's an older RPG, so FPS isn't really a concern in this case. I used a Logitech F310 controller for the entirety of my playthough, and it worked just fine by default. Didn't have to change anything for it to work properly.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nIf you never got the chance to play Final Fantasy V back in the day, this would be a great opportunity to do so. Great characters, great story, and a superb character customization system makes Final Fantasy V a fantastic entry in the series...although it is frequently overlooked. Don't make that mistake, give it a shot!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nThis video is intended to show off the job system and how customizable it is. Apologies for the border, apparently FF5 and Shadowplay don't play nice together.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23aOBz_shfI\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 9","true","23.4"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","35","44","0","3"

An RPG Maker game would be more consistent. Plus, the sprites seem amateurish compared to earlier remakes, especially since the chatbox heads don't fit at all with them (everybody has white hair). Overall, the GBA remake has better graphics in every point, and that was quite a while ago.\n\nGameplay: Controls are pretty fluid, though the eight-directional feature seems pretty weird and out of place. The combat is also a significiant notch below earlier remakes due to the fact that you have to press the button each time you want to do an action, as opposed to holding it.  You also can't run, and the texts are slow.  Again, the GBA remake is better.\n\nUI: It may be touch-control friendly but on PC, it's just too big and invasive. GBA wins again.\n\nAudio: Literally the only instance where it's actually better than the GBA remake; the audio in this is absolutely beautiful for most tracks. Some musics are badly mixed though, like Battle on Big Bridge where it sounds like they didn't know whether to make it mono or stereo and decided to just make it cavernous in order to hide their doubts.\n\nOverall: Just get the GBA remake, even if you're a big-time fan. You can just listen to the OST later on Youtube.\n\nUPDATE: Tried out different resolutions and on 720p, the environmental graphics are actually pretty good.\n\nUPDATE #2: You can actually run, but only if you have a Thief in your party.","September 24, 2015","false","42.8"," 202 of 327 people (62%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","62","202","327","19","24"

No vsync option because of sheer laziness by the devs. So if you like exiting the game to go into your GPU's control panel to force vsync on and then off after you finish, have fun.\n- Tiles in a lot of areas have severe outlines. Even the grass tiles have outlines! Maybe Square Enix should have used RPG Maker to redo FFV. They would have had a better looking game. >.>\n- Textures in some areas don't even match the other textures next to them. Imagine this. You have 2 textures with a smooth pattern connected to each other. Now rotate one of them 90 degrees and they will look out of place next to each other.

Now before I go any further, I should establish that I have enjoyed almost every main-line FF game. The sole exceptions are II, XI, and XIV, and that's mainly because I don't play MMOs. FFV is something special because everything clicks. This is one of those rare games where every aspect is perfect. "Every aspect is perfect". Wait... what? Why not just say "FFV is a perfect game"? Uhhh...huh. To this I say that if FFV is a perfect game, then what would be the point of playing other games unless they too were perfect? Would I be able to devote an equal amount of time to all these perfect games? Would one game be more perfect than the other? Besides, today's perfection is tomorrow's mediocrity. We should all strive to-ENOUGH!\n\nHow about we focus on actually discussing FFV? God frikkin' dammit!\n\nThis entry in the series is notable for its Job system. Early on, the four warriors of light are introduced to the crystal shards. These allow the heroes to change their job(class) at any moment outside of combat. While FFIII did it first, FFV expands upon the system, by allowing players to mix and match abilities. So your White Mage, who usually twiddles their thumbs during a random encounter, can use their bare hands almost as well as any Monk. The trade-off is that White Mages don't get the Monk's large HP pool. In any case, this system allows players innumerable options for dealing with monsters. Grinding, as always, is a last resort. If your party is failing to beat a boss, maybe their jobs need to be changed, or their abilities aren't adaptable.\n\nWhile I applaud Square-Enix for adding additional content to FFV: Advance (which this port is loosely based-on), I'm not too fond of the end/post-game. As any FFV fan will tell you, a party of Freelancers with every job mastered is absurdly over-powered. The original version of FFV takes note of this, hence the super-bosses Omega Weapon and Shinryu. FFV:A goes a few steps further with an additional dungeon, enhanced versions of those bosses, and a Super de-duper ultimate final boss to boot. Oh and everything loves to counter your !rapidfire attacks. After a certain point, it all becomes just a little absurd.\n\nSo let's take a step back and look at the main game, the "story mode" if you will. The real brilliance of the job system is not in combining all of the abilities to make super-boss smashing Gods, but in making for hundreds of ways to play through the game. The challenge-run is a long-standing Final Fantasy tradition. Ever played a party of all White Mages in FFI? A no-esper run in FFVI? FFV is hardly any different. This is an RPG that can be beaten with literally any combination of jobs. Yes, even a single berserker can defeat the final boss. They have to be level 99, have specialized equipment, and it's still a 1 in 249484140 chance, but it can be done. The point is, there is no wrong way to play through FFV. Your heroes can be whatever you want, and by using all of the tools available to you, you can see the game to the end.\n\nFFV also wisely chooses to avoid large cinematic set-pieces or overly-extensive conversations. This is a game made up almost entirely of overworld and dungeons. Later FF games have a lot of memorable sequences, but for me they don't hold up when being replayed. Take FFVI for example. I'm one of those rare players that prefers the second half of the game. I like the freedom that comes with exploring a world, choosing party-members, and building their abilities. The focus of FFV is exactly just that. Also, like with the other early FFs, this game is appropriately-paced. You can see and do everything in a reasonable amount of time. This, in my opinion, makes FF5 the kind of game that you could afford to devote one play-through a year to.\n\nAs for this port of the game...well...eh...I don't like it. At first I was stunned to silence by the awful interlacing, the frame-rate*, and the fact that mashing the fight command can sometimes lead to characters choosing to defend, switch rows, or ???? As I recall, the last time something like that happened was in FFIV: Advance, and I was not happy with that port either. After enough time, I got past these issues and beat this edition of the game, but it's still disappointing.\n\nI'm of mixed opinions on the sprites. As always, the enemies look great, but the characters look weird. Aside from the jarring inconsistencies (Why did they use Amano's artwork for the portraits?), the actual character sprites are just strange at times. To give an example: Bartz always has this "RAWR!" face whenever he raises his hands in the air. This happens at several points in the story, like when he's breaking free from something, celebrating, or is getting pumped up. This is getting really nitpicky, but it showcases what I prefer about FFV's original sprites. The characters in FFV are expected to show a wide range of emotions, but they're tiny sprites with a dozen animation frames between them. However, this simplicity works to the story's advantage, because you can always tell the current mood of the situation. With this version all I can think about is "Why does Bartz get angry so often?" as he gesticulates wildly like Stan S. Stanman.\n\nOverall, this port of FFV is serviceable, but it deserves better. This is a fantastic JRPG, one of the best of its kind, but it's the victim of yet another lazy port. Maybe one day Square-enix will get the bright idea to hire M2 or a similar team to do their previous games justice. Still, it could be worse...it could always be worse.\n\n*Yep. I will complain about the frame-rate in an RPG, especially if it's worse than the previous edition's.","February 20","true","36.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","20","22","3","0"

Before playing steam version, I have played the game on psone.\n\nThe story is very simple. First you need to save four crystals. After that you need to save the world by stopping main antagonist, who is simply just evil. Story is sometimes very serious, but it has a lot of funny moments so it's never too serious.\n\nJob system is awesome. You can choose one job class at a time for each of the four characters. Then you can train the job until you get skill that you like or until you master the job. I only wish that you could choose more skills on default class. You can choose two skills on default class or thee on one other class. Still mastering different jobs do pay off by giving better stats. It's just fun to master many different classes.\n\nI've noticed that some people have complained that game doesn't run smoothly. For me the counter said 60 fps all the time and I didn't notice any problems. Some people have complained that music is just the original music. I didn't mind that since I loved the music and it didn't need any fixing in my opinion. New sprites do look nice. I'm just happy that they didn't change animation much, since I loved the old animations. Only real issue for me in this game was when someone talked, there was a portray of the person talking. Most of these portrays didn't look anything like the character in the game.\n\nThis game had new classes and new dungeon compared to the psone version. New classes were nice and the dungeon seems cool. Unfortunately I haven't gone far in the dungeon yet, since you can enter there only after finishing the game.\n\nStill if you own any other version of the game and you are not hardcore fan of Final Fantasy V, I'm not sure if you should buy this version unless it's on sale. Steam version has only few new things added compared to psone version and I believe that compared to GBA or iOS version, this has even less new features.","October 20, 2015","true","48.0"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

It wasn't properly released stateside for many years and as a result very few played it compared to the vastly more popular 6 and 7.\n\n5 was a very natural progression of mechanics from 3 and 4. It took the job system from previous games and gave it a new spin. Now in 5 you could switch out your class at will. And you would gain XP in a particular class which would level it up and gain it abilities. Which you could swap in and out with other classes. It's a very modular game that lets you play it in whatever way you could concievably want. Like you can play the game with 4 warriors while still having 4 white mage skills attatched to them. You unlock jobs gradually throughout the game and there are even hidden ones.\n\nThe story to 5 feels like a spiritual predecessor to 6. It features things like multiple overworlds and a floating island at one point. But it's in general a more simple and straight forward story. It's a better paced and shorter game overall, and one that can appeal to newcomers of the franchise a lot more than some of the more intimidating later entries. The characters in 5 are all likeable and memorable enough. The only real thing I'd say that holds 5 back is the game feels a little samey overtime and I feel like if it lacked it's job system it would've really gotten dull. If you're exclusively playing FF5 for it's story it won't hold your attention as well as 6 and 7 do.\n\nThe port for FF5 on PC is based on the iOS remake that released some time ago. The sprites were completely redrawn alongside the user interface and character portraits. It also includes the additional content that came with the GBA port of FF5. I'd recommend finding a mod that disables the character portraits since they don't match the sprites and were based on the concept art for the game, so they look very out of place compared to the more modern sprites the game has. It also doesn't feature mouse control so if that's a turn off for you I'd suggest not purchasing this port.\n\nIt's a fine JRPG and if you can find it for a good price I recommend it a great deal.","April 24","true","15.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

The pace is fine bit of a slow start but actually one of the quicker ones in final fantasy games.\nDifficulty isnt really a thing, you will walk through the game and have a few difficult battles but unfortunately not many. The good news is that this has more to do with the sheer amount of different strategies you can use once you get into the game. This is owing to the job system which is my favourite in the main series though some of the off-shoots such as tactics are much more fun imo.","September 27, 2015","true","12.5"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","36","57","0","0"

Never do you feel it's oh so linear.  It feels like a game filled to the brim with everything.  A common complaint I heard is that this game feels like it never ends. But if you care about the world and enjoy the combat and just being in there. It's anything but a bad thing that the game is pretty long.\nA great match with having a lot to do is being able to make the party how you want it with its job system. Want lotsa melee? Want indirect attacks or magic oriented. Or a well thought out strategy of your own. Why not try it all?\n\nThese two together give this game a ridiculously high replay value.\n\nGameplay aside, the music is alright. (I prefer the GBA version probably due to nostalgia, but I feel like this soundtrack doesn't really want to be here. It's the SNES soundtrack for whoever didn't know.)  Still, some songs are still just lovely.\n\nLooks: ... well... In this version of the game it definately takes some getting used to. Textures are a bit weird, (Though I didn't notice until like 15 hours in.)   But the character sprites look really nice.  The portraits are the most shocking at the start probably. They don't fit at all with the rest. I got used to them after like 3 hours though. In fact, this classic Final Fantasy portrait box art artist guy is REALLY good at some portraits. Galuf and Dorgann look incredibly handsome, while Krile and Faris are still my cuties.  I think the shock was extra hard on people because the main character looks so awful. Even at the end of the game I couldn't understand how he could look like that. It just looks so wrong.

I'll just say what this game is for people who never played it.\n\nThis game is pretty awesome! The story is a bit cheesy but entertaining, but the gameplay is really the star of the game. You can pick the character's jobs and combine them with abilities you learned with them to improve what your characters can do in the game. For example, if you play enough as a Black Mage, you can add the option to cast black magic on your Knight. If you learned Knight's "Guard", you can put it on a Monk, which can naturally use "Counter" and it will counter-attack any attack while not getting hit at all.\n\nThe game is huge, has lots of enemies to fight, with lots of different tactics to fight them. Add the customization of the jobs and abilities, and you have a lot to play with.\n\nThe game uses sprites, as it's just a remaster of the old SNES/GBA version of the game. It's not high-tech or anything, but it preserves all the gameplay elements of when it was released. It was a very good game back then and it continues a very good game now.\n\nHave you wondered why people like Final Fantasy so much? This is not a Final-Fantasy-like game, this is the real deal.

Just 1-minute play to notice the following issues.\n1) Tile edges are visible and do not match properly (meteorite, grass, ...) so that the background seems a matrix of squares, not a real background.\n2) V-Sync and O-Synx are miserable - for example, when walking up/down horizontal lines bother the player.\n3) 1 GB of hard disc space for a game that is almost equal (very few and poor graphic improvements) to the SNES version of about 50 MB!?!\n4) Considering I am playing by means of a PC and that we are in 2015, sounds are like graphics: namely disgusting . Am I playing with PC or with 1990's 18bit-Consoles?!?\n5) Character sprites (while walking) are incoherent with character portraits (while talking): the former have brown/pink hair while the latter have gray hair.\n6) Command tips are only for keyboard, even if I am using a gamepad...

The game does have a few small issues as far as the artwork goes, but the character portraits that appear during conversations give us the level of detail that the simple sprites cannot. The music is everything we know and love, so thats another plus. Here is my review on how I see things.\n\nTHE GOOD: Its freaking FFV! The job system allows for customization options that hardly any game truly allows. (want to be a monk with white or black magic? We got you covered. Each job that is mastered adds the base stats of said job to the freelancer class which is the default class you start out as. This gives incentive to master as many of the jobs as possible to maximize your stat potential. For instance, you mastered the thief, warrior, black mage, red mage, and white mage. This allows for you to doublecast black or white magic from mastering the mage class, while hitting like a truck because of the warrior stat in strength, high magic stats from the white and black mages, while wielding whatever weapon you want and filling the ATB gauge very fast, with the option of hitting for double the power using focus from the monk class! Be what you want to be.\n\nTHE BAD: Nothing is really changed from the mobile port besides the new boss they added and the portraits.\n\nTHE UGLY: Taking my nostalgia goggles off for a moment, the art direction is a bit odd, some grammar issues still exist, and of course there is no new real content. The new jobs at the end of the game from the GBA remake are virtually useless, but provide something new if you really wish to use them. The monster art looks better than the sprites themselves!\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: This game gets about an 8.5/10 from me. With enough support from the fans, we can get the game "fixed" to other fans expectations. The game is still the great FFV we all know and love, just with a wierd art direction this time around. If the art is nonappealing to you then wait about a month or two for the steam sale and see if its on there, either way I recommend this game for all who love final fantasy in hopes that this game sells well enough for a port of FFIX!

It has great gameplay, but the story is bland. I could not disagree more.\n\nIf FFIV is a classic grand epic, a great tale of huge proportions, with heavy emphasis on characters, FFV is grand adventure. It is not as much about the characters, or the plot itself, or the setting, but about the overall feel of it. I really have enjoyed all the interactions, all the small comedic moments in this game far more, than in any other FF. And it actually has one of best "just evil" villains of all time, and one of best side characters of all time. It also doesn't really have any plot-holes, or inconsistencies. It really is well written, and presented, making me actually shed tear more than once.\n\nIt's themes may not be the best, and are indeed fairly in the background for the most part, but the setting has so much life to it. Whereas FFIV had some setting, but it was basicly still fairly undefined, FFV has just as definite lore, as future installments of the series. You don't need a lot to fully understand the differences between this peacfull land, and future settings. And granted, I actually hold FFV's setting high on my list, actually being far better than both FFIV's and FFVI's respective worlds.\n\nThe music and gameplay shine. Gameplay is singular THE BEST job system I have seen in Final Fantasies. It has just as much of customization as FFVII, or FFVI, but just like in Dark Souls, you can always add a little variance, you can always modify your strategy, but not to a point of complete change. And characters are leveling, not your items like in FFVII. And what's even better, is that the game truly is challenging. In both FFVI and FFVII although the main antagonists were epic as hell, I actually blazed through final bosses. It could still get challenging, but it was nothing realy hard. Final boss of FFV actually had me retrying modifying strategies for four hours, before I was able to truly beat him. I could count on my fingers amount of times, were final boss was a true challenge, both difficult and enjoyable - and FFV would be high on this list.\n\nIf you love good gameplay, you should get into this game immidiately. If you enjoy adventure-like feel, this one is definiately for ya. It may feel off compared to other FF's, but trust me, it's a welcome change of pace, feeling and themes, being both singulary the funniest, and most fun to play FF in the entire series. Add to that really well-written characters - there aren't many of them, but when they receive focus, they are not worse in any way than other main parties - excellent villain and you get one of the best jrpg's ever made.

A port is a port, and I'm sad that there's no mouse support still, but on the other hand, mechanically this is probably the best Final Fantasy in the main series. Some of the models look awkward, but if you're like me and gameplay is better than graphics, then pick this game up and treat yourself to a really fun, flexible, and intuitive job system that lets you mix and match different abilities to your heart's content. As someone who played through the game multiple times earlier in life, I can guarantee that someone looking for a JRPG experience will not be disappointed.\n\nHowever, one bug I will mention that is somewhat irritating is that sometimes the game doesn't correctly remember what your last action was. For example, one round you might attack, and the next the default action will inexplicably be to guard or use an item. It's minor in the grand scheme of things since it doesn't happen consistently, but nonetheless it is an issue. I haven't run into the screen tearing and other issues that others apparently are running into, either.\n\nI am also not the biggest fan of the music "remaster," but the in-battle models have been reworked and are exceptional- each character has unique animations for each action for each different job. One character casting a spell as a mystic knight will look different casting that spell as a ranger, for example. It feels like a loving recreation of an underrated game.","September 25, 2015","true","19.4"," 33 of 58 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","33","58","0","0"

This is the kind of game that needs it.\n\nShort version: If you don't have access to another version of Final Fantasy V, do buy this one. If you do have access to another version of Final Fantasy V, absolutely do not buy this one.\n\nI won't go into too much detail, because the basics have been covered by everyone. FFV is a great jRPG. It has great characters, the job system offers gameplay a lot of versatility, the music is fantastic and the dungeons are fun. If you can deal with the grinding (which is a given for the genre, anyway), there is no reason to not play FFV.\n\nHowever the port is attrocious. For some ungodly reason, Square thought it a good idea to port the mobile (iOS/Android) 'remake' of the game. They could have ported any version, but they chose that one. The result is a game that makes RPG Maker projects look like AAA industry juggernauts. Cloud saving doesn't work, the UI feels oddly out of place and controls during navigation feel slippery, with or without diagonal movement enabled.\n\nThe thing that turned me off entirely from this and made me go back to the GBA version of FFV is the visual inconsistency. The sprites are alright, but they clash with the backdrops. There are tile seams all over the place; the overworld uses the SNES backdrops, which means tons of pixelization, but buildings and dungeons are poorly redone and upscaled for the PC and you can see each and every single tile. There is no visual cohesion, no consistency; for an RPG that's supposed to draw you in a huge world, this port only manages to look too much like a manufactured piece of entertainment.\n\nSo, once again, if you can't get your hands on another version of the game, the basics of FFV are still here and it's a good game to try out (preferably on a sale, because the price for this ♥♥♥♥-poor port is outrageous). If you have played the game before, or you can get the PSN or GBA versions, get them instead and skip this.","May 29","false","2.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

(low steal rates for example)\nCons\nJob balance is pretty bad. Certain jobs are useless bar one skill.\nSome of the graphics are pretty iffy. You can see where tiles interlock for example.\nPost game content is a bit lackluster.\n\nI actually really like FF5, and unless the game was fundamentally altered in a significant way, I simply can't give it a bad review.\n\nSpecific to the port, the issues I have are with the sprites not retaining the same charm they had in the original/GBA, and that the graphics are pretty poor in certain areas. The game has an ios interface too, but that doesn't really bother me.\n\nThe things I like about the port however, are the revamped battle animations and spell effects. The enemy art is fantastic too.\n\nI'm torn on the graphics because there's pros and cons.\n\n\nNow in terms of actual gameplay;\n\nIt's Final Fantasy V. It has one of the best development systems in any RPG. It has depth and really rewards you experimenting. If you're someone who just wants to optimise right away, you might get a little bit less out of the system because it's pretty easy to break.\n\nStory is charming, but a bit clichéd. The writing is great even if the overall story isn't completely inspired. It gives a good sense of atmosphere.\n\nCharacters are pretty generic, but there are some interesting things you learn about them as you go on.\n\nMusic is Nobuo at his finest.\n\nIf you're a completionist, you might be irritated by the missables, but if you don't really care then it's not so bad. Most powerful equipment is obtainable from a shop later, even if you miss a rare steal.\n\nSpeaking of stealing, the RNG in this game can be just awful. Bad enemy spawn rates and bad steal rates can make it a little frustrating at times.\n\nThe game is about 40 hours long for the story and 60+ for post game content and grinding.","October 2, 2015","true","73.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

You can replace the ugly portraits, too. So that's a plus.\n\n- It stays faithful to the original. The job system, etc. is still there and it works as well as it did when it came out. It's still pretty fun to play around with.\n\n- The way they redid the graphics is somewhat appealing.\n\nCons:\n\n- The battle menu is obviously designed for touchscreens, which I feel alienates a large majority of the people playing the game/buying it. Should have just stuck with original battle menu. Much easier to navigate/use.\n\n- I don't expect much in the graphics department, with this game first having came out in 1992 and all and having a lot of adaptions without too many improvements graphically. However, this particular version was released in 2015. Where there are probably programs specifically designed to help remedy this.\n\n- The tiles and backgrounds are awful. As well as the sprites. It's like someone just remade the whole game with RPGMaker.\n\nAll in all, I'd reccomend it if you're looking to legally own the game and you want to scratch an itch for FFV. And don't get me wrong-- this isn't a bad port. Just a lackluster one.  But yeah.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nGood for scratching an itch, but a lackluster port of an otherwise excellent game.","March 21","true","22.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It isn't that bad. Yes there are some occasional graphical glitches, and it may not be as clean as the GBA version, but it's still a very solid port of an AMAZING game. It's certainly better than the US PSX version that came with Anthology back in the day.\n\nAnyway, if you've never played this game, and you're a fan of the Final Fantasy series as a whole, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. The story is pretty simple and uninspired, but it's more than made up for in the gameplay. The job system introduced in FF3 is expanded and reworked to become something truly impressive in this game. The soundtrack is, as always, impressive as hell. The combat is interesting, and the bosses are challenging. My only real wish is for a bit more balance between some of the job classes, but for a game that's 20+ years old, they did a pretty damn fine job.\n\nThis may not be the perfect port, but it's a very solid one, and the game itself is just incredible.

Not being elitist, this game can be incredibly boring, even for a fan of the series. If you don't want to do a lot of grinding, you probably won't like this game.\n\nSo for the rest of you still here:\n\nPros\n-Soundtrack is one of the best in the Final Fantasy series, and improved graphics from the original game.\n\n-Job System for an insane degree of party customizations\n\n-One of the more difficult Final Fantasy games. Hard fights, difficult classes like the Chemist and Cannoneer, this game won't be a cakewalk. And that's before we get to the superbosses! With bosses like Omega, Shinryu, ExDeath, Enuo, Gilgamesh, and many more, this has some of the toughest bosses in the series.\n\n-Game is a bit more streamlined. Resting at an inn is much faster, you can end a battle with usually a single button press, and the game doesn't auto-optimise your equipment every time you change your Job Skills\n\n-The legendary "Rapid Fire" and "Dual Wield" combo. Definitely worth grinding for.\n\nCons:\n-Easily one of the most grind-heavy game in the Final Fantasy series. You have to level characters and their jobs seperately, and ABP is incredibly tedious to farm.\n\n-On top of grinding, the best skills and gear aren't available until nearly the end of the game. By then, your character can be truly overpowered, but it can be a turnoff to people without the free time to get there.\n\n-Weak story compared to the rest of the Final Fantasy series. Story is fairly generic with few twists, and is fairly predictable stuff. Also some cringe-inducing attempts at humor, such as refrences to the Simpsons, lame puns, a main character being a crossdressing woman for no real reason, and naming the player character's sick mother "Stella" just for a one-off, immersion breaking reference to A Streetcar named Desire.\n\n-Yet again from Square-Enix, obviously a mobile port. While the ingame UI and battle interface isn't so bad, there's still vestiges of it (IE, "Tap the sprint button", with a giant button in the bottom right corner that doesn't do anything). In all fairness, WAY better than Square's other mobile ports on Steam, but it's a mobile game all the same, and I know that's a turn-off for some Steam users.\n\nBasically, if you've already played and loved Final Fantasy V, you've probably already bought this. But for newcomers to Final Fantasy? It's a hard call to make. Personally I love this game, despite it's many flaws. In terms of story, it might disappoint compared to Final Fantasy IV and VI. This game's real selling point is the Job System, and even from that point-of-view Bravely Default on the 3DS improves on this mechanic a lot.\n\nThe story isn't as good as Final Fantasy IV or VI. It lacks the presentation of Final Fantasy VII-onwards. But in terms of gameplay, I personally think Final Fantasy V is the strongest. For people who really enjoy micro-management and really getting into the nitty-gritty of party building and synergizing certain skills, this is the Final Fantasy for them.","November 11, 2015","true","24.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

Dunno if something like this occured in the mobile version, but if you have this kind of problem, just use some external program which can speed up the game process - set the speed to 1.5-2x and suddenly everything will run smooth as hell.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Sure - it is Final Fantasy V after all - buy it on sale, try to get used to new sprites, speed up the process and you will receive very nice and long classic jRPG.","January 5","true","8.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Final Fantasy V has always been a great SNES-era RPG, and that has not changed, even with the problems present in the Steam port.\n\nI think my biggest problem with the port, which is mentioned in most of the other reviews here, is the tile seams are very obviously visible.  This, more than anything else, bothered me, as it just makes certain areas and objects in the game look terrible to the point of distraction.  This also has the result of making certain areas of the game look really bad while your character are in motion.\n\nThe character sprites are another issue that a lot of people have with this version.  While I will say they look a lot less distracting in-game than in screen shots, they still take a lot of getting used to.  And even then, something about them just makes them look odd and out of place compared to the look of the rest of the game.  On the flip side, though, the redone enemy sprites look pretty fantastic.\n\nOn a positive note, this version of the game contains all of the additional content that was originally added to the Gameboy Advance version, which includes a handful of new jobs, new bosses, and a new post game dungeon.  So, if you've never had access to the GBA version and don't want to play on a mobile device, this a way to be able to experience these additions.\n\nOverall, the game seems to run fine on my PC.  In my 30-plus hours of playtime, I have personally not run into any noticeable bugs or crashes, and load times are non-existent.\n\nI debated on whether to give the game a thumbs or down at the end, since while I enjoy the game, the bad porting is an issue which I don't really think should be condoned.  But, when it really gets down to it, what I want to see answered in reviews is essentially "is the game fun", and in the end, I have to answer "yes".","January 28","true","44.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Few small, annoying changes and glitches:\n\nDiagonal movement and the removal of a grid based world.  You can turn off the diagonal movement but the game is not grid based anymore, so the player character sort of slides around corners.  Movement feels slippery and the lack of the grid makes landing the boat/airship/wyvern a chore.\n\nA strange bug where the cursor does not always start on attack.\n\nI do not care for the adjusted in battle interface.  It's nice that you can see all of the information all the time, but I do not care for the location of the action menu.\n\nWhile I will say the in game sprites are far better in game than they look in pictures they still appear awkward and out of place on the world map.  I enjoy their fluid movement and combat animations, and even some of the non-standing models, but the standing still versions mostly appear awful, especially when facing the down (looking towards the top down camera).  Overall the game looks better and the battle backgrounds are good looking.\n\nWorth noting is that this version does contain the additional content added to the GBA remake.\n\nThis game is 20 years old and a port of it shouldn't have any flaws.  It's fine and the worst feature is the movement but I really don't think there should have been any problems with the game at all.

I still remember playing this game on an SNES emulator way back before the PS1 release.  Back when the main character was given his literal translation name of Butz before being changed to Bartz in later releases.  Quite possibly my favorite game in the entire series, second only to Final Fantasy IX, and only then because I can't choose between them.  I have been looking forward to this release since it appeared in the Upcoming Releases section.  Now, has it been worth the wait?\n\nHELL YES!\n\nThis is the same Final Fantasy V I fell in love with so long ago.  The characterization is spot on from what I expected from this release, the graphics are pretty good, sprite work isn't as great as the GBA version, but still good, and the musical score and gameplay are just as great as I remember.  Playing with the job system is just as fun as in previous releases, making your own army of customized fighters with skill sets of your own making.  Want a Knight with the healing abilities of a White Mage?  A Black Mage with the fighting power of a Monk?  A dual-wielding Berserker?  All possible.\n\nSome of the animations and scenes look a little odd now, like when you check in on Faris in Tule.  In the original game, Faris turns her (not a big spoiler) head while sleeping, which makes her hair slip so the characters Butz and Galuf can get a good look at her face, but in this game, she turns completely over onto her front, I think, so the scene makes far less sense.  Whoever did these animations should have paid more attention to the source material, to get not only the animations right, but also the context of each scene.\n\nAll in all, a pretty good port, if you ask me.

So now that you know where I stand I have to say. This is somewhat dissapointing. First of all from what i can gather from tinkering with controls. You cannot run. You can sprint if you have a rouge. But you can't do the double speed run. This slows down the gameplay a lot.  Battles are slower. Thankfully you can fix that with battle speed. The portraits are completely unnecassary and pull me out of the expirence how little they share with the sprite, the original sprite, and the original portraits from FFV Advance. The game gives you 15 files. But once again I don't think you'll be playing through this version 15 times. Yes the characters can be customized with classes. But they still have the original growths so the characters will end up crappy if you don't make them the right type of class. You can move diagonally now, which is neat at first but really doesn't add anything from things it took away. And I'm not too far into it yet. But I've already seen one spell's mechanic was changed. Vampire, a really useful blue magic spell that is even useful for end game. It now heals you a tiny bit when originally it would fully regenerate your character. But at the cost of low accuracy and if you do it on any undead you're screwed. Maybe I'll recommend this game in the future when I get farther and see if it adds more then the GBA port. But otherwise I'm glad I decided to wait to get it during a sale instead of buying it when it was first released. A huge dissapointment.","December 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In 2006, the game was re-released with bonus content for the Gameboy Advance.\n\nWhat we have here is an enhanced remake of the Gameboy Advance version. The graphics and battle system have changed greatly, as has some of the translation. This can be a good thing or a bad thing. If you're a purist of the original Super Famicom version, then seeing the updates would probably make you feel uneasy and will take some getting used to. If you've never had a chance to play the see in the past, then you won't really care.\n\nThe graphics itself are really clean and crisp. They hold the 16-bit charm of yesterday while still presenting itself as something pleasing to the eyes of today. Sure, the portraits of the characters do not look like their sprites, but it's a 16-bit game, so imagination sometimes comes into play. Besides, this is traditional of any Final Fantasy remake in years past  (I'm thinking of Final Fantasy II here). The only issue I had was when the characters move their limbs or do some sort of action on screen. I'm not saying it's bad, but having played the original, seeing these events transpire with updates does cause me to chuckle.\n\nThe nostalgia factor kicks in big with the music. I literally have not heard a single change in quality from the original Super Famicom release, as if the music files were taken straight from the original source with no editing whatsoever. As a fan of the original game, this is pleasing to me, but as a fan of modern games, I will say that this is also appreciated. Even without an enhanced music track, the soundtrack is one of Nobuo Uematsu's finest and sounds great even by today's standards. It fits the style of the game itself and the story to go with it.\n\nThe story is very well done, albeit typical and to a point even cliché; evil guy threatens the world, four unsuspecting heroes set off on a quest to stop him, yada, yada, yada. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep the averge player involved, and there is also humor splashed in all over the place. There is enough mystery and suspense to make you think and wonder what is coming up next. Everything is presented well overall.\n\nThe gameplay, in my honest opinion, still holds up to this day. If you've played any Final Fantasy game, or any RPG in general, then grasping the concept of battle won't be difficult. Battle is simple, exploration is easy, dungeons are challenging, but fair. But what really sets Final Fantasy V apart from the others is the Job System. Yes, a lot of Final Fantasy games instituted a Job System of some sort (in all actuality, this type of system was taken from Final Fantasy III), but this game takes it a step further. As you battle, you gain AP to grow the job you assign your characters. When your Job levels up, you learn an ability (say Black Magic). But, perhaps later you want a character to change their job (we'll use Thief as an example). When you change your job, you can choose one ability that you have previously learned from another job to add it to your arsenal (like Black Magic). So in essence, you will then have a Thief who can cast Black Magic. It doesn't end there and the combinations are near limitless, however, getting everything requires a lot of grinding, something very common in older RPGs.\n\nOverall, this version of the game is just as good as the original. The differences are minor except maybe to the diehard purists out there. This game looks better, but it lacks the nostalgic feel from playing the original. But, if that doesn't bother you, or if you have missed out on this gem in the past, it is worth picking it up and playing for yourself.","September 24, 2015","true","72.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Oh and whoever put that deafening menu sound effect in the game, with this high a volume, needs to be fired.

(only if you dont know them already)\nyou use escape to pause and exit or  TAB to bring up the itmes jobs  menu etc...\nTo me that seems abit redundant, why not have the menus under one roof.\nAnother down side for me personaly is there is no option to use mouse in battle, as tapping down to go through the options is a bit of a time waste if you could just snap your mouse there or maybe its just me.\n\nThe Graphics\nOk im not trying to compare them to the 4k ultra hd realistic stuff of modern times but the tiles are not very well sealed you can see the seams really bad in some areas it don't break the game or any thing so dont get me wrong.\nThe characters dont look like their sprites nothing major tho.  I know the art works good but bartz looks like a girl or is it me\nOn the plus they look really good compared to the original version aswell as the ps and gba versions.\n\nI do love the story and some of the one linners that apeare every now and then  like when you go up stairs in the first pup and relise faris is a girl  kinda makes me chuckle a little bit.\n\nThere are 20+  jobs to choose from and master aswell as an optional dungeon and boss fight.\nThe battles are still the same fun as any Final Fantasy that uses a turn based systme.\nIn my opinion its not Final Fantasy with out a turn based battle.\n\nall in all despite a few minor things i find a bit anoying this game get a 8.5/10 from me its worth the investment for nostalgia perposes  or if you like them retro looking indie games its a real retro game thats full of story and fun and grinding for all you Final Fantasy and RPG fans to enjoy\n\nI hope you found  this review helpful many thanks for taking your time to read and i hope you enjoy this classic gem :)","September 26, 2015","true","8.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

FFV tragically gets overlooked quite a bit because it didn't have an official U.S. release/translation until 1999, seven years after it came out. This is really a shame because I think FFV outshines the other SNES era Final Fantasy games in a lot of ways. I'm sure this is a controversial opinion as debating which games in the Final Fantasy series always tends to get heated, but if you don't believe me and you haven't played this game, you really should.\n\nFFV's story is kind of... ehhh. It's pretty standard template "heroes save the world" writing. Story is not where this game shines, but pretty early in the game, you’ll unlock FFV’s job system. FFV's job system is what sets this game apart from other Final Fantasy titles, for better or for worse. The various jobs are slowly unlocked at key story points as you progress through the game. You initially unlock knight, monk, thief, white mage, black mage and blue mage but will eventually unlock all 21 jobs (25 in the enhanced remake). You can assign any of your 4 party members any job and can reassign them at any time. Changing jobs will affect your character’s stats and what items they're able to equip as well as grant them different abilities to use in battle. Once you master a job’s ability you can carry it over to use with other jobs. This, to me, is where FFV is at its best. Trying to figure out which combinations of jobs and abilities were powerful and which were useless was really fun and rewarding. For instance, combining the Ninja job's "dual wield" ability with the knight class' high innate defense and ability to equip high damage longswords was pretty good if my memory serves. FFV is paced pretty well such that you'll unlock more jobs just as you were mastering previous ones so you always have new combinations and tricks to try out and experiment with. The ending of the game comes right about the time you've mastered enough jobs to be dangerous. Unleashing all of your ridiculous tricks and crazy combinations on the final boss feels like an adequate final exam of your mastery of the job system.\n\nI think FFV is one of Nobuo Uematsu’s first really excellent soundtracks . Not that any that came before were inferior, but FFV really showcases Uematsu's musical range and his ability to create timeless and catchy tunes one right after the other, over and over again. “To the North Mountain”, “Home, Sweet Home" and "Clash on the Big Bridge" are some of my favorite tracks.\n\nSummary:\nIf you enjoy old school RPGs or are a FF fan who missed out on this game the first time around, you should check this game out. If you don't mind the slower pacing of the turn-based combat, I've found experimenting with FFV's job system while listening to the genius of Uematsu to be a really enjoyable experience\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","September 25, 2015","true","35.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

HOWEVER, does this impair the experience? Slightly, I would say, but not enough for me to recommend against it.\n\nThe Pros\n- Amazing Battle System\n- FFV (enough said)\n- GBA features with SNES music + 8 way movement\n- AMAZING redrawn enemy sprites.\n- I personally like the new character sprites too but opinions.\n\nThe Cons\n- Tileset has some issues. I've ran it at 720p with good-ish results and 800x600 res seems to help as well.\n- Framerate seems locked at 30 FPS despite running the game at full speed I think? Not really a big issue. Could just be my rig.\n\nAre the technical issues enough for me to not recommend the game? Likely not. The new interface can be a bit weird and intrusive at times, but overall the port is workable enough to play if that makes any sense. Granted if you're concerned with the negatives greatly, a patch will likely be released for this game I imagine. The issues are fairly minor compared to the robust, amazing game it delivers. Additionally, the new menu controls are AMAZING! Being able to instantly exit menus on the fly is an awesome feature, alongside being able to pause the game at ANY instance even during an active battle (in case you have to attend to other business or use the washroom.)\n\nOverall if you're concerned with some of the minor graphical issues and the framerate potentially, I'd say wait for a patch. If you love this game as much as I do however, these issues are fairly minor and do not get in the way of the core game experience, which is delightful. Otherwise I'd recommend playing the GBA port with the enhanced music patch (google it!)\n\nI recommend this game if you don't mind the minor nuanced issues. Lots of people are complaining (and rightfully so if they're that upset) but I can't say the product is unplayably bad because I'd be lying. Overall, it's FF5 with nice new redrawn stuff and some minor graphical issues. Take it or leave it, but I overall recommend it personally.","September 25, 2015","true","22.5"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

The interface is ripped straight from the IOS version, large buttons and all, the new character portraits are mostly ugly and its controls are very awkward, almost to the point of requiring a controller, and all the "new" features are all from special editions of FFV, so if you've played this game before on the GBA (especially IOS since its the same bloody game) you have nothing new to see here. But past all of that is Final Fantasy V. This game is still as good as ever and if you ever wanted to revisit it, or try a more classic RPG well this isn't a bad place to start. The revamped sprites are cute and the job system is why FFV is so good to begin with.\n\nHowever, Final Fantasy V being good may be enough to recommend it, but this port made that decision harder than it should. FFV has been good for a long time now, but the better visuals only do so much when the keyboard controls are pretty bad. Not bad enough to be unplayable but it does get annoying sometimes. If you haven't picked it up yet I recommend waiting for a sale.\n\nAlso, seriously, who drew these portraits? Only a few characters resemble their sprites in any way. It might seem like a stupid complaint but I couldn't get used to it.","October 6, 2015","true","15.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I have played this on the SNES and GBA and this one is deffinetly better, no im not saying that because of the ovibious bigger screen, I'm saying this because they were beautifully remastered. The only reason people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about thier graphics being buggy or blocky is they proably just updated from Win XP/7/8 to Win 10 or Mac 9 to Mac 10 and didnt bother to go to the graphics card website and update thier graphics drivers. Common mistake, but I am sure STEAM and WINDOWS/MAC developers are working hand in hand, and if people would just do a common update of drivers, they will see there is no problem with anything. So whould I recommend this to a friend, HELL YEAH i would, in fact i did with 2 friends already. So please do us all a favor and keep up the good work Square and Steam.

And Galuf and the main character, are both wrong Galf is Green hair on char Blond on portrait, and main char is Brown with white hair on portrait.

If you've played the other versions you'll like this one.\n\n-It has a sort of autosave-function I'm not willing to trust entirely yet, but then again it seems to be very good. Seems to save after entering new area and after winning a battle.\n\n-New sprites look weird at first compared to the classic sprites, but you get used to them pretty quick. Besides, they emote very much in the same way as the classics. (Weird to see King Tycoon's head!)\n\n-Documentation is very extensive if you come in as a new player.\n\n-I've seen complaints about running in 30fps instead of 60fps and honestly I have no idea what the problem is. I get it in a modern action game, but this is a SNES era JRPG. You want your party to chop at air smoothly? Anyhow, I'm sure some wizard will unlock it.\n\n-Some people are having graphical issues like tearing, but I haven't seen any, so YMMV.\n\n-Music is the classic old stuff, no weird new remixes.\n\nOverall I can recommend this especially to fans of the old games and other versions of FFV (you have the handheld goodies in this one). I can also recommend this to people who enjoy classic JRPGs. You can read more extensively about the actual game online, but basically it's a very "standard" FInal Fantasy: Group of heroes destined to save the world with the help of the Crystals. Considerably more lighthearted and humoristic than FFIV or FFVI. The Job system is awesome.\n\nPS. If you're new to the game don't check the achievements, since they spoil several plot points straight out!","September 25, 2015","true","36.0"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

Yay, I guess?\n\nI won't give a too detailed "Review" here, just a few Points that I judge PERSONALLY (read: SUBJECTIVE AND BIASED!), since apparently, nobody is allowed to think of this as a good game, judging by comments -_-\n\n-The Positives:\nbased on the GBA Version, both Content- and Scriptwise, so nothing is "missing" in this Version\nThe 2D Zelda-like free movement works infinitely better with actual hardware instead of Touchcontrols\nUsing the original SNES Soundtrack. Better to not fix what isn't broken :)\nNot using the (in my opinion) butt ugly FF3 / 4 3D-Graphics\n\n-The Neutral:\nThe Non-Enemy Sprites. I admit, that re-using Dimensions' Engine wasn't the smartest Move (especially for a PC Release), but atleast, everyone is still recognizable. Rated "Neutral" because I don't mind them as much.\nUsing the original SNES Soundtrack (again). Simply because there are a few Tracks I liked more on the GBA. A "Choose Music Version" Option would've been nice, but hey, you take what you can get.\n\n-The Negative:\nThe aforementioned 2D Zelda-like free Movement. What caused them to implement this in the first place? Atleast it's okay with Controller / Keyboard, but the Smartphone release this is based on was almost unplayable for me. Even worse, you aren't even given the Option to snap it back into grid Movement, you can only disable diagonal walking.\nThe Menus are a bit unintuitive for me at times, since instead of having a Pointer at the Character you want to Equip / change Job of, you have to pay attention which "Name Button" you're currently highlighting, which is a bit hard for me to see at times.\n\nHowever, the most important Point for me is how utterly shredded this game gets from the Userbase. What were you expecting, Full HD 1080p 60fps and all that? Guys, it was entirely visible from the Start that this is just a port of the iOS / Android Version. If you don't like it, why did you buy it in the first place? Just let it rest, or just don't get it in the first place and just buy the GBA (or PS1) Version, easy as that.

In late 2000's I put many more hours into Final Fantasy 5 Advance (for Gameboy Advance). Not so long ago I purchased Final Fantasy V mobile for my android device, then, I found out about this re-release of that mobile version. Deep down I do love this game but its a hard love... like to a roommate who just ate your last piece of cheesecake...\n\nBefore you read on, know that I normally would never consider graphics a big deal, and in fact I love old 16 bit classic graphics and other junky graphics\n\nOne of the only, and certainly the single biggest difference between this "mobile"/"steam" version and the other older versions is the graphics, If you play this new graphics version on the device it was intended on, a tablet or phone, the choppy mess is not as visible, and the monsters, terrain, backgrounds and menu's all look great, but, those character sprites still feel awful and out of place. I read quite a few of the reviews before purchase and saw many complaints about the graphics. I couldn't see what the big deal was, but, now I partly understand. It really does look like a choppy mess on this Steam version.\n\nPutting the graphics aside, Final Fantasy V had one of the weakest Final Fantasy stories to date, HOWEVER, for some reason I still consider this a classic title, with many hours of entertainment available to all who play it.\n\nI LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, FINAL FANTASY V.... but, in a game version where all you did was change the graphics, you better do it correctly, and you clearly did not even try considering this is just the imported mobile version.\n\nI will still recommend this game if you have absolutely no other way to play Final Fantasy V. I think my prefered method to play is still Final Fantasy V Advance (Game Boy Advance version)","September 25, 2015","true","28.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Some of the minor graphical issues with the tiles are slightly annoying, but don't detract from the overall experience.\n\nThis won't go down as the greatest port of a game of all time (I would have been overjoyed to see character sprites like the FF IV PSP remake), but it's definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of the series.","September 27, 2015","true","20.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

But this comes at the cost of inferior graphics on the overworld/dungeons/town sprites. Combat sprites are still okay.\n\nLONG VERSION\nThis is a PC port of the cellphone version of one of my favorite FF titles.  I'm not here to discuss FF5 as a whole (love the game), but as a voice of rebuttal aganst some reviews I've seen posted for this game.\n\nI have not personally seen the extreme screen tearing or refusal to bootup some users claim.\n\nGAMPLAY PROs\n+ 8 way diagonal movement\n+ Autobattle is great for grinding or going through easy areas.  (Either all Attack or all repeat last action, based on how you set cursor memory in config)\n+ Sprint on world map\n+ Automatic quicksaves\n\nGAMEPLAY CONs\n- Game runs slow in areas that involve room layouts changing (I've only seen two such rooms, both lategame, as of entering the final main storyline dungeon).\n- Cellphone interface means buying multiple items is half as bad/annoying as FF1 NES version.\n\nGRAPHIC PROs\n+ Combat sprites have addition animation/poses, based on which job/character it is.\n\nGRAPHIC CONs\n- Different character sprites for noncombat (map, story, etc). Initially HATED the new sprites during pre-release screenshots, but they've grown on me after seeing them in motion.\n- Portaits, while from the original character designer and decent art on their own, often look almost nothing like the ingame character.\n- Very noticibly poor tiling/tile seams in some areas\n- Not true fullscreen/widescreen, and supposedly very noticeable on dual monitors.\n- A certain portrait and sprite spoils the impact of a famous earlygame plot point.\nNOTE: Users have found ways to mod the character portraits.\n\nMISC PROs\nTitle Menu offers bestiary (filled as you fight) and music player (all unlocked by default).\n\nOTHER Vs GBA\n+ Not $40-$80+, and no risk of getting a bootleg or dead save battery.\n+ 15 Save slots\n\nOTHER Vs PS1\n+ No save menu graphic glitch (PS2), constant freezing (PS3), or insane loadtimes (all)\n+ GBA bonus content included\n- Sprint feature now requires Thief. As such you can't double-up on the Sprint speed bonus.\n? Different translation.  Probably better, given all the Y-Burns (Wyverns) and such in PS1.\n\nIf SE would have "fixed" the cellphone graphics and interface changes, this would be the hands-down definitive version of FF5.  But in the current state, this version makes the "best FF5" debate even more complicated.\n\nIs it worth the full $16 Square is asking for in the current state?  Debatable, depending on how you feel about the genre, FF5 itself, and "lazy" ports of cellphone games.  But for the $8 or less that it'll probably eventually go on sale for later, I'd say it's worthwhile, even if they left it as-is.\n[Note: Pricing info based on USA pricing as of launch].","September 24, 2015","true","56.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Can hardly be called having been given an upgrade in the controls or graphics. I've only been less than an hour into the game, but i'm not impressed with the sloopy work done on the graphics.\n\nI won't go into too much depth about it, but what bugged me the most was that the character sprites now look like they're all chest-up and strutting... especially Bartz (Did he get breast implants?). Or why does Lenna have pink hair as a sprite and white hair in the portrait (was it always like that? can't remember might have to look it up)? I'm sure many others have already said this, but using RPG Maker would've ended up doing a better job...\n\nAlthough it's still the same old FFV we all remember and loved. If it's simply for the sense of nostolgia (well that's basically all i cared for) and want to continue supporting the series, than buying this is worth it to you. So yeah, I'm having a bit of mixed feelings about whether to recommend or not... reviews need a "Maybe" option.","September 26, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I feel it's worth the buy, a great nostalgia trip and a few new job classes added to the game.\n\nI only have a couple gripes about the game, the first being the character portraits. They look great, but if you have any issues with consistency, it will bug the hell out of you that Lenna and Faris' portraits have them with whiteand blonde hair, when their in-game sprites have pink and purple. A simple to fix oversight, but it doesn't take anything away from the game itself.\n\nThe bigger issue I have is that the cursor will occasionally move to random selections on its own. It's quite frustrating when you're in a simple battle that only requires some mashing of the A button to win, and instead of attacking (the top selection of your actions) you randomly waste an elixir on a character with full health because the cursor moved to items for no reason whatsoever. This issue is more relevant to gameplay, but nothing worth saying you shouldn't buy the game.\n\nOverall, the game is fun just as it was when it originally released, just make sure you pay attention to what your cursor is doing so you don't waste powerful items. And if you have OCD, just try not to pay attention to the portraits when Lenna and Faris talk.\n\nHappy adventuring!","September 27, 2015","true","37.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I remember playing on the SNES as a kid, enjoying the wonderful setting, story, and gameplay. This Final Fantasy V PC port doesn't lose that magic. I have thoroughly enjoyed this port so far, and I've played the original FFV game all the way through at least 3 times, so I feel I have a good base to compare with. I think Square Enix did a good job with this port, and at least a couple of "problems" other reviewers have with this game are simply config options that can be turned off in game. That being said, there are a couple of issues, and I'll list out the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nIt still feels like the original game, just more polished\nNew animations are great\nNew art is pretty\nJob system is addicting surprisingly in depth\nThe story is quite good\nOptional autobattle - very nice for grinding\n\nCons:\nOccasional glitches with the battle selection menu causes me switch rows or defend when I meant to attack\nThe texture tiling still has the same issue as the original, in that it's slightly off and you can sometimes see the lines between texture squares.\nPortraits sometimes don't match character sprites (Faris portrait has blond hair, sprite has purple hair. Wut.)\n\nIf you like Final Fantasy, just get the dang game. It's great, just be prepared for plenty of grinding to get those job levels. If you've played the original FFV and liked it, get this game. It really twangs on the nostalgia chords and it's so much more fluid and pretty.","September 26, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Not anywhere near the quality of the DS and PSP versions of FF4 (which is a shame because this game definitely deserves that kind of treatment) but it is still quite good. The character portraits that I have seen so far look great (except for King Tycoon. That one looks a little off). This game is absolutely enormous with tons of replay value and this port includes all the extra GBA content.

The Super Famicom, Gameboy Advance, and Playstation versions still hold up to today on some levels. But, the IOS and PC remake of Final Fantasy V don't quite meet the expectations players were hoping for. To break it down for you:\n\nGood:\n- Retains the nice dialogue\n- Job System is kept as it was\n- Includes the 4 Extra jobs and features added into the Gameboy Advance\n- Sound effects are updated to fit whats going on\n\nOK:\n- Job Costumes don't feel the same. Especially the mask's and Gladiator class.\n- Music should have been remastered to fit the graphics\n\nBad\n- The sprites do not fit the enviroment whatsoever. They have the "Float" Feel and don't feel implanted into the game\n- Any Menu layout. Especially the battle layout. It makes you look where you shouldn't need to look, like completly to the right\n- The tile's borders look unpolished which just looks disorenting\n- Character portraits don't match the sprites at all. Kind of weird what their supposed to look like.\n- The font looks like a default font for Microsoft Word. Final Fantasy usually has good font when it comes to their games\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nPreferably, it's best to get a copy of the GBA, SNES, or PS version. Or you know, emulate them. The game feels better with the older sprites because they feel like they actually belong in the game. The battle menu makes you look in the correct spots and the music fits the game. Screwy tile borders aren't very noticible, and the character portraits look like the actual character... most of the time. It's your choice but, this version isn't the way to go if you are picking up final fantasy V.","February 6","false","85.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Once on the ps1, once on the GBA.  This Steam port is a port of a port.  The GBA version was the original (not counting the SNES/PS1 versions) and its contents were ported to IOS devices with major graphical changes.  I would call them enhancements, but I find the quality of the enhancements a little subjective.  I personally like them, but not everybody really does.\nFrom the IOS devices, this port sprang up.  And I must say... you're better off just playing this on an iPhone.\n\nFor starters, the graphics are significantly worse on PC.  The PC version does use IOS assets, but the tiles are so clearly visible on the overworld that it just breaks any sort of emersion.  I can see where they weren't able to properly adjust the display output of the IOS, therefore you can see each and every single tile on the screen.\nEvery problem that people would have with this game would probably apply to the IOS version, too.  The character models on the overworld and battle are pretty terrible looking compared to, say, the character models in the psp games (final fantasy I, II, and IV for psp) and they suffer from extreme stiffness for the kind of animation they were trying to achieve.  However, you can control the steam edition with an Xbox controller or a keyboard (HOWEVER, holding the accept button does not auto-select a command).\n\nThis isn't a bad game, it's just a bad port.

Seemingly, however, Squaresoft did us a favor by not localizing this game when it originally released on the SNES.   Frequently tedious random encounters sap your desire to explore and boss difficulty curves that ramp up excessively force you to reload and double back in order to grind on the same monsters you already didn't want to deal with for 40-60 minute intervals in order to progress.   The game's claim to fame is a more robust class system than it's predecessor, Final Fantasy III, and while the mechanics of this system are certainly enjoyable to play around with, it also forces you to track yet another thing you need to spend a great deal of time grinding on.   What really irritates me about Final Fantasy V is not that it is difficult.   Like a typical 90s jRPG, there is nothing in FFV that cannot be handled with copious amounts of leveling.  The real frustration comes in the fact that you can't simply sit back and enjoy the story.   As worlds go, FFV's is pretty interesting with a multi-world mechanic and a pretty memorable core cast of characters.   This update's inclusion of original Amano artwork as character portraits only makes the story more enjoyable to experience.   Unfortunately those few minutes of story are punctuated by frustrating gameplay that seems to have attracted little interest in balancing from the original dev team.   Serious Final Fantasy fans will want to play this game but for the casual fan there are far better entries in this venerable series to sink your teeth into.","January 4","false","30.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Once on the ps1, once on the GBA.  This Steam port is a port of a port.  The GBA version was the original (not counting the SNES/PS1 versions) and its contents were ported to IOS devices with major graphical changes.  I would call them enhancements, but I find the quality of the enhancements a little subjective.  I personally like them, but not everybody really does.\nFrom the IOS devices, this port sprang up.  And I must say... you're better off just playing this on an iPhone.\n\nFor starters, the graphics are significantly worse on PC.  The PC version does use IOS assets, but the tiles are so clearly visible on the overworld that it just breaks any sort of emersion.  I can see where they weren't able to properly adjust the display output of the IOS, therefore you can see each and every single tile on the screen.\nEvery problem that people would have with this game would probably apply to the IOS version, too.  The character models on the overworld and battle are pretty terrible looking compared to, say, the character models in the psp games (final fantasy I, II, and IV for psp) and they suffer from extreme stiffness for the kind of animation they were trying to achieve.  However, you can control the steam edition with an Xbox controller or a keyboard (HOWEVER, holding the accept button does not auto-select a command).\n\nThis isn't a bad game, it's just a bad port.  The gameplay isn't completely butchered.  It's essentially chocked full of the same content you could get in the GBA version, and the GBA version is probably my personal favorite version of the versions I've played thus far.\nIf you want to play this version, you're not worse off with the IOS version.

This is yet another instance of a game being released while it's still horribly unoptimized.  30 fps, laggy and jankity screen moment even on a good PC.. that's unforgiveable as far as a remake goes.  It just looks like trash.  I got it to stream it and play through it with some friends, but it's just not worth it, people will get seizures from watching it.\n\nThe sprites are hit and miss... Bartz/Butz/Dude's sprite looks like he's puffing out his chest beyond what humans are capable of, but ones like Lenna's look alright.  The character portraits are Amano, but as per usual they don't look like the characters at all.. so that's up to you whether it's cool or not.\n\nTileset is a friggin' mess.  Considering there are games out there made in RPG maker that have a smoother set than this says leagues.  The majority of tiles don't blend together, and look like they are all mashed together.\n\nMy major battle complaint is that you can't just hold down the attack key.. you have to push it every time.  Not a big deal, but why would they take this function out in a remake?  Did they not play the old one?  When older RPGs get re-released, they typically have things to speed up the game, not slow them down.  It's really just nitpicking, but it slows down things considerably.\n\nI wish I could say I recommend this, but I can't.  Not unless they patch it.  Pass unless you read about a lot of patch notes!

I like the FF series, but I have not played part V before. I did enjoy all the other releases on Steam so far.\n\nSomething about this game is different. First, it is impossible to remap/configure the controller keys, it just crashes the launcher (XBoxOne Controller).\nThe same itself does not run smoothly, and by that I don't mean low FPS, more the scrolling and animations/motions are a little unsteady. Not super bad, but it's enough for me to notice (running it on a 6700K GTX 770 Win10 system on a 3440*1440 60hz screen).\n\nThe game itself just fails to pull me in, for various tiny reasons. As a whole it seems rather improvised to me.\nThe storytelling feels superficial. The part that I played (up to retrieving the second crystal (water)) just feels like a rush-through, even though I tried to talk to every NPC and follow what is happening. So far, I am disappointed and don't think I'm going to play it through to the end.\n\nI wouldn't complain if it cost me 5 bucks, but I payed 15 Euros for this thing, and I'm not getting the impression that money was well spent.","September 26, 2015","false","2.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

The fact that this game is the Android/iOS version does not bother me in the slightest. People have petty complaints that the hero sprites aren't good enough, and that the portrait art doesn't coincide with how the characters look, but to me they're just vain complaints. The story is still there, the gameplay is fun and doesn't require much (if any, aside from Beastiary) grinding.\n\nMy major issue is the sloppy optimization. I have a total of 10 fans in my PC; 3 on my GPU alone and 2 on a liquid cooler on my CPU, the rest are case fans. This game, despite it being pixels and sprites, runs my machine as hot, and even hotter, than any AAA title out there. A stable 35C on my CPU and 60C on my GPU is UNACCEPTABLE for this simple type of game.\n\nThe game also, somehow, manages to weigh in at a hefty 50-60% CPU load. How? For what? Luckily for me this is distributed across eight cores. But I just do not understand.\n\nDespite enjoying this title, despite loving it coming to Steam, I am not recommending this based on the poor optimization alone. It is absolutely, undoubtedly unacceptable for a light weight, sprite based game to push my temperatures and load up to where an AAA title would have it.\n\nFix this, and I'll fix my review.","September 29, 2015","false","19.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix923/recommended/382890/","phoenix923","phoenix923","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix923/","770 products in account","A bit of a preface. The Final Fantasy series was what got me into rpg's some 20 odd years ago. I own multiple copies of the games spread across multiple consoles and I have beaten all of them. While I am not a diehard player I can certainly say that I really love this series. Which is why it pains me to say this but I cannot recommend the Final Fantasy V port.\n\nThe positives about the game are that I really like the re-done sprites for the monsters and some of the background sprites for objects and buildings do look nice. You have free movement instead of tile movement and you can quickly quit out of the menus by hitting the menu button. Unfortunately though, those is the only positives.\n\nThe first thing bad about this port is what everybody already knows, the character sprites. While I personally don't mind the new sprites, the problem is that they just dont fit in graphically with how the world looks. They look like they were going for a psudo 3D look to them which makes them stick out like a sore thumb against the backgrounds.  Plus their color pallets are exceptionally bright making them stick out even more. It is more or less distracting and constanly pulls me from the experience.\n\nThe second bad thing is the profile pics when they talk. While I am all for seeing the original artwork and I actually like how the characters are designed in it, they just dont fit into how the game looks. This is of course is also distracting seeing the clear difference between the simple sprites in the game, and the highly detailed character portraits.\n\nThe the third bad thing are the tiling textures, which actually don't tile at all. Around all of the tiles there is an extremely visible seam along all four sides which is, you guessed it, distracting. While moving around you don't really notice it but definately during cutscenes you will. I did read that if you put the game into 720p windowed mode it isnt as bad, but the problem is that it is still there and I want to play my game in fullscreen 1080p.\n\nThe fourth and final bad thing is the UI. Being an iOS/Android port the interface was changed to accomondate that. The problem is that SE did nothing to try and get it back to how it was, or done something to remotely change it. Not to mention there is a bug where if you mash the attack button in battle the cursor moves to the row button, wasting a characters turn and weakening them by moving them to the back row. You can move them back to the front but by then you have wasted two turns.\n\nSo in the end all we have is a game with a bunch of graphical elements that distract the player from enjoying the game and an uninspired mobile UI. While the game itself is great and it is Final Fantasy V, the lack of art direction really pulls me from the game. I probably won't refund the game as I do wish to own this on PC, but going forth I will definately wait to buy any other games in the series at a steep discount. My only worry is that when FInal Fantasy VI will eventually come to PC, that it will be in the same sad, disappointing shape this game was put in.","September 24, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

It uses the Active Time Combat which consists in waiting for the "Action" bar to fill up and them give an order for one of your party members, which include attacking, using magic or an item(the turn based I mentioned).\nThe game is very story-driven, although the linearity is almost zero, you free to travel the world, obviously withing geographic limitations, if you don`t have a damn boat, you can`t get out of an island :P.\nIt introduces a job system that allows you to completely customise your characters` way of playing, you can make them all mages or even warriors, it`s up to you to decide your own party`s playstyle.\nThe game`s difficulty? It`s challenging, that`s for sure, gotta be smart to utilize your party`s potential to it`s fullest. Otherwise you might get Rekt by Gilgamesh or any other boss.\nThe version of the game on Steam is the IOS version, does it look incredible? Hell no, but the game is great even looking bad.

It seemed like the difficulty would waver from insane to nonexistent from area to area for no reason. Armour made little difference to your overall survivability, and some bosses counter so often I found myself having my party attack>heal>attack>heal ad neaseum.\n\nI was hoping that they had fixed this in this re-release.\n\nI am disappointed that the obviously flawed mechanics are still present. I have played up until the void to confirm this and some of the most frustrating gameplay I have ever endured is here.\n\nAn example is in the void, there is an enemy that when physically attacked, it vasts protect. This by itself is not bad, but it casts it EVERY time. There is no check to see if it already has this status. If you have dual-wield and hit it with both weapons it casts this twice in succession, dragging out the battle unneccesarily. It is this kind of reliance on enemy counter attacks to drag out battles and increase the difficulty that I find unpalatable. Compounding this is this is many ememies counter even if you miss.\n\nI feel obligated to pointout that you will miss a lot. What is the point of dual wielding weapons if the second hit misses >50% of the time? Enemy attcks seem to miss me so infrequently unless I'm a samurai or using the zephyr cape which doesn't help if you don't have enough to go around...\n\nI like a challenge, but when critical attacks by the enemy are unleashed at any time bacuse instead of using RNG, they were added into the monsters move sets which canbe seen when you manipulate them.\n\nThis is overall very disappointing, and I'm sad to say it is just a port of the old game with none of the flaws fixed, with some fancy visual fluff. Unlike with FF IV where they added in augments, or FF VI where there was a good an solid game to start with, this is a poor offering. You can't polish a turd as the expression goes.\n\nSave your money and buy the FF IV or FF VI remakes instead.","January 12","false","108.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

This version is not for you.\n\nNow on to the meat. FF V is a phenomenal game. Beyond amazing in every form, and what I consider to be the pinnacle of the Job system within the FF universe. While this game does still have that, the flaws that are front and center are far too numerous to overlook.\n\nSee the short playtime? Yeah, that's because it crashed once and the hiccups began afterwards before I gave up on it. And within those minutes I experienced a number of issues. To begin, it is clear that the game has only been marginally formatted for usage with keyboard input. While most PC gamers today may prefer a controller for their gaming, rebinding keys within FF V to standard WASD movement resulted in a hiccup within a few mere moments: naming input has been bound to the keyboard, ending in a hero named BartzS before I realized that utilizing the Cancel key fixed it or that the Restore Default option was present.\n\nFollowing that, my eyes locked on the poorest excuse for tiling ever. It's easy to see why the screenshots and preview video show what they do: aspects such as trees or the initial meteorite are so poorly put together that you would expect the quality to come from the very SNES game this originated from. And associated with the poor tiling are the sprites for the characters. While I adore the Amano artwork for the character images, the same love cannot be tied to the characters themselves. Bartz alone consistently looks like a Looney Tunes character trying to intimidate a villain thanks to the "chest thrust out and fists at sides" sprite presented here.\n\nI wanted to love this game. I really really did. It's why I shelled out full price instead of waiting for a sale. Final Fantasy V is a glorious game, and that is why, above all else, I strongly suggest finding your experience of it elsewhere.","June 2","false","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Technically and graphically, the game functions poorly and I would recommend investing into an older not-PC remake of the game instead of this (until it gets updated).\n\nI've had many issues with controls: not only can I only use the menu function in one safe spot in the second dungeon, but I cannot exit that menu unless I save the game as pressing the back button only switches between the "inventory" and "save" screens". The game also has problems registering 2 different input keys at the same time (excluding directional keys); button mashing to figure out the controls will do nothing for you, give each key a second or two to fully register. You should also be aware that this game is fairly unstable: multiple crashes within the first 10 minutes of play, mostly around naming your character (caution: keyboard keys still function while typing the characters name and you may unexpectedly accept a half-finished name, like I did with the name "The" before the game crashed). Graphically, you can take a look at other reviews: the graphics are updated and improved, but there are plenty of tiling issues, the portraits (as great art pieces as they are) do not look like the game sprites and become very off-putting, and the game looks like it's 480p stretched to larger resolutions (don't hold me to that, but the main menu is very much low resolution).\n\nThe plus side is that there is controller support for the game, and it worked just as well as my keyboard (that is to say I still couldn't access the inventory/save menus); the 8-directional movement, though weird, is nice to have when traveling lengthy diagonal distances; and the gameplay is very much unchanged aside from the improvements of latter FFV iterations (that's more of a neutral point).\n\nIn summary, hold off until an update arrives or you may find out you can't save.","September 24, 2015","false","3.2"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","15","33","2","0"

The soundtrack is faithful to SNES original, though some sound effects are a little grating and outdated sounding-the scene where the meteor falls during the opening comes to mind.

The problem is the character models don't look like the backdrop. The character pictures don't look like the character model. Not a single piece of art is consistent. Honestly, its like they got three seperate groups to do them without comparing them ever. Despite being incredibly annoying, i could see past it if the gameplay was anything special... Which it isn't. The storyline is the generic 'chosen ones' story. If you dont mind mismatched art, boring story, and gameplay that will confuse and annoy you.

One thing that stands out in FF games is the unique character design and the attention to detail on all the playable characters. First thing I notice about this port is how all the characters here are void of any detail whatsoever. They look more like they’re ready to sit behind the counter at the Item stores, they don’t look like heroes or adventurers. I’m only 1 hour into it, worrying that I’m bored of it already and felt the need to drop out and do anything else with my time. I really wish they would remake these FF games properly, I enjoy everything about traditional old school rpg’s, yet the FF remakes always leave me feeling, disappointed. Maybe a few hours in I’ll feel different and update this review to say what an incredible journey it had been. Or maybe steam will release a statement saying: “We take pride in the games we sell and want our customers to feel real value for money as well as a sense of enjoyment from the games we provide. That is why we are refunding the £10.99 paid for FF V in full whilst we recreate the adventure to make a playable game that you will not regret parting with money on.” …Well maybe neither of the above will happen. Oh well. I’ll just do something else with my Sunday, maybe I’ll dig out an old console, dusk of the cartridge and play the original, which although flawed, was no better or worse than this incredibly weak remake.","October 4, 2015","false","24.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"

There are also noticeable tile seems in every explorable area.

I ended up enjoying this port about as much as I enjoyed the version for Game Boy Advance, so I've edited my review to recommend the game and reflect that. You can easily find other reviews that go into detail about what makes the game so great, but I'll just say it's one of my top 5 of the series after completing every major Final Fantasy except for 11.\n\nJust like many other long time fans, I was initially doubtful of the new character sprites for this version of the game, but after spending about 40 hours with them, they've grown on me and I like about 99% of them now.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Final Fantasy or JRPGS.","September 24, 2015","true","60.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","25"

Story wise it is also enjoyable if not a little winding as it progresses.  If you decide to play it and you want it to be fun stay away from the guides that tell you how to win everything, the fun is coming up with your own crazy combinations and ways to beat the bosses.   That's really where this game shines in my opinion.  Eventually you have classes that allow you to combine your inventory to kill bosses in creative ways.  If you decide to go for the huge achievements like all treasure chests or something you'll want to go with guides or be prepared for many hours of gameplay and farming because there are many missable beasts and treasures that might require replays to get them.\n\nThere are a few issues with this particular port, in my case it would always freeze in my first battles after starting the game for a just a few seconds then work perfectly from then on.

You expect cons? Well...\n-Liking anime may help because translation from japanese culture/language is impossible without context. You could easily see this as a strong plus because ROM versions of this game always ♥♥♥♥ed up the translation and Squaresoft (w/e) did this well as a standard translation for good character development.\n-Sometimes, it crashes. This can be frustrating, but the new save techniques make it not suck that much. Most likely it's more Windows 10 than FF V. This currently seems to be because I had another full screen app running at the same time.\n\nMediocre:\n-Okay yeah sometimes you see tiles. I guess I'd like Square to do their best in anything, so make the repeated tiles less noticeable, it's an art thing, you know what I'm talking about.\n-SAME MUSIC (YES!): as the original I hear, but seriously ♥♥♥♥ the orchestral scores of Megaboy, tho that's fun too. The music was good at the time and still is and here it is. Also there's no way this wasn't remastered. Uptight dude that codes like I do really needs his ears checked. Another positive really.\n-Un anti-aliased fonts: I applaud square enix, even if it was accidental, which I doubt, for showing the old techniques and the pixelated madness that was the time, even if through a rosy colored lens.\n\nPros:\n-OH MY GOD IT'S 2D: thank you so very much Square for not doing "cheap 3D" to push this to iphones in that dubious format. I love 3D done well. In a game with so much history as this, 2D but increasing the resolution and giving me awesome new but correct takes on environments and sprites is the way to go for anyone willing to sit down and play a while, which the format requires anyway.\n-FLEXIBLE AS HELL CLASSES: welcome to that mystical land where you multi-class as much as you want given a lot of (diminishing returns) effort. Finally, again, FF V. Much like FF III but they ♥♥♥♥ed that up with poor 3D... I still bought that one though. There's no reason in life that you can't learn a whole crapload given time. See this used well in FFXIV too, tho a review of that game is: fun as ♥♥♥♥, but virtually impossible to play multiplayer in any true sense.\n-Another Wonderful Game Where Your Characters Look Different: like FF (I) once you get the rat tail, you feel a unique sense of accomplishment cuz your characters suddenly look badass and you chose which characters in the first place. This is that to the nth degree. Well done.\n-NEW CLASSES: like there wasn't enough? I'm going to go level them all momentarily...\n\nTO SQUARE ENIX: you did this absolutely correctly. Newer technologies are not always better, and sometimes you have to wait on popular opinion to come around and realize your true masterpieces. I'm a fanboy as far as loving your work, but I've criticized it too, and this is what we all wanted in a remake of FF IV. FF V, mechanically, is a strongpoint you guys obviously realized in FFXIV. Continue to give the player option and we will replay your game, and make it even more of a classic.

It has an effective combat system with the class system being my personal favorite in the Final Fantasy series. Want to combine Monk with Summoner? The customizability is nearly limitless. The story elements are very excellent and the humor elements work to help the audience to cope with the horrificically dark story. Some may object to the over-the-top behavior of Exdeath. I personally disagree with this analysis. In fact he is my second Final Fantasy villain (just behind Golbez). His maniacal behavior highlights the threat that Exdeath poses to everyone and everything. He is also an effective strategist who uses the heroes and others to achieve his goals on mutiple occasions. Furthermore his minions were able to stay loyal to him over several decades. The scene with Galuf at the midpoint of the game was my personal favorite of the entire Final Fantasy series.\nEven though I have played little time for the Steam version I have played the game elsewhere. I beat the game on the playstation 1 port and I just beat the Android port earlier this year. The main criticism of the game has some validity. The character sprites do look terrible but I can forgive that. This format is one of the first occasions where gamers could easily access this game. There had been three official ports: The Playstation 1 Port (which can be purchaseon PS3) THE gba Port and the ios port.There were few ways that non-Japanese gamers could legitimately play FFV. Now to conclude my long-winded thoughts I recommend this game thoroughly.\nFinal Score: 9.5/10","October 22, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was really excited that they were bringing all the FF games to PC, yet they decided to badly port the worst versions and just pan then off to suckers like me.\n\nI might have even endured this had the scrolling been smooth,as I love the game in general, but it really is really quite juttery and not very pleasant to play. The new art is awful, the scrolling is very jerky and the sound isn't all that great either. No Steam overlay and for some reason Fraps doesn't appear either, which is annoying when trying to figure out why the scrolling is so rough.\n\nFFV is a great game and well worth a playthrough, but this is just not the way you ever want to experience it. Do yourself a favour and play it elsewhere,  really, you will have a much better experience. My downrating is not in relation to FFV in general, I really like the game, it's just for this godawful port I thought might be okay.\n\nSave your money, get the "original".","March 10","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoy it all the way through. There are a few issues, tiling can easily be seen, I found some graphical errors, like when I made Kerile monk and she glitched between both rows. Also when your in battle, at points the game will try to recommend what to do next, for example defend to reduce damage taken when your at low health, however it never takes into acount the enemy HP and the status of your white mage, so you could accidentally select defend or use an item. Keep in mind the problems I just mentioned are only on the PC port to my knowledge, however the actual game doesn't have any major flaws, other than it being a bit on the easy side. I would recommend this game if your a fan of JRPG's, old or new, however if you can't take a little bit of grinding and you dislike the battle system seen in VII, then skip this one. Me personally, I really enjoyed it, one of my favourite Final Fantasy games.","January 18","true","48.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you liked old school Final Fantasy games, you will probably like this. It's polished, decently well translated, and moderately difficult, just like the original.\n\nLooks like it has a bit of extra content, though I haven't played far enough to get to it in this version. Not convinced that it adds much to the experience, but Steam cards and achievements are nice if you're into that (I am). There are a few annoying glitches with the ATB menu, but it's not a deal-breaker.\n\nThe downsides include the fact that they used a rather half-baked graphics filter to smooth out the pixels, and in fullscreen mode, there is a horrid amount of what looks like screen tearing that could be fixed by using v-sync, which is not an option in the graphics menu.\n\nI didn't like this translation as much as the RPGe one from the late 90s, but it's far, far better than the one from the PSX release of this game. I didn't play the GBA version, so I can't comment on that.\n\nThe addition of the Amano concept art to the dialog boxes was a nice touch, even though they look NOTHING at all like the character sprites.\n\nMy other complaints with the game were mostly centred around the fact that I forgot how awfully GRINDY this game is (as were most RPGs at the time). Can't really hold that against it though, since it's not a remake, just a rerelease.\n\nFinal verdict, if you've already played this on other platforms, you can safely skip it, unless you want to push your nostalgia buttons, otherwise, it does a much better job of that than the butchery that was the FFIV DS port, so recommended. I'd still have preferred a direct port of the original though.","January 9","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
