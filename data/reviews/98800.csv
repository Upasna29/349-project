He began as a strange idea for the most stupid type of character I could have made. He would punch everything, get the crap kicked out of him, and drink every philter of booze he found. I crafted him and then set him loose on the first level and was amazed when he did not die immediately. I followed his adventures as he raided kitchens, punched robots to death, and drunkenly stumbled through level after level. He made it farther than any other character I had made, I formed a massive backstory for him as he went that bordered on actual fanfiction. It was the most beautiful thing that has ever happened. Gershwin swaggered onto yeat another level and began tearing through the obstacles in the best hat zorkmids could buy.  Gershwin ran into a room filled with fountains and saw a single lutefisk warrior on an outcropping. He rushed over to give him what for like the gentleman adventuer he is, but the warrior must have known him by reputation as he started to hide behind the nearest fountain. Gershwin rushed over and gave him the, "Dance of One Thousand Boots." Then Gershwin realized, he had kicked the fountain in his haste as well. The fountain had landed in an immovable position and was wedged there forever. My heart broke in that moment because I knew, Gershwin would forever be bobbing his eyebrows on that stone islet. Never to adventure again. He is now the only save file that will forever remain, and Gershwin will forever be punished for my hubris. Buy Dungeons of Dredmor, have adventures, inadvertently enact a tragedy.","August 16, 2014","true","147.5"," 176 of 193 people (91%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","91","176","193","37","5"

Well, maybe I'm overstating. But it's definitely one of the best -if not THE best- Roguelike I've ever played. I will always return to this game. It will constantly captivate me in its shiny roguelike eyes. Maybe it's because every character you make can have a new and exciting build. Maybe it's because no run-through is exactly the same. Maybe it's because there's actual crafting that's better than in some big name MMO's. Maybe it's because your death is always your own damn fault. Or maybe it's because diggles are so cute (but they hate you so much). I don't know, probably all of the above (definitely). I will always love this game and this game will always show me a good time. If you know what I mean. And I think you do.\n\nNegatives? The humor is sometimes a little too much, I think, like every-blooming-thing needed to be funny. Oh, there's funny in there, but sometimes you just want the flavor texts to give it a rest already. Furthermore, I guess the art style turns off some people, not me personally, but I've heard it as a complaint. I can understand that, but my advice would be to ignore it and just try it.\n\nYou won't be disappointed.","November 25, 2013","true","173.8"," 138 of 150 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","138","150","0","7"

Those who say that have not met our Lord and Saviour Lutefisk. The Lutefisk is a kind giver, and also a taker, for one cannot recieve what they are not willing to give away. Thus has been taught to me by the Lutefisk. As we delve deeper, we will all be taught by the Lutefisk; we will all join the Cult of the Lutefisk. However, a new Cult is not the only thing that Dungeons of Dredmor offers.\n\nAs a roguelike RPG, gameplay is simple: run around, grab loot, kill monsters, and don't die (and not just because Lutefisk does not promise an afterlife). However, there are many fun and exciting features. An advanced set of skill selection, in the form of multiple skill trees with linear paths, keeps combat unique and different. For example, I have had builds where I run around and just kick monsters to death (yes I mean kick, as in with a boot) while dual-wielding shields and builds where I teleport in, drop mines, push monsters onto said mines, and teleport out of explosion-related danger. There are several different interactions in the game that either reward or punish you. For example, Krong, the God of Anvils, leaves blessed anvils randomly on floors in the dungeon that you can enchant your gear with. It is not until you place your gear on the anvil, the point of no return, when you find out if Krong blesses or curses you. And of course, interactions involves our dear Lutefisk. Tithing Lutefisk at a Lutefisk Shrine, a food item that offers barely any health regen, may appease the Lutefisk God, and he may give you an enchanted item. DoD also offers a completely fair difficulty curve: each floor means significantly harder enemies. Therefore, as logic dictates, you should complete the entire floor you're on for as much experience and items as possible. The only exception to this rule is random minibosses and of course, Dredmor. Minibosses are literally there to make sure you're paying attention to the game. If you're punching everything, and notice this one monster is doing half your health in one hit, you should probably use a different strategy. Dredmor is a completely overpowered piece of... bologna... but I mean, to me this makes sense. It's HIS dungeon, HIS realm of power, and you're trying to stop him. If he was weak, why would a HERO (and quite the hero you are!) need to stop him? If nothing else, this hard task merely forces you to further investigate every chest, to question every move, and to work ever harder at making that perfect combination of skills.\n\nAnother good part about this game is that it's very accessible. There are three difficulty levels, permadeath is optional (so you can save your dearest characters), there is an option for smaller floors with the same experience gain, and with DLC, there is an option for 5 more floors of grinding before the boss. Speaking of DLC quickly, two DLC packs are super cheap (2.99 USD each and actually the Deluxe edition has the game and those two DLC for just 6.99 USD), and the third DLC pack is free. Cheap and easy to get into means that casual players can enjoy as well, while advanced difficulties and more options means that the hardcore Roguelike fan can cater to their style as well.\n\nAnother important thing about DoD in my opinion is the community. This is one of the most friendly, most helpful, best communities I have ever experienced on any game ever. Most questions get answered in minutes, and the number of guides for new players is seemingly limitless. These same helpful and friendly people also make amazing mods that add even more playability to a game I haven't been bored for even a second in.\n\nTL;DR: All in all, DoD is an accessible, fun, pun-packed, Cult-creating, deceptively simple Roguelike RPG with a good community and workshop integration. I would highly recommend this game even off of a sale, and when on sale I will attest that it's literally a "can't miss". If anybody has any questions, ask in the comments section, I will do my very best to answer them in a timely manner. Similarly, I will try to continue to edit this guide at appropriate times.\n\nThe"Your TL;DR is still annoyingly long, sir."TL;DR: Very fun, creative game; amazing community; astounding Workshop content; optional Cult participation. Worth every penny.","November 9, 2014","true","237.8"," 116 of 132 people (88%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","88","116","132","39","4"

Since then, a genre known as Rogue-like was born.\nA rogue-like game typically features a randomised dungeon, turn based movement and a plethora of skills and items at your disposal. Classic RPG weapons and armor, wizardry and sneaky rogues fighting monsters, all drably illustrated with ASCII graphics.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor takes all that, slaps on a easy mouse interface, some charming graphics and audio, and chucks on some good humour to boot. This is quite possibly the only game - now and forever - where I can roll a beserker viking pirate communist emo vegan. Monsters will waltz up to me moaning "I wasn't even supposed to be here today". It won't make you laugh until your face falls off, but it'll have you smirking with the occasional "hah!" throughout.\n\n\nIf you're just curious and never tried a rogue-like before, give it a shot. It's a fairly simple game, but with enough hardcore depth to have you reaching for the wiki once you get into it. It also has a range of addons found on the Steam workshop, so there's never an end to the strange setups you can employ and the delightful humour it prizes. It's often on a 75% off sale during holiday periods, and at that price it's well worth a dabble and beyond good value.","November 26, 2013","true","267.9"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","62","67","0","0"

This is one of those games.  I will play it, revisit it, time and time again, until I can't anymore.  It's that epic.\n\nTrue to it's rogue-like nature, there is very little hand-holding in this game.  There isn't -too- much to figure out for yourself, but there is definitely enough to keep things interesting.  The turn-based combat is refreshing, as is the way you can use items (clicking on an enemy while holding a bolt from your inventory will shoot them with said bolt).\n\nThe base stats are a a refreshing new twist, with stats not seen in any other games.  Of course, you've got about a million ways to start your character depending on what type of play-style you're going through.  Base stats serve only to enhance secondary stats, which are used throughout most of the game.  Nothing big to figure out, but you could definitely be a min/maxer if you wanted to be.  I prefer the role-play / lore route.\n\nPerma-death mode is the only mode I'll ever play.  As your characters die, your name, level, and score all get added to a giant headstone which shows all of your previous deaths as well.  Making it exceedingly interesting to see just how much farther you can push into the dreaded Dungeons of Dredmor.\n\nOver all, I HIGHLY recommend this game.  I feel like it is one out of over 150 titles that I own that I got much, much more than I paid for.  If you pass this one up, you're missing out.  Buy it.

You're now entering the Diggle Danger Zone!\nDeveloper: Gaslamp Games, Inc\nPublisher: Gaslamp Games, Inc\nFormat: PC\nReleased: August 1st, 2012\n\nYeah, good luck playing any video games today with this guy staring at you with his big... deep... fishy eyes.\n(The Lutefisk God is not to be confused with Dagon, Prince of the Sea. That's, uh, a different video game.)\nLet me start by saying that Dungeons of Dredmor is rogue like dungeon crawler and a parody of those at the same time. Lovely isn't it?\n\nOh boy where do I begin?\nI think this game was my first step into the roguelike genre and it became my favorite genre by far ever since.\n\nHaving said that let's get down to business.\n\nStoryYou're the chosen one. The hero. The man or the woman with the eyebrows of destiny! It's your duty to venture into the depths of the Dungeon of Dredmor and to show not only him but also every damn Diggle you'll encounter on your way who's Boss: The one with the most majestic eyebrows ever! and that is you!\n\nGameplayDungeons of Dredmor is turn based game means you move on a tile based square grid where you and your enemies take turns. Each floor is randomly generated meaning you will never see the same layout, types and amount of enemies or loot. Every single playthrough will be an unique and unforgiving experience.\n\nBefore you experience your first death by a fierce Diggle you will have to choose the difficulty and your seven starter skills.\nYou can choose between warrior skills like Swords, Axes, Maces or Smithing, rogue related skills like assassination, daggers or burglary and you can obviously become a powerfull wizard using skills like golemancy, alchemy or Astrology.\n\nThere have been several expansions for this game so far and each expansion includes some new skills like Demonologist (Realm of the Diggle Gods), Clockwork Knight (You have to name the expansion pack. <- yes you really have to) and Tourist (Conquest of the Wizardlands).\nAfter choosing skills to your like or letting the game choose some randomly for you it's time to enter the dungeon!\n\nThe game starts as you take control of our Hero with those beautiful eyebrows. Your goal is to get to Dredmor and to show him who's boss (obviously that's you but he didn't get the memo yet).\n\nIn order to reach Dredmor you'll have to fight your way through fierce Diggles, grab some better loot and also level up.\n\nWhile exploring your surroundings and getting beat up by those Diggles you will encounter several objects you can interact with. Like a well with a blue liquid in it. Too blue to be water so you take a sip and here comes's the beauty of the game. The effect will be random meaning you can get healed which would be sweet so you can get your revenge on those Diggles (ye I they're our arch enemy!) or you can get poisoned and die a pathetic death.\nAlso there's Krong. You will have a serious love and hate relationship with this fellow. You will find some anvils in the dungeon. Interacting with it will either bless you and upgrade one of your items or Krong will curse you for not cleaning your teeth this morning.\n\nAlso keep in mind that some area of effect skills can and will hurt you as well just in case you think it would be a good idea to set the ground on fire. It's gonna get hot and you won't like it trust me.\n\nThen there's also Brax. A bad ♥♥♥ shop keeper who clearly isn't scared of all those damn Diggles.\nYou can buy and also sell loot. If you are brave enough you could also see if you are fast enough to steal something but ... that's up to you to decide. You will have to face the consequences.\n\nVisualYou either love the Art Style or you hate it. There's not much else. Personally I really Diggle (hah see what I did there!?) the Art Style and I think it's just fitting for this game. It's not looking to serious and let's be honest: Nothing's serious in Dungeons of Dredmor.\nThe only thing that's a bit meh is the UI but the way the game looks is quite charming.\n\nWhat else can I say about this game?Gaslamp Games made a lot of things right I'd even go as far as to say nearly perfect if not for some minor interface issues and also the crafting in this game is tad clunky.\nIf you can overlook the art style (which probably isn't to everyone's liking) and the minor interface issues you will deeply enjoy this game.\nGiven you like roguelikes and getting beat up by Diggles ...

There are lots of games out there now that rock a similar angle— many of them good, some of them great— but very few retain the structure of Rogue like Dredmor. Here you will find bare-bones inventory management(so many times you'll drop things, rearrange them, et cetera), permadeath(though it can be turned off), procedurally-generated labyrinths and stupid monsters. The crafting system, the skill trees, all of it is designed to let you fall through the cracks. All of it is designed around letting you die.\n\nAnd it is gloriously addictive, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nThe first forty hours of Dredmor I didn't even get to see the namesake Lich at the bottom of the dungeon. I was playing on the hardest difficulty, with permadeath, and I just kept dying before the fifth floor. Then, suddenly, playing a character named Pyra Mancy, everything lined up perfectly and victory was assured. It was delicious.\n\nTriple A games have abandoned this concept, that insane difficulty makes ultimate success that much more rewarding. But of all the games I've beaten on my gameslist, it's no wonder that I'm proudest of Isaac and Dredmor.

This is a game where you will probably only ever be using the arrow keys and a mouse click, and the simplicity of this provides an easy gaming experience.\n\nI will say I have never played past the medium difficulty level, and I will go further as to say that I have never even completed a single save, I don't usually play with permadeath on either, it's mainly a case of me creating various heroes and forgetting how far I got on each one and deciding to start all over again. This is not a game you could finish in one sit through, even when enabling the mode which reduces the size of the levels, this game is still massive and takes a lot of time to cover each area and collect each item.\n\nOne thing I would imagine playing this game is that the simplicity and repetitiveness of this game would get boring, but it never seems to do that, I believe it is probably the desire to push on for more loot, gold and exp to max our your skill sets, as well as find interesting new items with cool stats and comparing them with your current inventory, perhaps one of the most thrilling discoveries you can make on any level is finding the store, which always stocks a bizaare inventory.\n\nThe music is also really good, and while it may feel repetitive at some points, it still manages to sound really great and perhaps helps in setting the mood for becoming immersed in the game.\n\nI would say the main factor for enjoying this game is that it excels in making you feel that you have achieved and made progress, there are a lot of achievements you can unlock, and two expansions which add more levels and crazy skills to master, this is definitely a great entry and perhaps a little overlooked work within the roguelike genre and I cannot recommend it enough.\n\nThat being said, this game is pretty buggy at times, the levels appear to be randomly generated and at times this can result in some items being blocked off and unattainable without the right skills, and this while slightly annoying, doesn't really take much away from enjoying the game, the game was also very buggy when I played it around it's time of release, but it does seem a lot more stable now. So I would still say it's definitely worth picking up especially given how good the price is.","October 25, 2014","true","21.8"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","30","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDek/recommended/98800/","TekDek","Tek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDek/","360 products in account","-TL;DR at Bottom-\n\nDungeons of Dredmor is simultaneously an addictively expansive roguelike with heaps of replay value and a disappointingly, shallow experience, and in this way, it is the World of Warcraft of it's genre. For it's price it absolutely is worth it, but at the end of the day you are left wishing the devs would have put a bit more thought into the game to create a solid experience.\n\nAt it's base, DoD is a turn-based dungeon crawler with painfully basic combat. You walk around rooms, meet monsters, left click them until they're dead. Occasionally you'll meet a situation where the enemies are statistically and/or numerically superior to you, at which case you must randomly spam offensive/defensive items and abilities at the issue until it's solved, and you really don't even have to pay much attention to exactly what it is you're using. It's just too inconsequential, regardless of the vast amount of options available to you. Increasing the difficulty or enabling perma-death somehow manages not to address this issue, it simply requires for you to pay more attention to the handful of mechanics that really matter. It might seem better for the first few floors of each playthrough, but regardless of settings and skillbuilds, the experience will degrade into the above mentioned simplicity by floor 5 no matter what it is you do, which is primarily due to XP and high level items being too abundant, leading to overleveling reducing the difficulty. Again, this stems from a lack of critical thinking employed in the basic game design, and while it'd be unfeasible to change anything at this stage of the game, it should have been taken much more seriously back in it's development infancy. The importance of a balanced experience distribution in an RPG game is one of the first things any old scrub with a couple hours of dabbling in RPG Maker learns, so it's downright embarrassing that Gaslamp Games took it so lightly.\n\nSo that's the core of the game. Why is this a good purchase then? Well the game has three factors that save it from itself; Humor, Content and Steam Workshop.\n\nHumor, I would say, is DoD's greatest asset. Without it's presence, it would crumble and fall into the realms of indie shovelware, and it combines together with a feature that you can never go wrong with; content. So there's a lot of humor is what I'm trying to say. So the way this game works is, after presumably completing the short tutorial course, you start a new game and enter character creation. This process is unlike anything you've experienced before. You right off the bat get to chose a number of skill trees (1-8) for your Adventurer and decide your playstyle on the spot. The fun factor in this is all the various combinations made possible by this formula. Simply put, you can be a regular Melee user, a wizard or a mix of both, and if you'd like you can take the Warlock tree to help with that. Or not. It's very freeform, although hard to explain. Right off the bat you'll notice via the Skill Trees' descriptions that the game's funny. You have skill trees like "Battle Geology: Like all geologists, you can create earthquakes, armor yourself in stone, and petrify enemies. " and "Warlockery: Warlocks are wizards that really wish they were warriors. Or Rogues. Or cheesemongers. Anything but wizards, really. Their "spells" (as they are) serve to make them less wizard-like in a variety of ways.". If these two make you chuckle, or at least make you go "heh" internally, then you'll have an absolute blast once you actually plunge into the game. Every item name, item description, skill, spell, room, monster, monster description - really everything that's anything with words on it will have humorous dialogue that simply never gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ old. Even monsters often make snarky comments from a list of a thousand or more phonemes. It ranges from low to high brow humor, references and even some memes here and there and it never feels distasteful or tired. If you're imaginative and weird, like me, you could also give a voice to all the text in your head, so that the Narrator from Trine 2, or hell, Jef Goldbloom says all the stuff, and it'll be all the more hilarious. And there's tons of this content, just tons and tons and tons. Rightfully so, because the game consists of 10-15 dungeons per run with each floor taking at LEAST an hour to complete unless you're leaving stuff unexplored.\n\nThis is where the Steam Workshop comes in. I personally don't recommend playing the game without all 3 DLC's installed AND the majority of the workshop content subscribed to and loaded up. The almost inexhaustible supply of content is the single one thing that can and will distract you from how shallow a game Dungeons of Dredmor actually is. When you're pretending to be a Vegan Necromantic Steampunk Knight and reading funny bits all the time, you don't care about gameplay. You'll be immersed into the whackiest, stupidest scenarios you've ever seen and you'll make it work. It's all novelty, but when there's this much of it, it works better than a real freaking game.\n\nI should fleetingly mention that crafting and inventory management is a huge hit and miss. During some runs, I'll have patience and indulge in the hassle that comes with dealing with it. Other times I'll simply ignore 90% of the loot that spawns all over the floor and wish they put more effort into it. Ironically, while I'd say it's bad in this game, DoD's crafting is exactly what today's MMOs could use in order to make crafting actually freaking interesting. Because MMO's are MEANT to be timesinks, and items there would be worth the literal hours it takes to get specific equipment with noticable and snazzy uses like in DoD. As opposed to stupid junk you will NEVER pawn off on marketplaces, nor even think about using yourself. Oh and the music is loud and obnoxious but it grows on you.\n\nOne last, last thing; The gameplay is crap, alright, fine. But I should tell you that if you're of the particularly imaginative sort, there's plenty of room to create fun, self-imposed challenges that could alleviate this issue. On a basic example, you could stylize your character to only wield clockwork/steampunk styled items, which limits your equipment and arsenal. You can take concepts like this to much deeper levels that I can't really explain without you having played the game. It's like those weird people you see on GameFAQ's making up weird challenge run guides for Final Fantasy games. You can do that if that's your sort of schtick.\n\n-TL;DR-\n\nGameplay: 2/5 - Shallow. Relies on your imagination to make it fun. Not for the casuals.\nReplay Value: 5/5 - There's lots of ways to play and things to try and as a Roguelike, the game does excell.\nContent: 5/5 - Thousands upon thousands of hilarious descriptions, names and phonemes is the game's primary source of fun.\nMusic: 3/5 - It grows on you, but nothing to write home about. Title song is catchy.\nArt: 3/5 - It's pixelart. It's alright. Level art styles will leave you scratching your head sometimes.","November 16, 2014","true","56.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","22","24","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/98800/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","If you want to get started with roguelikes, Dungeons of Dredmor is as good a place as any. It straddles an important line between more mainstream adaptations of the concept and the originators, where neophytes can find easy access and veterans can find a new take on old ideas. And while it may not be perfect in a lot of ways, it passes the main test of being something you can play for way, way too long.\n\nDredmor is really a traditional, grid-based, turn-based, everything-random roguelike dressed up in some handsome(ish) graphics and modern sensibilities. The only story you get is that you're a hero, and you're descending into the titular dungeons to whack the equally-titular Lord Dredmor. There's a thick layer of nerd humor over the whole package that runs more than skin-deep, as it even informs the class and stat systems. Luckily it's not the aggravating metahumor of something like Retro City Rampage, and is actually quite snappy and clever for the most part.\n\nThe aforementioned class system is probably the big draw of DoD, for newbies and veterans alike. Each character you roll gets seven skill sets to choose from a list of dozens, including everything from sword and shield skills to veganism and communism. Every time you level up, you can unlock another skill from one of your sets, allowing you to knock out one tree with half a dozen levels or diversify as you see fit. Sets tend to be eclectic mixes of active skills and passive bonuses, with some being demonstratively better than others, but all of them interesting and worth a try.\n\nOutside of the skill system, there's admittedly not a lot of innovation to be found here. You wander the dungeon, grab loot, kill monsters, and so on. There are shrines to pray to, gods to appease, vending machines to shake, traps to disarm, levers to pull, and plenty of things to die to. Unlike the roguelikes of yore, however, death tends not to come all that swiftly in Dredmor. It's pretty easy to keep your stats and gear up with the challenge presented by enemies if you're cleaning out the floors, to the point that by floor three or so, nothing's going to kill you outside of a room completely packed with monsters.\n\nThis ties into the main problem with Dredmor, the fact that individual runs can get pretty boring after a point. Unlike most roguelikes, the early game is when you need to pay attention to your skills and your loot. Once you get your rhythm locked in, levels start to blend together. The slow default move speed and animations drag things out a bit longer than they should, and your inventory and crafting windows really could have used another pass on usability. For as many steps forward that Dredmor takes as a modern roguelike, it has a couple feet planted firmly in the past.\n\nAll that said, I was able to sink 30 hours into the game before I grew well and truly tired of it. And those were an enjoyable 30 hours of looting, smashing, and giggling at the goofy jokes. Dredmor will go a lot farther with those new to the roguelike genre, but there is undeniably something for everyone, at least while it stays fresh.","December 18, 2015","true","30.5"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

The simple graphics and combat of Dungeons of Dredmor obscure its incredible depth of design, functional mechanics and polishing, and it really is a fully fleshed out title. My fun in Dungeons of Dredmor comes from battling through hoards of monsters while interacting with the world, using traps, spells, crafting and more, all while exploring ever deeper.\n\nHighlights\nThere are plenty of little things that help this stand out and help to make it something more than most rogue-likes, but the central design philosophy of accessability and the respect it has for the classic elements that make rogue-like games so fun that make it very much worth my time and keep me coming back.\n\nA plethora of additions and extra gameplay elements like crafting and landmines which would easily become an annoying chore or distraction in other games has been made completely optional and ignorable here, yet still adds lots of practicality to the game when you spend the time.\n\n* The attention to enabling and supporting Steam Workshop content definitely deserves comment. It's been woven into the game perfectly and means sharing rooms, items, monsters and even things like insults and decorations is rewarding.\n* The humour deserves mention. There are references to movies, old video games and culture not just spread throughout the world, but even in the U.I. and elsewhere.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nIt has been genuinely quite hard to find something to dislike about this game and the only things that are worth pointing out haven't really affected the fun I've had with this title, but they're here in the interest of a complete\n\nreview. The main drawback or limitation of the game is in the simple and, some would argue, boring combat. Fighting thousands of monsters in the same way, typically using the same specific skills and abilities can wear thin and unless you're willing to make some form of goal and targets, or story for yourself, reasons for playing can easily feel empty and flat.\n\n* The tutorial is quick and simple, but also very lacking. There are a ton of gameplay elements and user interface mechanics that aren't covered anywhere and usually have to be searched for to learn about, or will simply be discovered by chance.\n* Dredmor, the end-game boss can feel out of place and the ending can feel abrupt for some.\n\nRecommendations\nPresently available on Steam for £3.49/4.99€/$4.99 and with no real limit in replay value, Dungeons of Dredmor will take around 20 to 30 hours to complete a successful run, but reaching that run may take you 100 hours or more. As a\n\nresult, it's very fairly priced and good value for money even when not on sale, yet routinely goes on sale for -50% and -75% and is a must buy for anyone looking for an approachable rogue like.\n\nThe Complete version costs just 30% more, is available for £4.99/5.99€/$6.99. It is almost exclusively the better choice over the stand alone because it adds Conquest of the Wizardlands and the Realm of the Diggle Gods DLCs which add a total of 12 new Skill Trees, hundreds of new items, dungeon levels, monsters and mini-bosses and plenty more. Unless you don't expect to play more than a few hours or you're on a strict budget then there's no obvious reason not to grab the Complete pack.\n\n* Don't forget to install and name the Expansion Pack which is available for free.","July 28, 2015","true","10.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

This game is incredibly well designed.\n\nUnlike other roguelikes I feel the game actually gives me a leg to stand on and isn't out to screw me from the start. Its fair, something you usually don't hear in the same sentence when it comes to these games. The game wants you to succeed  and it wants you to have a good time.\n\nI also love how huge the levels are, I spent about an hour and a half on the FIRST FLOOR! Seriously, I just kept finding new doors to kick open. It also means you will be sufficiently buff for the next level. Seriously, dont blow through them.\n\nBut in conclusion. While yes this game may not look like much on the outside give it a chance. Its tons of random fun and has charm for days.","March 20, 2014","true","16.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

It's colourful, full of personality, and clearly made with love.  Amazing for introducing someone to the genre.\n\nIt also, however, begins to drag after a while; a complete game with Realm of the Diggle Gods and full-sized floors takes an absurd amount of time for what quickly starts devolving into incredibly repetitive content.  Monsters have little variety, stellar equipment slowly starts fading into a pile of ultimately unremarkable items, there's extremely little secrets or rare content to discover... it lacks the meat, depth, and sense of discovery to actually sustain itself over long periods of time.\n\nSo to be most specific on whether I'd recommend this game or not: If you don't know what the word "Roguelike" means yet, this is a great way to start the genre and enjoy yourself.  But if you're already into Roguelikes, as charming as Dungeons of Dredmor is, you'll find that once you get a game that survives the first ~4 floors, the game is ultimately just reptetitive and boring.","December 11, 2013","false","57.5"," 40 of 67 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","40","67","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/98800/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1476 products in account","Basic InformationTitle: Dungeons of Dredmor\nGenre: Casual, Indie, RPG\nDeveloper: Gaslamp Games, Inc.\nPublisher: Gaslamp Games, Inc.\nRelease Date: 13 Jul, 2011\n\nBasic OverviewDungeons of Dredmor is a very intresting and very different from other Rogue-like RPGs I have played in the past. This game has randomly generated levels, along with loads of skills that you can mix and match to your liking. This adds very high replay value to the game, which is what you would expect from a (optional) perma-death game. It's sometimes frustrating to be killed by an enemy when you've spent to long on a play through, but that's to be expected from a perma-death run of this game.\n\nGame playThis game has a lot of variation, whether it's randomly generated floors or a huge amount of skills to choose from. Each run is very different from the last. I found myself dying a lot when I first started playing it, but the I kept coming back for just 'one more run.' Then that one more run turned into two or maybe three. The game really pulls you in, it has a great atmosphere when playing it on Perma-death. You never know what's going to happen which makes you more alert for what can happen, maybe you will find a monster zoo and then you have to be careful. There is a wide variety of different enemies for each floor, and each floor has a different theme to it with specific enemies that you will encounter along the way. As for the weapons and classes there is a nice variety for them as well which gives you a better attack damage for a specific weapon type and will depend with what happen you start off with. But what makes this game even more unique is that you can substitute a weapon class for another skill that may or may not be better. You can make the game even more difficult on yourself if the hardest difficulty is too easy for you by having skills that aren't very helpful to you. There are so many traps, and levers that you have no idea what it will activate. Maybe it will open a door, or maybe it'll teleport you to somewhere else. That's the beauty of this game. The attack system is turn-based, so you move once then the enemies move. It can be a simple point and click or you can use WSAD for moving your character, then attacking is just simple being close to the enemy (if you use a melee weapon) and clicking on them to take it in turns to attack.\nScore (Out of 10): 10 - Very high replay value and variation!\n\nSound & MusicThe music for this game is perfectly fitting for the atmosphere and the game play for this game. Although it can get a little bit repetitive it's still nice to listen to when you are fighting a bunch of enemies at once. The sounds of each thing that you use, such as swinging your sword or axe is all very unique. It is quite obvious that the developers put a lot of time and effort into creating the sounds for each things. I would like to see some more music in this game that matches the atmosphere of the game.\nScore (Out of 10): 9 - Would like to see some more music that fits the atmosphere\n\nGraphics/Art StyleFor me the art style of this game is just perfect. It really fits in with the with the whole atmosphere and dungeons kind of feel. It's not a too series style of art, but then again it doesn't look innocent. It just fits perfectly with the whole gaming experience. Some people might not like it because of the cartoon kind of style to it, but I am just saying it from what I think.\nScore (Out of 10): 10 - My own personal opinion, you might not like the art style\n\nConclusionSo there is my whole review for this game, it's a very unique type of rogue-lite RPG game. It has very high repay value which always makes you come back to the game. It has great atmospheric music, I would only want to see a few more soundtracks on this game, and the art style, well take it or leave it. You'll either love it or you'll hate it.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 12","true","10.5"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","17","26","2","0"

Although it may be more accessible than any of those three games that Dredmor is similar to, do not think that this game is a rogue meant only for newbies, for the game equally appeals to those who had previous experience with rogue-likes. In addition to this, the game has a really neat character creation system, as you pick seven skill strees which determine what kind of archtype your character is (and, in turn, determines what kind of stats will be increased the most), as well as give you some skills that will help you kick some monster ♥♥♥. Combine that with a very solid combat system and a catchy soundtrack, and you got yourself a good rogue.

I hate this stupid game, I'm so fed up of dieing! Although, one more try wouldn't hurt ..."\n\nAnother roguelike with the one-more-life addiction working for it. Dungeons of Dredmor ticks a lot of boxes for me. I love the art and the sound and think it works fantastically together. I haven't even scratched the surface of the Steam Workshop for this game, which will potentially add hundreds more hours of fun to it. What DoD does best, is it makes me engage with my characters journey. I'm likely to stay alive in DoD for a few hours, and this makes me attached to what I've achieved so far and makes me want that character to be victorious. Alas, they rarely are. They often meet their end in some embarrassing way, to an enraged Diggle or something (sidenote - I really want a Diggle plushie. That would rock). Just writing about DoD makes me want to play more!\n\nThis game is superb for it's price.\n\nPlay it on Permadeath for the best experience.","December 27, 2011","true","38.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The amount of content you get for just a few dollars is incredible, and 800 hours later I still find myself learning new things. The humor is goofy and fresh, there's tons and tons of skill combinations, and for once, it's an RPG with a crafting system which is actually pretty interesting. Dredmor is simple enough so that people of any background can easily jump into it and have fun, but there are also difficulty levels for all sorts of players, and enough depth to challenge you as you progress.\n\nI've been playing this game for several years now, and it is by far the best purchase I've made on Steam.

Im not usually a fan of Turn-Based RPGs but this one just got me hooked instantly!!! I thought to give it a try and what a game!! Its original price is so worth the game, 4 euros is litterally a bargin for such a game.\n\nIn a game like this expect to die...........a lot. Its a Rogue-like, Turn-based, RPG, Permadeath game, meaning litterally if u die, well ur dead. The execution of all them put together waas done so well in this game. You start the game with your choice of sex and then 7 different "talents" you could say, from around 40 different ones!!! You basically mix and match what u want to be and then are put in a randomised dungeon, to survive. I have died 10 times four with the same talents and then just tried something else. Im now playing, still alive lvl 10 with the talents i originally wanted, but with more understanding of the game im now not fouled.\n\nIts a hillerious game with great amounts of time and depth put into it. I am having a lot of fun and now cause of this game i might look into more turn-based games.

For example, the game 1000000. It is a cheap game, sold at a cheap price. And then take BL Pre-sequal, a game that arguably charges more than the content it provides is worth. However, Dungeons of Dredmor has presented me with the rare privalege of saying that this game is worth more than the asking price. Since purchasing and playing many a game, over many an hour, I am happily willing to say that, if it were demanded of me, I would have payed 15$ for this game. Maybe even 20$. That is how much it is worth to me. Any many of my friends agreed with me. Many of their first words of reaction were "You got this for HOW MUCH?!". And so I present to you Dungeons of Dredmor, a game that, for some reason, feels the need to make you pay but a fraction of the game's true value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/98800/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I can't remember when I bought this, but I got the Diggle Nog cheevo for the 2011 Winter Sale event, so that could say something.  It took about three years of hiatus and 107 hours to finally kill Dredmor...once.  On Easy (and Permadeath).\n\nDredmor is a roguelike, and I think it's a pretty good introduction to the genre since I've not really played many of them.  You start out by picking from three difficulties, if you want your character to be permanently deleted when he/she dies or not, and if you bought the Realm of the Diggle Gods expansion, if you want to have 10 or 15 floors.  From there, you're given a page full of skills and you're to pick seven to make your character build, as opposed to having set classes like Warrior or Battlemage or whatnot--or you can just pick Random and see how that does.  And then you're given your choice of cosmetic gender, you name your character, and you're sent on your merry way.\n\nEverything is laid out on a grid and every time you move or attack uses up a turn, where everything else is allowed to move or attack.  You can quite literally stand with enemies surrounding you and nothing will happen until you do something.  You level up with enough EXP by killing enemies, destroying Dredmor statues, or unlocking doors/chests with lockpicks.  When you level up, you recover all HP/MP, and you're given your choice of your seven skills to raise which will influence how your stats increase.  Skills work on a linear tree system, but you're allowed to raise your skills in any order, between raising them all up evenly or maxing one as soon as possible.  Every skill in every tree does something, be it simply raising your stats by a set amount or giving you interesting new spells or moves or powers.\n\nCombat is pretty much "hit it until it dies" if you're going melee, but every character can use crossbows provided they have ammo and wands as long as they have charges, no matter what build you went with.  Some enemies use long-ranged spells too, so it's a matter of using what you have to counter their threat.  Monsters typically don't show up en masse during the game except in Monster Zoos, big rooms where mooks and minibosses pretty much Zerg Rush you.  You don't necessarily have to clear them out, but you get a free item for wiping everything out, and it's a lot of EXP, too.  You also get free items for doing sidequests gained by praying at the Inconsequentia statues scattered through the dungeons.  They're pretty basic quests--kill this enemy/group, retrieve an item, use this item on a special statue, etc.\n\nI think Dredmor is a pretty fair game in terms of difficulty.  If you die, it's almost always your fault.  Died to a trap?  You carelessly marched forward without enough Trap Sight Radius.  Fight an enemy to where the point both of you are near-death and you miss, dying to its attack?  You didn't heal yourself, retreat, try to lead it into traps, etc.  Of course, this game is randomly-generated so you can quite easily end up with a bad draw on items and stuff, but one draw of roguelikes isn't the game giving you the tools needed to win, but winning with the tools you're given.  No one game is unwinnable if you keep your wits about you and don't get complacent.\n\nThe expansions...well, expand.  RotDG adds monsters, skills, items, five more floors; YHTNTEP adds more monsters, items, skills; CotW adds even more monsters and skills and items, but also adds new floors apart from the main dungeon on top of a customizable safe zone (though the base game has a basic version of this place).  There are also quite a few mods on Steam and not on Steam that add more of the above and with things like additional room layouts and so on, but some may require some or all of the expansions, so watch for that.\n\nSo yeah, TL;DR I would really recommend this game.  If you're new to roguelikes, this is a pretty good place to start.  Easy mode is pretty easy, hard is pretty damned hard, but that all depends on how the RNG treats you and how you build your characters.  There are a lot of achievements here...though a lot of them require you to die to various critters.  But you know what they say:  Dying is fun!","March 5, 2015","true","107.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

On first glance, it seems pretty basic and generic as there are so many games with the same genre. However, Dungeons of Dredmor manages to stand out from the rest with it's wide array of skills, items, floors and monsters, it's humor, and how much fun you have playing it.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor has you as a hero to defeat Dark Lord Dredmor. On you quest to defeat Dredmor, you will need weapons, armor and a brain to slaughter monsters across the 10 dungeon floors.\n\nDoD has you start off with you picking from about 30 skills (Excluding Deadshot which was removed) and you have the freedom to choose whatever you like. It's a great sense of replayability that is added this way. You can mix and match different skills to see what you like as a player and various skills change your playstyle.. If you happen to mix to certain skills together, you may come up with an amazing combination to destroy some enemies. When you've picked your skills, you get spawned on the first floor. It's good to note that every floor is randomly generated and that the game is turn-based, allowing you to strategize your next move.\n\nNow as you progress through the game, different items will be there to enhance your character through different stats, I won't go into detail though. While the same items do pop up on occasion, they feel different because the stats and it's name is always different. Killing enemies will give you XP and will eventually get you to LVL up, therefore giving you one skill point to give you a passive or active skill. As I've said before, the game's large variety increases how much you play. DoD also has a surprising in-depth crafting system that will let you make better weapons, armor and various items like food and potions.\n\nDoD also has DLC, which is a must buy. It only enhances the game that's already worth your money.The DLC's add more skills, items, floors and balances the game in general. There is also a decent sized workshop community, constantly added mods to make the game better.\n\nOverall, Dungeons of Dredmor is an amazing buy. It's challenging with the option of Permadeath and it really makes you think in a lot of situations. For anyone who loves rouge-likes, you must check this game out.\n\nPROS:\n+Fun and Addicting\n+Charming\n+Humorous\n+Wide Array of Skills\n+Hundreds of Items\n+Challenging\n+Excellent Soundtrack\n+Permadeath Option\n+Deep Crafting System\n+DLC enhances and balances the Base Game\n+100+ Achievements\n+Steam Workshop\n+Bang for Your Buck\n\nCONS:\n-Graphical Style may not be your taste (Grew on me)\n-Other players have been known to lose their progress\n-Items don't change character appearance.\n\nDUNGEONS OF DREDMOR: 9.5/10","July 18, 2013","true","64.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I am writing this review, because the game pushed me towards the edge of negative emotions. Which is quite sad, because the game itself and idea are really good and addictive, sadly not enough to forgive all the non-stop, gamebreaking issues.\n\nThe mains reasons why I cannot, by any stretch of imagination recommend this game.\n1. Game crashes. Crashes sometimes are game-breaking, as the game sometimes just does not save at all. A crash couple times after 1-2 hours of playtime led to completely losing the whole progress until that point and resetting everything including game settings, which is impossible to accept,\n\n2. Game does not autosave for no apparent reason. It shows during gameplay that game has been saved, yet when starting the game the day after I'm still starting not from what I have left, but from the very previous save, which feels like even bigger waste of time - there is no way I am going to go through same thing I have passed already and got the good stuff and upgraded my character. It's just not fun at all and misses the purpose, because it's far from similar to replaying the game after death. It makes me not want to play it anymore because I don't know when save will work from the proper place and when it won't.\n\n3. Numerous glitches, including popping through doors, attacks that were impossible to hit they still do, I believe it's some sort of trying to give an advantage to silly AI which sucks terribly.\n\n4. Game performance is just plain awful. It has not been optimized for anything, and as far as the retro visual estetics go, clunkiness and non responsivness to keyboard is one more thing that CAN NOT BE ACCEPTED in game that has been out there for so long.\n\nI swear, don't buy it. It's more frustrating than anything you've met and after reading revious others left you can see these are not an uncommon problems. It will make you love the game, and few momens later you will hate it dearly and want your money back so you can get go get a burger instead of buggy, unplayble game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DejaBleu/recommended/98800/","DejaBleu","Wonderful Ruby Fruit Jungle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DejaBleu/","339 products in account","A rogue-like for newbies of the genre! Dungeons of Dredmor is a fantastic starting point for people who wish to play an often unforgiving and visually lacking genre. So let's start at price, Dredmor is dirt cheap. At £3.49 for the base game, it's a steal that will offer countless hours of adventuring fun, and this is helped by the fact that no dungeon is ever the same, thanks to procedurally generated dungeons! The story is the Evil Lord Dredmor is here to do bad things and you are a hero who has to kill monsters, pretty generic... However, the game is packed with humour, which is super pleasant and the game doesn't take it's self serious! Gameplay revolves around stat-checking, crafting, combat and cleverely disguised turn-based mechanics. The game is surprisingly tactical and you can often mess up if you don't think about your character's positioning! And that leads me to my final point: Permadeath and replayability! You can pick 7 base 'Perks' in character creation (which can be randomised). As you level up you can evolve these Perks. However, should your character get killed (and they will), you stay dead and start fresh! This is optional for the less hardcore rogue-like players. In conclusion I say if you like role-playing games you should give Dungeons of Dredmor a shot. It's fun, simple and hilarious.","March 14, 2013","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can turn permadeath on/off, and you can turn on "no time to grind" mode, which makes the levels physically smaller (so there's less loot), but the monsters give more xp per monster kill, so there's still the same amount of xp per dungeon level.\n\nI'd recommend playing a few times on permadeath mode, because your first couple characters are going to be terrible because you don't know what skills work well together.  Permadeath mode is also VERY intense.  Although I had fun playing with permadeath off in later characters, there's nothing like the thrill of getting out of a situation where you thought you were totally screwed in permadeath mode.\n\nOnce you've been killed by the final boss in permadeath mode (he WILL kill you the first time you fight him), by then you know what you're doing, and can turn permadeath off and build a good character to beat the game.","February 16, 2014","true","74.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It contains tons of classic elements -- the randomly designed levels, the urge to kill you approximately constantly, and difficult layouts -- and then lampoons as much as it can along the way. You'll get monsters yelling at you, incredibly useless-seeming items, abilities that may or may not help you at any point, and a hearty congratulations upon your eventual death.\n\nLuckily, for those of you not as adept with the concept of 'Permadeath' (think hardcore mode in ol' Diablo 2 -- die, and your character is gone permanently) the game does offer a mode on each difficulty level that removes the permadeath in lieu of saving when you need it. But, then again, I'm a purist.\n\nFor the genre faithful, this game offers plenty of challenge.

With a unique stats system and starting skills that can be combined in creative ways, Dungeons of Dredmor delivers a humorous, addictive, and highly replayable dungeon crawler. There are also plenty of items to discover, including potions and mushrooms that each bear different effects upon the user, as well as an array of weapons and armor with silly damage types and resistances (e.g. a ring that provides existential damage resistance to its user, or a dagger that deals asphyxiating and aethereal damage to its target).\n\nSometimes the best way to get into a roguelike is to dive in without any prior research, and at its price, Dungeons of Dredmor is a steal.","July 19, 2011","true","71.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

But the fundamental issue with for-profit rougelikes are two-fold: they are directly challenging some of the greatest games ever made, and two, all of their competition is free.\n\nI will put my cards on the table. I am a diehard Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup fan. I play it on my phone when I’m waiting in line. I squeeze a quick game in before bed most nights. The depth, years of production, and meticulous balance are difficult to find outside of the RL genre. And, it’s absolutely, positively, 100% free. So when the competitor’s game starts off costing infinitely more than nothing, it’s already at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is compounded by DoD’s other glaring flaw which is balance, or lack thereof. It is clear that the game was built, from concept to code to graphics, as a lark. Everything is a joke. All the references make it a blast to play. There are enough jokes that it even adds to replayability. But it also killed any shred of equality the game once had. Instead of picking a class and a race, as is standard with most RPGs, you pick seven skill trees which effect both passive stats and activated abilities, and go on your merry way. But pick the wrong trees, or wrong combination of trees, and you will find progression past a certain point impossible. For example, I would love to use the pole arm class. But the scarcity of the weapon itself, along with the subpar nature of the skill tree, makes it useless when compared to the sword or mace or even unarmed skills. About a fifth of the skill trees involve crafting, which in all cases is satisfactorily powerful, but turns the game from a fast paced dungeon romp into a painfully accurate hoarding simulation. Jokes about polishing your wand are great, I just wish the wand crafting skill was as much fun to use as it was to read about.\n\nBut in light of all this. In spite of the cost, regardless of the glaring flaws in the mechanics, I have still spent time playing this game, and avidly suggest it to friends who aren’t ready for a full on ASCII rougelike experience. It’s a fantastic gateway to a genre otherwise regarded as impenetrable. My issues arise from playing games like it for years, but for someone who doesn’t enjoy their eyes bleeding, a few extra dollars and inept skill trees will not sullen the experience. The controls are straight forward and predictable. And the experience is still that of a rouge like. All the frustration and theory crafting in a nice, accessible package. You will love this game. You will hate this game. But most importantly, you will play this game. You won’t spend all your time in menus figuring out how to quaff a potion, or figuring out what a certain object is. You will spend your time dying, and that’s what rougelikes are all about.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a new experience, and have no idea what a NetHack is or think Dwarf Fortress is a chapter out of Lord of the Rings, there is no better place to start than with Dungeons of Dredmor. If, like me, you have past experience with the genre, you may find the depth a bit lacking.

I can't remember what I spent it on, but I know that I had a few dollars left and wanted to get rid of my credit. So, I see that there's this game called "Dungeons of Dredmor" on sale for about what I have left. "Hm, this game looks fun." I think to myself. "Kind of simple, maybe, but I could get my money's worth in less than an afternoon. Why not!" And so I purchased Dungeons of Dredmor.\n\nThe fact that I remember buying Dungeons of Dredmor and not the rest of my gift card's value should speak to what I think of this game.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is NOT a "simple" game. There is a vast amount of depth here, particularly when it comes to crafting. I've hardly scratched the surface of what Dungeons of Dredmor has to offer, and I can say that it's one of the best roguelike RPGs availavle today. The gameplay is far from revolutionary, but is also very effective. The graphics are charming, and the writing is at times hilarious. Additionally - for a "roguelike", it's surprisingly approachable. The inclusion of permadeath toggle and multiple difficulty settings allows Dungeons of Dredmor to function as a truly hardcore roguelike, or as a more forgiving dungeon crawler.\n\nI do suggest buying the expansions for this game, if you do choose to buy it. Some of the skills and features included serve to even out the experience in some much-needed ways. On that note, Dredmor certainly isn't perfect. Choosing skills always feels like a lottery, with almost no description of what they actually do. The game itself can be equally cryptic, and expect to alt-tab to your internet browser of choice more than once during your stay in the Dungeon. Of course, the game IS a roguelike, so saying that it's "difficult" or "cryptic" isn't really a detriment, but rather something to keep in mind if you have no experience with RPGs like this. However, I stand by my point that Dungeons of Dredmor serves as an appropriate "entry-roguelike", with the potential to scale alongside the player's ability.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor, for being equal parts deep and approachable, having solid gameplay and graphics, clever writing, and minimal complaints, gets six out of seven stars.","November 25, 2013","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But don't stop there! Once you've died a horrible death or five, (heh, don't worry, it'll likely be a quick demise!) you'll start to get the hang of it, and be able to delve deeper into Dredmor's residence; killing off his foul minions and living vegetables with ease.\n\nThere is also a lot of humour and references to be had in this game too, which is certainly one of its strong suits; whether it's finding a Holy Hand Grenade from Quest for the Holy Grail, or having the option to purchase incredibly expensive (and pointless!) horse armour from Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Another one of the pros of DoD is that it's a completely new experience every time you play it, as the floor layouts differ between playthroughs, as do the items you find.\n\nSo yeah, at the price it's at, I'd definitely recommend buying it if you're interested in a very challenging and rewarding experience, provided you're prepared to potentially suffer for an hour or two, before you get the hang of it.\n\n\nSkål!","March 8, 2013","true","71.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Allowing it to be sold for a measly $5 is simply villainous, my friends. Don't let my Steam playtime deceive you, this game gave me many hours of enjoyment while unable to connect to the mmo's I typically play due to no internet. In times of such darkness, I turn to Dungeons of Dredmor. Below I will explain this game's pure awesomeness.\n\nPros\n+ Large amount of skills, each varying, humorous and genuinely useful. You choose seven skills to use at the start of the game, then choose which you invest in which essentially allows you to create your own class with its own skill-trees\n+ Fitting artstyle and music\n+ Hilarious, un-matched humor that is always refreshing and never (seriously), never gets old. SKOL! LUTEFISK FOR THE LUTEFISK GOD!! Also that noise the diggle makes when it comes up out of the ground. Sort of a "doodoodaDUUU!" that's so damn cute :3\n+ Randomly generated dungeon every time with just enough pre-made rooms and events to keep things interesting\n+ ^ that and the numerous skills give this game an absurd amount of replay value that goes well beyond an investment of\n5 bucks\n+Very moddable, with tons of great mods already available on the workshop\n\nCons\n- I don't know, you're part of the Diggle Rights Movement? No real cons, honestly, and for 5 bucks who cares\n\nNow that we've got that out of the way, let's talk expansions. Each of the expansions add more skills, all of which are hilarious, not to mention some of the funnest in the game (Communism skill seriously rocks) and are both totally worth 3 bucks if you dig the game as much as I do. Also, free expansion? Say what!? (I named mine March of the Diggles, by the way)\nIn all, if you like roguelikes, buy this game. Actually, if you like games in general just buy it. It's five bucks and I've probably got more enjoyment out of this little indie title than I did in Skyrim.\n\nTL;DR VERSION: Infinite hours of fun for five dollars. 10/10 Krong Anvils.","February 7, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/don_leno/recommended/98800/","don_leno","ImmortalBard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/don_leno/","245 products in account","Some time ago, I was given a Steam gift card. I can't remember what I spent it on, but I know that I had a few dollars left and wanted to get rid of my credit. So, I see that there's this game called "Dungeons of Dredmor" on sale for about what I have left. "Hm, this game looks fun." I think to myself. "Kind of simple, maybe, but I could get my money's worth in less than an afternoon. Why not!" And so I purchased Dungeons of Dredmor.\n\nThe fact that I remember buying Dungeons of Dredmor and not the rest of my gift card's value should speak to what I think of this game.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is NOT a "simple" game. There is a vast amount of depth here, particularly when it comes to crafting. I've hardly scratched the surface of what Dungeons of Dredmor has to offer, and I can say that it's one of the best roguelike RPGs availavle today. The gameplay is far from revolutionary, but is also very effective. The graphics are charming, and the writing is at times hilarious. Additionally - for a "roguelike", it's surprisingly approachable. The inclusion of permadeath toggle and multiple difficulty settings allows Dungeons of Dredmor to function as a truly hardcore roguelike, or as a more forgiving dungeon crawler.\n\nI do suggest buying the expansions for this game, if you do choose to buy it. Some of the skills and features included serve to even out the experience in some much-needed ways. On that note, Dredmor certainly isn't perfect. Choosing skills always feels like a lottery, with almost no description of what they actually do. The game itself can be equally cryptic, and expect to alt-tab to your internet browser of choice more than once during your stay in the Dungeon. Of course, the game IS a roguelike, so saying that it's "difficult" or "cryptic" isn't really a detriment, but rather something to keep in mind if you have no experience with RPGs like this. However, I stand by my point that Dungeons of Dredmor serves as an appropriate "entry-roguelike", with the potential to scale alongside the player's ability.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor, for being equal parts deep and approachable, having solid gameplay and graphics, clever writing, and minimal complaints, gets six out of seven stars.","November 25, 2013","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loki278/recommended/98800/","loki278","Thoth The Timeless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loki278/","298 products in account","Gaslamp Game’s first production, Dungeons of Dredmor, has accumulated quiet a cult following since its release two years ago, combining the unpredictability of rougelikes with the slick, mobile ready interface younger gamers have come to expect. But the fundamental issue with for-profit rougelikes are two-fold: they are directly challenging some of the greatest games ever made, and two, all of their competition is free.\n\nI will put my cards on the table. I am a diehard Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup fan. I play it on my phone when I’m waiting in line. I squeeze a quick game in before bed most nights. The depth, years of production, and meticulous balance are difficult to find outside of the RL genre. And, it’s absolutely, positively, 100% free. So when the competitor’s game starts off costing infinitely more than nothing, it’s already at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is compounded by DoD’s other glaring flaw which is balance, or lack thereof. It is clear that the game was built, from concept to code to graphics, as a lark. Everything is a joke. All the references make it a blast to play. There are enough jokes that it even adds to replayability. But it also killed any shred of equality the game once had. Instead of picking a class and a race, as is standard with most RPGs, you pick seven skill trees which effect both passive stats and activated abilities, and go on your merry way. But pick the wrong trees, or wrong combination of trees, and you will find progression past a certain point impossible. For example, I would love to use the pole arm class. But the scarcity of the weapon itself, along with the subpar nature of the skill tree, makes it useless when compared to the sword or mace or even unarmed skills. About a fifth of the skill trees involve crafting, which in all cases is satisfactorily powerful, but turns the game from a fast paced dungeon romp into a painfully accurate hoarding simulation. Jokes about polishing your wand are great, I just wish the wand crafting skill was as much fun to use as it was to read about.\n\nBut in light of all this. In spite of the cost, regardless of the glaring flaws in the mechanics, I have still spent time playing this game, and avidly suggest it to friends who aren’t ready for a full on ASCII rougelike experience. It’s a fantastic gateway to a genre otherwise regarded as impenetrable. My issues arise from playing games like it for years, but for someone who doesn’t enjoy their eyes bleeding, a few extra dollars and inept skill trees will not sullen the experience. The controls are straight forward and predictable. And the experience is still that of a rouge like. All the frustration and theory crafting in a nice, accessible package. You will love this game. You will hate this game. But most importantly, you will play this game. You won’t spend all your time in menus figuring out how to quaff a potion, or figuring out what a certain object is. You will spend your time dying, and that’s what rougelikes are all about.\n\nSo if you’re looking for a new experience, and have no idea what a NetHack is or think Dwarf Fortress is a chapter out of Lord of the Rings, there is no better place to start than with Dungeons of Dredmor. If, like me, you have past experience with the genre, you may find the depth a bit lacking. But overall, I applaud the developers efforts to make a deserving medium accessible.\n","March 3, 2014","true","114.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many of them are reskinned with a different color and the stats vary based on luck rolls.  Still, in terms of replayability, the game is solid.  You get to choose a set of any skills you wish from a pool and use them to run through dungeon levels.  This means you can play over and over and have a different experience each time (while the skills don't combo, they will supplement each other better others).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DejaBleu/recommended/98800/","DejaBleu","Wonderful Ruby Fruit Jungle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DejaBleu/","339 products in account","A rogue-like for newbies of the genre! Dungeons of Dredmor is a fantastic starting point for people who wish to play an often unforgiving and visually lacking genre. So let's start at price, Dredmor is dirt cheap. At £3.49 for the base game, it's a steal that will offer countless hours of adventuring fun, and this is helped by the fact that no dungeon is ever the same, thanks to procedurally generated dungeons! The story is the Evil Lord Dredmor is here to do bad things and you are a hero who has to kill monsters, pretty generic... However, the game is packed with humour, which is super pleasant and the game doesn't take it's self serious! Gameplay revolves around stat-checking, crafting, combat and cleverely disguised turn-based mechanics. The game is surprisingly tactical and you can often mess up if you don't think about your character's positioning! And that leads me to my final point: Permadeath and replayability! You can pick 7 base 'Perks' in character creation (which can be randomised). As you level up you can evolve these Perks. However, should your character get killed (and they will), you stay dead and start fresh! This is optional for the less hardcore rogue-like players. In conclusion I say if you like role-playing games you should give Dungeons of Dredmor a shot. It's fun, simple and hilarious.","March 14, 2013","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has incredibly fluid gameplay, which is both challenging and addictive. The combat is a little like Skyrim, in that you can get out of it exactly what you want. I'm generally kind of cheap, but there is no question about this game being worth its asking price. My suggestion is that you get the DLCs as well. They're cheap and they add a ton of content to an already fantastic game. Plus, you get the full range of mods from this game's wonderful community.\n\nIf I had to pick a gripe, however, it would be an aesthetic one. I don't love the way the game looks, though it is serviceable. The main character's eyebrows are almost distractingly large. Aside from that, none of the equipment that you pick up or craft shows up your character. This is a little irritating, as it doesn't necessarily give you the sense of progression that one might want out of a game like this. Regardless, however, this game is fantastic.

I found it frustrating that I couldn't min-max *everything* because some crafting recipes are pretty much always not available to you. I liked the skill system and that you can choose several rather than just rolling up one of seven different classes or whatever, and some of the descriptions were entertaining, but ultimately my problem with roguelikes is that they often end up as the video game equivalent of road hypnosis -- you spend hours and hours playing them and then you slip up once and you're toast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobthespacecadet/recommended/98800/","bobthespacecadet",""Bob" the Space Cadet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobthespacecadet/","699 products in account","I feel like now that I'm at around 250 hours of gameplay (not including my time spent playing it offline on my laptop on the train) this review is in need of a rewrite. Here goes...\n\nDredmor is both infinitely awesome and infinitely cruel. So many things make it a great game, and there are so many ways that it will make you royally p'd off.\n\nGameplay\nBasically Dredmor is a turn-based procedurally generated dungeon crawler (with the option for permadeath) in which you clear out a dungeon level by level until you hit the bottom and kill Lord Dredmor - a pretty simple premise and no back-story to speak of; but that's okay, this game is all about the gameplay, and the loot (oh so much loot).\n\nLoot, Gear, and Crafting\nI find, annoyingly, that this game punishes me for my compulsive hoarding of craftables because you will never be able to carry it all - but it will allow you to leave massive piles of loot lying about the place without ever taking them away from you, thus enticing you to ferry about every item you think you might possibly have a use for later... if you're into punishing yourself. Thankfully the game will let you speed up and slow down the animation rate by using the plus and minus keys (+/-) so you can make these little ferry trips less of a chore if you feel so inclined.\nThe craft system itself is pretty good. You get a base set of recipes and can find more stashed in bookcases scattered throughout the dungeon. You need to improve your skills to get better at crafting to make the higher level gear, however you'll often find that the best items are found throughout the dungeon rather than by crafting them. To balance this the game has an encrust system in which you can add extra elements to your basic items such as more damage to weapons or various resistances to armours (just be prepared for more compulsive hoarding to achieve the best results).\nThere are a number of shops randomly scattered throughout the dungeon, however they rarely provide the gear you really want and serve more as a place to sell your piles of unwanted loot just in case a shop later on has something you might want. At least it's nice to have piles and piles of gold coins.\n\nDying\nThe permadeath feature is very much welcome as stepping into a Monster Zoo (a special room absolutely packed with monsters) can be a daunting and exciting prospect when it could be the undoing of all your hard work; but don't worry, if that kind of thing annoys you, you can just turn permadeath off in the setup phase. When you do die, you will almost never feel tricked or like it was the outcome of bad game design; it is almost always because you did something stupid or weren't paying proper attention to where you were walking or to your health bar.\n\nSkills\nThere are many skills you can specialise in and some of them are pretty weird - yep, you still have all the standard kind of skills like swordplay and archery, but Dredmor also includes some unique skills such as mathemagician, tourist, and communist. The best thing is that, regardless of what seven skills you pick, you are not locked into using certain types of equipment. If you find it, you can use it regardless of class or level. This means you can just play the character any way you want to, and this flexibility equates to fun. Loads of fun.\n\nThat Old-School Game Feel\nDredmor includes lots of references to other games and popular culture which are reminiscent of older games that didn't have to be so serious, and this really gives the game the extra shot of charm it needs to help you look past its flaws.\n\nGraphics\nDredmor isn't 3D-rendered, it's illustrated, so you don't have to worry about graphic scaling, but none of your gear will appear on your player model aside from the type of weapon you swing when you actually perform your attack. This is a little disappointing at first, but Dredmor is so elegant in its design that this really doesn't matter; besides you still get to look at the illustrations of your gear in your inventory and character windows, which is enough.\n\nSound and Music\nThe sound effects are good and the music somehow never manages to wear thin. I imagine in years to come the soundtrack to Dredmor will inspire instant nostalgia in me, and when a game has that ability you know something is going right.\n\nAchievements\nI'm currently working my way through the long list of Dredmor achievements, and it's driving me INSANE. I initially thought "oh yeah sure, these all seem reasonably obtainable..." WRONG. 250 hours I've been at it and still not there. One achievement refers to a skill that is no longer in the game and requires you to do some pretty fiddly changing of config files, and another one just has no way of progressing the counter whatsoever (to my knowledge, but I will persist!). Once, all my achievement counters for partially completed achievements reset for no reason, leaving me to start over on my progress in them. I should also mention that you should probably be worried when a game has an achievement for having the game crash while you're playing it because it implies instability, but if you happen to have Dredmor running stably, you're going to have to figure out a way to force it to crash. Going for all of the Dredmor achievements has been an epic sage for me, and while lots of fun, it has also been very frustrating at times.\n\nThe Verdict\nDredmor has its flaws, but it is so special that I think of it with the same type of regard that I have for a member of my family. Dredmor is a part of me, and I'm pretty sure its whispers "please don't quit" when I try exit... I'm almost certain that's not just in my head. 9 out of 10, would grind (and there's a lot of grinding to be done, but it's a good kind of grind).","November 13, 2013","true","247.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

By that, I mean that your actions count as turns. You don't go into a battle mode, the entire game works on turns. If you take a step, pick up an item, use an item, use a spell, use an attack, defend... all of these things count as a turn. So whenever you do something, every enemy gets to as well. This is also used in coodowns on abilities and regeneration of health and magic. Insead of waiting on a timer, you do actions to keep the game moving. It's great for pacing. Before you even start playing, you have some options you can set, and then you get to pick from a number of different abilities. So you're not restricted to a class, as in some other games like this. Instead, you just pick whatever abilities you want, which is fun for customization and replayability. As you level up, you can chose to level up those abilities as you see fit, but only one per level. The gameplay, aside from the turn system, is pretty standard. You walk around a huge dungeon, fighting enemies and looting the place. You can also craft a great number of things along the way, provided you have the materials, the tool used to craft it, and enough points in the required skill to make the item. This is where I start to have some issues.\n\nSee, you can pick your own skills. You can also level your own skills as you please. But sometimes you'll pick skills that don't cover the areas you need in order to make certain items. If you don't have that to level up, you simply cannot make those types of items. That can be annoying. It can also be annoying to have all the materials, the skills, and not the tool required to make the item. Although that can be remedied by finding one somewhere in the dungeon. My biggest complaint is that the inventory you have is a tad small. It makes you have to manage your items well, constantly craft items to use up materials (but that's not always so easy to do), or constantly backtrack to the shops to sell things. I guess you could leave stuff laying around but then it'd go to waste. Having a few more slots would help a lot. I guess it comes with the territory of looting. And with the skill complain, I suppose you just have to plan ahead and know what you can and can't do, which in turn will help you identify which items you do and do not need. Some of the skills in the begining don't explain what they do, choosing to have a joke description instead. This can be annoying to deal with and try to remember what they actually do later. Some of the drinkable and edible items you get aren't specific about what they do either. You might drink something or eat something that puts a debuff on you, hurts you, or even kills you! And the game is littered with traps. Some you can see, some you can't. Sometimes you can go around them, sometimes you need to walk over them to get to another spot. Sometimes you can disable them, sometimes that'll fail and they'll go off anyways. Imagine hitting a random trap that you couldn't even see, only to have THAT be the end of all your hard work. With permadeath on (as the default), it's quite maddening.\n\nStill, this game is massive and... very difficult. I've sunk almost 20 hours into it as of right now and and never made it past the second floor. Am I bad? Maybe. But it's pretty easy to die from random stuff. I may have misread this but I think there's something like ten floors normally and fifteen with the expansions. So there's tons of stuff to do in this game. There's even tons of things I haven't even figured out yet! It's an amazing amount of content and playtime for what only costs you 5 bucks. Heck, toss in the extra buck for the DLC and get even more out of it like I did. It's very well worth the price tag and I'm really surprised it isn't going for more than that. It could definitely be a 10 or even 15 dollar game.\n\nDungeons of Dreadmor gets an 8/10 for being an immense dungeon crawler with an interesting take at a great price.","January 8, 2015","true","18.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Charming visuals and old-school, catchy music seal the deal.\n\nI once died trying to kick a locked door down.  No, I wasn't actively going for the achievement.

Dungeons uses an excellent skill selection, character customization (not appearance), and many random elements to provide for a hundred different ways to play.  You can become a warrior with high damage and defense, a rogue with high counter-chance and dodging, or a mage with magical abilities.  Actually, if you wanted, you could become a combination of any of them, or even all three.  And the loot is plain awesome.  I normally pick up everything - be it an aged-steak or a magical robe - and take them to the wizard's pocket dimension to be sorted.  It's kind of a organized mess, with piles all along the walls and floor.  There are piles of mushrooms, gems, food, armor to be used in smithing/tinkering, tinkering parts, ingots for smithing, and stuff waiting to be sold.  And anything that isn't worth selling or keeping gets turned into lutifisk.  Yep, lutifisk.  You might be asking yourself "Why I would be turning random junk into lutifisk?", and if not, you might be asking youself "What the heck is a lutifisk?" but all well be explained in due time.  Furthermore, you lutifisk haters, it is not rotten fish but just fish that.....well it kind of is rotten fish but it tastes good with butter.  So there.  Anyways, I would highly recommend Dungeons of Dredmor to just about anyone who likes games with random elements.

(Like, really minor, but spoilers nonetheless.)\n\nThis game is a unique combination of simple, easy, difficult, relaxing, laid-back, humorous, and just general old-fashioned fun. Holy crap it's fun. Basically you crawl your way through levels of the dungeon to get to the main bad-guy, accumulating a number of unique and silly items, skills, and badassery. Levelling up always feels good, and gaining a skill almost always has a noticeable affect on your combat.\n\nFair warning, you will die a lot. And if you're like me and love pain, you'll play on perma-death (which is optional). On about my fifth character, I was really getting into the swing of things. I had tons of items. I had a pocket dimension I could go to to dump unwanted detritus that might be useful in the future, and I'd just made it through the second floor (still haven't seen the third; the floors are fairly big and ooze with content and monsters). I was fairly powerful at this point, at least for the floor I was on, and easily laid waste to waves of monsters with the help of my zombies and clouds of poison that I conjured. So, feeling like a badass, I hopped over to my pocket dimension to drop off some loot, when I noticed that from said dimension I could also leap to other dimensions! "Okay, cool," so I did. Plowed through one small dimension, no sweat. So I go to another, run into two monsters, kill myself with my own poison cloud. It was my fault for not paying attention, but alllll the hard work, the several hours I'd put into his skills, levels, items. Gone!\n\nAt that point I said to myself, "Okay, this is probably the point where going back to the first dungeon just becomes a tedious grind, and I won't want to play anymore." Well tonight I felt like trying again, trying some new skills. Frankly, it's no less fun than when I played for the first time. The floors are all randomly generated, so it's never the same run between characters.\n\nMy current character has kicks that literally explode into fire, tearing through enemies like nothing, and I'm only on the first floor.\n\nIt's not just the content, it's the little quirks. You can tell the developers had a blast making this game. Everything shines with creativity and humour, and it's just a lovely little game gah I love it.\n\n10/10, recommended a thousand times yes.

While the graphics are simple, as is the gameplay, a simple interface masks a surprisingly deep customization and talent system. The synergy between different skills will have you experimenting with builds for DAYS. The addition and seamless integration of Steam Workshop was nothing short of brilliant, and when you feel like you've seen everything in Dungeons of Dredmor, provides HOURS of extra enjoyment.\n\nGood: Solid gameplay, fun visual aesthetic, good music. Deep and complex customization presented in a brilliantly accesible way.\n\nBad: Some skills are just too good. Whenever there's a skill that me and ALL my friends separately came to the conclusion that it MUST be in your build, things need a little tinkering.\n\nUgly: Not much.\n\nPossibly the worst thing I can say about DoD is that the era of the traditional rogue formula is definitely showing its age. The procedure of "I move, then all enemies move, then I move" is showing its age as a design process. Dungeons of Dredmor could be that last, best look at a wonderful genre, and I enjoyed the hell out of it, but I think it will be the last true rogue I play.

You will not be hurting for things to see and do in Dungeons of Dredmor also, if anyone has gotten 100% on it you are truly one of a kind. Next you are greeted with picking skills, you can choose up to 7 skills from a list of 50 different skills, all offering unique abilities and play styles, and once you've chosen between such skills as Emomancy, Killer Vegan and Bankster you choose male or female and enter the dungeons!\n\nThe story behind this game is that the evil lich Dredmor was imprisoned beneath the world for being a meanie but, has slowly eroded away his bonds and you are asked to enter into his prison (or dungeon) and stop him!...again! Its dirt simple but, hey it works well and the dungeons are no joke.\n\nThe game is grid based and combat is turned based, you can click or use the keyboard to move, upon entering combat you trade shots with your foe, (or take turns), the challenge of Dredmor is in how you build your character and, a little bit of luck with finding powerful items and shrines but, mostly in how you build your character. Although there are many skills to pick from some are better suited for dungeoneering than others, some only work better with other skills and there are some that are must haves, make no mistake there are ideal builds for this game.\n\nItems come in to play a little bit, especially food and healing items but, the crafting system in Dredmor is deep, there is a lot to craft and I haven't personally seen it but, what I have seen is almost every item in the game being craft-able. There are also skills associated with crafting, so you can build your character around any of the crafts if you so choose (such as being a clockwork, steam-punk knight) and, crafting things is as simple as having the crafting kit and using it with the correct items and there are a TON of items to craft.\n\nThe graphics are also nice with this mix of hand painted/ comic look style, the game also runs as smooth as butter and, looks so simple you should be able to run it on just about anything so it's a great game for laptops. My only complaint about the graphics is more of a personal desire, the game shows you all these really neat hand-drawn items that look totally badass however, it never shows on your character; your character always will have the same frilly Guybrush Threepwood outfit regardless of the badass armor and traffic cone you have equipped, that kind of detail would have been greatly appreciated.\n\nMusic in the game is excellent, with lots of organ, piano and strings, giving a sort of melancholy tune alongside some quirky upbeat tunes. The tracks tend to repeat if you linger on a floor too long so that may be a downside depending on how much you like it and, the music is what you'll listen to the majority of the games (in fact it often overpowers the other sounds of the game) so it’s a good thing it’s an awesome soundtrack.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor is funny and challenging, a great game to play anywhere and caters to a lot of playstyles, it’s a solid experience and gives you a huge amount of content to enjoy for a cheap price of $4.99 USD. For $6.99 USD you can get the complete set which I honestly suggest because it’s a great deal for the amount of added content you get even if you don’t end up seeing all of it. If you want a challenge, or a never ending rogue-like game, enter the Dungeons of Dredmor!\n\nTL/DR; Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with a HUGE amount of content for $4.99 USD, it’s got humor, charm and challenge, with plenty to do and replay ability to the Nth degree. It’s really cheap for what you get, Gaslamp Games certainly is giving you bang for your buck, honestly, if you don’t own the game, consider getting the full package for $6.99 USD, it’s just a few extra bucks and well worth it, plus the DLC by itself is $5.98 USD on its own so don’t waste your money unnecessarily! Check it out and support these guys so we can get more greatness in the future!\n\n-Double Thumbs up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews: youtube.com/RoyialNetwork","March 4, 2015","true","30.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A big fan of Gaslamp and their crew - I'm stoked to have been part of a lot of beta testing for the content of this game and even to where an achievement that I suggested on the forums has been added in! :D\n\nNow. This game sets up the limits of...weird. And the DLC has only improved it. The crafting system is large and well varied, the Wizard Keys and finding graffitti scrawled on the walls with codes to new levels, all the loot you can shake a stick at, in-game vending machines selling you everything from baseballs to ground meat and nukes and Root Of T'char.\n\nThe greatest thing about this game is how varied the outcomes can be. You have the choices of 6 different talent trees out of 15+ ones and none are "right" OR "wrong." The game gives you the freedom to play as you please and the Save-Exit function is a godsend when you start delving and you feel tired. Levelling up and playing is turn based and the enemies move as you move.\n\nOverall: I have so much fun with this game that I've yet to finish ONE game. 70+ hours on and offline with this game and every time there's that itch to re-roll a character and try a new combination JUST BECAUSE the skill trees augment and vary your gameplay so much!\n\nGOOD:\n-Fair play RPG.\n-Lots of contents, weapons, combinations, skill trees, items.\n-So MANY bad/good puns and references to other bits of culture.\n-Game never really feels 'unfair' or 'hard' as some other roguelikes.

While the graphics are simple, as is the gameplay, a simple interface masks a surprisingly deep customization and talent system. The synergy between different skills will have you experimenting with builds for DAYS. The addition and seamless integration of Steam Workshop was nothing short of brilliant, and when you feel like you've seen everything in Dungeons of Dredmor, provides HOURS of extra enjoyment.\n\nGood: Solid gameplay, fun visual aesthetic, good music. Deep and complex customization presented in a brilliantly accesible way.\n\nBad: Some skills are just too good. Whenever there's a skill that me and ALL my friends separately came to the conclusion that it MUST be in your build, things need a little tinkering.\n\nUgly: Not much.\n\nPossibly the worst thing I can say about DoD is that the era of the traditional rogue formula is definitely showing its age. The procedure of "I move, then all enemies move, then I move" is showing its age as a design process. Dungeons of Dredmor could be that last, best look at a wonderful genre, and I enjoyed the hell out of it, but I think it will be the last true rogue I play.

You will not be hurting for things to see and do in Dungeons of Dredmor also, if anyone has gotten 100% on it you are truly one of a kind. Next you are greeted with picking skills, you can choose up to 7 skills from a list of 50 different skills, all offering unique abilities and play styles, and once you've chosen between such skills as Emomancy, Killer Vegan and Bankster you choose male or female and enter the dungeons!\n\nThe story behind this game is that the evil lich Dredmor was imprisoned beneath the world for being a meanie but, has slowly eroded away his bonds and you are asked to enter into his prison (or dungeon) and stop him!...again! Its dirt simple but, hey it works well and the dungeons are no joke.\n\nThe game is grid based and combat is turned based, you can click or use the keyboard to move, upon entering combat you trade shots with your foe, (or take turns), the challenge of Dredmor is in how you build your character and, a little bit of luck with finding powerful items and shrines but, mostly in how you build your character. Although there are many skills to pick from some are better suited for dungeoneering than others, some only work better with other skills and there are some that are must haves, make no mistake there are ideal builds for this game.\n\nItems come in to play a little bit, especially food and healing items but, the crafting system in Dredmor is deep, there is a lot to craft and I haven't personally seen it but, what I have seen is almost every item in the game being craft-able. There are also skills associated with crafting, so you can build your character around any of the crafts if you so choose (such as being a clockwork, steam-punk knight) and, crafting things is as simple as having the crafting kit and using it with the correct items and there are a TON of items to craft.\n\nThe graphics are also nice with this mix of hand painted/ comic look style, the game also runs as smooth as butter and, looks so simple you should be able to run it on just about anything so it's a great game for laptops. My only complaint about the graphics is more of a personal desire, the game shows you all these really neat hand-drawn items that look totally badass however, it never shows on your character; your character always will have the same frilly Guybrush Threepwood outfit regardless of the badass armor and traffic cone you have equipped, that kind of detail would have been greatly appreciated.\n\nMusic in the game is excellent, with lots of organ, piano and strings, giving a sort of melancholy tune alongside some quirky upbeat tunes. The tracks tend to repeat if you linger on a floor too long so that may be a downside depending on how much you like it and, the music is what you'll listen to the majority of the games (in fact it often overpowers the other sounds of the game) so it’s a good thing it’s an awesome soundtrack.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor is funny and challenging, a great game to play anywhere and caters to a lot of playstyles, it’s a solid experience and gives you a huge amount of content to enjoy for a cheap price of $4.99 USD. For $6.99 USD you can get the complete set which I honestly suggest because it’s a great deal for the amount of added content you get even if you don’t end up seeing all of it. If you want a challenge, or a never ending rogue-like game, enter the Dungeons of Dredmor!\n\nTL/DR; Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with a HUGE amount of content for $4.99 USD, it’s got humor, charm and challenge, with plenty to do and replay ability to the Nth degree. It’s really cheap for what you get, Gaslamp Games certainly is giving you bang for your buck, honestly, if you don’t own the game, consider getting the full package for $6.99 USD, it’s just a few extra bucks and well worth it, plus the DLC by itself is $5.98 USD on its own so don’t waste your money unnecessarily! Check it out and support these guys so we can get more greatness in the future!\n\n-Double Thumbs up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews: youtube.com/RoyialNetwork","March 4, 2015","true","30.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A big fan of Gaslamp and their crew - I'm stoked to have been part of a lot of beta testing for the content of this game and even to where an achievement that I suggested on the forums has been added in! :D\n\nNow. This game sets up the limits of...weird. And the DLC has only improved it. The crafting system is large and well varied, the Wizard Keys and finding graffitti scrawled on the walls with codes to new levels, all the loot you can shake a stick at, in-game vending machines selling you everything from baseballs to ground meat and nukes and Root Of T'char.\n\nThe greatest thing about this game is how varied the outcomes can be. You have the choices of 6 different talent trees out of 15+ ones and none are "right" OR "wrong." The game gives you the freedom to play as you please and the Save-Exit function is a godsend when you start delving and you feel tired. Levelling up and playing is turn based and the enemies move as you move.\n\nOverall: I have so much fun with this game that I've yet to finish ONE game. 70+ hours on and offline with this game and every time there's that itch to re-roll a character and try a new combination JUST BECAUSE the skill trees augment and vary your gameplay so much!\n\nGOOD:\n-Fair play RPG.\n-Lots of contents, weapons, combinations, skill trees, items.\n-So MANY bad/good puns and references to other bits of culture.\n-Game never really feels 'unfair' or 'hard' as some other roguelikes.

Flushing away a couple hours/days work because you got teleported over a body of water and can't swim is enough to make you cry.\n-Butcher Rooms. Nuff said.\n-The stability of the game is still questionable at times and prone to some far-spaced but non-lethal bugs. It's a lot to deal with but the game is still stable.\n\nPLEASE NOTE that this game is NO LONGER BEING WORKED ON. This is a CLOSED project. Gaslamp has given up nearly all the resources to create the game back to the community to continue making content and debugging and in general have been very, very good to their players.\n\nFrom allowing us to name the expansions, to adding our own achievements, to allowing bug reports in beta they have done so much for this game and honestly...it's a project made with a lot of love.\n\nI may be selling you this game wistfully but I guarantee anyone who buys and plays this wonderful project WILL enjoy themselves immensely.

While the graphics are simple, as is the gameplay, a simple interface masks a surprisingly deep customization and talent system. The synergy between different skills will have you experimenting with builds for DAYS. The addition and seamless integration of Steam Workshop was nothing short of brilliant, and when you feel like you've seen everything in Dungeons of Dredmor, provides HOURS of extra enjoyment.\n\nGood: Solid gameplay, fun visual aesthetic, good music. Deep and complex customization presented in a brilliantly accesible way.\n\nBad: Some skills are just too good. Whenever there's a skill that me and ALL my friends separately came to the conclusion that it MUST be in your build, things need a little tinkering.\n\nUgly: Not much.\n\nPossibly the worst thing I can say about DoD is that the era of the traditional rogue formula is definitely showing its age. The procedure of "I move, then all enemies move, then I move" is showing its age as a design process. Dungeons of Dredmor could be that last, best look at a wonderful genre, and I enjoyed the hell out of it, but I think it will be the last true rogue I play.

You will not be hurting for things to see and do in Dungeons of Dredmor also, if anyone has gotten 100% on it you are truly one of a kind. Next you are greeted with picking skills, you can choose up to 7 skills from a list of 50 different skills, all offering unique abilities and play styles, and once you've chosen between such skills as Emomancy, Killer Vegan and Bankster you choose male or female and enter the dungeons!\n\nThe story behind this game is that the evil lich Dredmor was imprisoned beneath the world for being a meanie but, has slowly eroded away his bonds and you are asked to enter into his prison (or dungeon) and stop him!...again! Its dirt simple but, hey it works well and the dungeons are no joke.\n\nThe game is grid based and combat is turned based, you can click or use the keyboard to move, upon entering combat you trade shots with your foe, (or take turns), the challenge of Dredmor is in how you build your character and, a little bit of luck with finding powerful items and shrines but, mostly in how you build your character. Although there are many skills to pick from some are better suited for dungeoneering than others, some only work better with other skills and there are some that are must haves, make no mistake there are ideal builds for this game.\n\nItems come in to play a little bit, especially food and healing items but, the crafting system in Dredmor is deep, there is a lot to craft and I haven't personally seen it but, what I have seen is almost every item in the game being craft-able. There are also skills associated with crafting, so you can build your character around any of the crafts if you so choose (such as being a clockwork, steam-punk knight) and, crafting things is as simple as having the crafting kit and using it with the correct items and there are a TON of items to craft.\n\nThe graphics are also nice with this mix of hand painted/ comic look style, the game also runs as smooth as butter and, looks so simple you should be able to run it on just about anything so it's a great game for laptops. My only complaint about the graphics is more of a personal desire, the game shows you all these really neat hand-drawn items that look totally badass however, it never shows on your character; your character always will have the same frilly Guybrush Threepwood outfit regardless of the badass armor and traffic cone you have equipped, that kind of detail would have been greatly appreciated.\n\nMusic in the game is excellent, with lots of organ, piano and strings, giving a sort of melancholy tune alongside some quirky upbeat tunes. The tracks tend to repeat if you linger on a floor too long so that may be a downside depending on how much you like it and, the music is what you'll listen to the majority of the games (in fact it often overpowers the other sounds of the game) so it’s a good thing it’s an awesome soundtrack.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor is funny and challenging, a great game to play anywhere and caters to a lot of playstyles, it’s a solid experience and gives you a huge amount of content to enjoy for a cheap price of $4.99 USD. For $6.99 USD you can get the complete set which I honestly suggest because it’s a great deal for the amount of added content you get even if you don’t end up seeing all of it. If you want a challenge, or a never ending rogue-like game, enter the Dungeons of Dredmor!\n\nTL/DR; Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with a HUGE amount of content for $4.99 USD, it’s got humor, charm and challenge, with plenty to do and replay ability to the Nth degree. It’s really cheap for what you get, Gaslamp Games certainly is giving you bang for your buck, honestly, if you don’t own the game, consider getting the full package for $6.99 USD, it’s just a few extra bucks and well worth it, plus the DLC by itself is $5.98 USD on its own so don’t waste your money unnecessarily! Check it out and support these guys so we can get more greatness in the future!\n\n-Double Thumbs up from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews: youtube.com/RoyialNetwork","March 4, 2015","true","30.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Want a martial arts healing necromancer that can lob some fire around?

All the expansions (DLCs) are really well done and it feels that they are actually a big part of the game. My favourite DLC (or expansion) is "Conquest of the Wizardlands", adding the ability to customize your pocket dimension, find magical graffiti in the dungeon and use the codes from the magical graffiti in your pocket dimension to open "Portals to distant lands", one of them being the "Diggle Hell". Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the best RPG games I have ever seen. It is addictive as hell, you can play it always and it never gets boring, because every time you play, the dungeon is completely different.

It's very easy to get into, has a lot of skills to choose from for character creation (implying lots of replayability, but I was wrong) and it covers everything with a layer of clever tongue-in-cheek humor (like witty pop culture references? this game has lots!)\n\nHowever after playing this game on a netbook for over 80 hours, properly experiencing it in all its glory, I stand corrected enough to say that I would not recommend this game to someone else looking to derive some fun out of their play sessions, unless their entertainment consists in dying over and over unfairly...case in which I probably still wouldn't recommend this game because it simply isn't that good all things considered.\n\nFirst off, a major technical issue. This game is built poorly, seemingly by dwarven plasticsmiths (those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) It's a little 2D game with sprites that have 2 animations each. Still it actively takes 600MB of RAM, reserving even more than that. On my 2GB RAM netbook I can forget running this and a browser at the same time.\n\nShame, because it looks like exactly the type of game to be played on a netbook/tablet, and not on a proper desktop configuration like the game demands. It also personally annoys me as this seems to be a problem with more and more lazy pixel-style indie games: games that look like they were made 20 years ago demand 4GB RAM and 1GB VRAM. What the hell?\n\nOnto the gameplay itself. It's balls hard. Not in a good way as it seemed on first glance. It's unfairly and frustratingly hard. It's unfair because while you have an ample amount of skills to choose from, only a few are actually effective (give you a high likelyhood of winning the game) while others are downright useless. The same goes for weapons (don't use crossbows unless you like taking 4x longer than a character with his bare hands to win the game). This wouldn't be so bad, as every such game has some strategies that work better than others, but this game in particular is very stingy with its descriptions of mechanics. Without reading a guide, you will frequently encounter weapons and abilities whose actual effects are very underwhelming compared to what their descriptions would have you believe. You pretty much have to read a guide before diving into the game, or you'll frequently wonder "what does THAT mean" when finding, say, an artifact or another with a typical description like "The honorable poodles - it is studded with cheese crust and decorated with high quality tin"\n\nOnce that's out of the way, and you finally have a good understanding of the game mechanics that let you create an effective character with a fair chance of winning...you will run into another problem. Basically, once you figure out how to not die, everything all the way up until the final boss becomes one relatively simple, mindless, long-winded repetitive grind. And the final boss? FUBAR, because even many good builds won't scratch that guy (hints: Magical Law, Burglary, Crossbow, crafting/encrusting in general). A situation in which 99% of the game play is mindless faceroll, and that 1% (final boss) has the shot of taking it all away because of RNG is not fun (again, unless you're a difficulty fetishist). I also have to ask myself why they even made the game with 51 skills to choose from when less than 15 of those are actually going to let you win the game.\n\nCould it be that in spite of first impressions, this is not that good of a game?","April 8","false","108.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

He absolutely rants and raves about how much fun he has with it... I'm not sure that we should be friends anymore. This game is extremely boring. The enemies are simple recolorings, the combat is not challenging other than trying to stay awake, and the levels are bland.\n\nThe humor in the game is slightly funny at first... But this is not enough to keep anyone interested on this alone. The battle mechanics are repetitive and the only real strategy is to funnel the enemies into a hallway where they can't attack more than 1 or 2 at a time and hack away. The graphics are HORRIBLE. A few floors in the background/floor/wall/everything looks like a gravel driveway with vomit mixed in.\n\nAt some point, I stopped playing the game, and just started seeing how many characters I could create with some form of "eyebrow" in their name...\n\nAnd then I shelved it....  Overall, I'd say if you've never played a top down turn based roguelike, or if you want a reason to never play  another top down turn based roguelike, maybe pick this up when it's on sale. If you want a game that will keep you interested for more than half an hour without feeling like repeatedly clicking on an icon in windows 3.0, pass this up completely.\n\n","May 4, 2015","false","5.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Just as most of the games of this genre, it's fun as long as you're striving for survival. Once you find a self-sustaining skill build, get lucky with items AND don't do any mistakes, it becomes easy and kinda repetitive, but those are circumstances some players might never experience and therefore they could enjoy the game even more. I only wish monster zoos were either implemented differently or removed from the game. Other than that and some skill explanations being cryptic at times, it's a really good, polished game that I highly recommend.","August 31, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

First of all, there are many technical problems with the engine. Crashes (with an achievement), bugs and input lag are always part of the experience. I never bothered with the non-permadeath mode but If you play this mode, the game is completely broken due to crashes corrupting the save file.\n\nThe humor in Dungeons of Dredmor is something most people seem to be in love with but I found it to be uninspired, unoriginal and not funny in any way. The more hours I spent playing, the less patience I had with the game's poor performance and input lag. These two issues are simply awful and unbearable after a while. Worst of all is the crafting and lack of a decent enough inventory system. If you make a character build focused on crafting, you will be in for the most frustrating, annoying, cumbersome experience in any crafting related game. It's so poorly implemented and backwards that once you go through the troubles of attempting to keep ingredients/items, organize them and finally begin crafting, you will never want to craft another item in this game again. The negative combination of the awful inventory system and the hideous crafting system is enough to quit playing and never go back to Dungeons of Dredmor again. Sure, the game could certainly be played using other builds and you don't have to craft anything to beat it, but the horrendous inventory system is still there and there is no way of making it less painful to organize, keep and use items. Dungeons of Dredmor could have been so much better if the developers spent more time polishing and tweaking many of the major issues the game has.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor is mediocre.","October 25, 2015","false","35.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This will not be a game that you're on the edge of your seat playing. It requires much more methodical planning and strategy. With the combinations of skills you can use, it is incredibly deep. Some combinations of skills make the game borderline impossible, but once you get your feet wet, you'll have a good idea of which skills work with which other skills.\n\nDon't forget that permadeath is the default, so if you don't want your save files to be deleted when you die, make sure to turn that feature off.\n\nI love this style of game, so this gets a 9/10 from me. If you like this genre, you can easily sink 200 hours into this game and still not see everything.","May 24, 2012","true","16.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

DoD does all this while being remarkably fun and addictive.

If all you care about it gameplay, that's what you should take away from this review.\n\nSadly, the developer, Gaslamp Games, has recently come out with VERY strong anti-gamer rhetoric. They have decided that not only is there no reason to fight for ethical, honest journalism in gaming, but that they, as devs, should take it upon themselves to silence all critism, censor all honest discussion, and side with people saying things like "Gamers are dead" and "All gamers are mysogonists."\n\nIt is sad to think that a company I once held in such high regard has secretly always held such anti-consumer, anti-customer ideologies. I am grateful that these tendencies have come to light, but I am sad to say I can no longer support their company financially, no matter how much I love their games.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you are comfertable giving money to a company that actively dispises you, as a consumer, please, buy this game.

I dont feel like enagling and disabling it all the time, so I pick all by hand. and it sucks.\nor if I want to open menu (to change autoloot or settings) I press ESC and it close inventory. press it again, and it closes character screen. press third time and we have menu! and now I have to open character screen and inventory again. yes it is minor thing. it is also stupid and anoying. and there are more...\n\n\nat all, I think this is GOOD game. problem is, that it is in 60-70% good. absolutely not 95% as suggested by steam reviews.\nthat is why I vote NO.  It has so many YES votes, it has become seriously misleading.\n\nVERDICT: if you like games like this and want to try another, buy it !\nbut there are some indie / rouge games that I think are better.","November 16, 2014","false","28.7"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","6"

Centuries later, the magical bonds that hold him in place are loosening and his power grows ever stronger. The land cries out for a new hero, a powerful warrior or a mystic wizard like those spoken of in the prophecies of yore.\n\nWhat they have, unfortunately, is you...\n\nStep into the Dungeons of Dredmor! Embrace your destiny! Face evil of the likes the world has never known - the terrifying Swarmies, the undulating Thrusties, and the adoreable nest-building Diggles. Worship Inconsequentia, the Goddess of Pointless Sidequests, or try your luck as a devotee of the nameless Lutefisk God. Cast powerful magic learned from the dark business warlocks of the school of Necronomiconomics, or summon the Viking Runes of your ancestors to blast your foes with thunder and lightning! Discover the power that can be had by wielding a bizarre armament of devastating weaponry such as the Interdimensional Axe, the Plastic Ring, and the Invisible Shield (if you can remember where you left it). Wield shoes decorated by the Dwarven Glittersmiths, all of whom have now committed suicide because of their shame, and embrace the joys of destroying giant moustache-wielding brick demons with a mace decorated with tawdry, delicious bacon.\n\nWhile you’re at it, be prepared to die. A lot. In hideous, screaming pain that makes you throw your keyboard out the window.\n\nThe Dungeons of Dredmor await.

The game is funny, the graphics nice for the genre, there's plenty of depth and it is original in many ways. For the price I paid (part of a Humble Bundle) and the £3.49 it is on Steam, it is very, very good value.\n\nHowever it is flawed. It is so slow to play and there's so much repetition of doing the same thing i.e. fighting - which is a problem common to many turn-based roguelikes but overcome by most with instantaneous response enabling quite large battles to be resolved quickly. Sadly this is not the case with Dredmor, making the early levels quite laborious on repeat play throughs. Since it is a permadeath game, I soon tired of trudging my way through the early levels and soon put the game into my archives.\n\nYou won't be wasting your money buying Dungeons of Dredmor, but if you want a game that will draw you in and keep you coming back for more, I'd be surprised if you found it here.","April 30, 2014","false","8.3"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","1"

The play style harkens back to the earliest dungeon crawlers, featuring randomly generated dungeons, punishing combat, and a wealth of customization.  It's charm lies in the witty, inane humor sprinked in everything; my personal favorite joke were the shrines littering the dungeon, where you could pray to the goddess of side-quests, and receive a random task.  I swear, it's much funnier than my lame description implies.  Nonetheless, it's difficult to reccomend for you to buy the game, as the gameplay is extremely clunky, especially item and spell management.  For items, you must click and drag every single thing in the game.  That means that when you come across a trove of 9 pieces of Lutefisk, you either have to click and drag 8 times, or get lazy and leave them sitting there.  It's simply frustrating.  Additionally, stats and related systems are poorly, if at all, explained.  It becomes a burdon to try to compare one piece of armor against another.  All-in-all, Dungeons of Dredmor is an entertaining series of jokes, that lacks the polishing necessary for today's game market.","January 20, 2014","false","4.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","1"

Just be aware before going in that when things go wrong in this game, it'll in all likelihood be unfair (swarmed by enemies out of thin air, overleveled enemies just randomly appearing and one shotting you, etc) and ruin any amount of fun you've had prior to that character's untimely demise.\n\nThat said, Dredmor is an approachable roguelike that handles its systems nicely. It can seem overwhelming at first, but when boiled down, all those skills, items, and crafting come into play, there's nothing complicated about it at all. I just really can't recommend it myself given how abrupt and unfair every play through I've had has gone.","September 10, 2013","false","14.1"," 10 of 32 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","10","32","0","2"

Character progression is severely lacking in depth. The skill system boils down to unlocking one active or passive skill per level in a sequence of linear offerings. The crafting system is unapproachable, excessively time consuming, and unnecessarily cumbersome due to the inadequate inventory management system.

Well, I guess let's try and figure out where and why I bought this game. That may shed a little light on how Dungeons of Dredmor (Further referred to as DoD) came to be in the 1K Game Stream Challenge.\n\nAs best I can guess, DoD came with a bundle of games. Either some HumbleBundle or one of the other "Value Bundles" being sold by one of the flavor of the month Steam Key re-sellers on the internet today. See, the Indie Developers tend to get their games lumped together, because the consumer of PC games seems to like value above quality. This is not always the case, but unless your dealing with the likes of HumbleBundle, then you're probably going to find a few games in each bundle that equate to a happy meal toy.\n\nLet's start at the beginning. For the record, I knew nothing about DoD coming into the playthough. I literally couldn't have told you anything about the game. After playing it for 3 hours straight on cast, I can tell you it's a Rogue-like RPG Game, and that's about it. From the point I started playing, I was confused by the mass amount of loot just lying around. Some may find this interesting and want to pick up every little thing, but honestly it seemed more like a videogame about hording than adventuring. There is so much crap lying around that you spend far more time messing with the tiny inventory screen than the tool belt where you store important spells and skills. This seems boring and tedious, neither are what I consider a gaming experience. Even trying to figure out the crafting system was cumbersome and not intuitive.\n\nNow, I am a supporter of Indie Games and when it comes to Rogue-Type games, I love them!  Spelunky, Crypt of the Necrodancer and Rogue Legacy are amazing. The difference is they are mainly platformers, and this plays well with the Rogue style of death machines. You care very little in most cases that you have to start over. In DoD this can be a nightmare if you leave the Rogue option on. Starting over each time is hell if you've just lost an hour of crafting work. One final note, that may be just a gripe,  in the game the characters always look the same no matter what armor you equip them with in the menu. Metacritic's average complete argues against my finding with a 79 for overall reviews. I would probably have put this more in the range of 40-50 based on the issues I've stated above.\n\nThe one area that DoD wins in is price. Being an Indie title, the cost of the game is going to be on the lower side of the scale. When I say the lower part of the scale, I mean less than $5 on steam everyday. The complete edition is $6.99, and has a decent offering of DLC. The other advantage to DoD is that it supports user mods from the Stream Workshop, which can really extend the life of any game. To be fair, I did not install any files from the Workshop. I can't say that I would recommend  buying the game, but if the opportunity arises that some bundle has the game, give it a try and see if you can find anything interesting from user generated mods.\n\n\n\nFoG\n\n#HistoryWillBePlayed\n\nReference:\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor\n\nGameplay Video:\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/fansofgames/b/585136108","November 4, 2014","false","3.2"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","13","0","0"

Unless I missed a option you always need to play with a mouse beside the keyboard.\n\nThe atmosphere the game creates also doesn't really click with me. It tries to hard to be funny.

It takes retro gameplay, great music, silly humor, and RPG elements, throws them into a rogue-like and calls it a day.  Dungeons of Dredmor feels, plays, and bleeds retro but still manages to be a new, unique experience.\n\nThe combat system is what you'd expect from a rogue-like of the sort.  Melee weapons stab or bash at close range while magic and crossbows deal with enemies farther away.  You click, you (may) hit, rinse and repeat.  While that sounds boring, the game does a great job at giving players variety (especially with magic!)\n\nAnother major reason that I love this game is the skills.  The skills and attached skill trees (more like a 'line'") are in depth and compare to that of modern day triple A RPGs.  You can be anything you want, leading to rediculous (and awesome) combinations. You want to be a sword-wielding, arrow launching, blood magic casting, vampire with a hobby in blacksmiting?  DoD lets you do just that.\n\nIn general, this game makes the genre more accessible as ever because it's 3 different difficulty levels cater to the casual as well as the rogue-like veteran.  Ive played most of the recent rogue-likes that have come out and enjoyed them all but DoD takes the cake.  It is insanely fun and super addicting and I highly recommend this game.","February 4, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These range from simple weapon mastery trees to ludicrous skills like 'Emomancy' granting you powers to manipulate and utilise the energy of angst and deprivation, or the 'Archaeology' tree which grants a certain iconic fedora and bonuses to trap avoidance and general nimbleness.\nOverall, Dungeons of Dredmor is a great whole package at £4.99 for all the DLC and the base game, and promises to draw both old-school roguelike fans and newbs to the genre alike by adding actual graphics whilst sticking to the core mechanics of loot hoarding, character progression and permadeath.","June 6, 2014","true","40.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've yet to close the loop with them and report my experience, but they helped get me up and running with the game on Steam.\n\nTHE NOT-ALL-GOOD:\nYour character's art doesn't change to reflect your items.

Finding the synergies between skills as you fine-tune your build is immensely satisfying.\n\nIf you're a fan of old-school dungeon crawlers and roguelikes, you should definitely give Dungeons of Dremor a look.","December 25, 2014","true","139.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have never played a roguelike before, keep in mind that you WILL die.. over and over. The goal is just to keep trying to get a bit further each time, and if that fails, hope you die in an interesting way. Instead of being tied to a class, you pick from a selection of physical, magical, and crafting skills. The dungeons are randomly generated each time, so you never know what you are going to find. I highly reccomend this one as an introduction into roguelikes, for anyone who doesnt know about them, and to those who love the genre, Why dont you have this already?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharkylove/recommended/98800/","sharkylove","Sharky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharkylove/","302 products in account","What can I say about Dungeons of Dredmor? Well, for one, it's one of my favorite games on Steam. I could spend countless hours playing character after character looting and exploring dungeon after dungeon, and never have the same experuience twice. I'm not kidding. Not even once have I found a room exactly the same. Talk about Procedurally Generated.\n\nThe joy of this game does not come in any one category. There are parts of this game that, if anywhere else, would make for a horrid experience. The combat isn't that complicated, but it can be difficult, and it's always fun. Wearing a piece of clothing or weilding a specfic weapon doesn't effect your outward appearance, only adding (or subtracting) from your stats, so for people who like to see your appearance change it's a problem.\n\nDungeons of Dredmor isn't like most other games out there, as you may have already guessed, but it is ery entertaining, and hours will go by without you even knowing it. There is so much content in this game, and of all the hours I have played so far, I have not made it past the second dungeon. Is this because it is difficult? Maybe a little. But the real reason is that the game is really really big. Too many different types of monsters to count, as many weapons, more items than I've ever seen in a game, and interesting text on everything.\n\nThis game has a lot of pop culture references and stuff like that, so for people who hate that with a passion, this game probably isn't a good choice for you. But if you want a game that can make you laugh, that's really fun, and can let you waste away hours of your life, then this game is perfect for you.\n\nI highly reccomend this game.","June 20, 2014","true","31.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Heck, even playing with permadeath on and on the hardest difficulty is fun because it's hilarious to see how exactly you'll die and how long it'll take (spoiler: some of the achievements give it away).\n\nLike my buddy Graham said when he recommended this game, give a try even if you're someone like me, someone whose attention span is ill-suited for rogue-likes and/or turn-based games. It's cheap (especially when it's on sale) and for the price it's a lot of fun that I know I'll be coming back to in the future.","July 16, 2013","true","54.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The game gets more and more punishing as you progress, and there is less room for mistakes (PERMADEATH ALL THE WAY!). It is very easy to die from a stupid mistake!

There are all sorts of "rogue-like" and "rogue-lite" games on Steam nowadays, and this is certainly among the best.\n\nYou're basically a person with some customized build of your choosing going through a dungeon with the goal of becoming more powerful and slaying some guy. The story is comical and background noise at best, and the real strength of the game is in exploration and advancement.\n\nThe one flaw in this game is the art style. Obviously, the graphics are very low tech, but there is a difference between "good" low tech (Shovel knight, Braid, etc) and "bad" low tech, and this, albeit barely, falls into the bad. Everything around you kinda looks vomit-colored and some of the monsters blend in with the scenery so well that they look like furniture. If it weren't for the fact that items "sparkled" when on the ground, you'd really have no way of knowing the difference between a new pair of boots and a corpse. Dob't get me wrong; it's not the worst looking game in the world by any means, but it could easily be made better.\n\nIn short, this game is cheap and goes on sale a fair bit. It's perfectly for when you've got some spare time at work and things are slow, so you should look to add it to your library when you get the chance.","September 19, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics and sound effects are not mindblowing, but they work very well.\n\nIf I were to criticize at all, it would be just to wish for some more UI options, such as moving/adjusting the log scroller, and perhaps adding more detail to it, as well as some way to look at tiles that are behind walls.

A wonderful sense of humor and one of the more interesting skill and leveling systems I've seen in an RPG make this one a keeper.","September 25, 2014","true","93.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sheer amount of charm packed in every byte of this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebulonpi/recommended/98800/","zebulonpi","Zebulon Pi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebulonpi/","364 products in account","A wonderful rogue-like, with a lot of the traditional "we're not necessarily going to tell you what everything does" vibe, starting with character creation. Can make it a bit less "jump in and go" like something like Desktop Dungeons or Binding of Issac, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing, just different. As if to make up for the complexity, you can save your progress in the game, as well as toggle on and off "permadeath", where, if you die, you can't re-load from saves you may hae made, which definitely raises the tension.\n\nWith lots of difficulty, lots of replay value, and a different random dungeon every time, you will be playing this for a long time to come. Highly recommended for rogue-like fans.","September 27, 2014","true","36.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun and easy to pick up with tonnes to do, explore and kill. Don't be put off by my playtime, this game, just from the small snippet I've played is extremely fun. Not to mention the price tag, I would easily pay more than £3.49 for this game purely because of it's little quirks.","August 6, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
