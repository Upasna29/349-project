The Quest is one huge, deep, and exceptionally well-crafted RPG experience.\n\nLarge and beautiful open world that truly feels like it was carefully hand-crafted, one that is rich with nostalgic fantasy atmosphere and filled with loads of interesting locales to discover, dungeons to plunder and quests to solve (which often can be done in more than one way, or sometimes in a way that is connected with other seemingly separate quests). Game features a reputation system where your fame/infamy increases or decreases depending on your actions and way in which you complete quests, which in turn can influence your future quests and your interactions with some of the game's NPCs.\n\nCombat is fully turn-based, highly enjoyable and deceptively simple. Game offers deep and open character customization, wide variety of equipment and spells, and sufficiently deep alchemy system. It's definitely a kind of game where trying out a vastly different character build is a good enough reason for a full-fledged replay.\n\nThis new re-release comes with a fully redone HD visuals, and I must say that team did a pretty good job there: game looks -gorgeous-, at times almost like a beautiful hand-drawn fantasy illustration, fully retaining its original charm reminiscent of 90s games that influenced it.","December 22, 2015","true","18.9"," 74 of 78 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","74","78","4","0"

I played the game originally on IOS back in 2008, but don't be fooled, this game is not like the mobile games of today. The Quest came from a time before microtrasactions and dumbed down mobile games. This game is a true RPG and a complete game. This new version was remade mostly from scratch to have higher graphical fidelity than the original release. I have put in hundreds of hours on the old version of The Quest. The game is fleshed out in many respects, with in depth character creation in which race choice matters, a custom enchantment system, alchemy system, tons of spells, and tons of content. If you love old school RPG's, or new school RPG's like Legend of Grimrock, you will like this game.","December 21, 2015","true","23.7"," 61 of 72 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","61","72","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuzzieBoy/recommended/428880/","FuzzieBoy","FuzzieBoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuzzieBoy/","583 products in account","While this game's origins are on mobiles and PDAs, don't let that put you off; it's from a time before microtransactions and wait timers plagued these games. In fact, it's always felt like a game that would be at home on PC. And it is.\n\nThe Quest feels like an homage to the dungeon crawlers of the late 80s and early 90s, with player choice firmly leading the way. Nearly every quest will have multiple ways to solve it, and the idea of what's good and bad is constantly foggy due to the fame system. As opposed to a meter telling you if you're a saint or sinner, you get a meter of fame, which decreases when it looks like you've done something bad, and increases when it looks like you've done something good. This may sound like the same thing, but sometimes the person you're sent to "rescue" doesn't want to leave, and was actually forced into a life they hated back home. Sure, getting them back would give you fame - it looks like you're helping - but is it really the right thing to do? This system really changes up how you approach your tasks, as it's not uncommon for what looks like the right thing to do to actually lose you fame - those in power have influence, but often tainted morals.\n\nOn top of that, the combat has surprising depth to it as enemies seem to be able to have all the resistances and weaknesses you do, and finding these out can really be the difference between life and death. This really makes scraping through some of the tougher fights - even those fairly early on - really satisfying. Dungeons - while often fairly small - contain traps to disarm and secrets to find. Even potion crafting is fun to play with when you get some levels in alchemy, as some combinations of ingredients will have some unexpected results, and stumbling into one of these when you need it the most is so, so relieving. Everything you'd expect from a first person grid based CRPG is right here, and executed brilliantly. On top of this, the attention to detail is often staggering: even your outfit changes how people interact with you, with fancier clothes letting you get more favour with the posher characters, but also causing the lower class citizens to often be not so friendly. There's even a small card game to play in the inns to earn money, which may seem simple at first, but can be quite involving, and is a very fun distraction when you start to set up massive attacks with your buffs, and some large attack combos. The game is really full of depth, and you shouldn't ever be lacking for something you want to do, as the writing - while sometimes imperfect - does enough to make you actually want to help the characters who need it.\n\nThough not everything is perfect. My main complaint would be that there's really no way to escape a melee enemy that's too strong for you - you have to let them hit you once to figure out they'll destroy you, and from then they'll shadow your movements. They'll even follow you all the way back to a town, and just stay infront of the guards, who will do nothing to help, making you essentially trapped. While this is less of an issue when you get the paralyze spell, it's still quite annoying until then. But quite frankly, this is nitpicking more than anything else, and not enough to dampen my enjoyment of this game at all. Highly recommended to all CRPG fans.","January 9","true","4.7"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","37","43","6","0"

The Quest nails the old school game style and the reworked art gives a taste of modern efforts ( though i prefer the older visuals).\nWhile the Quest is honestly rather simple compared other games of the same nature like "The Legend Of GrimRock" 1 & 2 or the the formentioned DaggerFall- it still holds its own and will eat up hours of your time, plus it's great for a entry point into games like this.\nHowever this is  a game formula the often calls on the "Love it or Hate it" conondrome, not to much hand holding here, and so it's best you do some research on the games i just mentioned and know what your getting into- i mean 10 dollars is 10 dollars.\nP.S(this game is Turn based, unlike DaggerFall).","April 25","true","13.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","1"

And a day ago, when Steam Winter Sale started, I noticed a familiar name in the list of games with a discount.\nAt first I didn't even believe what I was seeing back then. It was like a dream came true, and when I started the game I felt such an amazing nostalgic sensation, it was incredible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/428880/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","Wow. Like a lot of people I was turned off by the "was on mobile/pocket PC". But the game had such good reviews, I had to try it out. And I'm really glad I did. The best way to describe it is TES mixed with the mid-generation Might and Magics - World of Xeen era. (I love MM 4-7. I even like 8 too) It really feels like a good turn based/semi realtime game from the mid 90s. And I mean that in the best way possible. Graphics are colorful, bright, and appear hand drawn in a well done mid-90s style- People move about, and clicking on things in the viewscreen allows you to interact. You can pick flowers & herbs, look at signs, examine things, talk to people (or sneak around from behind and steal), and so on and so forth. You can even read books. Some contain short stories, some useful alchemy recepies you can make from the herbs collected out wandering around. Personally, I love that. I'm one of those weirdos who's read literally every single book in TES.\n\nCombat is handled through a turnbased system on the overworld map kind of like M&M. IE - an enemy moves on the same overworld map as you, it doesnt go into a combat screen. They can even snipe at you from a distance with a ranged weapon. I was out screwing around in the wilderness, and all the sudden I started taking damage. I looked around, couldn't see anything. I took a step and got hit again. I saw movement, and realized an f'n archer was sniping at me behind a bush. I ran at her and she actually dodged out of the way so I couldnt hit her. Not bad. Once you get close, the game goes into a turn based mode, noticable by the fact that there appears to be a slight lag as the triggered enemy(s) move or attack. You can move(turning in place is free)/attack, then the enemy(s), then you. You are free to go wherever, so if you dont want to fight, just take off in the opposite direction and hope you're fast enough to get away.\n\nTheres plenty of people to talk to and sidequests so far. My one complaint about that is although there is a journal system for actual quests, there isnt an ingame note system where you can type simple notes to yourself for info that may be related to your quests. So if someone tells you "the mayor's house is in the Northwest" or "I heard the smuggler (name) has a secret tunnel hidden in the SW of (place), you better write it down or remember it, the game wont remember it for you even if its a clue directly related to an in-journal quest.\n\nThe class and skill system is pretty cool for a game like this. Its completely customizable. You pick a basic race, and are free to pick a base class. Then you can tweak the skills you start with however you want. Want a necromancer mage that steals and dual wields light weapons? You got that. A ranger that sneaks around and specializes in mind magic and heavy weapons? Yep.\n\nAnother cool thing is based on your starting character, you start in a slightly different area of the game with a slightly different intro book. Its a nice touch.\n\nIn the inn theres a nice little card game you can bet money with.  There are 3 decks to choose from, each deck has slightly different style cards. The object is to play a card every turn and drop your opponents HP to 0 with attack and DoT cards while keeping yourself alive with defense and healing cards. Its a fun little diversion.\n\nThe sound is the one part the game isnt that great in, but thats fine. Not much sound at all, steps on hard surfaces, rustling in the woods and just a thwock-oof (or other appropriate monster noise) when you hit or are hit in combat.\n\nOverall, this game is a surprising little gem. Anyone who loves the mid-90s style RPGs should take a look at it. Its surprisingly complex and nothing like what youd expect from a "mobile game". My one concern with that is I'm wondering how long the game actually is, I mean they did such a good job on such a restrictive platform I'm wondering if they had to sacrifice content?","December 24, 2015","true","3.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","2"

This does not affect the review.\n\nSecond, I see two distinct types of players of The Quest: old-timers who played it in the iPhone (and PPC) days, and newbies who found this game on Steam and maybe wishlisted it.\n\nIf you're one of the old-timers, get this game. Period. Even though you don't have the luxury of expansions, mod support should come out soon enough.\n\nIf you're a newbie: You should buy this game. For about ten dollars, it's a steal. The graphics are vintage, looking like they date back to about 2005. As a person who cares more about gameplay, this doesn't matter. My point is even though it doesn't have the visual quality of The Witcher 3 or Skyrim, you should still get this.\n\nThis is a CRPG, which means it's open world. Some of the quests in this game might be rather generic and basic, but others give you a freedom of choice not seen in many other RPGs. You can choose to live a pious life or be as evil as you want, based on your actions. In addition, there's a good and evil ending. You also get the freedom to teleport (though limited) to whatever location you want through Mark and Recall spells, as well as the ability to enchant your armor, weapons, and jewelry with whatever you want. You want to give your dagger a +2 Personality enchantment? Go ahead!\n\nIn terms of length, one could see about 20-50 hours of gameplay in this game. However, I've not played the base game by itself up until now, since I played it on iPhone with expansions, so this is a rough and wildly variable estimate. Redshift updates their game very frequently, so any glitches you find will get patched out within a week at most.\n\nIn short: Purchase this game if you like RPGs. Period. It's only $10, but worth so much more. If you've played it before in the past and enjoyed it, I'd be surprised if you didn't get it.","April 1","true","3.1"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","0"

In these days where AAA titles rules on the market, there are also developers like Redshift who brings to live that old-school, almost forgotten kind of games -\nGames with soul. For these of You who remmember old games times, this one is a must-have. And for these who not? Well, look at those wonderful screenshots, isn't it Beautiful? Of course graphic is the one thing. Gameplay is similar to other rpg's except movement. Our hero may walk in any direction but there is no slants. There is no mouse free look. That's what I love in this game. I can focus on what is in front of me instead annoying mouse hover-overing around. :) Of course game have mouse control as well. You may walk freely wherever You want, talk to anyone, take and complete quests and fight of course! Lot's of fight.Combat is turn based. Quests may be solved in two ways. One way is good, other bad. It is Your decision which way to choose. Will You be a good and kind person or simply a thief? It's up to You.For these who like a little experience grind I have good news! Enemies respawn after a few days in game! Loot is random. There is also many herbs which help You in Your quest.If You will have enough alchemy skill, will be able to create many useful potions!\nWhat's bring my attention was clear and good looking interface. The Quest have a well made one! I like also the font of the game as well. Music is very good. I enjoy to listen main menu track just for relaxation.\n\nThis is a solid, well done RPG game with truly gorgeus hand-drawned graphic. It's worth the price!

Any other problem is a minor annoyance, and there aren't many.

The Quest, being indie game, is not nearly as polished. I played other games like that, e.g. Grimrock, but I never could play past 15 min. The story of The Quest looks strange at first, but I learned to enjoy it over time. Skills and items are all quite interesting as well, and excitment from visits shops doesn't wear off fast.\n\nWhat's fresh here - it's old school progression system. Neither narrative nor regions decide for you when you qualify to go and fight. You do it the old fashion: you run, you train hard on weaker enemies, do quests, have a shopping spree, then you go back to the dungeon and kick ♥♥♥ of that spongy litte ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And you save a lot, how else would you know when to run? There's nothing new in combat system, it's just ok (I find it quite underwhelming being an archer in games like that). Good-evil alignment is real and affects a lot of stuff including gear you can use. And, most importantly, what really keeps me going is exporation I think.\n\nThe game has its flaws, needs more graphics settings, could use more polish (UI), but if you are ok with that and if you can lay aside inconveniences like lack of quest tracking and quick bar for iteam/spells or accidental attacking of civilians then you will have a lot of fun with The Quest.","March 9","true","35.9"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Personally, I am very happy I found this gem on Steam. Hate to think of what I would have missed if I had passed it up. What first attracted me was the handdrawn art seen in the screenshots. "The Quest" is a beauty and also very fun.\n\nOlder titles that come to my mind are Might and Magic 3/4/5. However, "The Quest" formulates its own style in both atmosphere and mood, and it does not feel too much like M&M or really any other title I know. If Redshift has modelled the mechanics of their game after some other title that inspired them, then it's one that I have yet to play. Suffice it to say, I enjoyed "The Quest" immensely and I am very much looking forward to the promised sequel. The stories in both the main game and its expansion captivates with numerous twists that kept me questioning the motives of the more important characters you are forced to interact with. There are plenty of interesting moral choices to be made both during the main questline or during sidequests which might prompt a reload of your save just to see the effects of what happens when you act differently. Atleast that is what I did - often. :) Playing cards at the inns is another addiction.\n\nAlso, technically, the interface in this game is simple in a positive way and allows you to focus on gameplay rather than zillions of statistics or needless tabs that serve no practical purpose. Its nice for a change. What I am saying is basically that "The Quest" is easy to get into but hard to put down. Frequent patches has also killed of most bugs reported and I did not runt into as much as a single issue while playing. 100 % stable.\n\nI could go on about everything else I like about this game but other reviews might might say it better or offer other more detailed perspectives on various aspects of gameplay I haven't covered here. It's not a game for everyone but rather a matter of taste (as with everything). Still, if you approved of the older M&M - or similar - then I don't see why you should dislike "The Quest".

Balanced and challenging fights, interesting quests and very atmospheric locations - all included.\nAlso a perfect example of an HD remake.\n\nFirst played it on Pocket PC back then and spent countless hours exploring, brewing potions, playing card games and sneaking into the cities. Hope the DLCs will come along as well.\n\nReally long ago emailed devs because I wanted to play it on PC after my PPC broke up finally, but wasn't able to pay for it because had some problems with PayPal (still wasn't able to register there for some mystical reason recently).

Be prepared for spending many hours exploring, fighting, playing cards in the Taverns and eventually solving the main quest of the game.  I finished the game in just under 40 hours, however I still have more of the map to explore, and want to play as a full Mage class on my second run of the game.\n\nDifficulty is very well balanced in the beginning and middle game.  At the beginning you feel powerless, as you should, but gain a few levels and things begin to even out.  Still you will be have to use strategy to defeat your foes depending on your build.  My physical fighter had some difficulty with magic based attacks...higher level enemies in particular can destroy you especially with lightning attacks.  Still there are many ways to buff your character to overcome this.\n\nMy only criticism is I felt the end game was a little too easy.  In the game you can enchant items buffing your stats considerably which does take away some of the challenge.  Enemies don't scale to your level (which I like), and you get good satisfaction slaughtering enemies that gave you trouble in the early game.  Enemies also respawn after a while (a week?) which helps you to gain more experience and precious gold.  Be wise with your money...I ended up with just over 4000 gold at the end game after amassing over 20000 gold throughout the game.\n\nSo yeah this is a pretty special game, that will appeal to those who enjoy turn based combat, grid movement and games like the early Might And Magic series.  I really look forward to the sequel and if possible an expansion to this game would be a great addition.  The Quest is a first class game from beginning to end.","January 9","true","40.7"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

All games should strive to be this detailed and interesting. If you ever feel the need for a good old role play, dungeon crawl, or just have a love for video games, this game is for you. The story is really good, and each quest has great writing and isn't just some fetch quests. The NPC's really bring the game to life. This game is definetely a must buy, and I would snag it early during the sale. As you can see by my play time, I've been playing it non-stop since I bought it. A drawback to the game however, is that it is sorta hard to start off. It is a little complicated at first with all the character building, and you being thrown in the middle of a town to fend for yourself and find quests. I'd recommend the guides Sylon compiled in the official RedShift Forum. There is a button in the menu screen to get there, but I'd recommend using the steam overlays browser functionality to have the ability to open guides at any time. Keep in mind though that pressing shift within the game is the attack button, so when you open the overlay press tab first so you don't trigger an attack.You wouldn't believe how many times I've accidentally hit someone while opening the overlay and having to pay off the fine. Anyway with all that said, The Quest is a great must-immediately-buy game, and while it's on sale you can't go wrong with buying it!","December 21, 2015","true","4.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

It's very similar to the classic Might and Magic games such as MM3 and World of Xeen but with a little more depth in the skill system. So far the difficulty level seems just right. One difference from the Might and Magic and The Quest is that you play solo in this game. There are no party members, but it's still pretty fun playing solo. You will meet interesting characters, browse through shops with many goodies, and crawl through dangerous dungeons! I'm also liming the art in this game, it fits it well. The Quest is also turn based with grid movement which is a huge perk IMO. So, do yourself the favour and buy this gem!

You will be faced with choices that will either make you famous, or infamous.  The best way I can describe this is if Skyrim was put into an old RPG engine.\n\nIf you've played the game on ios or android, it's pretty much the same, only the graphics have been massively inproved as has the framerate.\n\nThe only downside to this game I can think of is that if you drop an item that's required for a quest and the item disappears, you cannot finish that quest.

Characters are solid; however, I would love to see more attributes or ways to customize my character further.\n\nComplaints:\n(1)Quests are extremely vague with no markers or map assistance. I end up usually roaming to fill in the map, then happen upon the areas. Additionally it can be tricky to figure out how to clear them. Some might disagree, but I enjoy quest markers of some sort.\n\n(2)This one is a personal preference, since I prefer real time combat. When a monster gets into range you go into "slow-mo mode" where your movement is reduced to 1 square at a time, with the enemies responding to each movement.  Battles seem to drag on at times with you moving around to get them stacked up on a same square.","March 22","true","4.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It has a distinct "indie" look to it at first glance and drowns in a sea of lower priced indie games fighting for your attention.  But let me tell you if you have even the tiniest nostalgic bone in your body, you are doing yourself a great favor in picking up this game!  I am quite a fan of the older RPG games, particularly games like the Elder Scrolls Daggerfall, Lands of Lore and the Might and Magic and Wizardy series of games.  The Quest hits those notes with plenty of charm to spare!\n\nThere are the standard fare of classes and races to choose from, giving you the opportunity to tailor your own character to the style of play that you enjoy the most.  I personally set out as a mage, and I get all the right feelings from that, including feeling like a wimp at a low level.  Leveling up and purchasing better equipment actually feels to make a difference.  I am able to creep ever farther out into the dangerous wilds as bit by bit I get just a little better and wield better equipment.\n\nThe imagery is nicely stylized and consistent throughout from what I've seen.  It does have that "low budget" sort of look which makes for unimpressive screenshots but once you immerse yourself in this world, you are easily lost in it and the funny looking features of the landscape don't bother you much.  It's the large world seemingly filled with exciting adventures that you here for after all!\n\nThe controls have taken me a bit to figure out.  Some things aren't as intuative, like clicking on a crack in the floor sometimes opens up my inentory, as if it is a container, sometimes it initiates an attack, sometimes nothign happens at all.  And there doesn't seem to be any visual feedback to let you konw which will happen.   Because of this, it took me several play sessions before I wasn't accidentally attacking small children in town, or firing off a healing spell when I meant to look at my character sheet.  but given a bit of time, you will become familiar with the keyboard shortcuts.\n\nI think the lack of intuitive interface, or maybe I should call it "hand holding" actually lends itself to this game as a benefit.  I'm actually enjoying learning in a more natural way all of the different ways I can interact with the world I'm finding myself in.\n\nThe music is nice and fitting for the situations. The sound effects are just fine.  I actually wince each time I'm minding my own business wandering through the forrest only to be ambushed by an amazonian looking archer woman.  The sound of her arrows thudding into me, and the sharp grunt my character makes me cringe every time.\n\nDon't let any doubts about first impressions keep you from picking up this game (as I did at first), you owe it to yourself ot get started on this exciting quest!","May 25","true","4.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I bought this back then a little while after its release as the style of gameplay reminded me of older turn / tile based RPGs such as Daggerfall.\nThe gameplay is addictively fun and simple, you can move quickly over tiles whilst out of combat but when within range of another enemy the speed slows down to help you plan your next move, take a potion or choose a spell to fire. The story is nicely written and interesting to get involved with and the music is very relaxing when exploring towns and forests and equally immersive in dungeons.\n\nThere were a number of expansions for The Quest that were released on iOS that all expanded on regular gameplay and were also playable standalone, I'd like to see them make an appearance on the PC port as well.","December 22, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

In spite of those cons, the game is actually a lot of fun and incredibly compelling.  However, if you don't like old-school RPGs (ie grid-based movement, rigid combat) you probably won't like this.  If you do, look no further!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzScAC01dKA\n\nThis is actually a remaster (remake?) of a game that came out on Pocket PC and iPhone in 2009.  The art style kinda dips into the uncanny valley at times, especially when you look at peoples' faces.  There's quite a few different play styles with the different skills that you can pick from, so you're liable to find something that suits you.\n\nThere's a lot of dialogue that really lends itself to making the world feel more alive.  The writing is sometimes a little bit off and the AI is a little silly (I had a horde of bandits follow me to the town and camp outside waiting for me... guards sat and just had tea with them) but the game keeps pulling me in and makes me want to see how powerful I can get and what lies just beyond what I have currently explored.\n\nIf you're looking for an old-school RPG experience that won't break the bank, this is for you.","December 29, 2015","true","3.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It has a lot more in common with, say, the Elder Scrolls series than it does with something like Lands of Lore. You're a lone hero, so there's no party to manage while you travel about the land of Freymore (something I adore about this game!). With a difficulty level that is completely spot-on, you'll be doing plenty of exploring, dungeon diving, character building, alchemy, and fighting as you work your way through the game's many quests.\n\nAnd the quests are really where the game shines. They are plentiful, well written, and almost never as they first appear. For example, an early quest has you seeking a boy to recruit as an agent of the kingdom...but shortly into the quest, it branches and gives the player multiple options for completion. Will you force him to come with you? Will you recruit someone else in his place? Player choice and twists like this are a common theme throughout the game and allow you to role play and build your character as you please. The depth is a refreshing departure from the "kill 10 rats" trope and really shows the care that went into crafting the world and its stories. It's even fun to tell friends the crazy stuff that happens because it's often hilarious and totally unexpected, and you don't always get that in RPGs.\n\nThe game also received an HD facelift when it came to Steam, with new graphics and an updated interface. The screenshots make it look a bit chintzy, but in motion, the new art really works and looks quite charming. I've been able to run the game on multiple devices with different resolutions and have had no issues at all. On the other hand, the music and sound hasn't been updated. This is a non-issue for me since the music, albeit midi, is quite good, and the sound effects are perfectly serviceable. As a side note - the developer includes the old development version of the game, with the old graphics, for the low price of zero dollars.\n\nThe developer also added a lot of convenience options like key rebinds, tool tips, inventory sorting, quick saves, cloud saves, touch mode and I'm sure a ton more I'm missing. It does a lot to bring the game up to date and it feels a lot more modern than it used to. They're continuing to release updates and fixes to the game as well, and it's obvious they are listening to the community. My wishes include getting the expansion content - and mods - in addition to native controller support. This game would work amazingly well in Big Picture with a 360 controller!\n\nSuffice it to say that I'm totally impressed with this new version of The Quest. What I initially thought would be a quick port ended up being a developer's genuine effort to bring an old classic up to date and to a new audience. This does not feel like a mobile port in any way. It's a full-fledged and substantial PC release and I really feel it really has that "special something" that a lot of RPGs lack. I'll soon come back and spend even more time with it than I did on iOS. Here's to hoping the expansion content is released and that the Quest 2 gets made!","January 19","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/428880/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Dungeon Crawler: When considering what dungeon crawler games to play on Steam you’re going to find people make mention of a lot of titles before they ever, if they ever, consider The Quest. That’s not an indictment on the game but rather of how few people have discovered it yet. Of course, most Steam players will be familiar with titles such as the Legend of Grimrock franchise and some of the various titles that actually feature the word ‘dungeon’ in their title yet The Quest may be much better than some of them and closely behind the icons in the genre (such as Grimrock). The Quest offers everything that a lover of dungeon crawlers would hope to find in a title. It’s tough as nails and very challenging, the game world is sizeable enough to allow the player to explore to their heart’s content and it’s got enough old school charm that it’s going to remind some of their favorite dungeon crawlers from yesteryear.\n\nSolid hand drawn graphics:  The graphics being entirely hand drawn adds a tremendous amount of character to the game. It’s a nice touch and one that most players will appreciate. The only slight niggle is that some areas have had much more attention to detail paid than others. This inconsistency is very noticeable, almost from the very start of the game, and can become a bugbear. When the attention to detail is at a high level the graphics reach an exquisite level and truly add something special to the game.\n\nMore depth than the Mariana Trench: The Quest truly is one of those games that is seemingly easy to learn but difficult to master. There are a ton of skills, abilities and variants that you can and have to learn in order to become a proficient player. However, you do get an opportunity to jump on into the dungeon crawling aspect of the game before you have to learn these types of skills if you already have some prerequisite knowledge of traditional RPG character builds. As you level up you get to put points into character skills and abilities that supposedly make the game easier. This may be at such a small incline that you may not notice very big differences between individual levels but ultimately they do add up.\n\nStop following me: When you realize that the mob that you are facing is going to overpower you they will seemingly forever chase you all over the map. This is particularly devastating when the difficulty spikes are sudden. This starts from the early game and is relentless throughout the game – or what I have played of it thus far. I died quickly and often when I first started playing to the point where I decided to role what is the game’s variant of a heavy armor clad barbarian. I don’t particularly enjoy playing this class but it was the only one that seemed to give me much of an opportunity to get into the game. The clothies and the ranged attackers seemed to get eaten alive.\n\nIt’s a great case study in how to move from mobile to Steam: The final note that I wanted to make on The Quest is that this game was originally a very good mobile game. However, I would argue that it is even better on Steam than what it is on mobile devices. It’s one of those games where I have to imagine that the developers at Redshift believed that their game would ultimately reach the PC format. Had I not been told that this title was on mobile a long time prior to its PC incarnation I would never have guessed that it was a mobile game. I don’t believe it’s fair to call it a ‘port’ but I’m not exactly certain just how reimagined it really is.  However, I can imagine that it was a relatively seamless transition from mobile to Steam. It’s a game that should be considered a great case study for developers looking to make the jump.\nThe Quest is a fantastic dungeon crawler that deserves increased attention from what it has had to date. The $14.99 asking price maybe a little high but not unrealistically so. I would recommend it to all RPG fans.\n\nNote: Elendil from Redshift has corrected me and advised that although the game first appeared on mobiles that it’s heart was always a PC game. However, Steamified maintains that if you are going to release on both mobile and PC that The Quest is an important case study for other developers to follow.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 18","true","42.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You define your class, but you are not bound to it. However, each levelup you get 10 points to distribute amongst your skills.

In comparison, the might and magic games were superior to 'the quest'.\nMight and Magic VI was published in 1998, and is much better than "the quest" and its poor emulation.\nIf you have ever played M&M series (6, 7,8,9, and even 10!) than you will be disappointed with this game.\nIf you have never played M&M, then go grab Might and Magic VI (or the M&M ~ six pack) for less price and much more depth and fun than this 'quest' game. You can buy the Might and Magic games at GOG.\n\nAs far as the Quest, its not a very good game. Feels like a student's project. It lacks everything and falls well below any current standard.","May 30","false","24.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The old school charm, combined with gorgeous graphics is a winning combination in anybody's book. I would probably give it a perfect score, except for one thing, that I think folks out there should know about. Although the game itself is damn near perfect...at least in my view...the forum is a completely different animal. I brought up one point about the game that did not make sense to me. Anyway, when I made the post (hours ago)....it is yet to appear on the forum. In fact, I spent over an hour looking at posts, and I never saw one negative post. In this age of sometimes rushed games, and different systems....I find that highly suspicious. On "EVERY" other forum, that I have ever been on...the posts were put up either immediately or very quickly. I wanted people to be aware of this, should they run into problems, and Heaven forbid, need to look for an answer on their forum. It is very disappointing to see such a great game tied to such a bad forum.\nNot allowing constructive criticism and/or bug reporting is not a good way to run a forum. It is not like that here on steam, and should  "especially' not be like that on the game's own website.","January 19","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
