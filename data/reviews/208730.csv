"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riomhaire/recommended/208730/","riomhaire","Oakreef","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riomhaire/","563 products in account","This game was largely panned and I'm sure if you want to hear about what's wrong with it it won't be hard to find negative reviews, but this is all about why I loved this game.\n\nI heard going into this game that it had terrible gameplay but I actually found the combat system very engaging. For the most part it revolves around using special abilities to interrupt enemy attacks, keep them stun locked or provide power combos with status effects. Fighting one enemy at a time is quite a simple task but the game really shines in crowd control: Facing off against a room full of enemies you must be constantly mindful of all of them. One successful special attack against you can turn the tide of the battle drastically.\n\nThere are two main characters and they can be spec'd very differently. Making one a tank and one a glass cannon results in some varied gameplay between chapters early on and once the two heroes join forces later in the game synergy between them can make clearing out rooms of soldiers both efficient and satisfying.\n\nI think the dialogue system is worth mentioning. Instead of simply stating what your character is going to say many dialogue options are presented as part of your characters inner thoughts and, giving you a slice of something familiar from reading the books. Some options are even just two parts of the same thought. "I don't trust him..." "...but I have no choice" are just so much more interesting as choices than "refuse" and "accept" and after a while I found myself reading them in the characters' voices. It's a very elegant implementation of an old fashioned system that shows that actual care and thought went into this game.\n\nStory is were the game really shines though. It's not on the same level as the A Song of Ice and Fire series proper (it suffers from some awkward and sometimes over-expositionary dialogue and poor to atrocious delivery by the actors) but it's a solid addition to the franchise and as video games go it's terrific.\n\nAs already mentioned there are two main characters: Mors Westford is a sworn brother of the Night's Watch and a secret skinchanger. Alester Sarwyc is the heir of noble house who left Westeros to become a Red Priest. Their stories start off seemingly entirely separate but as the game progresses their stories begin to converge both as you learn the connections between their current situations and their past history together.\n\nDespite being old friends Alester and Mors are quite different from each other with motivations and world views that are very much at odds. Alester is quite pragmatic and willing to stoop as low as he needs to to reach his goals. Mors is more driven by a sense of justice but also a rage that is always bubbling under the surface. When the tensions between them come to a head it's one of the best moments in the game and the voice actors (particularly Mors's) actually manage to summon up some real emotion to their performances.\n\nThe intrigue itself is complex and slowly revealed with many twists. These are twists of the good sort; they take you off guard when they happen, but once out in the air you'll slap yourself for not having seen it coming (though admittedly some are a bit obvious or otherwise cliche).\n\nThere is some conflict with the source material (some of which can chalked up to gameplay necessities and some not) and there are a few moments where the story falls flat. But these are rare enough and stand out because they contrast the largely good writing. If this were a tie-in novella rather than a video game I would have been as glad to read it as I was happy to play this game (though I'd expect some the dialogue to be brushed up a bit and the body count drastically reduced).\n\nThe game is a diamond in the rough but I would recommend that anyone who is a fan of the franchise and a fan of WRPGs should at least try it out. I'm sure many of you have it sitting in your library unplayed after the game's inclusion in a Humble Bundle.","November 25, 2013","true","30.6"," 153 of 179 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","153","179","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/208730/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","A great mature RPG.\n\n+ Very good, tight, quite lengthy and powerful story (with a fair amount of twists and multiple endings)\n+ Interesting main and side characters\n+ Good (sometimes perhaps a little too strict) to very good voice acting (and plenty at that)\n+ Nicely written, believable dialogues (there are light dialogue trees too)\n+ Thick character and world lore (accessible to people new to GOT by codex/encyclopedia pages ingame)\n+ Nice music (composed by the TV show composer, it seems)\n+ For fans: Familiar places (King's Landing, The Wall, ...) and cameos (Joer Mormont and Varys have their looks and voices from the TV show)\n\n~ Combat can feel easy/underwhelming for perhaps 1/3 of the game. For some time I was wondering why I should care about what abilities to use even if it's always been fun to do so. Your character automatically attacks a random target or one you choose, with you moving him around if you will or by using active skills that use stamina or have a fixed cooldown. Sometimes my foes stood no chance even if I let my characters just do basic attacks. A few parts aren't winnable for story-reasons. I don't know anymore if you select a difficulty and which one I might have chosen. It got more interesting halfway through when I was able to utilize different skill sets and characters (usually two at a time) at a regular rate (it changes for many parts for story-reasons, which I am welcoming, it shouldn't subjugate to the gameplay mechanics, this game should be mainly about it's characters and the story and it is).\n\n~ Character development/gear usage seems a little strict. Depending on your very first choices in the game your character is set on a rather narrow path regarding the weapons and armor he should use. This can be important later on because there is a "rock, paper, scissors" system in place that encourages you to use specific armor to counter specific enemies and, on the other hand, use specific gear to fight specific enemies. Upon leveling up you can put skill points in other, "unusal" weapon/armor areas but that's not very wise since it requires more points to get those up and you cannot use any skills for weapon sets unfamiliar to your class. So, for example if you choose a class using two-handed weapons and heavy armor in the beginning you will want to stick with just two-handed weapons and heavy armor for many parts even if you should loot or want to buy one-handed and lightly armored gear, and even if you should encounter enemies that use equipment that literally works like scissors to your paper-based gear. You can use everything at any time - but you won't be very effective. Around halfway through you can select a secondary class where things get truly interestings and where you can actually mix things up without feeling like being on a disadvantage.\n\n~ Should you get ideas to fight random mobs to level up unusual/inexperienced areas to redeem for the lacking bonuses/skills: That won't work. Because enemies aren't randomized. Cleared areas won't have enemies spawn unless the story wants to. Not even random brigands or wildlife or something. This can add to the immersion in some ways, for the very least makes post-combat exploration easier (the two main characters have special skills to find hidden objects) and there are plenty of enemies to fight and good numbers of quests to do before you reach the end of the game, and if you stick to the class and thus weapon/armor selections you made early on you'll probably have no serious problems getting through this game. But straying off from these pre-defined leveling paths may leave you very vulnerable later on with no other way to deal with it but bite yourself through it.\n\n~ Combat can be a little mess at times, particularily indoors with the camera not getting a good look on things. Not too dramatic since you have a pause button that almost freezes time when issuing commands, but still. The straightforward/head-on mechanics don't work well if you for example try to shoot someone with a bow from an elevated position as I tried in King's Landing. It would trigger a mass rush of all allied and hostile characters to clash into each other around several corners with my bowman having struggles to follow after.\n\n- Some more face models and clothing may not have hurt. The main and some special side characters aside most other characters can look a little generic, even if they are never really unfitting by looks or voice. It's not too dramatic but more often than not you'll see the pretty much same gown or rags on female characters, at times same faces even, and would have hard times to differ between some side characters if not for their varying names and voice actors.\n\n+ That being said, those characters for which the devs had more love/time for really look nice and impressive, with scars and veins and freckles and such. Overall the game is nicely-looking and very immersive even if it won't sate the high-res texture junkies. And it has a clear and nice interface and runs very stable (thanks to the Unreal Engine, I guess) even if I had some odd mini-freezing when turning the camera around some places but that might be my relatively old system and not the game.","August 1, 2015","true","66.8"," 88 of 91 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","88","91","4","1"

If you like good RPGs, you will want to consider playing this, regardless of if you care about the Game of Thrones franchise or not.  That said, this game does a pretty good job of tying into the first book/season; so if you are a fan, it certainly adds to the experience and helps you appreciate the rich story in the game.\n\nThere are several mechanics that contribute to the high quality of the game as an RPG.  You play as two characters, back and forth, each with separate stories that inevitably collide later in the game.  The game is very heavy on cutscenes and plot development, but it is done well and is generally pretty enjoyable.  There are dialogue trees you will explore during the many conversations in the game, being thorough and inquisitive will often reward you with items or little permanent trait boosts.  There are decisions to be made, which will have minor consequences (like extra rewards for quests from NPCs); there is also a major decision late-game and a few different endings.   There are active abilities you can use while exploring out of combat to discover secrets in the world.  The combat is active, but has a tactical-pause which can be utilized to issue specific commands and tactics to your character(s).  There are a handful of fighting styles you can pick from for each character, and you also get other party members that will have various styles which will spice up combat here and there.  There is definitely a good amount of substance, and it makes for a very enjoyable RPG experience.\n\nThe story is enjoyable.  And for a game so story-driven it better be.  The plot of the game is a “sidequel” to the first book/season— that is to say: it takes place during the same time and in the same place, but follows a different set of characters/events.  I think the writers did a good job of creating an atmosphere pretty true to Game of Thrones.  If you are a fan of the books/show you will probably be intrigued by the story in this game.\n\nThe game does have some flaws.  The graphics are not as great as they could have been.  The voice acting is mostly solid, but at times feels forced.  There is limited variety to gear/weapons, and the combat does get repetitive even though the fights are distanced with cutscenes.\n\nIn summary, Game of Thrones is a very enjoyable RPG.  It does have some flaws, and may drag at times, but seems to be well made (no bugs/crashing) and tells a good story.   It has plenty to offer for fans of RPGs, and if you are a fan of the books/shows you will enjoy that added bonus.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 2, 2015","true","26.8"," 117 of 133 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","117","133","3","2"

If yes, then it is a no-brainer that you will like this game big time. It is also heavily underrated, so this one is a hidden gem. While it has some cheap mistakes, this game still deserves your attention.\nThe STORY[10/10] is one of the best I've ever known and I red a lot, seen a lot of movies, so yeah it's quite something. There are two protagonists: Mors Westford, who is an honorable man in the Night Watch and a mounstruos beast in combat. He has a dark past, lives in a cold place; you could say he's iron made. Also, he's a skinchanger, being able to control his hound. The other one, Alester Sarwyck, a Red Priest who can manipulate fire, who comes back to claim his title and land as a lord, now being ready to face the world he fled from. The villian is the evil-cunning-great fighter type, whom you'll want to kill the moment you see. Every key character ends being involved in the Game of Thrones, so things get brutal and the happy ending... up for debate.There are many sidequests that enhance the story and reward you with cool items(and experience).\nThe GRAPHICS[6.8/10] look outdated, but maxed out looks nice, and the artstyle is attractive. The real problem is reusing models, which means sometimes you'll have triplets in a cutscene. The main characters and all the places are unique, though, so work and clever thinking was used in the design as well. Such a shame it doesn't use better technologies, would have been a lot better for a lot more people.\nCOMBAT[8.9/10] is made as tactical, but as you'll progress in unlocking stronger abilities, you'll synergize with the battlefied, emerging victorious, without much thinking. Finishers depend on the class and weapons used, and both differ greatly from what you have at your disposal. I enjoyed combat and class exclusive abilities that I have a reason to replay the game. The downer here is the difficulty, if you play on Lord you might be stressed a lot, and that can happen on Knight too. Best you choose the Squire, since there is no achievment affected by the difficulty.\nAll in all, it's a great RPG with high replayability value. Don't listen to the bad reviews, because those reviewers didn't even finish the game. It gets better and better as you play, so giving up on it is a bad decision. If you've watched the show you should check it out; if you've red the books, you should own it; if you're new to the series but like RPG's, the same for the book readers(if it's on sale, after all it's your risk).\nGAME SCORE[8.5/10]","February 11, 2014","true","45.0"," 98 of 120 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","98","120","0","0"

THe writing is excelent, but everything else goes from anywhere between decent and weak. The graphics are sub-par, the music is forgettable and the voice acting goes from excelent (a couple of the actors in the series worked on this and deliver good performances) to mostly plain and laughable... Shame, since excelent acting would have helped the already excelent plot.\n\nNow the combat... the combat is like most tactical RPGs (think Dragon Age: Origins for example), but it gets pretty plain and repetitive quickly due to lack of characters to form different parties.\n\nBottom line is... if you're looking for a good story, sure, get it for a decent price. Otherwise, there's other RPGs out there that do it better, be it graphics, gameplay, voice acting (and also have excelent stories to boot).","August 4, 2014","true","7.8"," 86 of 104 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","86","104","0","4"

The game has some good ideas and potential but if felt like once everything started to come together it just ended.  Now I have never watched the game of thrones so my review is going to be purely based off of the game play.  I got over small things like the camera angle being horrible and your actions not really effecting the outcome of anything.  The game is very restrictive and you will follow a  certain path no matter how you choose to play your character.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat is a turn based/real time format.  It was very fun and I would recommend watching a youtube video to get an idea of what I mean.\n\nSkills:\nThe game does a good job of explaining these but you will learn that if you spend your skill points on certain skills you have wasted them.  The biggest of these being the one that effects your buying/selling skill. I invested most of my skill points on this skill and then a few hours in I realized there was no way I would ever be able to buy any of the gear so I would never use this skill. (at least not until the end of the game, and at that point you'll start to get so much money you could buy everything twice)\n\nEconomy/Gear:\nDo not plan on doing anything with buying/selling.  You will never have enough money to buy better gear until the very end of the game.  At that point it becomes completely rediculas and money is basically being thrown at you.  Just plan on looting and wearing that gear.\n\nWhy I'm NOT recommending:\nThe biggest things that made me decide to not recommend the game is that you put all this time into developing your characters skills, finally get enough money to buy some decent equipment, and then the game just ends.  I was left going why did I waste all that time planning and training up?  I should have just sprinted through the game play and listened to the story.  Also once the story ends your done, there is no going back and replaying things your just finished.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you just want a story this might be your game.  Do not spend to much time planning out your skill tree's or traits or anything else about your character because in the end you will never get to use your thought out plan.  Play this game to just hear the story and nothing more.  I personally didn't find the story all that amazing but that does not mean you wont.  If you buy this game set the difficulty to easy and just sit back and enjoy the story.\n\nThank you for reading my post, I hope this helps you to decide if this game is worth it for you.  Either way enjoy your gaming.\n\n\n","September 13, 2015","false","59.9"," 74 of 92 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","74","92","2","2"

If you have a soft spot for these sort of games then I believe this one deserve a humble chance. You will play as two very different characters in different time frames until you reach a point where they will meet in the story. The game offers you a lot of content to read and if you are a fan of the Books or the TV show this will be something you will simply should keep on your radar. There is a vast amount of Lore regarding the cities and the people who live in them, the religion or their beliefs as well, the characters and the different house banners and so on.\n\nThere is a lot of talk so I found this game to be very relaxing to play in a nice session after a long, tiresome day. You answer the questions by choosing one of the possible outcomes and they are written in first person. From the main quests to the secondary ones you will be faced with some choices to be made. Some will decide the faith of people, others will let you seek revenge or prove that you are merciful and fair. Expect to be a lot of political games where even when trust is earned you should always suspect everyone, after all, everyone wants their share of wealth. I did some of the secondary quests but not all them. They are mostly focused in side stories and are not boring at all as opposed to those fetch quests where you need to gather ingredients or something similar. Usually, it’s about someone needing help, recruiting members to the Wall, see why someone did something or seek more information that can be useful for you in the future.\n\nThe main story is divided in Chapters which offers a great time frame if you just want to play bit here and there. You can start a chapter and be done with it, get some rest and on the next day advance a bit more. I admit that as I was advancing in the game I got surprised more than once for the outcomes I was facing. This is Game of Thrones so you should always expecting deaths from those you love or care while playing the game. Trust no one and remember to not follow only your heart as you might be betrayed for being too gentle.\n\nThe combat is slower than any other similar RPG but it can be tactic as well during combat you can open your Abilities wheel and select what moves or skills you want to do. The game won’t fully stop but you will enter in a very slow motion giving you time to make the best strategy for your enemies. Different weapons are good or bad depending on what sort of armor your enemy is wearing. A heavy armor is resistant to swords since it can’t be pierced but are weaker to blunt weapons so pay attention to this in order to end the combat quicker.\n\nThe way healing works is also very creative in my opinion. You can get some flasks but they will be empty. Then, you will have to go to a store who sell potions in order to fill them with what you desire. You can fill them with poison, oil in order to burn your enemies and other healing herbs and medicine like the famous milk of the poppy. You can replace already filled bottles with other things if you desire. This is crucial for some harder fights and will help you in the long run.\nThe voice acting however is very poor, especially in the sad or dramatic scenes. During certain critical events I really tried to let myself get immersed by the things that were happening but the poor voice acting broke the immersion I was trying to achieve. That often used moment of “Noooooo!” is rather embarrassing and anger, sadness or fury moments are not strong enough to make some scenes more believable. It’s a shame because a game with such emphasis on story elements you really want to feel the tension you witness when watching the TV series or when reading the books but I’m afraid that sometimes this simply won’t do. You will notice some voices from the show like Varys the Spider but even with familiar voices, as soon other characters start to talk in a more emotional sense it won’t feel immersive. As for the normal and non-emotional conversations I believe it’s more than doable.\n\nThe visuals are also nothing to be amazed but this did not bother me at all. I played the game at 1080p and while it’s nothing to be stunned about I noticed some really nice details like when you are carrying a shield in your back and you see the scratches in it or the reflections of the sun in that golden lion shield from the Lannisters. While this is not a game to be played for the visuals I also saw my fair share of people trespassing doors, my dog getting his head between the iron of gates and other small glitches. Nothing game breaking, you just see that it’s something that could have been more polished. Because it’s in the deep of the lore that you will find the bigger satisfaction I ended up ignoring these small technical issues and I focused on my decisions, the stories and most of all, the outcomes based on what I said or done.\n\nIf you are a fan of the theme then I believe this game deservers a fair chance. It took me around 20 hours to finish (one of) the endings and I know there’s some replay value if you wish to see a different ending in the last couple of chapters.\n","May 13, 2015","true","21.7"," 48 of 53 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","48","53","0","0"

Once you get through the introduction and preface scenes in the beginning of the game you are no longer playing as a character in some game but you feel as if you are transformed into the main characters and you forget that you are playing a video game.\n\nSomeone obviously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the cornflakes of all of the major game reviewers right before they gave their opinions of this game. It was blantantly obvious they did not play more than 30 minutes of the actual game and the rest of the drivel they wrote came from the pamphlet that was inserted into the box. The little bit of the game they did play, it was quite clear that they were not paying attention to the story being unfolded or the characters they were playing because all they could do was complain about the graphics art not being up to their "standards" and how the combat system took actual strategy and forethought in order to win a battle.\n\nThe story line itself was captivating and full of constant twists and turns. Nothing was as it appeared to be throughout the entire gaming experience and by the time you reach the end you are blown away because NO ONE saw that ending coming. Unlike many rpgs out there that try to create the illusion that you are making the decisions for your character that matter in the world around you, this game actually does make all of your choices have consequences. Sometimes they are immediately revealed and other decisions that you thought were trivial end up drastically changing major plot lines throughout the game. While it is a colossal cliche it applies to this game whole-heartedly, "I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me."\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that deeply enjoys real rpgs and is starving for orginality and complete immersion into the rpgs they play. While this game was not on the same financial budget as say Skyrim, it is a testament to the developers of this game that they spent all of their energy and money into making a quality game that surpasses any of the blockbuster games that have been released in the last couple of years.","November 6, 2015","true","82.9"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","50","59","0","0"

R. Martin's - "Game of Thrones" books. If you read the books or watched the TV series of "Game of Thrones", then you might enjoy it more than those who will go into it blindly, because you will miss the whole story surrounding this fantasy world. Story takes place in the timeline of 1st "Game of Thrones" book.\n\nTo not spoil the story, I will only state that characters you play as are not in the books, nor TV show and are made up, but game itself follows the books. You will also hear about and meet many well known characters that appear in the books / TV show.\n\nMoving forward on to the actual game, story is strong, with A LOT of dialogues and choices that will reward or punish you, depending on what you chose. Voice acting is great and includes some voices from the TV show, but not many. You can chose character stats, skills and preferred fighting style, be it shield and 1 hand, two 1 hand, 2 hand or ranged weapons, basically your generic yet somewhat limited RPG.\n\nGameplay is tactical and static, you often just stay in one spot swinging weapon and using skills, then after you kill someone, you automatically run to next enemy, etc.. Combat reminds me the Dragon Age series. Visually game is nothing impressive and has a lot of low resolution / blurry textures, basic level design and good share of loading screens inside one location.\n\nPersonally for me, the story was the strong point here and if you do side quests and explore you are looking somewhere around 20-30 hours of gameplay, depending on your difficulty level and dedication.","August 15, 2015","true","22.5"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","34","36","0","0"

Admittedly the first few hours of the game were boring, and i was close to quitting a few times (the only reason i didn't was because i was being stubborn), but after getting about half way in, i found myself actually having fun. That isn't to say that this is a good game, it is more of a enjoyable bad game. I know how odd that sounds, and i don't fully understand it myself, but for some reason i eventually got invested in the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen next to them. The gameplay itself is average, but the story is nice. Mainly since the game does let you make choices that affect the story(which am a sucker for). Now with all this being said, I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone else. I just felt it should be noted that the game isn't horrible, but it isn't good either.","November 28, 2013","false","19.5"," 73 of 100 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","73","100","2","0"

So there's the slowdown ability for you to take strategic decisions in combat, and you (usually) have two characters that you control. One is focused on crowd control and healing, one is focused on one-on-one fights and stealth.\n\nAnd all of this is set in the Game Of Thrones universe, which I like very, very much. There are (side)quests to finish, secrets to find, people to fight, all the while following two interesting stories that come together near the end of the game, which should take you 15-20 hours if you play normally. If you rush it's a few hours less, about 12-15 hours.\n\nThe graphics are good, faces are a bit messed up and out of date though, and same of the environments lack finer detail and variety. However, the atmosphere is accurate.\n\nThe voice acting is mostly solid. I heard a few sentences here and there that were spoken without any passion. Nothing major, but it did detract from the experience a bit. The music, on the other hand, is excellent.\n\nGame Of Thrones is a good game, that could've been much, much better with a little extra work and polish.\nIf you don't know Game Of Thrones then I suggest you skip the game (but you will miss out on the better stories, mind you), otherwise give it a try. You probably won't be disappointed, but let's see what Telltale Games will come up with first. I have high hopes for their game.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]","March 2, 2014","true","13.6"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","35","43","0","0"

But I don't agree with most of them so it seems!\n\nThe story is amazing, especially if you're a big fan of the books and tv-serie. You'll recognize a couple of people in-game (Jeor Mormont, Varys the Spider, Cersei Lannister) and people (NPCs) are talking about other characters of the books around you when you walk through the world.\n\nYou play with two characters at once, you'll switch between the two characters every chapter, like in the books. Mors Westford is a knight of the Night's Watch and Alester Sarwyck is a Red Priest of R'hllor who is returning home (Riverspring). The two stories come together in one of the chapters and you'll play with them at the same time (you can switch between characters in the gameplay).\nYou can upgrade skills (different types of swords and armor), special powers (Light of R'hllor and Skinchanger), attributes (like intelligence, strength, agility) and choose different perks.\n\nThe gameplay took some time to get used to. The thing that bothered me the most is that you use the right mousebutton constantly throughout the whole game; to press it all the time to move the camera was kinda weird.\n\nAlso the combat system needs some time to get used to. It's kinda turn based. You choose some actions/perks in a row of actionslots (three) and hope to counteract the things your enemy does. It gets pretty hectic sometimes when you got 5 or 6 enemies against you and two characters to command with actions for both to think of. But after a while it gets pretty easy if you get the hang of it, big fights become easy if you know which enemies to take out first and which action counteracts their actions (Interrupt, area damage) and which weapon is best against their armor.\n\nYou have an huge endless inventory, where you can choose the right armor and right weapons and right potions/poisons for you, or sell and buy new ones at the different merchants found in the major cities.\n\nLots of sidequests, lots of places to look for loot, just a couple of bugs which are easily resolved by restarting the game.\n\nIn my opinion a 7.5 out of 10. Maybe not worth the full amount, but great to get on Sale.\nTook me about 28 hours to finish (with a lot of just standing around and listening to people around me and looking for loot).

Martin's world is incredibly ripe for all kinds of game genres but one of the most obvious is certainly the RPG - enter "Game of Thrones: The Role Playing Game".\n\nUnfortunately GoT is lacking in quite a few places. While the storyline is fairly on par with what you'd expect from the novels Cyanide Studios chose to create a game that looks and feels like it should've belonged in 2003. The combat is more or less the same model found in KOTOR, the graphics and visual design are severely lacking polish and modern standards, and the voice acting (aside from the contributors from the HBO series) is laughable at best.\n\nOverall the game has an interesting story to tell if you can stomach through it's many shortcomings.

The characters are worthy of the show and the voice acting, especially for Mors (one of the two characters you play as) is fantastic.

First they wrangled the rights to make a series of Blood Bowl titles, even after the notoriously protective Games Workshop launched a lawsuit over Chaos League; and then they somehow wound up with Game of Thrones.\n\nPlacing such a huge property in the hands of a relatively small developer comes with its attendant problems. A lack of budget afflicts this third-person RPG like a creeping malady, working its way into almost every aspect of presentation  and eating away at the positive work being done elsewhere. But while a larger developer with big-money backing might have ramped up the spectacle, their natural inclination towards more conservative storytelling may have resulted in a more straightforward tale than the one presented here.\n\nGame of Thrones has several problems as a game, but its major strength is a story that largely succeeds in interweaving with George RR Martin’s established narrative while not overstepping its boundaries or drifting into awkward fan-fiction territory. Its plot runs parallel to the events in the first book of the series and HBO’s opening TV season, so it’s fairly important that you’ve read or watched at least one of those. If not, the endless scheming and counter-scheming of powerful medieval-fantasy Houses could be a touch on the confusing side.\n\nCyanide’s Game of Thrones introduces two new characters who pursue goals that are ‘off camera’ for the books and series (though a few established faces; Queen Cersei, Lord Varys and Jeor Mormont do show up). Both of these newcomers fought for the Lannisters in Robert’s Rebellion against King Aerys II and both now find themselves in circumstances quite different from feudal military service. Mors Westford is a grizzled old crow of the Night’s Watch, while Alester Sarywck is returning to his birthplace in Riverspring as a Red Priest.\n\nThese two are an unusual pair for a videogame; older, morally compromised men with a rigid honour code (Mors) and a new-found religious enthusiasm bordering on the fanatical (Alester). For a little over half the game you alternate between playing as Mors or Alester, before the pair meet up for the concluding chapters of the tale. This interchange is handled well and works as a structural device in-keeping with Martin’s ‘point of view’ chapters in his books.\n\nIn another unusual step for the videogame narrative, these two ‘heroes’ have very different aims and ambitions. As do the two main antagonists, whose mendacious plotting and back-stabbing is for contrasting ends. Again, this is just as it should be for a series which prides itself on ethical grey areas and the pragmatic demands of power.Unfortunately, this robust story rope is frayed to near breaking point by some abysmal voice acting and uninspired level design.\n\nOur two protagonists are not really to blame, nor are the HBO guest voices; but the supporting cast bring a collection of performances ranging from flat to borderline unlistenable. That includes an ill-advised, in-jokey appearance by George RR Martin himself.\n\nWeak deliveries, misplaced emphasis and terrible, wandering accents are just some of the delights the cast of Game of Thrones has in store for you. If it weren’t for the halfway decent talents of the main pair and Varys’ splendid cameo appearances, I’d have recommended simply muting the voices altogether. It doesn’t help any of the actors that the lines appear bereft of any kind of post-production Foley treatment. These are the sounds which add convincing background effects when a character is, say, stood in a snowstorm versus inside an echoing castle hall. Here, no matter what the circumstances, everyone sounds like they’re inside a cozy sound studio.\nThis poor voice acting undersells some reasonable dialogue and gives the story a cheap, unconvincing feel that it doesn’t really deserve.\n\nThe cramped level design works for areas like Castle Black or the Sarywck seat of Riverspring, but fans of the series will probably have a hard time believing that the city of Kings Landing outside the Red Keep consists of about five merchants and roughly the same number of streets. None of these iconic places are really done justice by the developer’s less than impressive use of the Unreal Engine 3. For a series with so many worthy sights to offer, far too much time is spent in boring, dank underground tunnels.\n\nWhen not wandering around narrow streets, playing voice-acting Russian roulette, or warging into Mors’ dog for some scent-chasing pseudo stealth sections, your time will be spent in combat with the various Wildlings, sell-swords and Knights who populate the realm.\nThe combat system owes a fair bit to older PC-centric RPGs where pausing the action and issuing orders was the norm. Here, time just slows to a crawl rather than pausing outright, but the process of assessing your situation and queuing up relevant skills remains just the same. Mors’ and Alester’s skills are class-dependant (you choose one of three classes for each character at the start) but every path can deal out useful debuffs along the lines of ‘immobilised’, ‘stunned’ and, best of all, ‘on fire’. Each armour type also has a weakness to a certain type of weapon, so it’s worth paying attention to that when fashioning your tactical plan. Finally, a limited number of flasks can be filled with various concoctions to aid your characters or hinder your foes.\n\nIt’s a sturdy system, offering just enough tactical fluidity and challenge to force you into thinking your way through each encounter. The actual animations which play out with each skill are fairly wonky and awkward, but the intent is there and the combat succeeds in finding an interesting compromise between real-time and turn-based approaches. It’s not quite revolutionary or deep enough to remain interesting for all 25 hours of the campaign, as you hack through rank after rank of increasingly familiar men-at-arms, but new abilities (obtained through levelling up your characters) keep things fresh for longer than might be expected.\n\nThere are no dramatic branches to the storyline (at least until the finale), but choices you make throughout the chapters do tend to be reflected in dialogue or little set-pieces later on. Help a chap out of jail, and his gang might lend their support to you. Imprison some rioters in your dungeons and they’ll still be there later on. My only gripe with the narrative pacing is that it all begins to go wrong slightly towards the end, when Mors and Alester can suddenly fast-travel between locations in the North and South. This feels especially silly when you’re presented with  a couple of side-quests many miles away from your supposedly urgent, time-sensitive mission and are able to complete them as if nothing is amiss.\n\nPC users should be warned that the game offers only the sparsest of graphics options, so delving into the config files to whip the Unreal Engine 3 into a shape of your liking is pretty much mandatory. Like everything else about this game, you have to put up with an unpalatable surface to get the best out of it.\n\nThere’s no denying that Game of Thrones will test your tolerance. There are so many negative idiosyncrasies and cost-cutting measures in place that you’ll probably start to wonder when the game will just fall part entirely. But it never actually does. In fact, it stays on course to deliver a compelling parallel narrative to the opening book and HBO series, with characters as morally ambiguous and events just as horrific as any from Martin’s pages.

Martin) If you are not familiar with neither the book nor the series, despair not. The game still offers an immersive story and enjoyable gameplay for you. Maybe it even sparks interest of yours to discover why it is so popular and give a chance to either the book or the series or even both.\n\nProlog\n\nThe game starts on the northern part of the Seven kingdoms located on the continent called Westeros. On this very place the continent is divided by the 700 feet high wall built 8000 years ago and guarded by an antient order called Night's Watch. The first hero is Ser Mors Westford sworn brother of this order, a ranger able to track almost anyone with a help of his dog. One day a letter arrives with a special request for Mors about protecting a woman sent north. No reason just this, the letter was sent by an old friend of his and arrived with a bunch of soldiers dedicated to find her. Something is not right here and Mors was allowed to go for that girl and find out what is that all about.\n\nThe another character is a former southern nobleman Alester Sarwick who just arrived home for his father's funeral. After 15 years in exile in Essos, where he became a red priest of the Lord of Light, he came back to find his home in depression and poverty. This used to be a prosperious center, what could have happened. After finding out that his brother Gawen was disinherited and his sister Elyana has been betrothed to their half-brother Valarr, Alester makes an underlying decision to stay and help the things sort out.\n\n++ Story\n\nAs you've seen the story is divided in two parts, following acts of two characters which at the first look are separated by far distance and have nothing in common. However their past and future are bound together. How? I guess you will have to find out for yourself if you want to know more.\n\nThe story is the best part of the game. It has action, twists, heartbreaking moments, shortly everything you desire. In addition it is very detailed and can offer you closer look into this universe, its history, society, places or significant characters. It's achieved mainly through archives of Westeros which you can collect during gameplay and afterwards read in the Codex in the menu of the game.\n\n- Choices\n\nEven though the dialogs offer you many options your choice doesn't really matter. Only once you have a choice which influences the end of the game. I've tried reaching both endings and the difference is only in the ending cutscene and last 2 minutes of the game. Exept this its the same, so I don't see any point in playing this game twice and trying different playstyles.\n\n- Combat, Abilities and Skills\n\nSince you can play for two characters in one fight you are able to control both and it's reached genuinely through quick switching between them and using their abilities during "slowed time". Being able to slow time in order to time attacks and maximize the efficiency is a gentle solution and enables finishing the game even on the hardest difficulty (as I did). It is entertaining, but as the game develops it's all the same again and again.\n\nWhen we are talking about choosing capabilities, which you take in the abilities tree, choice doesn't really matter. You will be using only a few and most of them are useless to you. As usually you will get through with stun and damage ones. Skills improve your proficiency with particular weapons or effeciency of an armor you use, so easily you know what to pick. Another thing is that during gameplay you can obtain some traits improving your character, increasing hit chance or deflection for example, but only with a minor impact.\n\nThe last thing to mention here is the level cap. It can be reached only at the end of the game after you have finished everything possible in the game. So in conclusion only usefulness of reaching it is gaining a steam achievement.\n\n- Semi-open World and Side quests\n\nThe game plays out on a few locations of different sizes. As a whole this world is tiny and you can't miss much in it because you come back to every location so many times it is almost impossible unless some exceptions which are sealed after finishing a chapter.\n\nDuring gameplay you can meet only few side quests in the advanced phase of the game. These will bring you again on the locations you have been before and most of these tasks are solved by tedious dialogues with different types of people or fighting which is then more tiresome than entertaining.\n\n6.5 /10\n\nI would recommend this game only to those interested primarily in the story. This is a nice completion for fans of Game of Thrones, but as I have said before even others may find this game interesting and enjoyable.","February 15","true","39.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

Game's story is unpredictably interesting and doesn't stoop to merely rehashing the familiar tunes from the books, but it carries their tone and atmosphere perfectly into an interactive medium while its two protagonists are some of the most layered characters I have ever played as in any game and as a result it's incredibly satisfying to watch their grim tales unfold over the course of the game, all the while bringing the story's peculiar framing into foreground and delivering one of the more compelling experiences in recent years. Sadly, this is where the other side of the coin comes into play - game's technical and mechanical aspects are questionable at best and a mess at their worst. One glance at these graphics will tell you they weren't where the budget went and the sound department didn't fare much better, VA suffering in particular with not even the main characters managing to avoid the brunt of the damage, for the most part. It's clear the voice talent wasn't given much direction to work with while they were delivering their lines and this vague design philosophy carries over into other things like somewhat archaic combat and arguable direction when it comes to gear design, secret finding and other systems.\n\nI should point out, bold and underline that I still enjoyed Game of Thrones immensely when all the good and bad is tallied at the end because, in my opinion at least, game's strong story and narrative manage to FAR outweigh it's technical shortcomings. If you enjoy a story with an edge that doesn't hold back any punches and without the proverbial knights in shining armor, this just might be the game for you.","August 30, 2013","true","22.6"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","27","37","0","1"

Having already watched every episode at least 10 times, and with the new season months away, I found myself desperate enough to buy this game, one which I had passed over many times because it looked like your typical crappy tv/movie-based game. And that is exactly what it turned out to be, but against my better judgement, I heeded the mostly positive reviews here and bought it. What a mistake.\n\nEverything about this game feels like a complete afterthought. Everything from the combat, to the leveling system, to the gear just feels poorly designed. And no, this isn't me just complaining about how the game LOOKS bad...graphical quality is not particularly high on my list of priorities, even if this game does look like its from the early 2000's. It is difficult for me to pinpoint in this review exactly what is so poor about the gameplay because my answer is simply: everything.\n\nAccording to many of these reviews, the story is the best aspect of the game and it is what makes the "meh" gameplay worth it. While I am inclined to agree that it is the strongest part of the game, that isn't really saying much. The story is fair, but certainly not good enough to warrant the cost unless it falls to $5. My suggestion would be that if you really want to check out the story, save your money and just watch the story via youtube videos. Each time somebody buys this, it further justifies to game developers that they can continue to get away with churning out these steaming piles of garbage.\n\n","January 26, 2015","false","12.1"," 36 of 59 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","36","59","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/208730/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Game of Thrones is a real time RPG set before the events of the show but will eventually go up to Season 1 of the show. It has you controlling two protagonists, one a Ranger of The Wall called Mors Westford  and the other a self exiled heir to a powerful lord of the south called Alester Sarwyck. Each have their own inventory, money and skills which you will have to constantly manage. The game is mostly linear but has a few side quests here and there but will expire once that chapter is over. It does feature a few characters from the show that play vital roles like Queen Cersei and Varrus along with some well known locations like Kings Landing and Castle Black. Neither area are impressive though and Kings Landing feels like a tiny town instead of the capital of Westeros. If you are unfamiliar with Game of Thrones the game does feature a lot of codex entries to help fill you in.\n\nLet me start off with talking about gameplay. It is pretty simple, you auto-attack an enemy when spotting them but pressing the attack button is much more effective as it cause more damage and its a lot more likely to connect the blow. Then  you can select an ability and a menu opens up causing the action to go into slow motion to give you more time to select them. Which sounds alright but the fact that you usually fight by yourself against multiple enemies will cause you to quickly get bored since you have a limited set of moves and will be relying heavily on the same few moves with little chance to vary it up. The targeting system is very clunky and will flat out refuse to work at times causing you to take unnecessary damage as you are unable to target the archers that are quickly draining your health and to further annoy you enemies strikes can hit you even if you are a couple feet away from them and they strike air. I feel combat would be a lot more enjoyable if you had a party like most games of this genre but as it stands it feels very tedious.\n\nOnce you reach level 7 you can choose another fighting style which has it's own set of moves which is very welcome so you can experiment with a few more ablities. The game also features light stealth  sections in where you take control of Mor's dog and enter a first person mode to pick up on peoples scents and hunt them down. You can take out enemies by sneaking up behind them and pouncing on them to rip out their throats which is fun at first but for some reason they found it necessary to make you mash a button when doing that which gets annoying fast. Alester on the other hand has an ability to spot hidden items but the animation of it takes quite awhile to finish which makes it annoying to use too. At one time you are required to go on a scavenger hunt searching for seven keys around Alester's castle which just felt like lazy padding but luckily after that you can solve the games only puzzles which were pretty enjoyable.\n\nGraphics are very outdated and the major areas you explore are tiny and unimpressive. On top of that the amount of times they reuse the same models is absurd. Every piece of armor looks different and it is pretty fun mixing and matching the armor sets to your liking. Enemies all look very similar minus the sigils of their lords on the armor and shields which isn't really a problem since the fantasy stuff is near non existent in this game. The user interface for the inventory is pretty bad since it is difficult to compare equipment and weapons, armor,potions, etc are separated into different tabs which make it even more of a hassle. Also when selling at vendors the items you have equipped are in random positions with only a tiny icon that has your face on it which may cause you to accidentally sell your best equipment. Another issue I would like to address is that the mini-map is very confusing to understand and you have to be practically on top of an item or location so that you know where it is, though there is a map in the start menu which is much more useful.\n\nSound is a mixed bag. The music features the main theme to GoT and some other fitting music which I find enjoyable but loops a bit too often. Sound effects are just average, they do the job. Now this is the worst flaw of the game, the voice acting. Holy cow, with the amount of dialogue in this game you'd think they would atleast try to make it decent but nope. The only characters with decent voices are the ones from the show, the rest are terrible. They all sound half asleep and sound so monotone that it really damages the story in this game. It makes the world and adventure seem so boring hearing how everyone talks like the world's most underpaid documentary narrator. None are capable of of showing emotion, they yell “No!” the same way I would from arguing with Siri on my phone while high on meds from a blow to the head.\n\nStory starts off with the most evil looking protagonist called Mor's as he does a few missions for the Night Watch and eventually switches to Alester who has returned to Westeros for his fathers funeral. Both are really interesting characters (with bad voice acting) and the events that happen to the game will eventually effect both of them. The story in this is surprisingly important and is capable of changing all of Westeros to keep it vague and spoiler free.  It is pretty cool playing as a character with a looked down upon religion and wish they would have done more with it other than a few characters hating your guts because of your beliefs. They do an excellent job at getting you to despise the villain in this game and became my main motivation for wanting to beat the game considering the main story was rather uninteresting until later on. About 3/4th into  the campaign the story suddenly becomes very good and will have you hooked until the awesome end. It was a rather surprising and welcome change, it's like if the writer's boss found out he spends most of his workdays playing Minecraft or something and replaced his computer with a typewriter.\n\nThis is one game I spent a lot of time wondering if I should recommend or not. It isn't broken and runs fine enough it's just so boring until much later on. It doesn't do anything well other than build up the main characters but even that is negatively effected by awful voice acting. And it is rather tame until the 3/4th mark which is strange considering how gritty and violent the GoT universe is. I'd have to say that if you are a huge Game of Thrones fan wanting to explore parts of Westeros and wanting to see a story not involving the Starks and Lannisters then feel free to give this one a shot.","January 11, 2015","true","23.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

Just being in Westeros is a big deal and it's nice to meet characters that you already know. The story has the right feel. The graphics, while not spectacular by current standards, are enough to convey the required look and mood.\n\nUnfortunately, the game play is abysmal. The combat mechanics, in particular, are downright painful and completely break the immersion in the battle as you have to fight more with the UI to do anything meaningful than you do with your opponent. I do like the "active pause" mechanism, where action (and even speech) continues in slow motion rather than stopping completely, but that's part of what breaks the immersion. If you want any chance to win your fight, you can't do it in adrenaline-pumping real time. As an option, "active pause" would be phenomenal. As an obligation, it sucks. And once you're in combat, you're locked in place with your opponent. You can't back down, move sideways, or go to a tactically better location. The only thing you can do is to change target. This  is even worse as an archer. Once you start shooting, the game decides where you stand. You can't seek cover, even partial cover. You just stand there in the middle of the combat field like a big idiot while enemies either shoot at you or charge you, at which point you can switch to a melee weapon.\n\nAnd then, there are cut scenes. Billions and billions and billions of cut scenes! While the cut scenes are interesting, they're too long and too frequent. If they wanted to make a movie, I would have gladly bought the DVD, but what I wanted here was a game.\n\nInteraction with the world is also painful. You can't interact with most things and the only way to know that you can interact with something is when you're nearly on top of it and an obnoxious glowing icon suddenly appears over it. You can't talk to most NPCs, either. Unless they're a merchant or a quest giver, they're basically just mindless decorations. Even the ones you can talk to have no variety. They will repeat the exact same phrases over and over and over. You can't get into most buildings. You can't pick up objects that are on the ground. That beautiful sword on the ground? Forget it. It's just part of the backdrop. It might as well be a painting.\n\nBasic movement is also incredibly primitive. We're talking Doom grade primitive. You can't jump and every drop is protected by a forcefield that prevents you from falling, even if it's only a couple of feet. You can't crouch or change speed either.\n\nThis final point bothers me personally, but some people might like it, though I can't begin to understand why they would. If you chose to play with the controller, the controller becomes the only thing you can use. The keyboard and mouse seem to be completely deactivated, except for the arrow keys when navigating a menu. Maybe they just wanted it to really feel like a console port.\n\nSo, if you're a Game of Thrones fan, you're kind of in a bind because you will want to play this, if only for the story and the chance to meet some of your favorite characters or to visit some of the locations. But if you're not a GoT fan and are just looking for a good RPG, walk past this one.","November 2, 2014","false","1.6"," 73 of 130 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","73","130","0","0"

(yes, stealth is also a mechanic in this game).\n\nA.I ; ( 6/10 )\n1) Enemy A.I - They are challenging because each has different type of armor and weapon.\nThe come in groups so you will have to combine strategy and tactics to defeat them.\n2) Character A.I - You control your A.I (ofcourse because it's a rpg fantasy game) just like in Of Orcs And Men.\nEach character has different abilities and different tasks. (control the dog of Mors or the soldier of The Priest).\n\nOverall ;\nIf you enjoyed games like Of Orcs and Men and Divinity you will find common combat system like in Orcs and Men and similiar rpg elements like in Divinity.\nYou will enjoy the gameplay, cuz it's also repetetive as you can play in different classes, different builds/skills and making your character be a ruthless heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a good "governor" for the people of Riverspring.\nBut if you've watched the show and expect the characters from the show and storylines from the show, you are to be mistaken.\nYou should give this game a try cuz it's unique and good as it is.\nThanks for watching this review.","November 27, 2015","true","38.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

Personally? I enjoyed it. Immensely in fact.\n\nLet me caveat that, first.\n\nIt was crashy during the first few hours. I nearly quit several times. The combat system is annoying, mainly because every time the player gains a new skill, when using a controller, the old skills shifts slots on the dial thus meaning that combat can never be played with muscle memory. That may be less of a problem when using k/m. The combat was no great shakes due to that time-slowing mechanism [geez if yer gonna have pause-based, have pause-based, going half-azzed is just silly] but this game, like Torment, isn't so much about combat as it is about what that combat reveals about the story.\n\nA common complaint was the graphics. Okay, I get that...this game is not $60 however and I really have no problem with dated graphics so if you are expecting Skyrim you will hate it. If you like older games played for their plots and characters the graphics probably won't bother you.\n\nI don't understand the complaints about the voice acting. I thought the two main protagonists fit the story very well. Other than the odd unimportant NPC--it was adequet to decent voice acting all the way through. I've played games with far worse vocals, for sure.\n\nWhile the villains of the tale are rather generic, the main characters [you, as the player, play two of them] were deep, inspired characters with flaws, vulnerabilities and strengths.\n\nIt has replayablity from the perspective not so much of outcome but of revealing more story. If that's what you're into--then it provides that experience. It also provides the choices of changing the skill sets of the main characters if desired.\n\nThe Writing:\nThat's where this game shines all the way. It's deep, complex, dark and compelling. I was driven to finish it because that story drove me on from start to finish. It opens up questions on the nature of responsibility and making difficult choices, honor, family, committment, etc.\n\nI am going to recommend it because at this price point--it IS an enjoyable game to play for a couple of days and while many of the complaints about it are valid--it is far more interesting than many AAA titles with better graphics and bigger budgets. Remember, when this was made, nobody was quite sure that GoT was going to be the huge hit that it became so this was farmed out to a smaller, less expensive developer. It feels to me as if the devs were cut off what they really wanted to do with this game due to budgetary constraints and as such, did the best they could under the circumstances.\n\nAnd for all that--it IS worth playing and I would recommend it.","September 29, 2015","true","60.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I kept thinking to myself, this has got to be the end, and to my surprise, another chapter unfolded.\n\nThe combat is very simplefied, you mainly need to keep track of your characters health and to target enemies. Not very hard at all.

Alester is royalty, while Mors has "taken the black", living a life alongside an army defending all mankind from any and all threats that may lie beyond an enormous ice structure known as "the wall". The motives of these two characters differ on many important points, and this game is a journey to discover how their paths affect one another. Knowledge of the TV series or books is not a prerequisite to enjoying this game, but it certainly is a perk.\n\nNow, I seriously discourage anyone from buying this that has a habit of skipping cutscenes and dialog. Cutscenes and role-playing dialog are more than 50% of this game’s true content. It’s essentially an interactive 25+ hour movie, written by George RR Martin himself. The story is deep, the acting ranges from passable to superb, and it all absolutely ties in to the lore of the TV show.  You make dialog decisions that can and will affect the outcome of the game, and in many cases, affect the outcome of your present mission.  Almost every fight can be talked out of, if you care to figure out how to calm the person you’re speaking to.  Adversely, you could tell the angry person to shut their mouth and prepare for a beating, if you wish.\n\nCombat is cool-down style, and fights can be slowed down to bullet-time to make tactical decisions, which you will be doing A LOT.  Auto-attacking will get you killed, period.  You must use buffs and special attacks which are unlocked with XP, which is gained by completing missions, discovering new areas, and defeating enemies.\n\nStandard RPG fanfare such as inventory, loot, bartering, side-quests, open-world exploration, hidden items, character leveling, upgrades, stats, potions, and armor & weapon slots are all present as well.

If you can get past uneven production values and shallow mechanics, there's quite an interesting tale to be woven here, and the cinematography of shots and angles in the scenes is a standout.  Some interesting combat mechanics and an atmospheric soundtrack help elevate it from merely mediocre in my opinion, but if you wanted to self-insert you own characters into the universe of Game of Thrones as I did, this one will disappoint.

It has one of the more detailed, involved and believable stories among games of its level. It starts off slowly, but gets really gripping towards the end. The way they took the stories of two different characters and meshed them together really works. The game's story runs concurrent to events in the main GoT storyline, which is also great if you're a fan.\n+ They didn't bill this game as one that provides many decision choices, yet there are a surprisingly decent amount of dialogue and character choices. It doesn't change the main story outcome very much, but definitely changes some side quests etc, as well as the feel of the story.\n+ Lots of GoT lore throughout the game (optional for you to read), and I love that they include weapons and armor of famous characters from the main GoT story.\n\nCons:\n- Biggest flaw is a graphic bug that I could not find a fix to. All suggestions I came across did not solve the bug. Very often (in 'walled' surroundings) when panning the camera, it skips madly, making it impossible to face / run in the right direction, and causing a huge amount of nausea. Its the main reason why it took me so long to finish the game. Granted, this bug does not occur for everyone, so it's just a risk you have to take if you decide to get the game.\n- Voice acting could have been better. Most of the time the characters (aside from Mors) sound either flat or fake. Better voice acting would really have helped make the story so much better, given the already good storyline. Alester also sounds a bit flat at points, which a main character really shouldn't.\n- Combat is also very cumbersome. You have to 'pause' the game to use abilities, which makes combat rather slow, and constant toggling between characters to use their skills is a bit of a pain.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend the game, unless you're the kind that absolutely hates graphic bugs and will trash the com in a rage. Given the price, and how good the story is, I'd say go for it if you like detailed stories, or if you're a GoT fan. If you're not so much of a fan of GoT / RPGs, or are hesitant to risk getting the bug, then wait for it to go on sale and then get it. Because it'll certainly be worth it on sale.","September 10, 2015","true","150.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Finally,today i have a free time to write a review about this game.\nFirst of all i tell you that i'm a biggest fan of Game of Thrones . I have all 6 books and i read them all already. I read them in 3 months or a bit more . I have seen TV series . And everytime when i'm reading,watching i have sort of fire inside.I mean that i imagine that i'm in book ,in this story ,and i feel of sorry for heroes of this. I don't know why ,but I always feel sorry for them. So , about this game.\nI need to tell you a few words.\nWe will start from pluses:\n+good story\n+ kinda of open world ,looks sort of.\n+new heroes,story\n+ voices\n+ you can feel sense for heroes more than in film or in book .\n+good nature around you +sounds +you can take equipment,what you want to see on your hero\n+ a lot of swords,armors,etc .\nWhen i was playing ,i couldn't stop for a while. I had to know more,i had to play more, I forgot about time.\nAnd now about minuses of this game:\n- awful gameplay ,i mean it hard to play the first time.\n- difficult control of the game\n- combat looks very strange and when i had the first battle ,i wanted to  unistall this game .\nBut how you can see,i played it a little and i really enjoyed that. For instance,i had a life with heroes in this fantastic world.\nCan i recommend this game?- hm,i don't know. If you have a good nervous system for this game,and you recognized about all minuses and you want to play,just do it.\nFrom my point of view i can give this score for game : 7/10.\nThank you for your time.","January 25","true","80.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It nailed the ASOIAF aesthetic really well, and is beautifully grimdark. It also starts slightly before a Game of Thrones and so sheds an interesting perspective on the first novel, Jon Arryn's troops get a look in for example.\n\nCyanide/Spider make the same sort of game (Of Orcs and Men, GoT, Mars War Logs and now Bound in Flame which I haven't played). They all have very original, adult(a 15 year old boy view of adult anyway) worlds with a dash of humour and underlying grimness. If you like one you'll like them all, and vice versa if you don't.\n\nThe downsides are twofold: they are very unpolished, not buggy which they get called, but not the bioware level of sheen that people seem to expect. They also have a similar, although evolving combat style. In Orcs this was very uninteractive and quite hard, it slowly has become slightly easier and requires more player involvement. It got quite fun in Mars with a dodge roll but in GoT it is a bit slow and mainly comes down to maxing out knockdown/cc skills and then unloading damage on stunned enemies.\n\nThey are quite oldskool RPGs in feel, with talking and world development and slightly arcane fighting. GoT was advertised as being an rpg for GoT fans when really it was a GoT game for RPG fans if that makes any sense.\n\nBasically if you like 'proper' rpgs and you like ASOIAF you should give it a try, the beyond the wall dlc prequel is particularly good.\n\nAnd the special edition with all the dlc is cheaper than the base game so buy that, the beyond the wall dlc is brutal, and well worth a play.","February 20, 2014","true","38.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What really impressed me was how the story progressed and really chocked me sometimes, there's always going to happen something that you did not expect.\nOne thing that really bugged me however was that the choices you make (and you'll be making alot) didn't have that much of an impact in the story, it felt like they added choices just to have more dialogue.\nAnother thing is the voice acting, Some are good, Some are bad, Most of the time when characters talk to eachother it feels more like they're just saying their line instead of actually talking.\n\nThe combat is also something that could have used some more work, I found it hard to effectively switch targets in realtime and some abilities are just overpowered. However they did make it alot about interupting attacks and combining attacks between characters which I really enjoyed.\n\nOverall I would say that the game was definatly worth the money and time and I would gladly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of Game of Thrones or RPG.","February 21, 2014","true","37.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mors is more of a badass with a violent surface a soft core and most people will probably like him more then the other potagonist who tends to care more about status, family and his city. I won't go into spoilers but there are a bunch of twists throughout the whole game, a few expected ones but overall quite enjoyable. The pacing is often good, but some chapters seem a bit too long and tedious, especially if you want to see more of Mors this will be quite annoying at times but it is ok. There are still enough interesting things that keep it going.\n\nCombat\nIf you know games like Dragon Age you will be quite familiar with this. you can pause (here: slow down) the game and activate skills to kill or interrupt enemies while adding states like stun, bleed, poison etc. on them. There is a cast bar for any skill or action you take, so anticipating moves is often required. A random aggro system is there that depends on damage dealt and there are skills to provoke enemies, but apart from that they often seem to attack randomly. There is also an armor system with different types of weapons having a greater effect on certain type of armor, combined with the ability to switch weapons this makes for a very good combat system - on paper. Effectively this is pretty pointless, as the damage bonus is always the same (15%) and there is no penalty. In addition you would of course need another weapon and the skill to fill the second weapon slot, apart from that you have 3 weapon types but only 2 weapon slots (unless dual-wielding). Add the fact that light armor grants low health and heavy armor high health in general what makes it obviously more beneficial to invest into things that increase damage against heavy armor, the rest dies anyway. There are also criticals, deflection and dodge effects, but I will come to them in the next section. Basically everything your character can do, the enemy can do as well, except for instant interrupts (only the interrupting part is instant, those skills still activate like any other).\n\nCharacter Development\nThere are multiple things that have to be considered: attributes, abilities, skills and traits.\nAttributes directly influence your characters stats, like damage or health. An important point is that upon creating your character you can already maximize 2 attributes and set one at 8 (of 10) considered you keep 2 stats at minimum. As you gain attributes very slowly (5 over the course of the game) this takes a lot of momentum from your progression, because you amost cap effectiveness (of attributes) upon creation. There is also some kind of discrepepancy between the (pretty much exclusive) resistance mechanics, deflection and dodge vs health and damage resistance. As abilities always hit once they activate deflection and dodge will not help anything against them, to counter those you would need abilities to interrupt (some ability trees have little to offer there) and enough energy to cast them, so you will probably need to invest a lot into intelligence. After deflecting you still take damage and you can only dodge after a deflection (there is one ability that changes that slightly) so you will still die unless you have someone to take all aggro from you.\nAbilities are aquired by investing points in a chosen tree. There are at most 2 trees that can be acquired, the second can be either another weapon stlye tree or a specialization of the first. Some are more useful than others but the majority is balanced. There are some serious issues with trees failing horribly in certain situations, like Mors' Magnar tree only having one costly interrupt that can be dodged unless the enemy has low health, while the defense tree offers way more for way less. It should also be noted that ablities seem use weapon damage, NOT dps, thus slow high damage weapons seems to be the better choice here.\nSkills are the ability to use a certain weapon or armor. Skilling anything where you don't get a bonus is pretty useless as you waste too many points. You will have enough to max a weapon of choice and your armor of choice, depending on intelligence even two weapons/armors may be possible.\nTraits can be choosen and acquired through the game giving small bonuses to the character. most of them are pretty balanced, but there are some issues here and there where it would seem unfair (if you knew the other bonus at least).\nYour progression will be pretty slow at the start and only picks up when your are about lvl 7-8 because you get another tree and level up more quickly after that. you are able to  (iirc) pick all specialized abilities and all but 2 standard abilities upon reaching max level, so you should choose which skills you do not need.\n\nDiffculty\nThe easier difficulties will be underwhelming. You don't need to think much there, often enabling buffs and just letting them kill everything works. Lord is challenging but I see certain builds that don't stand a chance here. There is also a "cookie cutter" strategy where you just focus the enemy with the lowest health, kill him and move on, as most enemies do the same amount of damage (unless they use an ability that has to be interrupted ofc). This gets a bit tedious later on, as you essentially always do the same. another option is having both charcters pick up AoE skills and nuke the group until only the big ones are left standing. Buying weapons early will make this even easier.\n\nFairness\nAs stated above some builds won't stand a chance in certain situations, this only holds for Lord diffculty however and you can just tone it down for a short time, but that itself is not a good design choice. Some dialogue choices are also unfair, offering certain quests or similar things where you really can't expect it. There are no major issues here but some small things that may annoy you if you ever find out about it. Another bad thing is that at three points where you can decide to undertake a more difficult approach, be it attacking without killing sentries first, not taking an escort or clearing the more dangerous part of the castle. Seriously, if they don't want you to do this, then they shouldn't add that option, as these things are very frustrating on the highest diffculty.\n\nItems\nNot much to say here, loot is pretty balanced, you get a ton of gold though and can buy anything without problems once the more valuable stuff drops. Every drop is scripted so no surprises there. One issue is the high drop rate of two handed weapons, that seems wasted, as there is only one tree that can use them at all.\n\nQuests\nVery interesting quests, at times a bit linear but the conversations are what this game is about. The side quest are really great. Good characters and you almost always have some kind of choice that changes the outcome (mostly kill someone or not or whom to side with but sometimes there are other benefits).\n\nDesign\nThe atmosphere and design of the locations are very well made. There was one door in King's Landing that couldn't be opened at all so you always had to run around (often running into a deadend) so that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off severely.\nApart from that, they did a good job.\n\nStyle, Interface\nInventory, character screen etc. are pretty basic. It is very easy to get used to it, and everything is easily accessible. But the minimap designer should have been sent to the wall. It can't be called "map", because you do not see any layout only relative distance to points of interest and it's not even locked. Very bad choice here. Another thing is the sheath/unsheath animations at the start/end of battle, staying in battle mode (adding a key to enable/disable it) would haven been way better.\n\n\n\nOverall decent game, but way too many minor flaws to be anything more. They should have taken more time.\n7/10","July 29, 2014","true","38.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The story follows two original characters, Mors Westford and Alester Sarwyck. Both characters are sanctioned, and yet lack a lot of the flare of the characters from the book series. That said, those who like watching the show will find they are fine.\n\nThe unreal engine isn't utilised to its maximum capacity, however, it is more than adequate for those looking for an interesting story to parallel the characters they enjoy from the main series. The graphics are fine, but nothing to write home about. There are a few graphical issues here and there, with objects/bodies clipping through walls, sconces, etc. The world design is a little linear, and fairly "closed off," however, there are some neat features like hidden doors and alternative paths that will be discussed later. That said the weapons, armour and body/face art is not too bad, not the best, but still, the graphics utilisation for the characters allows for a deeper emersion.\n\nAs with all RPGs the RPG elements are going to be important. There are plenty of good items, that seem impossible to buy, and some even stay that way, so this makes the game's item dependency fairly well balanced. The character building is pretty good, and probably one of the better features in the game. Both Mors and Alester have 5 sections to do with the character building side of things: Characteristics, Stance Skills, Ability Skills, Stats and Traits.\n\nBoth characters having to choose one of three stances, and getting to specialize in a second or "doubling down" on their original stance at level 7. At the beginning of the game you have to place your Characteristic points much like most RPGs, these should be stacked with your stance, especially if playing on a harder difficulty. The Stance skills give your characters their combat abilities based around their weapons, whereas the Ability Skills give them abilities based on their unique abilities, that is, Mors is a Warg and has a dog (aptly named "The Dog" GG for creativity...) and Alester is a Red Priest of R'hllor. The character's stats affect the armour and weapon proficiencies, however, the stance they choose doubles the points placed one weapon type from each of the three weapon sections, and one armour type, obviously allowing for a more rapid spec, and increasing the gameplays dependence on items. The traits are interesting, as the name suggests, they are traits which have little bonuses. However, the starting traits require a balance between positive and negative effects. That said, as the game progresses, many other positive traits can be unlocked.\n\nGameplay revolves around three central sections: Combat, Narrative and Exploration.\n\nFirstly, combat is not what most might expect from a 3PP RPG, there is no hacking and slashing, no button mashing... Both Mors and Alester (and the odd companion you meet throughout the story) have three orders you can place from amongst various abilities you have, these are placed in a somewhat bullet-time initiated by pressing the space bar. This is pretty cool as it allows the player to assess the situation and look at armour types, etc. Ahhhh, something I haven't mentioned yet, Armour types. There are 4 Armour Classes in Game of Thrones, unarmoured, leather, mail and plate. These correspond to three weapon types, cutting, perforating and bashing. There is a bonus 15% damage increase when using the matching weapon type, so it is important to try and match them. This is also a bit of a flaw, as you are only allowed two weapon sets at a time to switch between and changing items in the inventory is not allowed in combat, this isn’t really an issue, and most combat is fairly straight forward and victory is nearly always achievable without the need for this, but it would have been nice to have the third slot, just to even things out (as clearly it is the intention from the start to have a proficiency in one weapon type from each section, cutting perforating and bashing, yet you will assuredly find yourself sticking with, most likely, only cutting and perforating throughout the entire game). I digress... The abilities you cast/order/whatever, use a mana like resource called energy, this regens at certain rates and can be near fully regened using a restore ability once every 20 seconds.  Combat difficulty scaling is a bit unbalanced, Squire is winnable without any effort auto-attacking will win most fights. Knight will take a minor amount of effort, auto attacking will be your majority of damage which does help with energy maintenance. Lord, however, will melt your face and have you retrying most fights half a dozen times.\n\nSecondly, the Narrative sections are pretty cool, giving some depth to the story and allowing for some player choice responses, much like mass effect or knights of the old republic. These can change the course of the game and unlock traits. This is the main story telling vehicle and allows for some time to sit back and be immersed... unfortunately, towards the end of the game, I found myself fighting to stay my patience at the false endings. My housemate, Paddy, was having a good old time listening to me become enraged at how the game was being dragged out. As for the story itself, it isn't bad. I think that those who are more interested in the TV series would find this more appealing. Initially I thought the other way around, that the book fans might be more interested, however, I realise that the character depth which looked to be developing, fell off the face of a cliff and died as the two character's paths crossed over... making the title more appealing to the TV show fans, as the characters are far less complex. That said, the title IS based off the TV Canon and not the book canon.\n\nThirdly the exploration section has some unique features, but does leave a lot to be desired. Frankly, the world map is tiny... especially for Westeros... Kings landing is smaller than my inner-city apartment, and other areas are equally small... I was expecting far more in this area. There is one saving grace though, MAGIC!! Both Alester and Mors have unique abilities, as a Red Priest of R'hllor and a Warg respectively, that they can use to interact with the environment. Mors can skinchange and use the dog to scout around, find hidden items, track scents and rip enemies’ throats out, which is neat. Alester can use his powers of R'hllor to find hidden items and door switches (usually hidden as sconces on the wall), which is less neat, but you know, we can’t all have overpowered dogs. There are some interesting sections where you have to solve puzzles and find your way around mazes, sometimes being allowed to think outside the box and avoid combat, or at least take on fewer opponents, which gives you the false illusion of free will, in an otherwise very linear, boxed off world.\n\nThis game, whilst not horrible, has some woeful issues. These include world design and extreme item dependency, however, if you play on the easier difficulties, you should be able to carve through the game with little worry. Taking care to remember that this is a semi-cannon game, you won't be playing as Jon Snow, or some other ♥♥♥♥♥♥y character you heart from GRRM's ♥♥♥♥-fest, but you will be given a somewhat interesting storyline that parallels nicely with the first season and first book of the series (thanks to GRRM having input in the script so he didn’t have to retcon the ♥♥♥♥ out of it later).\n\nGG.\n","December 29, 2013","true","194.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Martin’s rich fantasy world. The story takes place just before\nthe events that happen in the First Book and HBO’s T.V. Show Season 1.\nGraphics: ★★★☆☆\nThe graphics are pretty good as are the recreations of the scenes from the T.V. show. The games camera or FOV are too close and feel very cramped and claustrophobic however with a few simple tweaks the game improves immensely.(See Below for instructions on how to tweak your game)\n\nSound: ★★★★☆\nThe epic musical soundtrack from the T.V. show is great throughout the entire game. The voice acting is also done nicely.\n\nPlayability: ★★☆☆☆\nThe gameplay combat is clunky, you set up actions in a three-slot queue, then watch your commands get carried out in sequence. Apart from your basic attack, no abilities are mapped to any face buttons, so you frequently need to pause (though the action doesn’t stop entirely) and pull up an ability wheel to issue new orders..\n\nEntertainment: ★★★★☆\nGeorge R.R. Martin collaborated with Cyanide to create the story and I got say it is as good as the books and will keep you coming back to see what is going to happen next?.\n\nReplay Value: ★★★☆☆\nI feel the game has a good replay value with all the choices you make throughout the entire game which effect how people react to you and of course the end game. Also replaying with different classes adds to a new experience. There are five different endings based on what you do in the last chapter, but the bigger changes occur throughout the adventure as characters are either present or absent based on how you treated them earlier.\n\nOverall Rating: ★★★☆☆\n\nMY PERSONAL REVIEW\n\nGame of Thrones is split into chapters, and control alternates between two protagonists. Alester is a red priest returned from a 15-year exile in the east, and Mors is a skinchanger in the Night’s Watch. Though the two plotlines are initially unconnected, each story arc is full of interesting developments and surprising twists, making their eventual convergence quite satisfying.\nMor’s is a skinchanger so he can inhabit the body of his lovable dog and scare attackers with his mighty bark, or lunge at their throats with its chopping teeth. You can control your dog outside of combat as well, to track the scent of a fleeing coward or squeeze through a hole in the wall, and this adds some diversity to the exploration. The dog also has a skill tree to level up with Mors. Certain animations for  the kill scenes are quite entertaining. In many RPGs, good loot can make some long fought battles worth the wait but that doesn’t happen in Game of Thrones. Nearly all of the good items from shops are unattainably expensive until the game is practically over, leaving you to scavenge for gear suited to your particular armor and weapon specialties. Overall  I feel Game of Thrones is purely story fleshed out through  its two characters as you delve deeper into all its lore. If you enjoy great story telling with a lack of good game mechanics than you cant go wrong with Game of Thrones.\n\n\n\n2 Tweaks I found that greatly improved the game for me are:\n**Turn on Vsync**\nEdit configuration file\nGo to %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Game of Thrones\UnrealEngine3\AGOTGame\Config\nOpen AGOTEngine.ini with a text editor.\nFind a line: UseVsync=False.\nAnd change it to: UseVsync=True to enable Vsync.\n\n**Adjust the Field of View**\nEdit input configuration file\nGo to %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Game of Thrones\UnrealEngine3\AGOTGame\Config\nOpen AGOTInput.ini with a text editor.\nFind the section [Engine.PlayerInput]\nAt the end of it, add the following lines:\nBindings=(Name="F1",Command="FOV 75",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)\nBindings=(Name="F2",Command="FOV 90",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)\nBindings=(Name="F3",Command="FOV 120",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)\nModifiy FOV values to your preference if needed and save.\nLaunch a game.\nWhile in game, press F1, F2 or F3 to change FOV.\n\nHope this helps as I found both work and make the game alot better.\nHere's a link to a video showing the effects!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUydr_NCtyw\n.","January 15, 2014","true","52.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The story is Chapter-based and switches b/t two characters: Mors Westford (of the Night's Watch) and Alester Sarwyck (a Red Priest) - old friends who have not seen each other in numerous years. They are both trying to find a certain girl that some groups and those on or near The Iron Throne are looking for, in this excellent story loaded with a web of secrets, lies, twists, turns, and (of course) conspiracies.\n\nCombat feels somewhere b/t the combat of the original campaign for Neverwinter Nights [NWN] (have control on two party members at once) & Dragon Age: Origins [DA:O] (real-time combat with a pause allowed for strategy). Though, parties you control never get as big as DA:O (even if there are other NPC's who help you and you have no control over) and the pause isn't a full-blown pause - here, the "pause" only slows time here, which makes the game feel more action-like. Once you have more skills behind you, the gameplay certainly gets better and a bit more strategic. The combat here though lacks the flashy & showy nature that made games like Dragon Age 2 just look awesome.\n\nThe graphics technically often come off as dated & looks like they should've been released back when DA:O came out. While some character models & and areas look fine, others who aren't as important often come off as bland and/or are just there. The voice-acting is all over the place, ranging from poor to really good - where most of the best acting comes from either the main characters in the story & also those actors and characters who are also on the GoT HBO TV show (like Varys). Interesting enough, there is an option in the game menu to even mute/turn-off the voice-acting completely. Also worth noting - sometimes, the dialogue might come off a bit stilted, unfortunately.\n\nIf there is anything that this game nails and other companies should take notes on, it's the actual storytelling, characters, lore & GoT universe. GoT: RPG delivers a fantastic story & plot. B/c the game is done in a Chapter-based format & will often hit you with a cliffhanger just like the TV show does, you'll want more - though since this game is complete here, you'll have the feeling of wanting to just keep on playing to see what happens next; or maybe continue even further than that to see maybe even what happens a bit later; or maybe even be compelled to continue even more! Throw on top of this that there are constant jaw-dropping plot twists & even moral decisions for players to make in the main story and even on side quests, this game will certainly keep the player engaged and immersed into the story and actual game-world itself.\n\nEven despite its dated nature in some regards and a bunch of minor issues, that can't stop GoT: RPG from sitting on its very own throne. It's the game's characters, lore, GoT universe, the actual adventure itself, & its lengthy story (which took me somewhere around 42 hours, BTW) that are excellent and certainly do make GoT:RPG as memorable as it is.\n\nFinal Grade: B-","September 29, 2013","true","42.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

Once you get through the introduction and preface scenes in the beginning of the game you are no longer playing as a character in some game but you feel as if you are transformed into the main characters and you forget that you are playing a video game.\n\nSomeone obviously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the cornflakes of all of the major game reviewers right before they gave their opinions of this game. It was blantantly obvious they did not play more than 30 minutes of the actual game and the rest of the drivel they wrote came from the pamphlet that was inserted into the box. The little bit of the game they did play, it was quite clear that they were not paying attention to the story being unfolded or the characters they were playing because all they could do was complain about the graphics art not being up to their "standards" and how the combat system took actual strategy and forethought in order to win a battle.\n\nThe story line itself was captivating and full of constant twists and turns. Nothing was as it appeared to be throughout the entire gaming experience and by the time you reach the end you are blown away because NO ONE saw that ending coming. Unlike many rpgs out there that try to create the illusion that you are making the decisions for your character that matter in the world around you, this game actually does make all of your choices have consequences. Sometimes they are immediately revealed and other decisions that you thought were trivial end up drastically changing major plot lines throughout the game. While it is a colossal cliche it applies to this game whole-heartedly, "I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me."\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that deeply enjoys real rpgs and is starving for orginality and complete immersion into the rpgs they play. While this game was not on the same financial budget as say Skyrim, it is a testament to the developers of this game that they spent all of their energy and money into making a quality game that surpasses any of the blockbuster games that have been released in the last couple of years.","October 19, 2013","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The rpg element of the game doesnt really do that much except unlock attacks, most of which you ignore as you found a pretty effective system at level 10. The Warg parts of the game happen a good part of 3 times, and each one is fairly easy to do, once you unlock the takedown skill with the dog you tend to clear out the entire map with the dog before actually doing anything.\nThe only thing it's really good for is being a GoT game, in which case you get to see about 3 characters from the book/show.

Followed some tweak guides and was able to disable DoF, increase the Field of View and get the graphics more to my liking.\n\nLong story short - a couple of hours in and I was hooked.

The combat animations are simplistic as one would expect from the Game of Thrones universe as it is not as fantasy heavy as Dragon Age. This leaves the combat feeling a bit stale. Fortunately, there is enough variation in the skills effects that in the harder difficulty levels you will have to plan your attack pattern if you want to win.\nIn pretty much every aspect this game falls short of Dragon age origins and the ending of Dragon Age 2 since that was the only good part of that game. It is still worth purchasing on sale if you enjoy interactive stories. This one you can even direct a bit, and your character will even gain new traits according to your decisions.","December 14, 2013","true","24.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is one of the best I've seen in a video game.  However, the combat, controls, and visuals are all pretty much just adequate.  There are a good number of small bugs mainly dealing with the camera and walking controls.  The voice acting is also pretty hit and miss with people mispronouncing names and speaking as if they don't understand the context of what they're saying.","May 24, 2014","true","40.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics may be a bit outdated and there is no open world to explore, but it stays very true to the concept of GRRM book series and GoT. The story is amazing and I wasn't invested in a game that much for a long time since every chapter (it is made like the books in a POV style where you skip between characters) ends pretty much with a cliffhanger. The voice acting may not be over the top (especially NPCs except for Varys and Jeor Mormont who are voiced by the actors), but not that bad.\nThe numerous references not only to the HBO show but also the ASoIaF books make it very delightful for fans. However, the story is the main reason why one should play it. It's not the typical RPG story like "Rescue the World from certain doom" but rather about personal motivations.\nThe gameplay is a two-edged sword, hate it or love it. I found the slow-motion attack selection very refreshing, the abilities of skin-changing and manipulating fire was also extremly creative.","June 25, 2014","true","32.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I say this because there is extensive amounts of dialogue, which I happen to enjoy, as it conveys story, as well as it's strategic combat system and it's lore. When I say lore, I mean that  it's a game about game of thrones, which is my second favorite show of all time. It's combat system is hard to get the hang of at first, unless you've played Of Orcs and Men, because it's quite a lot like that.\n\nIt's also nice to know that If you don't like one storyline that you're playing in the game, there's always the other to look forward to. One storyline is about a Night's Watch Veteran, Mors, and the other is about the eldest son of the Lord of a town he deserted 15 years prior, and his name is Alester. I personally prefer Alester, because he's a more interesting character in a more interesting plot line, wereas Mors is fairly interesting in a storyline that is difficult and honestly somewhat boring. But any reader of this review should still recognize that I've not played much of the game, so I can't truthfully describe each of the storylines and what they are like.\n\nAlester's storyline, so far, is that he left his town 15 years ago because he didn't want to keep being reminded by the past, but leaving emotionally destroyed his father and sister, throwing the town into turmoil. He returns after his fathers death and that's where the player starts, so i won't reveal any more about it.\n\nMors storyline is that he is part of the night's watch, and has been for about 15 years, when his friend he's been with for those fifteen years attempts to desert the Watch, resulting in the consequences that any fan of the show or books will already know. Mors is then put in command of 4 new recruits, who he must take to track down a Watchmen who has broken one of his vows. That's where the player must continue from.\n\nSo far my pros and cons are:\n\nPros:\n+lots of dialogue with mass effect like choices\n+varying storylines\n+interesting strategic combat\n+fairly good visuals\n+moral choices that affect the future\n+cutscenes are skippable\n\nCons:\n-Cutscenes around every corner\n-High prices at merchants\n-Dialogue is a bit wordy\n-Camera mostly restricted\n\nMisc:\n*Doesn't remind you to check character screen when you level up\n*Rarely autosaves- remember to manually save periodically\n\nOverall score:\n8.5/10 - greatly recommended for GoT/ aSoLaF fans","November 1, 2014","true","2.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The story was written by George R.R. Martin himself, and it fits into the the overall story of A Song of Ice and Fire well. That said, the game clearly had a low budget. The graphics and animations are bad, the combat is boring and repetive, the environments are bland, and most of the voice acting is grating. It's almost funny how some of the characters are endearing despite looking and sounding like crap. The one saving grace is the traits system, which actually rewards (or punishes) you via stat buffs/debuffs depending on what choices you make throughout the story.\n\nThis game is almost worth playing thru for the story, but you would probably be better off reading a synopsis or watching a Let's Play video. As it stands, it's a 4/10 pass for this one.","December 1, 2014","false","31.1"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

That's where the game shines, if anything. The story is meant to be somewhat canon from what I have gathered and it's well written, it is grim and intriguing. If you are a fan of the books and the TV show, this game will probably be something for you. It's somewhat of a prequel. The main characters are new but you will meet some familiar faces while you are strutting around in Westeros. It's quite a linear game with a few side quests and a DLC quest, it took me 24 hours to finish the game and that's not counting the DLC. Some of your choices throughout the game might have consequences, which is always a plus.\n\nThe combat in this game is where the game suffers. It felt a bit clunky sadly. The game tries to approach a tactical system that we've seen in Mass Effect and Dragon Age, but it falls a bit flat. I constantly found myself waiting impatiently for the energy bar to fill up so I could use abilities. There are different classes and a lot of abilities to chose from, different talent trees and skill points. However, to me it didn't mean much in the end, I simply lacked the interest in what to skill because of the combat system.\n\nWhat I found great with the game is that when you meet familiar faces you will also hear familiar voices, this is because the actors and actresses from the TV show voice acted in the game. This is a plus because a lot of the other voice acting wasn't up to par most of the time. The visuals aren't great but they're not horrible either. The characters look stale and the lip syncing doesn't make sense most of the time. The game can feel pretty sometimes and it's wonderful to explore known and unknown parts of Westeros, but don't expect the graphics to be as stunning as the TV show - they are quite outdated.\n\nI recommend this game if you are a fan of the books and/or the TV show, especially if you have the patience to endure a below average combat system, simply to enjoy the story.","April 22, 2013","true","24.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This Game runs like a dog on a high end machine (runs skyrim maxed) while having pretty poor graphics. The controls are nonsensical. You spend more time listening to dialog which has no point than actually doing anything. The stats system is awkward. Combat is weird and hard to control. I think I spent more time looking at loading screens then actually doing anything. When I wasn't looking at a loading screen, I was listening to a character preach on about things that have no bearing on the story.","June 21, 2014","false","0.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The reviews of this game were pretty mediocre and I knew that going in, however I thought playing it knowing of it's dodgy quality would somehow make me tolerant of it's shortcomings. I was wrong.\n\nIn the main, it was the voice acting and dialogue which killed this game for me, I just couldn't get over how bad it is. Does that sound snobbish? Perhaps... but when every conversation had me wincing internally...  I knew I wouldn't be able to plough through this game.\n\nThat said, in my opinion I think the combat  is actually worse. It is a kind of real time, MMORPG style combat reminiscent of World of Warcraft. You queue up actions and attacks with special abilities taking up "energy", while standard attacks can be laid upon your enemies forever. There is no blocking animations or reactions to being hit, they just chop and hack away at one another until one falls down... very much like the early MMORPGs.  The only difference to the formula here is you can hold in space bar to slow the game down to a crawl, like a real time active pause.. should you feel the need to do so.\n\nSpecial attacks might hit multiple enemies or add a status effect like "stun" or "bleeding" but it is really unsatisfying. Those of you who like that kind of combat...  I'd say you should still steer clear of this. I played WoW for years and believe me when I say whatever itch that game scratches with it's combat... Game of Thrones doesn't.\n\nThese two elements alone were enough for me to abandon Game of Thrones only a hour in. Some may argue I hadn't given it a chance... but to be honest first impressions stick with me when it comes to games, mainly because there are just so so so many others in my collection that I could be spending my finite free time on. Perhaps that is shallow...  but I suppose I'm so long in the tooth as a gamer now, you just know when a game isn't going to improve.\n\nSo be warned... Winter is coming... but you can spend it indoors playing a lot better games than this.","November 25, 2013","false","1.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

I will give the game credit for being bold enough to try a new type of gameplay, however, it was perhapse to0 bold. The game becomes unplayable when its graphics are turned up past the default; while it doesn't cause lag, it causes characters and objects to look like swiss cheese, with polygons missing from the model, allowing you to see through it.

Very very linear, with maybe a few distractions/sidequests, but mostly you run in a straight line and hope that you built your character right because you can't go off and grind on things to get more powerful. The dialogue was unengaging, the story tried to really hook me but has failed to keep my attention by the repetitive and soul-less voice acting. Calling this a budget RPG, or an RPG, is using the term very loosely. The leveling system looks like it would be interesting, but the skills do little unless you put a lot of points in to them (a LOT). I chose one of the character's classes (a Water Dancer), just to have it so down the main storyline I have to wear medium armor. Sure, I can wear light armor still by just re-equipping it, but if I use light armor, everything kills me very quickly. I thought, "Well, maybe I can just get some better lighter armor". I have yet to find a merchant that even sells for cheap enough for me to afford. I can't go out and grind for XP and money, I'm stuck on these rails. Finally I ended up getting stuck in Chapter 4 because everything kills me very quickly (mostly, archers). I even tried turning down the difficulty, and I still get killed just as fast...\n\n\n\n\nThis game took no risks, and it feels like a mix between The Witcher and Dragon Age: Origins, with all the good story, choices, and fun combat taken out. They put you on rails, failing to deliver a compelling storyline of any sort, failing to let you truly explore the world to your leisure. Every time I try to get in to the story, I just become disgusted with another thing this game does wrong. Don't buy the DLC, don't buy the game, unless you have a real obsession with the Game of Thrones universe. I'm glad I got this crap in a humble bundle, it's not even worth a fraction of the $2 I spent.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Some things I forgot to add: There is no character creation. The most customization you will get is your choice of equipment and most of the other weapons don't even show in the cutscenes. The choices you do get to make during dialogue honestly don't matter that much. Let me put it this way, if you played Dragon Age Origins, loved the choices, then played Dragon Age 2 and went "Euuugh, smh", that's about what I felt with this game's dialogue and choices.","June 3, 2014","false","5.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The leveling mechanisms are copypasta from various RPGs of the past, but seem rushed and somewhat abitrary in some circumstances.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not convince myself to continue far enough for the main plot to unfold, so there may be some hidden redeeming value that I am yet unaware of.\n\nAll but the most dedicated RPG fans who also love Game of Thrones will probably be disappointed.\n\n3.5/10\n\nReasonable Price: $3.99","December 23, 2013","false","0.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I also do agree the price is a bit high but it does include DLC so at least when it goes on sale I highly recommend grabbing it (as I did).\n\nThere are some generally fine features in the game such as the actual RPG elements (you even get the feel your choices matter), the story is interesting and gives that whole Game of Thrones vibe many seek from this game (also I think even people who have not read any books or watch the series can play and enjoy this) and voice acting is overall very good but some characters do seem to suffer from the monotone book reader syndrome. What comes to graphics they're pretty decent but just like any good features mentioned above they do lose to many other games if you start to compare.\n\nI also do think some of the features are quite unique such as your characters special skills (hard to explain but you can use a dog for tracking for example). I haven't completed the game and I'm writing this review after 3 hours (2 chapters) so I'm not sure what to say to the claims on the game being too short but I personally like how you switch between main characters every now and then.\n\nNow like said, I also do understand why some people don't like the game much: it's whole battle system is quite flawed and very tedious especially for the veteran players who can compared it to better systems. It's mediocre and typical skill system (minus the mentioned special skills) doesn't seem to help the situation much either. You do get a lot of choice in weapon types but it can be more confusing than fun as many weapons are not labeled as they should be (this is merely my personal opinion). I also think how you select your attacks in battle feel very much like if you're playing a online flash game of sorts and that cheapens it a lot. I can tell they did try think out of the box but instead of getting out of the box they just jumped into anothert one.\n\nBut like mentioned above, I do recommend this game (especially for GoT fans and others who love a good story) if you can grab it from a sale because while many including myself enjoy the game... it IS very mediocre in this sea of modern RPG games you can pick from and the chance you can't overcome it's tedious system is quite high.","March 19, 2015","true","3.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

But if you can go through the first 10 hours of the game, you will want to finish the game. because YES this is a fantastic narrative and you will reap your rewards in the end.\n\nYou will need a dose of patience, this game filters off casual players, it has terrible gameplay mechanics and expensive high end weapons, the levelling does not help either. The lighting in the game is too dark for my taste and and if you use a controller like me the minimap disappear!! The interface can be frustrating with its dial-select options. But you will forget about all that as you progress in the game. It has some moments, dark humour, tragedies and satisfactory voice-acted dialogues (I must warn you, there are a lots of cutscenes).\n\nThe game bears similarities to the moral choices pioneered by Starwars KOTOR as well as the pauseable combats.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackDJ/recommended/208730/","jackDJ","DatFrog / Beauharnais","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackDJ/","107 products in account","The video game industry has received a great deal of attention from the Game of Thrones fans recently with the release of the Telltale's Game of Thrones game. It was the opportunity for me to test another video game based on the tv series/books. This one, developed by Cyanide, was released in 2012. Here's my review:\n\n(See rating at the end of the review)\n\n____________________________\n\nGAMEPLAY: Game of Thrones is a very classic RPG in terms of gameplay. It's a third person action game, which reminded me the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series. The offensive and defensive options are divided between melee attacks, magic powers and potions. Magic skills and sword attacks must be combined to be efficient, which forces the player to stay active during the fighting parts. In addition, it is important to use your companions as often as you can. In order to make this easier, it is possible to use an "active pause system", which on the one hand makes fights more tactical but on the other hand slows them down. So nothing new in terms of gameplay, but it works.\n\nVISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: On this aspect, this could be way better. Cheap graphics and poor voice acting (except for some of the main characters) kinda ruin it. In a way, the game is close to the world of the books but it doesn't really recreate all its beauty. And it becomes quite annoying because the game is not focused on fighting but on the story of Westeros and its background. The soundtrack and some of the artwork are from the tv series.\n\nSTORY: This is the good aspect of the game. The story, which happens just before the death of Robert Baratheon, is fictional but totally fitting with the books. It is full of choking deaths, revelations and secrets, but also clear of manichaeism - in others terms, the good characteristics of the books. There are many twists until the ending scene, which serves as a narrative climax. The story is really the key point of the game, and while it is well written, the huge amount of dialogs could be disappointing for some players.\n\nLENGTH: Quite good. It probably takes between 14/16 hours to finish the game without hurrying youself, which is neiter too short nor too long. You can probably add 5 hours if you want to complete all the extra quests.\n\n____________________________\n\n\nGameplay        3/6                Visuals, music and atmosphere        2/6                Story        5/6                Length        2/2                -        -                Global Rating        12/20\nEven if the game stays true to the books, it is limited by low production means and a lack of originality. The game is still entertaining but doesn't match the books's quality.","December 19, 2014","true","18.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

On a side we have one of the best storyline written in the last years of videogames, and the other side an atrocious hollow, boring and laughable gameplay mechanics.\nIf this was delivered more like a telltale game (the walking dead, wolf among us and so on) this would have been a spectacular 9/10.\nBut since this game is depicted as an rpg it fails BIG TIME.\n\nThe combat system it's absolutely b.u.l.l.s.h.i.t. You cannot prearrange any sort of tactic to take care of your companion I.A. so everytime you want to use a special ability you have to switch to your companion character and make him use the ability you want to.\nThe enemies are divided in 3 types: cloth armor, leather, mail and plate. Each of these are weak against a certain type of weapon (cutting, smashing, perforating) providing a 15% bonus damage when the proper weakness gets spoiled fighting the right enemy with the right type of weapon. All good right? Nope.\nBecause infact you can equip only  2 type of weapon at time. Ok, you can equip 4, but there's no point in doing it, because the 15% bonus wouldn't make up for the fact that you're not skilled enough to use that weapon, so you will end up missing more than hitting your opponent. So you'd end up picking two type of weapons to specialize in and stick to them, making them level up once every level (you will be able to rise the skills to a max of 100, for example you want to get good using two hands swords, you'd rise the swords skill under the cutting tree of the weapons)\n\nIf you manage to get through this (especially in the first few hours of the game, i'd say atleast six) you'll be rewarded with a fantastic storyline, and at times yes, it will make up making you almost forget all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game brings to the table. Ah, and i wished (except done in some cases) they'd use much better voice actors, some of them are coming through seriously flat, which is a bugger since this game has such an elaborate and fine storyline to tell. Atleast some of the were good.\n\nThis could have been so much better if instead of trying to "milk the games of throne cow" it would have been properly give its time to develop gameplay wise.\nI'm hoping in the telltale game coming later in 2015. If that game will have on par storyline with this, i'd consider it as a The Walking Dead (season 1) contender.

You have to constantly click the middle mouse button to center your view, or hold down the right mouse button while you run around, which disorients me quite fast. The camera is directly over your shoulder, so if you happen to turn around without using the mouse to orient your camera, you can only see your face and behind you.\n\nCamera controls are so basic to any game, I'm shocked they don't at least have an option to set it to automatically follow you at least. If they fixed that one glaring issue, I'd whole-heartedly recommend this game. As it is, I am still enthralled enough I'm going to keep trying to play it and hope they add camera controls. I doubt I'll be able to play in large doses, though.

The release in 2012 would imply a better package of graphics and combat smoothness than we get here, both these elements are around 4 years behind the times (as you'd only expect with UE3-made titles).  For comparative purposes, this should be viewed as a peer of games like Gothic 4, Witcher 1 (also built on UE3) and Risen 1, they have a lot of dubious qualities in common, such as slow, affected dialogue to expand apparent game time, NPCs drawn from a limited stock of character skins, and more.  You can get through it by plodding carefully and muzzing through early quests and objectives which are just a bit dull, like chores, and winning valueless "achievements" which you'd get by playing the game normally anyway.  The combat can be clumsy and frustrating unless you painstakingly control every single blow, but this becomes a nonsense when selected team-mates can't reach selected targets due to obstruction by other team-mates and overcrowding.  This just smacks of an ill-considered game, where certain shortcomings weren't ironed out during beta testing -- if indeed it was ever beta tested.\n\nSome characters are made to look like the actors in the TV series, and like-soiunding voices are used, but that's where the similarities end -- on the voice subject, you'll quickly realise the dialogue was recorded at many different sessions, and not sequentially, making it sound like bits cut out of radio pla\ys and pasted in, with mis-matched environmental reverb and rather disgruntling emphasis-flow.  Plotlines have little bearing on either the books or the TV series, its just an adventure game set in the Westeros world; this will either disappoint you or delight you, depending on how you see these things.  We must remember this is a game, and games have a very different set of rules, especially RPGs, where options are granted and choices can be made -- often not the choices we're pushed into making, or the choices made on TV.  I just think it's a cheap shot at a tie-in, with below par graphics and a very "generic" feel to it (there we go, UE3 again).  Even in 2012, the industry could have turned out something much better, and certainly the "franchise" as it has become, deserves only the best.  Experienced gamers will quickly feel they've played this game before, those new to the genre will no doubt be awed by the next title you play, which will seem so much better.","September 4, 2015","false","21.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I bought the other game made by Telltale, and liked it well enough. And so, encouraged by the positive reviews I read, I thought maybe this one would be interesting.\n\nI really, REALLY wanted to like this title, but sadly I couldn't play it long enough to draw conclusions about the game content itself; due to all the issues that started popping up. Of course I wish I could have played further into the game before posting a review, but no sale. It's terrible. My computer isn't exactly perfect but it isn't the worst either. I can play Skyrim and Bioshock Infinite on it without a problem. Yet somehow the cinematics on this game had characters that looked like floating sets of clothing with teeth, eyeballs, and discolored blotches like a toddler got loose with the crayons and doodled all over a world map. And whenever it wasn't bugging out, the graphics were shoddy at best, with a handful of textures that looked moderately adequate.\n\nThe battle system glitched out to high hell also. I was left sittin' there like a lemon, unable to move, with no status ailments that I was aware of, with full energy, then I noticed...I AM moving, but... at a pace that makes glaciers look like Turbo. Oh, joy.\n\nGood thing I bought it on sale. I'm going to give it another try sometime for the sake of saying I gave it a fair shake, but I'm not holding my breath.

The voice acting was pretty bad, particularly the main characters which is unfortunate because there is a lot of dialogue. The characters do this very odd shifting stance while they talk where they put one hand on their hip, it's very distracting to see these big burly characters with one hand on their hip while they talk to each other.\n\nIt took what felt like a long time to get to the first combat in the game, the combat uses an action queue system. It is not hack and slash at all, your combat actions are on a timer to complete, you have to manually select enemies to attack and switch between controlled characters during combat to queue up actions or let your allies auto attack. I found the combat to be the most disappointing, it just felt very boring to queue up attacks and sit back waiting for them to countdown.\n\nI definitely made a mistake buying this game, I thought the graphics looked fine in the screenshots but I found them very outdated when I started playing. From the little research I did it looked so much like a hack and slash combat system and found that the queued combat system drained the last of my resolve to play through this game. Only made it to the third chapter I believe, just wanted to warn other people from making my mistakes.

Controls are incredibly poor to me, the game was basically just a long headache. The story and dialogue, as with most telltale games, was quite good, but sadly I cannot truly say that this game was a success.\n\nAs an ASOIAF fan, I also didn't quite feel like the game was a necessary expansion into the universe. Let me put it this way: I don't regret getting it, but now that I've tried it, I realize I could have done without it.\n\nWatch a let's play before getting this to make sure you can stand the controls.

From the get go it pours lots and lots of cutscenes on you to the point that you want to yell shut up and advance the plot, dammit!

I never thought it would be so difficult to look back at those great examples of no-brainer UIs like in KOTOR and just shamelessly mimick it.\n\nSame generic faces everywhere.

Seeing a bunch of reviews giving this game a bad score, I prepared myself for the worst. Wow, I was blown away. This game is really good. I got to admit, I didn't excpect it, but it is a good game.\nThe gameplay of the game isn't amazing, but coming into this game you shouldn't excpect amazing gameplay. What is given to you to replace the lousy combat resembling in small ways a turn based combat, is an amazing story. The story reminds you so much to that in the books and the show. Not because of the characters, but because of the complex story, great characters, choice, unexpected events, negative view at things.\nEvery bit of the game feels like it should: An interactive game of thrones. Even though the choices you make in the game might not affect the world much, it still makes you feel special and like you achived something.\nDefinetly a great game.\n8.5/10\nFor more news and reviews head over to www.tuniworld.com","November 2, 2013","true","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So if you forget to add heals to your belt before the game springs a boss fight on you without warning, then chances are, you are screwed.

The voice acting was pretty bad, particularly the main characters which is unfortunate because there is a lot of dialogue. The characters do this very odd shifting stance while they talk where they put one hand on their hip, it's very distracting to see these big burly characters with one hand on their hip while they talk to each other.\n\nIt took what felt like a long time to get to the first combat in the game, the combat uses an action queue system. It is not hack and slash at all, your combat actions are on a timer to complete, you have to manually select enemies to attack and switch between controlled characters during combat to queue up actions or let your allies auto attack. I found the combat to be the most disappointing, it just felt very boring to queue up attacks and sit back waiting for them to countdown.\n\nI definitely made a mistake buying this game, I thought the graphics looked fine in the screenshots but I found them very outdated when I started playing. From the little research I did it looked so much like a hack and slash combat system and found that the queued combat system drained the last of my resolve to play through this game. Only made it to the third chapter I believe, just wanted to warn other people from making my mistakes. At least I got it on a sale.","January 2, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Seeing a bunch of reviews giving this game a bad score, I prepared myself for the worst. Wow, I was blown away. This game is really good. I got to admit, I didn't excpect it, but it is a good game.\nThe gameplay of the game isn't amazing, but coming into this game you shouldn't excpect amazing gameplay. What is given to you to replace the lousy combat resembling in small ways a turn based combat, is an amazing story. The story reminds you so much to that in the books and the show. Not because of the characters, but because of the complex story, great characters, choice, unexpected events, negative view at things.\nEvery bit of the game feels like it should: An interactive game of thrones. Even though the choices you make in the game might not affect the world much, it still makes you feel special and like you achived something.\nDefinetly a great game.\n8.5/10\nFor more news and reviews head over to www.tuniworld.com","November 2, 2013","true","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The mouse look (hold down right mouse button to look around) makes the view stutter and jerk around - usually flipping you around 90 degrees. This makes it impossible to navigate the game world. I've read countless forum solutions about setting V Synch to application controlled and so forth in the Nvidia control panel - but none of this fixes the problem. I suffered through this issue when the game first came out - and now - years later I returned to it to see if a patch/update had fixed it but as of the writing of this - the game breaking problem is still there. Many people don't seem to have to this glitch so it's hard to figure out how to fix it when so few people care.

How you had to avoid it.\nI didn't care; and played it anyway... and I am so glad that I did. This is a GREAT RPG. Great!\n\nThe story is intense, adult and interesting. There are some weavements in to the show (and books?) that you probably understand better than me if you watched/read them. Even if you didn't you can still easily follow this game's plotline and enjoy it. It truly is one of the best story-lines I have experienced in a game.\n\nSo good infact that yes, it allows one to overlook the weaker points of this game. It starts rather slow, but name me one RPG that doesn't. It's very conversation-heavy, which would scare off some, but is like the perfect thing for me and many RPG-fans. There can be very large stints without combat or "action"\nWhich is good, since the combat isn't exactly amazing. While complex enough, with various armor and damage types, many skills and abilities it's just... jarring. It's usually not much fun, which makes it fortunate it usually doesn't last that long. Mostly it consists of finding good combo's (x knocks out, y does bonus damage on knocked down foes) and hope for the best. I've lost fights heavily, and then won them using the exact same tactics without loosing any health at all on reload, so the combat results can be highly random.\n\nBack on the good side; this game features *many* great additions many RPG's could profit from having. The 2 storylines that start appart and closely come together and merge and then allows you to make the end-choice is great. It really helps avoiding story-fatigue if you don't get all of it in a large mesh-up. Downside is that you have to pay attention, it can be confusing if you don't. This is not a game just to relax and not think. You need to pay attention. Another great action is the dog, allowing you to sniff out clues, hidden rewards and take down lone guards (very advised since aforementioned combat). The counter-part fire view is sorely lacking in comparrison.\nOther great additions you will notice throughout, and might be spoilerish so I wont go into details expect that you really should loose the boss-fight once. That's just pure genious that other games lack, you'll know what I talk about when you see it.\n\nAnother downside is the extremely unoptimalised graphics. You'll often notice stuttering, and FPS might drop to it's knees looking at a wall, while a giant city-overview runs fine. This stuttering behavior can make it hard to navigate about and is overall extremely annoying, and probably the single most giant downside of this game sadly enough. It looks good enough, but it's performance is terrible. Some areas of the city I tried avoiding just because I knew they would drop my framerate to it's knees.\nHowever, I really suggest to get yourself through the horrors of the optimalisation and (infrequent) combat to experience  what this game's plotline and conversations have to offer you. You'll not regret it playing to the end and experience it all. Definitely one of the biggest surprises to me these last few years.

While a step up from Of Orcs and Men, it still falls very short of enjoyable.\n\nIf you aren't aware of the combat system, its a mix of strategy turn-based and hack-n-slash. You plug in attacks x,y,x and then your character does attacks x,y,x in sequence - not as you press it. This means youre basically standing still creating sequences of attacks before you even know what the oppenent is going to do - almost like rock, paper, scissors. (the slow reaction time / animations mean that you can't do it in real time, even if you wanted too).\nIt's disgusting and doesn't feel right to play. Doesn't feel like youre actually controlling the character, its strange.\n\nIf you can bear the clunky, semi-realtime combat - I'm sure this game would be great.\n","March 14","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't want to spend too much time here because the game doesn't deserve it. Which feels like the same mentality the developers had when they made this game. Go find something better to play, it won't be too difficult.\n\nOr maybe I'll try to follow through on some stuff that stoodout.\n\nGood stuff\n---------------\n*Everything is voice acted\n*Good framerate, never crashed\n*Story is interesting and appropriately convoluted.\n\nBad stuff\n-------------\n*Exposition heavy dialogue that is overly wordy and riddled with alliteration.\n*A "labyrinth" that is completely linear.\n*"Stealth" whereby you can ripout enemies throats 5 feet away from their bretheren without alerting them.\n*"Stealth" kills that are done via a one button QTE, spam the left mouse button.\n*Exploration is rarely rewarded and shows that despite the appearance of large environments, the game world is completely linear.\n*The camera is restrictive, cannot be zoomed out. There is an FoV config fix but it makes things look warped. The camera needs to be panned out a bit.\n*Cannot turn the character without holding down the right mouse button.\n*Boring loot.\n*Shallow attribute and character customization.\n*Shallow combat with skills that either look the same or have the same functionality. It plays like a super limited Dragon Age but with only 1 or 2 characters at a time.\n*Ideally, you can switch weapon types to counter enemy armor types. In practice this is hardly needed, atleast on normal difficulty.\n*Clunky UI\n*Graphics are rather bland and there is a large amount of environment repetition\n\nIf it's your first RPG to ever play or you are a massive GoT fan, then I think you may find something worthwhile here. I.E. if you don't know better or have some larger incentive to overlook some rather significant shortcomings then jump on in. But for the rest of us, for anyone that has ever played a decent RPG or isn't a GoT junkie, steer very far away from this one because it exemplifies mediocrity in all capacities.","May 28","false","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is just awful. It just doesnt work in any way. The only reason i played it was because it had the Game of Thrones name on it. With the franchise attached to it i was quite biased in its favour before playing it but nothing could cover up the monstrosity that is this game\n\nThe combat doesn't seem to make any sense. It's not like one of those games where you know the combat has a learning curve that you'll eventually get used to. The combat in this game just doesnt make any sense and i can't see anyone getting comfortable with it. The camera as well is just horrible. It doesnt go where you want it to and just ends up disorientating the player. Story-wise i cant really comment on because i didn't play for very long. It could be a good story but everything else just completely dwarfs that possibilty\n\nPros:\n-Its called Game of Thrones\n\nCons:\n-The combat system doesn't work at all\n-The camera mirrors the combat systems perfectly\n\nConclusion:\nWhile i recognise that the cons list isn't long and some people might be able to see past a couple of faults these are just too big to overlook in my opinion. I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It tries too hard to incorporate to many aspects of other successful titles ( Dragon Age, KOTOR ) but just fails miserably.

GOT from an origional perspective: and written by George RR Martin!\nGood graphics. Yeah, some people have said they look a bit "dated" but when has that been terrible? I still think AC Brotherhood has good graphics and that's four years old. GOOD GRAPHICS dammit.\nLots of weapons.\nGood Voice Acting\nBrilliant Music.\n\nNo Impact:\nSkills sytem is different but has no real impact on gameplay aside from being an average skills system.\n\nCons:\nTERRIBLE COMBAT!!! : Despite the hype, this has the combat of the average Generic MMO. The only cool part is the ability to "slow down time" in the middle of a conversation, so the speaker's voice gets distorted (heheh).\nYou spend lots of time "finding" things. IE. "Here's the way into a room you need to investigate to continue the story, which is a really cool story you want more of! Oops, now where was the way out again? Sorry. Guess you'll have to check EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DOOR IN WESTEROS!!!!!"\nNo character customization. Yes, I know you play as a GOT character BUT...\nLevels that trap you. "Find the rocks." OK... WHERE exactly? See above. I can't progress in that story I raved about untill I FIND THOSE DAMN ROCKS!!!\nLinear. This is not normally a "critiscm" of a game, since there's alot of good "linear" games. Sure, I prefer open world and sandbox because there's much more to do, but levelled games can be fun as well, the same things happen bassically, and they can still get your blood pumping. Some of the earlier COD games and Halo are a good example, as well as various racers, and classics like Mario...\nBut not Game of Thrones. Oh God no. Because this game has ABSOLUTLEY NO REPLAY VALUE!!! You only play it for the story, and you must do eveything EXACTLY how they want you to (you can't even draw your weapon without permission from the magic devs) to progress, so what's the point of replay?\nSome skills are useless: Wild Fire is incredibly rare, and for the first five levels of "fire" skill (there are only six levels per skillset by the way) you need Wildfire equipped.\nLONG conversations. Sure, I know this is GOT, more plotting than slaying, but really? A fifteen minute conversation with an NPC (admittedly and IMPORTANT NPC but..) that you can't get away from? How about "choosing options in conversations?" How about three times in fifteen minutes?\n"Consequences for your actions" havn't appeared in the 15 hours I've played the game...\nBUGS. This game crashes far to frequently for my taste...\n\nOverall: I'd reccomend buying this game for about $5 at max. Its bassically another Game of Thrones novel, yet it bassically tells the same story you've already heard from a different perspective. All the pro's are bassically things they brought over from the epic TV series (like voice actors, music, setting, etc.). However, I can understand a desire to buy this game simply to be able to wander around Westeros (and there's precious few time and far too small locations to do that).\n\nPlay at your own risk.","August 27, 2014","false","15.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I've read all the books, seen all the HBO episodes. But this game's just terrible. No attention to gameplay detail. The views destroy any enjoyment you might have had, forcing you to hold your right mouse button at all times to turn anything, not allowing any options for a follow, overhead or first person view. The voice actors are OK... but their lines sound like a 5th grader wrote them. One of the first insults in the game is, "that's not what your mother said last night." When you try to buy items, there's little to no difference in the colors denoting different tiers of coins and the items you view don't specify if they're one handed or two, making it risky to buy anything. You also have 3 choices in combat: die with a 2 hander, die with a sword and board, or die with two weapons. The difficulty isn't so great on Normal that you can't win fights, but it feels more like a chore than anything for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrsly/recommended/208730/","syrsly","Syrsly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrsly/","745 products in account","TL;DR: This is hardly a game at all, allowing for very little combat choices and even less exploration.  The story is good, though, and ties into the franchise quite well.  Music is straight out of the show, and some memorable characters came from the show to appear in this game.  However, it is not fun; it is tedious.\n\nFull review:\n\nFor starters, you choose dialogue options in a similar fashion to Mass Effect but rarely see an actual difference in the responses from the other characters.  This illusion of interactivity works against the game because I would most likely be more immersed in the story if I could turn off the captions and watch everything like a movie.\n\nIf you manage to ignore the gigantic captions at the bottom of the screen, the characters are bland and unexciting.  This is a problem I have with The Elder Scrolls games, too.  Characters are unappealing and uninteresting.  They rarely do anything other than move their lips and maybe wail their arms about them in random directions.  Most of the time, they don't even move their heads!  The lack of animation leads to some major cinematic flaws which make this a hard story to follow, but in general, lack of animation would be OK if the gameplay could make up for it.\n\nThe gameplay consists of mostly menus, going from one place to another, and watching characters move in slow motion.  The combat is as unexciting as can be, yet you may find it frustrating due to the lack of a good user interface design.  I chose the normal difficulty level and could not get past the first non-tutorial fight without choosing the damage sponge class.  Did I mention the class system?  Yes, there's a class system, a damn good one!  Unfortunately, it goes to waste due to the horrible way it was implemented in combat.  Basically, the combat consists of pressing space to go into slomo mode, choosing a couple actions for your character(s), and then proceeding to watch those actions unfold.  It may sound like a decent strategy system, but it doesn't work.  The first battle was so difficult I had to do it four times, switching classes on the fourth try, requiring me to sit through a bunch of boring loading screens due to skipped cinematics replaying everything all over again.  A retry button would have been nice there.  Hell, an auto-save would have been nice there!\n\nThe overall presentation of this game's story is a mixed bag of awesomeness and futility.  The entire game is voiced, but the characters aren't animated very well.  The combat system makes me want to avoid combat rather than look forward to it.  The menu is poorly implemented but has a nice visual appeal.  The control scheme is horrible both in the combat and in explorable areas, requiring you to use the numpad and the mouse at the same time for example just to do a simple task like change your target.  The music was straight out of the show, so it was awesome, but come on, we can just listen to the music elsewhere.\n\nI do not recommend this game, because it is absurdly frustrating to play and offers little in the form of entertainment.  Fans of the show may find some redeemable value in the character appearances or the backstory of The Wall, but nothing justifies playing through the entirety of this game in my opinion.  My patience wears thin after just one hour.","February 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Basically we live in the world of MMOs and this game just isn't that great.  The character/ combat system is OK.  It is one of those games where the influence of MMOs is obvious, such as Final Fantasy XII.  Supposedly from what I have read the combat system degenerates into button mashing although I have not gotten that far I have only played it for like 10h or so.  Basically it is very dependent on using an interrupt mechanic.  It's OK I would say it is only for hardcore Game of Throne fans only.

The controls are non standard in a horrible way and consequently are aggravating to control. The mouse only moves the camera if you hold a button and it is far too sensitive, also 'w' does not move you forward but about 30 degrees off forward, your hand is expected to be on the number pad and on wasd during combat. It's poor to play but I wasn't expecting anything brilliant in that department, I wanted to dive into westeros.\n\nYou start (I only played the start) at the wall which was disappointing, later you play a red priest in the free cities but I could not stick with it for that long. Call me a fangirl but what I like about asoiaf was that it felt realistic given the rules it wrote for itself. The sworn brother you play can warg with his Bull Terrier (at the wall, this dog would freeze to death, as a ranger's companion he would die of exhaustion) but you are labelled as a skin changer rather than a warg despite never (so far as I can gather) going into other animals. But a warg? They're rare to the point of nonexistent south of the wall.\nOne of your first missions is to find a brother who ♥♥♥♥♥ and killed a new recruit (mole's town has a brothel; there are boys there to the best of my recollection, no reason to ♥♥♥♥ a recruit). The player character called the brothers crows (taking back the word, I imagine) and they talk about white walkers and others as different beings on multiple occasions.\n\nAfter too many, "you didn't read the books!" moments I gave up.\n\nAvoid","October 23, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

I did not further check out if there's a setting to make it go like a third-person view mode, but I'm betting there isn't. The game has so much potential from the GoT universe, but then the gameplay ruined it. It's pretty much like some sort of strategy and RPG rolled into one. I suppose this would be "the ♥♥♥♥" back in the day, but buying this at this time is just a waste of money. Just go get Skyrim and find a 'GoT Mod', if that exists.

I like the GoT universe, and it was cool to sort of be "in" it, but...I'm not sure who the target audience of the game is. It seems like it might be people who know *of* GoT, but don't actually have any familiarity with it, other than "hey, isn't that the theme music?" I say that because characters spout exposition constantly (the voice acting is almost universally monotone), and someone like myself who's read the books will probably find it profoundly boring.\n\nBottom line:\n- If you're intimately familiar with GoT, you'll probably find the story elements of the game incredibly dull. Unless you just absolutely-cannot-get-enough-of-Westeros...in which case, just find a Skyrim mod or something.\n- If you've played an RPG before, you will find the game mechanics boring and unoriginal. Especially if you've played a PC RPG before (again, Elder Scrolls, I'm lookin' at you)\n- The UI seems like it was designed for the lowest common denominator, I.E. - consoles, which means that on PC there are several aspects that are really unintuitive if you have, say, a keyboard and mouse attached. Like PC users tend to have. (Of course, it's possible that this was released PC-only--I haven't checked--in which case, shame on the developers for a UI that's atrocious for no good reason)\n\nOkay, so...my bottom line is longer than the rest of the review, but my point is this: do NOT waste your money on this game, even it's on sale...unless you know nothing of Game of Thrones--other than that it's "a thing"--AND have never played an RPG videogame before.","November 10, 2014","false","4.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Normally I don't recommend or criticize a game until I've played several hours at least, but in this case I had to make an exception. I've only played half an hour and I can honestly say this was one of the worst games I've ever touched.\n\nAs a huge Game of Thrones fan I thought that no matter how bad the game itself was, the story would be worth playing it for. Unfortunately, the story might be good, but it's delivered atrociously. The voice acting is TERRIBLE and I mean comically bad. Definiely exacerbated by the awkward pacing, and the dismal dialogue itself. I can't believe any game would allow dialogue of this poor quality. It feels like it was written by a bad fanfic writer who read the Wikipedia summary of an ASOIAF book a couple of years ago. I know George RR Martin can tend to be a bit flowery in his dialogue, but this game has you going "Who the hell has ever talked like that ever" too many times.\n\nAfter enduring the first few cutscenes I was already on the verge of quitting (seriously it felt like the writers were trying really really hard to remind us this was a Game of Thrones game, shoving completely awkward, unnecessary references to lore). But when I actually tried the combat and gameplay I knew this game was unsalvagable trash. I felt like I've seen that same skills tree in a dozen other games, the camera itself is probably an enemy character given how much it hindered you, and "combat" conists of queing up three actions repeatedly.\n\nTo be fair, here are some good points I can think of: The graphics are decent, and the two main characters are very different and play that way as well. The story is worth playing if you can bear bad lines and acting (I couldn't). Music is good, it's basically the show's.\n\nOverall: Poor gameplay and camera, some very bad voice acting and dialogue obscuring a great story. Definitely not worth more than 5$, this is a game where its better to just watch someone else play","January 19, 2014","false","0.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It's a fun game with decent production value. It has one of the smoothest game engines I've ever seen. Graphics aren't great and character models suck and animations could be much better but the medieval setting is captured nicely. Voice acting is done well, however a bit too monotone. The part that made me like this game was the combat. It is like combat in a mmo: there are no attack buttons to mash, just auto attack and use some skills. You press the left button on the gamepad and it brings up an ability wheel and you select actions and it puts them in a que, then you hit it again and you go back to combat and perform the abilities. I appreciate the combat so much because I'm an oldschool gamer at heart and love Final Fantasy games, so I've always liked selecting abilities in combat a bit more than just button mashing. There is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of talking so either be ready to skip a lot of dialogue or read it, in which the storyline is actually pretty interesting imo.\nThumbs up good game, 7.5/10","January 1, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It is epic and it makes Mors a bad-♥♥♥. In fact Mors is a really cool character that I'd like to see in a game similar to Witcher 3 but that is where the good things end.\n\nThe game is a poorly made and is very badly optimised. Combat is uninteresting and uninspired and is nothing like DA:O which is a great game.\n\nThe story is a joke to Game of Thrones universe. It is as if it was written for a bad fairly tale with stupid plot twists that are seen from miles away. Varys looks like a fool in this game, they ruined him persona (other characters from the series/books look foolish too). Cersei isn't even voiced by Lena Headey. And most importantly, the game just feels awkward. I mean main characters are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Like badly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and completely cliche. Especially the Red Priest.\n\nThe animation is completely out of place! I mean the hand gestures that are frequently used by 2 main brutal characters that look like they are waving their hand and showing the index finger and saying "heeey Gurl" (all they need to add here is the circular head movement with the neck being completely moitionless) are just outright immersion breaking.  I mean they do it all the time when they try to act tough. But instead of looking tough they look like they are homosexual and it just makes it all silly. Not to mention lots of other animations that are not supposed to happen!\n\nThere is not much to say here except that it fails both as an RPG and a GoT story. I would avoid it at all costs even if you are a fan of either or both. And this is coming from a guy who plays old games on regular basis, who loves indie and RPGs like Morrowind and DA:O and a guy who loves GoT books and series.\n","February 10","false","10.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

There is no real character customization, yet different armor looks different on the character model (Weirdly inconsistent). The combat is a direct rip of the original Witcher's combat, akward but functional. Very poorly optimized, my computer isn't the best, but nothing in the game justifies the slowdown as I move the camera. I can play Blood Dragon fine, why is this so laggy? The animation is pretty bad too, takes you out of the experience when the characters move their mouths like nutcrackers. The story is good but it doesn't justify buying the game, even as a fan.

I think if they have more of a budget or more staff this could have been one of the all time great RPGs. The story is fantastic,  George R.R. Martin was definately involved in crafting this thing because it is also apparently canon, the houses and events are part of the actual story.\n\nIt starts 15 years after Robert Baratheons rebellion, the story is told through two different perspectives through two characters. You start of with Mors, a brother of The Nights Watch fighting wildlings north of the wall. Then in chapter two you're introduced to Alestar, an exiled knight who deserted his family and lands to get away from his deeds during Roberts rebellion. Alestar fled to Bravos where he discovered the Lord of Light and became a Red Priest he returns to his home after 15 years for the burial of his father.\n\nI can't really say too much about the story because it's Game of Thrones (and believe me this is Game of Thrones), and I'm resisting the urge to quote Ramsay Bolton as it is so moving on.\n\nIn terms of the game itself, it's serviceable for the purposes of delivering the story.\n\nTo me it felt a lot like Dragon Age 2, but with more corners cut and I know people are probably freaked out by that notion so allow me to clarify. You will see multiple character models which are exactly the same, most of the time you won't notice but occasionally they'll be standing right next to each other. The combat is fairly lack lustre it's your basic "select skills and wait" simulator. Locations are quite small and not very impressive you do feel as though Westeros is a stage rather than a living breathing world dark and full of terrors.\n\nHowever all of this only prevents the game from being great rather than what it is, which is very enjoyable.\n\nIt's an RPG which is way heavier on the RP than the G, and the choices you make do actually have very significant consequences so I advise you to save frequently just so you can satisfy your own curiosity.\n\n","November 24, 2014","true","61.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a very intriguing Story that kept me invested in the game. NOTHING was phoned in about the plot, it was well thought out from start to finish based on the books and using some special character faces from Season 1 of the TV series. The videos are short and keep you in suspense for the anticipating blood bath to come. The combat in the game is nothing revolutionary but it is fun and makes sense. A major complaint is that this game is clunky and glitch but I have only had 2 glitches in 40 hours of play and both were resolved easily without reloading… in fact I get more glitches with Call of Duty then I do with this game. This game isn’t state-of-the-art GOLD by any means but if you can get past the fact that not all games have the budget of Halo Reach and CoD Ghost then this is a solid game that looks great for what it is. Character Development is very well balanced… I never found myself dominating over groups of men and I did hit a few points were I had to try a few times to beat a special bad guy so the challenge part of the game is perfect.

This is nowhere as bad as the reviews claimed. In fact, it's pretty good. It does have faults: very linear, mediocre level design, and very few NPCs make the game world kind of boring. However, the combat is pretty good (especially if you play on hard) and the character builds are different enough from eachother to make more than one playthrough worth while. But the real reason to play this is the storyline. I'm a big fan of the books and I was actually kind of impressed how the writers for this managed to replicate pretty accurately everything that is great about the books, without seeming like they are merely rehashing pre-existing storylines. It even had a couple twists that genuinely surprised me, which was nice.\n\nThere might be better RPGs out there in terms of gameplay, but if you like the GOT universe or just like games that put story before all else (even, sometimes, at the cost of gameplay) then this is well worth a playthrough.","October 27, 2012","true","44.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Allthough my complaints are few and mainly focused around the camera being centered to close to the protagonists back, I do not believe people who dislike this game are wrong.\n\nTo break it down, the one point people seem to agree upon is that the story is what drives this game forward, it's a very interesting take on the events taking place during the first novell of the "A Song of Ice and Fire" saga, all be it not entirely canon unless we've been kept in the dark on some major nuggets of information both within the books and the HBO show.\n\nThe errors I've heard about it is that the combat is way to repetative, and many people dislike the way it's done. For you who have played 'Of Orcs and Men', the combat is very similar to that, as is the gear system, only Game of Thrones seem to have a bit more indepth inventory. I personally enjoy this combat style, but as my favourite parts of the books are the priesthood of R'hllor, and my favourite part of the HBO show is Connleth Hill, it's hard for me to look down at this game too much. (Yes, Connleth does do a guest appearance as Varys).\n\nAnother issue I care to mention that I personally struggled with was the portrayal of women, and whilst I am not a fan of the heated pro or cons of feminism debatte raging online, let me just tell you that even I who generally doesn't mind exploitation or characters not being described to their fullest was shocked with how there seems to be no noteworthy woman in this game at all, but hey, atleast the protagonists are allright. (Warning, one of the voiceactors for the protagonists sound like coarse stone).\n\nSo to summarise, as much as I personally enjoyed this game, it probably isn't for you. I can live with the poor graphic, a handful of bugs and an uncomfortable camera angle as I am so interested in Westeros, but I wouldn't expect many others to put up with so much. But at the end of the day, I really enjoyed the game, it was fairly lengthy if you did the side missions and it never felt to easy or to difficult. But if you against all odds find it in you to deal with all of these things I've warned you about above here, I strongly recommend the game simply on the basis that I enjoyed the combat system, and the story is good.\n\nThat and I got to play as a servant of R'hllor so it was basically 90% me roleplaying as Thoros of Myr.","November 27, 2013","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hydra092/recommended/208730/","Hydra092","Hydra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hydra092/","524 products in account","I played this game mostly for its good story. When I mean "good story", I mean you could remove the gameplay and put it in a movie or a book and still find it intresting. Characters are well written, the plot is complex, there are multiples choices with consequences and it respects its setting perfectly. However like in all RPGs, the feeling of realism that you could expect from Game of Thrones setting is broken by the dozen of battles the main protagonists fight without loosing a limb.\n\nFrom a pure technical point the game is quite outdated, the graphics and the animation quality are  mediocre, despite having quite a good artistic direction. The gameplay manages to be entretaining but never cross the boundaries of greatness. The combat is midly intresting at first to become very repetitive as you progress, because you are simply overpowered (like in dragon age). There's also voice acting, but it is often out of the place, failing to show any emotions, or exagerating them most of the time.\n\nHowever despite all these issues, I'd say its a solid pick on sale if you like games that plays like dragon age and good "mature" stories.","October 18, 2013","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I normally prefer turn-based combat, the real-time-with-pause works pretty well. You have to balance inflicting status effects (on fire, stunned, knocked down, etc.) with matching extra powered attacks while always saving a bit of power to throw in an interrupt. You're often controlling 2 characters (and sometimes also a dog), so there is a lot of room for strategy. Like most real-time-with-pause systems though, the fights always devolve into a big pile of guys bouncing all over the place.\n\nThe story is really about as good as it gets for something like this. It all takes place before the show starts and focuses on new characters who often run into characters from the show. The writing is ok, and the story is interesting. Some of the side quests are fun.\n\nThere are a lot of negatives though. Some of the quest are really wonky - you have to basically try every dialogue option. It seemed like a crap-shoot to figure out the best dialogue option. The results were just too random.\n\nThe visuals are all over the place. The main two character's faces look great, but some of the cast members are almost unrecognizable. The texture quality is often pretty bad. For example, the doors look like something from a 10-year-old game: just a flat texture on a very thin bit of polygons. Like, the handles are never modeled making them look really out of place. Tree, flowers, etc. often look terrible. Oh, it's also worth mentioning that the game is over-the-shoulder third-person, so it can be a real pain to look around. As far as I could tell there was no first-person "look" option. The FOV was really low, as well.\n\nThe difficulty curve is a bit off. Most fights were easy, even many "elite" or "boss" fights, but a few were suddenly extremely difficult.\n\nIn the end, Game of Thrones RPG is a fun little game that fans of the show can get some fun out of. It has some flaws, but overall I've had a good time.\n\n* It features the likeness and voices of actors from the TV show, which is based on the books.","November 27, 2013","true","30.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of the Game of Thrones series like I am, and like roleplaying games, its just plain neat.\n\nI really am enjoying being in the nights watch and seeing the ominous, thrilling wall that goes on forever.\n\nThe combat is tactical not action.  The game does say that in the description, but I thought it would be somewhat twitch based, it is not.  You choose the actions of the character and they carry them out in real time, but you can pause any time and change and/or que up orders.\n\nIts a role playing game, which means you do get to build up your character, choose attributes and skills, buy, find, and equip different weapons and armor.  I love it.  Exploration pays off in finding new items, etc.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic at the highest settings and at 1600 by 900 resolution.  I know that people criticized the graphics for the Xbox, but the computer version to me at least, captures the world perfectly.\n\nThe dialogue and story is game of thrones, that simple.  Horrible actions, rough words, and intigue everywhere.  Do not let your children play this game.  The first quest is caused by some horrible, R rated actions.\n\nA few things could be better.\n\nYou have to almost be on top of an item before you see it.  For example, you may see a bunch of crates across the room, but you have to walk over there and almost be touching them before you get an icon that there is something to grab.\n\nThe game appears to be fairly linear.  I'm very early in the game, but its not a wide open world to explore, its more of a tight knit story to follow.  There are sidequests, and several neat choices in the dialogue, but this is a more linear game.\n\nNeeds more actors from the series.  The only voices that I believe are in it from the series are Varas and the commander of the Night's watch, thats it.  Since this takes place parallel to season 1, there are so many others we could have met.  I don't know what other characters may be around, but even if we get to meet them, they won't be the same voices.\n\nAnyways, I don't what was up with the Xbox version, but the pc special edition version is a great game if you would like to enjoy Westeros for a little bit while waiting for season 5.  Right now its on sale for 5 bucks.  Its a steal!","June 29, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We have two main characters with separate storylines and motives, but they will be forced to take part in the political events. The atmosphere is very bleak, treachery lurks everywhere. The game features some of the most disturbing scenes in gaming - done so well, that the worst one isn't even graphic.\n\nThere are a lot of smaller and bigger choices to make, the consequences are often non-direct or delayed - but they have impact on the plot.\n\nThe game is off-putting at the beginning - the visuals are outdated (though some of the textures, armors etc. look weirdly good) and the combat feels slow and boring. But if only you'll stay a bit longer, hopefully you'll find yourself in the story's grip. The graphics will still be awful, but servicable. Combat will pick up a bit though once you'll learn more skills and get more stamina to use them - it will still be a bit boring as it's very tactical and focues on disabling and exploiting enemies (at higher difficulty levels it's very challenging).\n\nGet the Beyond of Wall DLC if you decide to play the game - it's a short prequel and it's great.","March 10, 2013","true","40.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a very intriguing Story that kept me invested in the game. NOTHING was phoned in about the plot, it was well thought out from start to finish based on the books and using some special character faces from Season 1 of the TV series. The videos are short and keep you in suspense for the anticipating blood bath to come. The combat in the game is nothing revolutionary but it is fun and makes sense. A major complaint is that this game is clunky and glitch but I have only had 2 glitches in 40 hours of play and both were resolved easily without reloading… in fact I get more glitches with Call of Duty then I do with this game. This game isn’t state-of-the-art GOLD by any means but if you can get past the fact that not all games have the budget of Halo Reach and CoD Ghost then this is a solid game that looks great for what it is. Character Development is very well balanced… I never found myself dominating over groups of men and I did hit a few points were I had to try a few times to beat a special bad guy so the challenge part of the game is perfect.

This tale coincides with the events of the first season of the show and the first book.  I quite liked being a part of the intrigue of the Game of Thrones universe.  You hear of events going on in the main storyline while performing the duties/tasks involved in your own story arch.  I loved the way they worked together - you playing a part of one of the more relevant aspects of Queen Cersei's plot involving bloodlines.  If you are familiar with the Game of Thrones lore you will NOT be disappointed.  Another plus for me was the co-op feel of the game with you in essence controlling two characters throughout - with them coming together at a certain point to deal with a supposedly common goal (of course - this being GoT there is deception involved here as well).  This is one time where I stayed away from a game because of negative reviews - I wish I hadn't - this game ends up being one of the better RPG experiences I have had (in a limited, non MMO environment).  This is a must play for GoT fans.  Period.","January 1, 2015","true","33.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of the Game of Thrones series like I am, and like roleplaying games, its just plain neat.\n\nI really am enjoying being in the nights watch and seeing the ominous, thrilling wall that goes on forever.\n\nThe combat is tactical not action.  The game does say that in the description, but I thought it would be somewhat twitch based, it is not.  You choose the actions of the character and they carry them out in real time, but you can pause any time and change and/or que up orders.\n\nIts a role playing game, which means you do get to build up your character, choose attributes and skills, buy, find, and equip different weapons and armor.  I love it.  Exploration pays off in finding new items, etc.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic at the highest settings and at 1600 by 900 resolution.  I know that people criticized the graphics for the Xbox, but the computer version to me at least, captures the world perfectly.\n\nThe dialogue and story is game of thrones, that simple.  Horrible actions, rough words, and intigue everywhere.  Do not let your children play this game.  The first quest is caused by some horrible, R rated actions.\n\nA few things could be better.\n\nYou have to almost be on top of an item before you see it.  For example, you may see a bunch of crates across the room, but you have to walk over there and almost be touching them before you get an icon that there is something to grab.\n\nThe game appears to be fairly linear.  I'm very early in the game, but its not a wide open world to explore, its more of a tight knit story to follow.  There are sidequests, and several neat choices in the dialogue, but this is a more linear game.\n\nNeeds more actors from the series.  The only voices that I believe are in it from the series are Varas and the commander of the Night's watch, thats it.  Since this takes place parallel to season 1, there are so many others we could have met.  I don't know what other characters may be around, but even if we get to meet them, they won't be the same voices.\n\nAnyways, I don't what was up with the Xbox version, but the pc special edition version is a great game if you would like to enjoy Westeros for a little bit while waiting for season 5.  Right now its on sale for 5 bucks.  Its a steal!","June 29, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We have two main characters with separate storylines and motives, but they will be forced to take part in the political events. The atmosphere is very bleak, treachery lurks everywhere. The game features some of the most disturbing scenes in gaming - done so well, that the worst one isn't even graphic.\n\nThere are a lot of smaller and bigger choices to make, the consequences are often non-direct or delayed - but they have impact on the plot.\n\nThe game is off-putting at the beginning - the visuals are outdated (though some of the textures, armors etc. look weirdly good) and the combat feels slow and boring. But if only you'll stay a bit longer, hopefully you'll find yourself in the story's grip. The graphics will still be awful, but servicable. Combat will pick up a bit though once you'll learn more skills and get more stamina to use them - it will still be a bit boring as it's very tactical and focues on disabling and exploiting enemies (at higher difficulty levels it's very challenging).\n\nGet the Beyond of Wall DLC if you decide to play the game - it's a short prequel and it's great.","March 10, 2013","true","40.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This a purely story driven game that has the dark tone and twists that make the books and the TV series great. I will admit that the first few hours of the game is slow and it may straw people away from this game, but don't this game picks up the pace and never lets go. This game requires patentince and there are scenes that last for a very long time but are filled with great dialogue and even better characters.\n\nMany people complain that there hasn't been a great game that the series of Fire and Ice deserves, I would disagree with them. This game is a great compaianon piece to the world and lore of this sereies of the books and TV shows. This has a great and lengthy main story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It was very hard for me to put down the controller once i started it. At over 20 hours it provide a lot of great sotry moments. Also the side quest do not detract from the story at all and adds an incredible amount depth to the story and the characters. If you do all the side quests it will add about another 10 hours to the game, I would recommand that you do so.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is a little weak and has a very steep learning curve. I'm not the biggest stragiests, so when I found out that the combet requires to you really think, it took me a little bit to get used to. But once I put the effort into it it become very rewarding.\n\nThe graphics are not that great but they make up for it in the art department and the ability to recreate areas fome the show and books. the atmoshere is thick with style and can bery nice to look at. The game play and the graphics are not what makes this game great though, that's due to story. Get this game for the story, you will be a happy camper if you do so.\n\nIf you're someone that does not care for stories in games and only worries about gameplay, I would reccomand that you don't pick up this game. But if you are someone that love an incredible, darkcharacter rich and lore heavy story then this is the game for you.\n\nPros\n-An amazing story that stays true(for the most part) to its source materail\n-Two wonderfull main characters that are great to play and level up\n-Two intersting intersecting stories that clash in a really great momnet\n-Fantastic vioce work from the main characters of the game\n-A Lengthy story that will keep you at the edge of your seat\n\nCons\n-Steep learning curve\n-First few hours are slow\n-Console port with no grahpic options escept for resolution (that can be changed by going into the invidia control panel and fixing that yourself)\n\n9/10","June 30, 2014","true","41.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the story alone I would recommend GOT.\n\nAt first I was not impressed with the combat but as the game progressed and the 2 heroes united I felt the game take on a different tone. More abilities became available and maybe sticking with the same 2 characters I learned how to use them effectively and had a more enjoyable time. Combat became more frequent which may also had something to do with my enjoyment.\n\nI am still not a complete fan of the combat system however it is used in several of the DEVs games. As is the same awful camera controls. Once I got over the fact I would experience at times not being able to see my characters fully while in combat and during some cut scenes having my character stuck in a door or looking through my companions head or at a wall(etc...) I didn't hate it as much.\n\nWhen I play I think of replayability. At first I thought NO. however during my game I rethought that and even though I would not immerse myself in the dialogue as I did It still may be fun trying the different combat stances and actually striving to finish all the side quests. I also think of bang for the buck(joy for the price) and since I bought GOT at a huge discount I definitely got my moneys worth for 1 play and if I do come back in a month or more than the bang will only increase.","September 17, 2015","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story-wise, it remains loyal to the series and introduces new characters as well as characters from the show (with some of the actual cast providing voices!)\nBasically, the game is set in a similar style to the books. You play as two characters, Mors, a ranger of the Night's Watch, and Alester, a red priest who has returned from Braavos to reclaim his father's seat as Lord. You switch between both characters  every chapter. The RPG elements are great, allowing you to choose your style of play. Mors and Alester have different fighting styles, and you can pick which path you want them to go down. You can upgrade your skill tree, add points to weapons etc... all the typical RPG things. What ultimately kills it however is the combat system.  When you engage in battle you select an enemy and you can line up attacks. Using such an old combat model for this type of game is its downfall. I could look past some of the other aspects except this.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game is stable and runs smoothly. The graphics are dated, but they're not bad so to say. Just don't expect super beautiful graphics. The enviroments are also a bit shallow. Riverspring, during the riots felt a bit bland to my taste. There was none of that true hateful spirit! You need to play the game to see for yourself. Apart from that the game hasn't aged well. It feels like it was made back in 2000.\n\nBut what about the story? The thing that made me a big fan of GoT is the story, which in this case this game has remained loyal to. The game takes place before the events of the first book, in a simpler time when Robert Baratheon was still whoring away, Eddard Stark's head was still on his shoulders and the realm was finally in peace after the downfall of the Targaryens. Some of the cast members from the show lent their voices! I was absolutely surprised when I heard Varys' spidery voice narrating the intro and good ol' Jeor Mormont giving orders to the Night's Watch. It's those little things that make this game so special.\n\nIt has it's flaws but if you are willing to overlook the outdated game mechanics, I recommend this. It's a must-get for any true GoT fan (It's better for readers of the book, but show-watchers are welcome to try it!) If you want a proper quality GoT experience, play Telltale's Game of Thrones game. There is far more polish and TV-esque story than this.\n\nEDIT: Oh and I forgot to mention the voice acting. Apart from the cast who lent their voices (which sound just like in the show!) some of the voices can sound uninspired, like when they're saying, "OH MY GOD WE'RE GONNA DIE!" They sound sort of bored. Not all the voices are like that, but some definetly are.","September 1, 2014","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are believably written and very memorable. Overall, the story is realy great. You don't have to have read the books, though it might help understanding the ovarching lore a bit better.\nTechnically the game realy isn't that great. The animations are stiff, the voice acting isn't top notch and so are the graphics. But you have to remember that the budget wasn't very high. The game is perfectly playable, though the battle system takes a little time to get used to. The further I got the more I enjoyed it. Please don't stop after one or two chapters. I realy enjoyed the 29 hours it took me to complete the game(including the prequel DLC "beyond the wall").\n\nFor some players it might be important to know, that the game is more heavily based on the books than the TV Series. There are two characters (Jeor Mormont and Varys) that resemble the actors of the HBO series and are voiced by them, but that's it. Most locations don't resemble the ones you might know from TV. King's Landing has more of an european Middle-Age-Vibe to it, for example. Of course there's the ingenious Theme.\n\nThe game takes place during the first book/season, so you won't spoil yourself anything that takes place after that time.","January 14, 2014","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The conversation choices have very little consequence to the overall experience.\n\nOn the other hand, I had a blast learning the combat system and exploring the dungeons.

The story, completely original, manages to fit the story told in the books without inconsistency I could notice, and involves new characters I found quite attaching. The story telling is also very well built, with the complete plot discovering step by steps.\n\nBUT... gameplay is cheap. Really. The huge environments are disguised empty corridors, making the level design kind of boring. The fight system is also "has-been" and reminds me of KOTOR, which was fine at its time, 10 years ago. In addition, on my computer, the UT engine seem to be used in a pretty much buggy way.\n\nAt the end, it looks to me as an unfinished game. All the basis are here, and are tremendously good, but lacks some serious finish.\nIf you are fond of the books or the TV-series, get it without hesitation !\nIf you are just fond of good RPG's without particular interest for GoT, you may find something better elsewhere.","January 17, 2014","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though the game has a decent story it bursts and get shattered on the shortcomings of the graphics engine.\n\nYou play two characters: Mors, "the butcher", Westford, a loyal warrior of the Night's Watch and Alester Sedwick struggling to regain his heritage as Lord of Riverspring after been away for 15 years.\n\nThe story is really great and contains all the ingredients the famous Game of Thrones series features: honor, love, fights, betrayal, debauchery, violence, mystic and magic, deception, heroism, and cruelty. It's all in there. This is a true Game of Thrones story.\n\nAlso if you watched the TV series you'll recognize some characters: Cersei Lannister plays the plotting ♥♥♥♥♥ and you simply can't get behind Lord Varys motives and schemes. As a goodie: you have a Cameo-appereance of Mr. "Game-of-Thrones" himself: George R. R. Martin is the Maester of Bergholz. Running a little Q&A with him is quite hilarious.\n\nOk, there are some irrational items in there: e.g. it takes you 3 months game time to travel from Castle Black at the Wall down to the Riverlands, but after chapter 8 you are free to simply click anywhere on the map and are there within a blink of an eye.\n\nOr: at some point Alester murmurs to himself: "pillagers will be executed" during a riot ... which does not keep you away to grab and loot anything which is not nailed down. =)\n\nBut then there is the story. And what a story it is! I can remember the events in chapter 11 leaving me with my jaws wide open: WTF! The game overdoes this theme and attitude of the core Game of Thrones nature in the end like in the final events in chapter 14, but all-in-all it is a great story to experience. Westeros is here.\n\nThis is the very strong part of this game.\n\nThen the combat techniques is quite interesting and has some charm: like in a Dragon Age 2 manner you slow down time - it actually never stops - and issue some actions. This interface is not that easy to get your hold on but after some encounters you'll learn this new experience. And it is fun. As time does not stop you feel pressure to get to your decisions rather fast. I finished the game on normal level and every now and then I lost some combats and this is a real good experience. Be demanding so that success is sweeter.\n\nThis is the interesting part of the game.\n\n... and then there is the game engine. They say it does not take a good graphics for a great game to tell thrilling and fascinating story. True. But the engine should at least bare some minimums. This game is an example to stress this principle.\n\nAs the audio and speakers are ranging from ok (average peasant) to excellent (Lord Varys) the Graphics are weak. All in all the textures are squishy, some motions clumsy. You find a lot of people sharing the very same faces and if I don't know it better I would say I've been witness to the impossibility of the framerate dropping below 0! Seriously, you have to be very capable of suffering and be very high pain tolerant accepting this. Walking around the great hall in Castle Black is ... well ... demanding. Even though some places are nicely rendered like the Gift at the Wall.\n\nIf the developers had more time to improve the graphics engine this game would have been rated much higher in the critic's world.\n\nThis is the very poor, ugly part of the game.\n\nFor the record, I needed about 36 hours at normal difficulty level and finished the story with Mors taking care of the baby outside of Westeros.\n\nI award this game 3 out of 5 stars, thanks to the pretty cool Game of Thrones story line ... nearly ruined by the half-baked graphics textures and graphics engine. It could have been better. Much better.","January 19, 2014","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't take it anymore. Even if you are a die hard Game of Thrones fan, this game is very hard to swallow. The thought of walking around Westeros killing Lanisters and Whitewalkers sounds great, but there is none of that in this game. There is none of anything in this game, actually. It's merely a point and click story about the Nightwatch defending The Wall. There are no kings, no throne...the story is so far removed from what one expects they give you a nameless dog (not a dire wolf) to walk around with.\n\nThe combat system is literally the worst I have ever seen in a game. It is reminiscent of a third person RPG aka Final Fantasy like, but they try to make it "real time" by having the NPCs move about the screen. Perhaps small children would enjoy this type of engagement within a game, but certainly no one that watches Game of Thrones.

Playing it for the first time, I enjoyed how the two main characters were not really good characters but more so severely flawed characters put in desperate situations.  If you are wanting to play a game that had  similar characters to The Witcher, you may also enjoy the characters in this game.  Like most western rpgs,  the branching dialoge choices is a nice touch that adds  replay value and helps you get immersed in the setting of the game.  The gameplay is a cross between Dragon's Age Origin's queuing system as far as stacking different types of attacks/selecting party members and Witcher 2's slow down when you are trying to select attacks.  It works for the most part however I did have trouble in certain segments of the game.\nThe game has a very decent art style with really nice moon effects in the forest.  However character detail is very lacking and ugly.  The soundtrack was pretty decent, nothing that stood out and made it memorable but it was not bad either, just a bit repetitive.  The voice acting is definitly low budget however, some of the characters really put forth some awful lines of dialogue and made some scenes hiliarious when they were not supposed to be.   In addition, like most western rpgs, there are plenty of bugs and glitches that at one time forced me to load a previous save, 30 minutes back, so be warned to save often and have different save files just in case.\nFor the current asking price, it is in my opinion too much, wait till it gets on sale for under $10 and you should fine plenty of enjoyment with the game.  I would avoid the dlc however, the dog skin is just a skin pack and adds nothing to the gameplay or story.  The weapons pack is also not very well designed as you still have to pay  a merchant to get the weapons that are extremely expensive, you will eventually in the course of the game, get weapons that rival those dlc weapons. The one story dlc "Beyond the Wall" is okay but very brief,  do not get the dlc at the current asking price.\nWhile the game has many flaws, it is very enjoyable.  I personally am still not necessarily a fan of Game of Thrones but I can say the game did increase my interest a bit into why people enjoy the series so much.  If you are a fan of the series, you will probably enjoy the game a lot and if you are not a fan like myself, you may enjoy it as an okay western rpg set in  a gritty medieval environment.","July 6, 2014","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is wierd and I almost abandoned the game in my first 2 hours with it.  I'm glad I didn't give up because before I knew it I was dragged into its story, having fun with the combat, and searching every corner for loot.

I can't take it anymore. Even if you are a die hard Game of Thrones fan, this game is very hard to swallow. The thought of walking around Westeros killing Lanisters and Whitewalkers sounds great, but there is none of that in this game. There is none of anything in this game, actually. It's merely a point and click story about the Nightwatch defending The Wall. There are no kings, no throne...the story is so far removed from what one expects they give you a nameless dog (not a dire wolf) to walk around with.\n\nThe combat system is literally the worst I have ever seen in a game. It is reminiscent of a third person RPG aka Final Fantasy like, but they try to make it "real time" by having the NPCs move about the screen. Perhaps small children would enjoy this type of engagement within a game, but certainly no one that watches Game of Thrones. No one that enjoys the type of game this one tries to portray would be interested in this, for 10 minutes into the game you are gravely dissappointed.\n","January 5, 2014","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is moderately fun if a bit awkward. The character development system is what I refer to as "chose what you like it doesn't make much difference". Everything else (the gameworld) is medieval and grimey looking... so different to pretty, pristine Skyrim. The story is good and rather dark and it delivers well. Even some dark humor permeates at time. George RR Martin would approve (or he must of...). The story avoids being flat -in other words  stories that fail to build suspense. The Mors character is really well-voiced - he needs to be in more games, Allister is pretty good too - but distinctive, good quality voice acting really adds something. GoT is worth playing with these things in mind. If you like colour and movement - like Super Mario World and that ilk, the game will be a bit more riskier in the "will I like it" stakes. Still I suggest getting this on sale since its replayability is perhaps limited.","January 22, 2014","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have read the books and you aren't playing this game you are stupid.\n\nThe graphics are not top notch, the camera is sometimes a bit wonky (yet much better than any of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ force unleashed games), and smaller ancillary characters are not voiced by the best actors. Those are my only complaints. I haven't beaten the game yet, but I'm enjoying the hell out of it.\n\nBoth of the main characters are interesting and simply fun to play.

In each mainstory conversation you will get different options on what tosay, how to react or what to do, all which will effect the story and the the NPC:s opinion of you. The voice acting, on the other hand, is terrible. Everyone speak with monotone voices lacking of emotions as if the actors just read the script into the mic instead of acting it out. In an RPG containing more intruiging story than combat, the voice acting is important and Cyanide Studios should've tried getting better actors.\nThe combat is inspired på the KotOR series. You have a skillset and you queue up your skills to execute combos and deal as much damage as possible. The combat part is well done and works fine. You upgrade your skill tree and choose yourself if you want a lot of different active skills, buff yourself with passives or use a combination of both.\nSome hitbox glitches can be found as well as a bad choice of camera angles during cutscenes, but apart from that the game was good. Not great or the best I've ever played, but certainly good and worth trying.\n\n7/10","January 14, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are believably written and very memorable. Overall, the story is realy great. You don't have to have read the books, though it might help understanding the ovarching lore a bit better.\nTechnically the game realy isn't that great. The animations are stiff, the voice acting isn't top notch and so are the graphics. But you have to remember that the budget wasn't very high. The game is perfectly playable, though the battle system takes a little time to get used to. The further I got the more I enjoyed it. Please don't stop after one or two chapters. I realy enjoyed the 29 hours it took me to complete the game(including the prequel DLC "beyond the wall").\n\nFor some players it might be important to know, that the game is more heavily based on the books than the TV Series. There are two characters (Jeor Mormont and Varys) that resemble the actors of the HBO series and are voiced by them, but that's it. Most locations don't resemble the ones you might know from TV. King's Landing has more of an european Middle-Age-Vibe to it, for example. Of course there's the ingenious Theme.\n\nThe game takes place during the first book/season, so you won't spoil yourself anything that takes place after that time.","January 14, 2014","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very very satisfying to see diverse dialogues between them based on your actions and development in the game. Most dialogue options are very diverse and has impact on bigger things. In the end, you will be testing your wits against the game. There are several different ending possibilities but non of them are really definitive good or bad choices. Grim, just as expected from Martin :) The Voice acting is also astonishing and the music just feels right.\n\nCombat is OK. Might feel clunky at first. Very basic but it's not spoon feed either. You have to use your skills very very carrefully and calculate the outcome. You will be forced to run and get creative with your skill combos. Very demanding and challanging especially in higher difficulty settings. In most situations you have to nuke the enemies before they can act. Otherwise you'll get hurt big time. Enemy AI isn't really perfect but they are not mindless zombies either. As you level up, you may think yourself on a easy spot but the game still suprises you with different sittuations. Your characters has different set of skill trees that compliment each other. However, some skills are slightly unbalanced. Also i hould mention, there's a limited slow time feature which you have to use in order to queue your skills. You can not pause the game in mid combat and manage your characters.\n\nAnd then there's Westeros. Quite nicely designed. it's not an open world map but the fast travel option gives you the illusion that it is. I find that the level designs are quite linear however theres always a couple of different ways to deal wıth the challanges ahead. You find different equipment and treasures as you explore the every corner (tho %95 of the loot is just plain crap). What's really annoying is to run across the maps again and again to complete side quests. Previously killed enemies doesn't spawn so you don't get any exp or loot either. Pretty much all the side quests has to be completed in order to get more exp. to deal with harder sittuations. Pretty boring after a while and kills the replayable value.\n\nGraphics are not the best but who cares. More than OK in my book. Detailed equipments are nice. Nothing out of place. Animations are quite nice but walking animations may feel clunky and slow paced at first. Slowing time in combat looks just great.\n\nIt's clear that the game takes after titles such as dragon age and witcher. It has strong points and weak points. I definitely recommend this title to anyone who likes medival RPG games in general.","March 18, 2015","true","75.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was charmed by drama and tough choices no other RPG could offer me in recent years, by characters actually playing instead of so popular nowadays standing and giving dull speeches (like in any Bethesda product), by giving the evil character that you can, from one side understand and from the other, want to slaughter without any mercy. Yes, yes... this game gives many emotions to a player. Character development options are quite good, with very nice extent of variety. Two characters we have occasion to control present completely different trees of fighting stiles and additional abilities.\n\nMany complain about combat system... Actually any player who remember "Knights of The Old Republic" should find it very similar. Sure it needs some getting used to after mindless click-fest from game I mentioned on the beginning or other pseudo-RPGs but it is nothing players haven't already seen. Some battles actually need planing and are very rewarding.\n\nGraphics... yes, this game has outdated graphics. Everyone can see this on screenshots so there is no point in describing it but I need to say that except rare buggy camera work there is nothing that interrupts our gaming experience. Mechanics are ok, there is nothing good or bad to say about them... I experienced no major (or minor for that matter) bugs.\n\nSo, bottom line... full price of this game might be too big for many players... but if it will be ever on sale with some good discount... then there is simply no reason not to take it.\n\nWith regards,\nREDDQ","January 29, 2013","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

R. Martin again wrote a great story, with great twists and many dead characters as usual. The storyline runs parallel to the main story of the first book and they almost touch sometimes. It's a tragedy as close to the book as possible without just telling the same story or object it.\n\n(-) The technical realisation is awful. The fighting system is interesting but gets pretty boring after a few fights. The skill tree is unbalanced, you got some really strong abilities on one hand, but many are pretty useless. The settings are often really small (Kings Landing is explored in 5-10 mins). The graphics aren't that good also, not totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but they don't fit a story so mighty.\nAlso you get about 10 different weapons and armaments for every class, but except for a few legendarys they are all the same and you end up fighting Lannisters, while wearing a Lannister-breastplate, because thats the best you get for quite a while, but you hate it since you are a ranger from the Wall. But only in the very late game you have enough gold (and the chance to visit a trader) to buy some legendary stuff.\nAll in all there are some heavy issues with how the epic story is implemented and it's really sad, because with a little more budget and a little more time this game could have been awesome.\n\n(->) Anyway: I liked the game because of it's great story which made up for all the pain I suffered while playing. I think I won't play it again even if i want to check out some different classes (haven't played the archer yet), but it's just too boring if you know whats going on.\nIf you are a GoT fan or even read the books you should consider buying this piece (at least on sale!), because it tells a George R. R. Martin story in the universe of GoTl, that you can't buy as a book.","July 22, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story-wise, it remains loyal to the series and introduces new characters as well as characters from the show (with some of the actual cast providing voices!)\nBasically, the game is set in a similar style to the books. You play as two characters, Mors, a ranger of the Night's Watch, and Alester, a red priest who has returned from Braavos to reclaim his father's seat as Lord. You switch between both characters  every chapter. The RPG elements are great, allowing you to choose your style of play. Mors and Alester have different fighting styles, and you can pick which path you want them to go down. You can upgrade your skill tree, add points to weapons etc... all the typical RPG things. What ultimately kills it however is the combat system.  When you engage in battle you select an enemy and you can line up attacks. Using such an old combat model for this type of game is its downfall. I could look past some of the other aspects except this.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game is stable and runs smoothly. The graphics are dated, but they're not bad so to say. Just don't expect super beautiful graphics. The enviroments are also a bit shallow. Riverspring, during the riots felt a bit bland to my taste. There was none of that true hateful spirit! You need to play the game to see for yourself. Apart from that the game hasn't aged well. It feels like it was made back in 2000.\n\nBut what about the story? The thing that made me a big fan of GoT is the story, which in this case this game has remained loyal to. The game takes place before the events of the first book, in a simpler time when Robert Baratheon was still whoring away, Eddard Stark's head was still on his shoulders and the realm was finally in peace after the downfall of the Targaryens. Some of the cast members from the show lent their voices! I was absolutely surprised when I heard Varys' spidery voice narrating the intro and good ol' Jeor Mormont giving orders to the Night's Watch. It's those little things that make this game so special.\n\nIt has it's flaws but if you are willing to overlook the outdated game mechanics, I recommend this. It's a must-get for any true GoT fan (It's better for readers of the book, but show-watchers are welcome to try it!) If you want a proper quality GoT experience, play Telltale's Game of Thrones game. There is far more polish and TV-esque story than this.\n\nEDIT: Oh and I forgot to mention the voice acting. Apart from the cast who lent their voices (which sound just like in the show!) some of the voices can sound uninspired, like when they're saying, "OH MY GOD WE'RE GONNA DIE!" They sound sort of bored. Not all the voices are like that, but some definetly are.","September 1, 2014","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From really the start of the game it will pull you in and get you invested in the two main heroes and their cause. And will give you the "game of thrones" treatment story wise until the very end.\n\nThe game does have it's flaws - and i would suggest you watch at least a minor youtube clip to see that you can handle the a bit strange 3rd person view. Also the AI is pretty dumb in most situations, but the combat, once you get used to it, feels solid and challenging enough to not get boring, and the AI being predicatble can be considered a good thing, as it allows youto build up your own strategy of how to deal with different groups of enemies.\n\nPlays well with KB/Mouse, no problems at all. And the graphics options and toggles that you would expect a PC game to have are all there.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nGreat game, with a great story, that looks a bit dated, but doesn't have any major glaring bugs and accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is tell you a story while giving you enough gameplay in between to make you feel apart of the story and that what you do matters.","December 18, 2013","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

yep, a 'unconsented sexual intercourse'/murder/incest fantasy. seek professional help. im aware that now i have angered about half the population of planet earth but i dont care much as i dont have a high opinion of the human race anyway. i have a small excuse for playing the game, it was a part of a bundle, got decent reviews, so here we are.)\n\ni was a part worried, having played of orks and men recently and, well, i didnt like it much. however many problems with that (somewhat later!) game were not present in got.\n-the attribute/ability/skill/trait system was much more refined and i felt actually compelled to think ahead and plan for my two characters.\n-in got you have much more freedom (something i very much appreciate in an rpg), you can travel back and forth, find new quests or secrets you missed.\n-it is more pleasing to the eye.\n-voice acting was great in both games, with a few miscasts (for minor characters) i guess they had to ask the janitor to fill in,\n-path finding is much better in got, there was only a few times when the not-player-controlled-character stuck somewhere (although there was a fun moment when the dog was stuck on a stairs under mors, both becoming unmovable).\n-i played alaster as assassin, there wasnt much assassiny about him: couldnt sneak, and poisoned blades should be maybe used in more covert fashion. at least we had the hound...\n-as with of orks and men music wasnt very memorable but fit right in, nothing to complain about (uh, i guess maybe it was from the tv show soundtrack and it might be an anthem or something for got fans, sorry about that.)\n-sounds are funny when you approach a group of people talking, it starts and ends abruptly getting close or putting some distance between you and them. no worries, there are subtitles (which behave similarly btw) and they are on a repeat mode. you can listen in to every discussion you want.\n-here, developers decided to make better equipment available to you as you progress in the game, not to throw the best stuff at you in the beginning. how traditional, how dull (sarcasm, see ooam.)\n-the game behaved reasonably well while alttabbing, not rock solid, there were a few crashes but nothing too frustrating. however i always had to mute the game as it doesnt turn off the sound when its in the background. minor inconvenience.\n-and again, talk, talk, talk. and again, i like a good story, when the game isnt only about shooting, butchering (heh), blowing things up, but sometimes the game felt like a - somewhat - interactive novel. maybe i had problems only with the distribution of the fighting and talking scenes, im not sure, but in hindsight there were times when you talked for half an hour then ran around with the dog for half an hour then fouught for half an hour (half an hour=might have been much more).\n-at least you can skip dialogue lines and cut scenes. not recommended btw only if you screwed up something and have to reload, but still, - though a feature which is common in the past 10 years - big step ahead from ooam.\n-lenghtier than ooam, steam says i played 40 hours but considering my abuse of alttabbing its probably between 30-35.\n-this also had some frustrating points, like the mark on your map showing an exit to your quest often led to a closed portal,\n-or you could reforge that damned valyrian (or something) sword to anything - except for what i wanted, a two-handed mace,\n-or the clunkiness of the character/inventory screens,\n-or a lot of (small) things i cannot remember and cant check as i - celebrating having the game finished - deleted it immediatelly.\n\ni enumerated faults and only improvements to my not-so-good experience with ooam but do not fret: this is a worthy game. far, faaar from being among the best, but a solid experience, entertaining, well written and most of the time quite well designed.\nif you like the subgenre i think the deciding factor might be, where do you stand with game of thrones, the franchise. if you like it, im sure you will enjoy it quite much.\nif your stomach tends to turn on describing or even depicting of incest and the most hideous kinds of 'unconsented sexual intercourses' and most vicious murders - well this might not be for you.\ni enjoyed the story and the solid gameplay but im sure ill never want to do anything with got again. telltale got? im sorry, so long, and thanks for all the fishies!\nstill, ill wave the 'recommended' flag, as this game is a good effort, a worthy game, and im sure that many people with stronger stomachs (god, seems theres a lot of them!) would enjoy.\n\nEDIT: 'unconsented sexual intercourse': you know what. quite hypocritical from valve, filtering the r word while selling a game which is full of it. urinates me off a bit.","April 5","true","40.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you wish to embark in this marvelous journey, prepare yourself to almost regret your purchase. Almost. First few chapters are boring, gameplay brings nothing new to the table, it's just a copy paste of RPGs like Dragon Age: Origins. There are few things to do and even fewer places to explore besides whats presented to you in the main quest line. The story of the game deals with small matters compared to what the books are all about and, although you will meet with famous characters and visit famous locations, you'll leave no permanent mark on the events that set out the war of the five kings.\n\nBut that's exactly the point of the story on this game, however. You don't matter, your little affairs don't matter and ♥♥♥♥ you for thinking otherwise. The narrative on this thing is so cold and real it will make you think Martin wrote it himself. There are plot twists galore, plenty of dear characters dying and the bitter reality hitting like a brick every now and then. You'll be playing as Mors, a man of the Night's Watch, and Alester, a heir to lands in Westeros who became a Red Priest while in exile, only to return and witness the damage his absence caused to the lands he was supposed to rule. You'll grow to like these characters for what they are and, likewise, you'll grow to like the game's story. Hopefully, you'll put up with the game's bland mechanics and even have some fun with it once you understand that nothing in this game's game play is objectively bad, its just not revolutionary.\n\nYes, get this game. It'll start out a 2/10, but it will become a 8/10 by the time you're done with it, believe me.\n\nGameplay - 5/10\nSoundtrack - 8/10\nGraphics - 7/10\nContent - 3/10\nChallenge Level - 4/10\nReplayability - 0/10","May 31, 2015","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is nowhere as bad as the reviews claimed. In fact, it's pretty good. It does have faults: very linear, mediocre level design, and very few NPCs make the game world kind of boring. However, the combat is pretty good (especially if you play on hard) and the character builds are different enough from eachother to make more than one playthrough worth while. But the real reason to play this is the storyline. I'm a big fan of the books and I was actually kind of impressed how the writers for this managed to replicate pretty accurately everything that is great about the books, without seeming like they are merely rehashing pre-existing storylines. It even had a couple twists that genuinely surprised me, which was nice.\n\nThere might be better RPGs out there in terms of gameplay, but if you like the GOT universe or just like games that put story before all else (even, sometimes, at the cost of gameplay) then this is well worth a playthrough.","October 27, 2012","true","44.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

George R.R Martin helped write it and you can tell, especially with all the intrigue and twists and turns. The game suffers from annoying combat mechanics and there isn't that much to do besides the main quest and one or two side quests, but it is a perfect game for any hardcore ASOIAF fans.\n\nThe story is great and you play as two main characters, and you visit many places throughout the game. The iconic locations are in such as Castle Black and King's Landing, you can go to Mole's Town as well. But most of the NPC in the game just stand around and offer nothing to the story but to make the locations look full of life. You can also hear the authentic voices of Joer Mormont and Varys, and the voice acting of the two main characters is great also.\n\nThe combat is a good system, but the annoyance is being ganged on upon by 5-6 enemies at a time. Even on the easiest difficulty the combat was annoying, not hard, just a pain. Many times I just wanted to skip the combat and advance throughout the story. Levelling up is cool, and there are alot of cool items in the game. My character for example was weilding Ser Duncan's sheid, and you can even use The Red Viper's spear. Those items are included with the Weapon Pack DLC though.\n\nEach "Chapter" in the game has the main quest and 1-2 side quests you can do. Side quests usually help you out later with the main quest if you accomplish them. But once you complete the quests there is nothing to do in the game but maybe fight in the arenas to get more cash. Making cash is easy, just sell all the stuff you don't have. No need to really fight for it.\n\nThe game is great for all ASOIAF and GOT fans to enjoy. The story is great and you will feel for the characters, but just remember in GOT their is no such thing as a happy ending.","September 14, 2015","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't really have much exploration, but a number of interesting side quests and hidden loot should keep you occupied. The combat system is very dynamic and well thought through, with skills of different characters complementing each other. Brilliant voice acting, likable characters and a thrilling plot with numerous twists and (as far as I know) four different, moving and emotional endings. I'd recommend the DLC pack, since the new weapons can give you quite an edge in battle, it lets you replace the skin of Mors' butt-ugly dog and adds a bonus quest that tells the badass story behind Mors' nickname  and presents some stunning visuals from the top of the Wall.","October 2, 2015","true","44.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played many other RPGs before but this is one where you really had to think hard about every decision and their long term consequences.  You don't get to create your own characters but you really get immersed in the ones they present to you with their complicated back stories.  Neither are 'bad' or 'weak' character types and there is still a lot of freedom to choose your class and develop them how you want.  It's the true art of role playing to act and think like someone from a differnt time.  You realize how difficult survival and finding allies can be very quickly in this story when everyone has their own motivations that don't mirror your own.  There are multiple endings which leave some things left unanswered but I enjoyed that since it gives room for the imagination to determine how you would react to the situation based on how you played your characters.","October 8, 2015","true","35.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the story alone I would recommend GOT.\n\nAt first I was not impressed with the combat but as the game progressed and the 2 heroes united I felt the game take on a different tone. More abilities became available and maybe sticking with the same 2 characters I learned how to use them effectively and had a more enjoyable time. Combat became more frequent which may also had something to do with my enjoyment.\n\nI am still not a complete fan of the combat system however it is used in several of the DEVs games. As is the same awful camera controls. Once I got over the fact I would experience at times not being able to see my characters fully while in combat and during some cut scenes having my character stuck in a door or looking through my companions head or at a wall(etc...) I didn't hate it as much.\n\nWhen I play I think of replayability. At first I thought NO. however during my game I rethought that and even though I would not immerse myself in the dialogue as I did It still may be fun trying the different combat stances and actually striving to finish all the side quests. I also think of bang for the buck(joy for the price) and since I bought GOT at a huge discount I definitely got my moneys worth for 1 play and if I do come back in a month or more than the bang will only increase.","September 17, 2015","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

George R.R Martin helped write it and you can tell, especially with all the intrigue and twists and turns. The game suffers from annoying combat mechanics and there isn't that much to do besides the main quest and one or two side quests, but it is a perfect game for any hardcore ASOIAF fans.\n\nThe story is great and you play as two main characters, and you visit many places throughout the game. The iconic locations are in such as Castle Black and King's Landing, you can go to Mole's Town as well. But most of the NPC in the game just stand around and offer nothing to the story but to make the locations look full of life. You can also hear the authentic voices of Joer Mormont and Varys, and the voice acting of the two main characters is great also.\n\nThe combat is a good system, but the annoyance is being ganged on upon by 5-6 enemies at a time. Even on the easiest difficulty the combat was annoying, not hard, just a pain. Many times I just wanted to skip the combat and advance throughout the story. Levelling up is cool, and there are alot of cool items in the game. My character for example was weilding Ser Duncan's sheid, and you can even use The Red Viper's spear. Those items are included with the Weapon Pack DLC though.\n\nEach "Chapter" in the game has the main quest and 1-2 side quests you can do. Side quests usually help you out later with the main quest if you accomplish them. But once you complete the quests there is nothing to do in the game but maybe fight in the arenas to get more cash. Making cash is easy, just sell all the stuff you don't have. No need to really fight for it.\n\nThe game is great for all ASOIAF and GOT fans to enjoy. The story is great and you will feel for the characters, but just remember in GOT their is no such thing as a happy ending.","September 14, 2015","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story in itself is very good, though the game is no where near as polished as it should be.\n\nThe combat can be clunky as whilst it isnt turn based (You assign skills in a slowed down real time), it can be very repetitive and there are often clipping issues where the characters will either occupy the same space or "vibrate" when they are standing half inside a wall. The system itself though is pretty easy to master once you understand the roles of each character (I always use Mors as a Landed knight and so he "tanks" whilst Alester can damage the enemy)\n\nThe quest system can be frustrating too if you are new to RPG's as if you miss a slight detail, you will pretty much fail the side quests. Most of the side quests can be completed over several chapters, but if you miss a specific pickup that starts the quest in the chapter where it has become available then you won't be able to complete the quest once you have moved on in the story. This can be awkward for achievment hunters.\n\nI do wonder how this story would have turned out if it had been developed by a bigger studio, as it is clear that the writers have tried to keep everything in keeping with the lore of Westeros. It does kind of feel like this game was made by a company who snapped up the license before anyone else could and then they rushed to push out the game to cash in.\n\nAll of that being said, if you are a fan of Game of Thrones and old style RPG's then I would recommend you buy this just for one playthrough. If you arent happy with slow turn based combat and linear levels, then I simply would not. I would also say that this game is not worth the full price and you should wait until you see it on sale somewhere.\n\n","February 27","true","80.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's a big plus.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the rest of the game makes it seem as if the entire budged was thrown at exactly that, and everything else was rushed or just left alone.\nThere's constant flickering in some textures. When starting combat there's a very colorful, mosaic-like plane on the sword for a second. A lot of the animations are rather unnaturally looking. Example of this is heads turning far further back than humanly possible. Walking pases are off, the lip-sync looks like people didn't even try to sync it.. Being someone familiar with 3D modelling and animation I can tell you that this is rather poorly done. The textures are low resolution, too.\n\nThe dialogue is rather cringe-worthy at times and there are a lot of aspects that make this game not hold true to the actual environment of the universe. One immediate example is the Night's Watch. In this game they have good armour, a lot of food, halls are lit and seem warm. Whereas we know that the Night's Watch isn't being looked after in the books and the show. They need men, they need supplies; they don't have good armour.\n\nThe dialogue, as mentioned before, is pretty cringy. Something that seemed odd to me was (close to the beginning) that I, as Mors, got to carry out the death sentence of the first guy I track. That's a commander's duty, not mine. I'm some ranger, a good one yes, but I am still just a ranger. Some of the dialogue options you get are really bad and don't keep you immersed at all. Everything just seemed very forced.\n\nThe combat is rather lackluster. This kind of combat is good (like in Dragon Age) but it has to be done well.\n\nAll of this combined made it very hard to enjoy any of the story.\n\nI know this isn't a great review at this point, I'll probably edit and fill it out later. But as of now I'd say don't get this game unless you get it in some bundle. I'm sure there are some people who could find enjoyment in this, but then again there are people who enjoy Goat Simulator P:\nJokes aside, I don't mean to bash this game; 3D animation and modelling is hard not to mention putting all of that together into a working game.\n\nBasically; some may like this and some may not. It depends on you, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you're really that GoT-starved that you need anything you can get, go for it.\n\nNOTE: my playtime is rather low, keep in mind I played this game offline, too.","February 18","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story in itself is very good, though the game is no where near as polished as it should be.\n\nThe combat can be clunky as whilst it isnt turn based (You assign skills in a slowed down real time), it can be very repetitive and there are often clipping issues where the characters will either occupy the same space or "vibrate" when they are standing half inside a wall. The system itself though is pretty easy to master once you understand the roles of each character (I always use Mors as a Landed knight and so he "tanks" whilst Alester can damage the enemy)\n\nThe quest system can be frustrating too if you are new to RPG's as if you miss a slight detail, you will pretty much fail the side quests. Most of the side quests can be completed over several chapters, but if you miss a specific pickup that starts the quest in the chapter where it has become available then you won't be able to complete the quest once you have moved on in the story. This can be awkward for achievment hunters.\n\nI do wonder how this story would have turned out if it had been developed by a bigger studio, as it is clear that the writers have tried to keep everything in keeping with the lore of Westeros. It does kind of feel like this game was made by a company who snapped up the license before anyone else could and then they rushed to push out the game to cash in.\n\nAll of that being said, if you are a fan of Game of Thrones and old style RPG's then I would recommend you buy this just for one playthrough. If you arent happy with slow turn based combat and linear levels, then I simply would not. I would also say that this game is not worth the full price and you should wait until you see it on sale somewhere.\n\n","February 27","true","80.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Water Dancer mechanics don't really work, archers are useless. When not watching cut scenes or holding absurdly long conversations the game is little more than a treasure hunt with some random mindless killing. There is one puzzle, but it is so simple a child could solve it in seconds. The options for Mors have very little bearing on the story at all, not mych better for Alester - though at least some choice there. But bugs, wow so many little areas with glitches in them.

They cloud our minds with bias and wishful thinking, reality mostly struggles to fulfill." - A chev. medium\nForeword: I didn't read the books yet, because it mostly wouldn't be healthy to do so and watch the show the same time. First you'd of course spoiler yourself, second you'd be unsatisfied with script author's decisions, as usual. But no matter if you're a fan of the show or of the books, it's just happening in Westeros with the famous characters near you. Yet, there's a bitter truth about this game: Not everything that shines is gold.\n\n\nAs there were rumors about this in reviews lately, I decided to clean up some misinterpretations... Let's see what's truly going on with this title:\n\n___________________________________________\n- About: "There seem to be no promised show characters!"\nThere are definitely characters from the show and you come them as close as you do in Telltale's GoT, while here you have the comfort, that it's not just english language support, plus synchronization from the show.\n\nExample without big spoiler: Lord Varys, who also speaks the intro sequence you get to see when launching a new game. And that's just one of them.\n\n___________________________________________\n- About: "Really bad fighting"\nControls and Gameplay are nearly the same like in Dragon Age then. If you didn't like that one's combat system you will hate this, because it's kinda unhandy and I struggeled myself to get used to it. But as soon as you know, it's no "Mount & Blade"-, "Devil May Cry"- or Hack'n'slay-gameplay style, there's no\n\nYes it's old, or "outdated" by now, (remember, it's from 2010 meanwhile) but Gothic also is and both are still great RPGs. I also found myself being unable to replay Elder Scrolls: Morrowind, because nowadays we're so flashed by few really great RPG's (Witcher, Fallout, TES:Skyrim, ...) entertainment span, that some old classics has became too uncomfortable for us to play anymore.\n\n___________________________________________\n- About: "Story bad, gameplay bad, overall bad"\nDepends on someone's taste. Some ppl like tea with cherry cake, but is it a bad mix, because more ppl love coffee with strawberry cake?\n\n/Story (Staying vague intentionally to avoid twists and spoilers.)\nThe story is definitely not "bad", it's kinda how you would expect it from the show. You don't play any superhero or a famous character from the show. It's like the Foresters are in Telltale's GoT Adventure. A small Family(house) that serves the greater houses like Lannisters or the Starks. Two stories about two men, who have some things in common, like the Lannisters as their liege lords and things to regret in their past. A thing players more and more seem to forget, while getting fed with "better games" where you are mostly in a superior position or have advantages against the AI: Modesty.\nWhy? Well, for a game, set in the GoT world for me it's important to keep our feet firmly on the ground, because even it's a low fantasy setting, it must maintain a balance of power, else it becomes implausible to the show's logic.\n\n/Gameplay\nUnhandy, but you can get used to it.\nLet's have a little comparison: Did you play Dark Souls? Well, I'm a convinced keyboard player, (because I wouldn't have bought a good PC if I still wanna play with any gamepad) and thus playing this 3rd person game without a gamepad is one ugly hell of character control, which is bound to a poorly/boring programmed combat system & therefore a no-go-game for me. It was a "Prepare to die"-Edition because of a control setup rage attack ;) But ppl loved it, so it seems not too painful to get used to a lesser impossible control setup, I would assume.\n\nOf course that claim: "Spectacular and tactical challenging combats" (re-translated from description) would be more true, if you cross out the "spectacular", but that's artist's freedom in advertising, isn't it...\n\n/Overall\nThere has been a lot of potential to make this game really epic, there's nothing to say against this charge, but it could've also been much worse, like GoT Genesis, which is hardly hitting the world's edge, while it doesn't really feel like being involved in Westeros. It feels like a mod for a strategy game which has Dragons and a world map, just painted in GoT colors. So it's no endless game, but if you can accept its weaknesses once and for all you might actually start to enjoy the story. You won't be flashed, since this game is not even near the scale "perfect", but you could get entertained.\n\n___________________________________________\n- About: "Voice acting is awful"\nI don't know how entirely how it is in english, because I take the chance to change the language to my native, as there's the rare spread option for it. For me it's like: "You'll never experience things the same intense level, as you would in the language you're usually dreaming in."\nBut after I played the DLC(untranslated) it seems like the voice acting problems are in both languages quite similar, so I think, it's been treated a bit shabby, but at least they managed it to have voice acting in more than one language and that's a plus for non-native english ppl.\nOther examples for poor (translated) voice acting performance: "Mass Effect 1"\n\n___________________________________________\n- About: "The game is linear"\nIf you read "linear" and think of a timeline that progresses, then =true.\nElse: If you think "linear" means that decisions doesn't have consequences than it's simply false.\nNowhere this game is listed as "open world" so I don't know where expectations here turned wrong... If you don't have an open world, you always have a red line. The entire Mass Effect- and partially Dragon Age-Saga(DA:Inquisition excluded) use that progress principles. The only difference in that critic point is, that both Bioware franchises offer the option to make sidequests in an individual order.\n\nConclusion/Advice:\nBuy it when it's on sale, open your mind and you'll experience an semi-retro, tactical RPG you won't regret.\n\nI played it, as it has been released then and not a long time ago I re-installed it again to take one of the rare story driven, RPG journeys in Westeros. So there's a way to play it longer than 30 minutes, if you can overcome your nowaday's expectations and enjoy the way instead of racing for the finish line ;)","June 5","true","54.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
