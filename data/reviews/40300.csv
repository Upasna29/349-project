"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJinxed/recommended/40300/","MrJinxed","Jinxtah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrJinxed/","511 products in account","I did not know what I was getting myself into when I first started this game.\nNot at all actually, as I had no knowledge of what the game even was apart from being an RPG. I hadn't read any sort of reviews, seen movies, or anything of the sort.\nThis is far less impressive than it might sound, as I had gotten the game through a bundle (humble bundle) with a bunch of other games, and if I'm being honest I only started playing for the trading cards I would get. The original plan I had was just to play for a few minutes to see what it was, and if it was anything worth spending time on. I fully expected just to tab out after a few minutes and let it run in background until I got the card drops, and then proceed to uninstall and never touch it again.\n\nWhat I found though, was something I could not put down. 37'ish hours later and I've completed the game in just a few short days. It was one helluva experience.\n\nThe game started out quirky in that combat was not really that good, but since I was just playing for a few minutes anyway, I decided to roll with it, and slay a few monsters. I barely survived the first few encounters, and had to scour the beach where you start for supplies to munch on in order to regain some health.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of game time, I was hooked. Not since Gothic had I played such a game that was this punishing yet satisfying. I found I could go anywhere, but quickly learned what monsters to stay away from. In the beginning I could hardly kill the most simple monsters, and I couldn't understand why when I leveled up, nothing happened and I apparently couldn't put points in anywhere. Having played Gothic, I figured I'd stumble upon the solution before long with some sort of trainers, and as it turns out, that was exactly the case. You see, skills have a set number of levels, and you need to put a big amount of points into them to become truly good at something, be it using a bow, casting a spell, using a sword, or sneaking, pickpocketing and so on. The only problem is, there isn't enough points for everything because monsters don't respawn, so what you see is what you get (with a very few exceptions between chapters), so there's no grinding in this game, which is great, but also forces you to choose a few skills and stick with them, because being a jack of all trades in this game just isn't as good as a specialist.\n\nFast forward 24 hours of gameplay time and I'm still in the first chapter, and had explored most of the island and killed most of the available mobs instead of going to the first town and progressing the story. It was tough, but I learned a lot about combat, and how to fight the various monsters.\n\nSpeaking about combat, when you decide upon melee weapon style (staff, axe, sword), you can level it up to level 10, and with each new level you gain faster speed, or more manuerability, and learn to make consecutive swings. This allows you to string together a flurry of combos which makes short work of enemies you had previous thought were neigh impossible to deal with.\n\nI played 26 or so hours with no armor at all, as there was simply none available until a certain point in the story (chapter 2). This meant the game was a lot tougher than it needed to be, but also a lot more rewarding, as I had to master the not so easy to learn intricacies of combat in Risen. However, even with armor, I found the monsters a challenge throughout the game, and at no point did I find I could just rush through any opponent.\nSome block, some rush, some dodge your attacks and leap towards you, and some sidestep you in the middle of your attack and come at you from the side. Some still parry your blows and counter them. And of course some just use brute force. The game also likes to throw packs at you, almost never allowing you to fight a single monster at a time, but often up to 6 or even 8. It forces you to plan ahead, and know your terrain and so on, which makes for a great and memorable experience.\n\nThe game lasted me around 37 hours, and I am blown away over how great it was. There were hardly any bugs. In fact the only bugs I came across were me getting stuck on terrain after having jumped where I shouldn't jump, or just getting unlucky with landing a couple of times. I could count the number of times it happened on 1 hand though, and with the amount of quicksaving this game forces you to do, it was never a problem. I'm amazed how well polished the game was. You could argue that it's an older game, but that doesn't mean anything in terms of bugs. Most games never fix even the most horrendous bugs if they don't catch it in the first few patches, so this was both surprising, and gratifying.\n\nI could write volumes about the story and the locations you visit, but as I don't want to spoil things, I'll just say that it's one of those stories that starts you off with a blank slate, where you don't know anything about anything to begin with, and you soon have to rescue the world type of scenarios. Don't get me wrong, the story was actually ok, and the game forces you to choose sides rather early in the game. I did not regret my decision, but I do kinda wish I could see the other part. I have read it makes very little difference, and it's just a few quests which all end in chapter 1, but I'm not about to replay the game just to experience an hours worth of quests, so no matter.\n\nAll in all it was a really enjoyable experience, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. Just be warned, it is not one of those mainstream games where you can breeze through. The combat is tough as nails, and nobody is going to hold your hand. If you played Gothic and liked it, chances are you will love this game.","June 8, 2014","true","39.4"," 145 of 150 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","145","150","0","9"

Instead of just picking the best you find you can just target the best weapon and go and get it. This can be addictive but it gets tiring using the same armour for a longer period\nConclusionRisen is a great game, it is, but it is also not for everyone. Risen is made by Piranha Bytes which is based in Germany. It is a small studio which is why you cannot expect a big franchise here. Piranha Bytes became famous with Gothic and Risen is Gothic through and through. If you're already a Gothic fan then you probably do not need to get told to buy this game. Unfortunately after Gothic 3 Piranha Bytes got into an argument with their old publisher, Jowood, and the rights of Gothic went to them. Piranha Bytes is a small studio and very passionate about their game which is why this was quite tragic. Gothic 4: Arcania was produced by another studio and became a mess. After Gothic 4 the rights went back to Piranha Bytes but it was too late since the storyline was already ruined with Gothic 4. Risen is an attempt at recreating Gothic from scratch and the game plays exactly like Gothic did.\n\nThis game is very old-fashioned and inconvenieent. Do you remember old games where just opening the map was annoying but you played it anyway because you get used to it? This is the type of game Risen is. The combat system is annoying when you compare it to other titles where you press a few buttons and you've  gotten a few thousand kills while checking what's on the TV. As a new player you are going to die against any beast until you learn to double-tap S to dodge attacks. If you are someone who enjoys RPGs in general then get this game, you won't regret it. If you are someone who likes RPGs 'as long they're great' then just save yourself the trouble as you'll probably stop playing due to it being too annoying and you're not willing to adapt. If love RPGs then prepare to become part of the franchise as there are already Risen 2 and 3 that will advance in the story. I would rate this game 7/10 for reasons explained above. This is not a bad rating, it just simply is not for everyone. Personally I have greatly enjoyed Risen and am very motivated to begin my adventure in Risen 2: Dark Waters.\n\nThis game was played at maximum settings on this system:\nMonitor: BenQ XL2420T[www.amazon.co.uk]\nGPU: Sapphire Tri-X R9 290[www.scan.co.uk]\nCPU: Intel Core i5-4670[www.amazon.co.uk]\nRAM: Kingston HyperX Blu 4x4[www.amazon.co.uk]\nMotherboard: MSI Z87-G45\nSSD: Samsung SSD 830[www.amazon.co.uk]\n\nIf you have any further questions or are still unsure if you should buy it feel free to ask.","November 24, 2014","true","93.2"," 119 of 132 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","119","132","6","0"

However, as soon as your character talks to those NPCs they feel like flashed out personalities and help create that feel of immersion that makes this game great imho.\nFurthermore, there is no pre-game class selection and only over time will one decide if he is to become a mage or a warrior. A sword/axe fighter can still use and depending on the skills one chooses to learn even may be able to create spell scrolls as well as a mage might be using a sword.\nOverall this one can be a very nice experience if one is able to look past its dated-look!","January 19, 2014","true","45.0"," 83 of 88 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","83","88","0","0"

I got it with the Deep Silver Humble Bundle a while ago, and it just gathered dust in my Steam library at first, with 0 hours of play time, not thinking it could be anything amazing or out of the ordinary. I was very wrong.\n\nRisen is a third-person RPG with a strong story with multiple pathways towards the end and a lot of ways to get rid of your enemies. The combat system got me intrigued after the first Hungry Sea Vulture I had to kill. It's tough, I won't lie, almost every battle is going to be a challenge and will deserve a quicksave, but it's fair and very rewarding. Also, it helps that you can approach combat in a lot of ways, depending on your specialisation, ranging from swords and staffs to magic bullets and bows.\n\nThe story is quite strong and well thaught, but not necessarily the best. What I appreciated though, is the fact that your actions have a strong impact in the game world, and you actually feel like something has changed. This is helped by the fact that some quest lines have different outcomes, depending on who you choose to help. (The Steelbeard/Romanov/Patty ordeal). You have 2 main story branches that meet somewhere in the middle, after around 10-15 hours. Yes, the game is pretty long, around 25-30 hours. but it never gets boring or repetitive. The replay value is also big. You can play it twice, for both sides of the story, or 4 times for the full combat experience.\n\nI whole-heartedly recommend this game.","February 16, 2014","true","85.9"," 76 of 80 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","76","80","0","0"

Untill now. But because i never write reviews, i will keep this very short and not go deep into the details.\n\nI have very high standards for combat difficulity, so i played Risen on hard mode and finished it today. The combat is the best and most enjoyable combat i have ever seen (together with Dark Souls) and the difficulity and learning curves for talents and fighting styles was just perfect. The way of getting new armor, new weapons, quests and crafting everything was just absolutely amazing and immersive at its best. For me personally, Risen is by far the best rpg single player i have ever played and to be honest i enjoyed Risen more then The Witcher, Dragon Age and every other popular rpg games i have played and the graphics of Risen are so enchanting and immersive to me i find it is much better then the other rpg game released even to this date!\n\nA quote from a reviewer two days ago:\n\n" But worst of all, and this is unforgivable, it fails to get you to care "\n\nI personally disagree. One of the reason why Risen is my number one rpg is that it compelled me to care so so much about every item in my inventory and keeping it organized, keep track of everything i find, every descision i had to make when distributing my skill points, every progress of every quest, every location, i cared for it all like i never had done in any other rpg game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/40300/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Risen is tailored for a niche audience, the hardcore RPG crowd. If you've never played a Gothic game before, then Risen might be a great place to start--if you know what to expect.\n\nWithout some explaination, you might find the game a deeply flawed, boring experience or you may grow fond of the game despite its faults. The worst flaw that would otherwise make this a classic is its replayabilty, specifically past Chapter 1.\n\nA Beginner's Guide\nI'm going to save you hours of trouble with some useful tips.\n\nOne, turn the difficulty down to Easy--trust me, you'll thank me for Chapter 3. (See Padding.)\n\nTwo, there is always another option. Magic can be just as practical to non-mages to beat the game.\n\nHere are some helpful reminders on how to win:\n\nBe flexible. (Weapons, magic, talents.)\nStay focused. (Find your specialization fast and treat every encounter as a threat.)\nExplore. (There are many paths--some rewarding, some punishing.)\nThree, exploit the game's looting mechanic. Whenever you knock down a human NPC, you can steal their stuff and they'll come right back with little to no punishment. (See a good weapon/shield? Take it.)\n\nFour, abuse the brewer for gold. In the Swamp, there is someone who will buy weed from you (10 for 70 pieces of gold). You can then beat him down, steal it back and sell  him the same stuff. This is a great way to earn gold if you are lacking funds, and because the game is difficult already I don't feel bad using the exploit.\n\nFive, get trained ASAP. The game won't let you max your character out with gold alone. You have to gain XP to earn Learning Points--I don't think there's a max level--which you can then use to earn talents (swords, sneak, etc.) as well as stat increases.\n\nSix, focus on talents and stats. Talents are to improve your character itself via better combat skills/animations; stats are to get you better gear. The game expects you to manage both as you'll need counter-parry for Chapter 3 enemies (+7 for Swords) as well as decent gear to deal out enough damage.\n\nIf you know this information before starting, then you'll have a much better time than most players. The game is intentionally brutal at the start, but it is the good kind of challenge where it relies as much on skill as awareness on your character. Get past that hurdle and you'll find a worthwhile experience in the first chapter of the game.\n\n(You're still going to die a lot.)\n\nSimple One Button Combat? No.\nRisen's combat is... complex. That's as nice and as nuanced as I can describe it, and in some ways I think the combat makes Dark Souls feel streamlined in comparison.\n\nYou can read the attacks of enemies--but the animations are somewhat sporadic and poor. You can use a wide array of attacks--when you unlock them. The game requires you to use your positioning, sometimes, but also mastering the parry system, other times.\n\nBut that's not what makes this game brutal to something like Dark Souls.\n\nYour character's animations are hampered at the start. You will notice a change in combat gameplay from the beginning of the game towards the end, so leveling up your talents and stats is mandatory to win. (Or you can be a bigger masochist.)\n\nFor example, in the early part of the game, you'll rely on dodging/faking-out enemy attacks than the late-game parrying system. Your animations improve and the enemies require different tactics.\n\nThis never felt aggrivating because the game felt designed that way.\n\nEnemies are not scaled to the player, discouraging players from areas they shouldn't be exploring, and the ones in my way were were reasonable compared to the hordes later on. And compared to the initial enemies, they do become more complicated towards the end--except for the Titan boss fight--that I was required to master my specilizations to win.\n\nHowever, what I don't understand is why the game locks your camera. It works for 1-1 engagements, but clunky when you have to fight multiple enemies at once. If they had enabled it as a lock-on button, then I wouldn't compliain.\n\nThe other main issue with combat is the lacking variety of enemies. You'll quickly notice color-palatte/text swaps and grow tedious of engagements. (Thankfully, enemies will taunt you before actually attacking you.)\n\nThese two problems don't detract from the thrill of every engagement, but they are areas of improvement and the monotony of the game is something that becomes a problem once the game falls short of its introduction.\n\nIt Begins...\nWhenever people praise Risen for its open-ended routes to play and the wonderful sense of world building, they are usually referring to the first chapter of the game. And there's a good reason why that is the case.\n\nIn the game's first hours, you find yourself in the conflict between the "freedom fighters" of the Don as well as the Inquisition's hold on the island with the mages' Monastary of the Order.\n\nSimple enough, right? You may be surprised to know that you actually have three initial paths to choose--all of which have multiple ways of accessing them. And in order to advance to Chapter 2, you have to visit three main areas of the game. Some are based on your choice; others on your failures.\n\nFor example, you could start by going to Harbour Town (a neutral area). To enter the town, you can bribe the guards to let you in or you can do some farmwork to sneak in. (Or you can be taken away by the guards to the Monastary for being outside the walls.) Once inside, you can do quests for either faction--be sure to choose one side for the best rewards--that will have multiple ways of success.\n\nFrom there, you can either enlist with the Inquisition to get some training (especially for magic) or you can meet with the thieves' leader to find the hidden exit that the Don's men use to  carry out ther operations. You'll either find yourself in the Swamp (the Don's headquarters) or the Monastary.\n\nOr you can start out in the Swamp to train your skills and rise up within the ranks doing laborous tasks that can be challenging early in the game. Then you'll recieve orders to find out the situation in Harbour Town and then set up a peace agreement at the Monastary. (This is the route I took for my playthrough.)\n\nOr you can be caught by the Order--at any point in the chapter--and forced to enlist.\n\nAs you can probably tell, there are many alternatives to choose. That's not even talking about the island itself. The island is actually a very contained, expansive environment that has multiple entrances and paths from one side of the island to the other. From Chapter 2 onwards you recieve teleportation stones to save time.\n\nWhile most games would portray one as the noble underdog and the other as the tyrrant, Risen doesn't portray either side as the good side. In fact, no one is the "good guy" other than how you portray your character.\n\nUnfortunately, the end of the first chapter is where the game begins to fall short of itself.\n\nMore Padding Than Necessary\nChapter 2 -4 suffer from serious padding. I wouldn't have a problem had the game not spammed enemies or deviated me to put me on fetch quests. It doesn't ruin the game, but I have little desire to replay past Chapter 1.\n\nI enjoyed the temple quests, but I wished the two factions were relevant. And because the three areas and the factions become forgotten, the game feels more linear than it is.\n\nIf the game simply condenced these chapters into one, I think it would be a masterpiece.\n\n"Rising Up, Back On the Street..."\nFunny enough, the Eye of the Tiger is an apt way to describe the "thrill" of Risen. For every failure, you learn something new--and that's the essential thing Risen does right.\n\nI wonder how many people will be forgiving of this game in a post-Steam refund world. It's a slow-burner RPG that warms the heart with enough time.","January 9","true","39.5"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","66","72","3","0"

This is a great game, if you loved Gothic 1 & 2, you will enjoy this immensely. The world is very well crafted and exploration is a huge part of this. Most importantly, it is what makes this game so good (hidden passages or secrets, loot which you will want to explore. I roamed the world for hours instead of doing the story related quests).\n\nI played this on Hard difficulty and often found myself getting owned, especially when I was getting sloppy in combat - 1 or 2 mistakes and you are eating dirt. That is a very refreshing thing in the age of "easy mode everything". The combat is decent and challenging almost till the end. However, it has some issues (targeting and monsters strangey dodging attacks even though you attack from the side or back etc.). That would be one of my only complaints. The game also doesn't take your hand and show you everything, you have to find out yourself (or read internet guides a lot).\n\nThe quests are also really good. One could complain that they only involve kicking butt and / or bribing someone, but there are multiple solutions to almost every quest and a lot of interesting choices. I also really like the gathering / crafting system, which is almost identical to the Gothic games - you will gather herbs and other materials in the world, but they are not a big, shining object which you will immediately notice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raduchi/recommended/40300/","raduchi","Raduchi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raduchi/","294 products in account","Risen (1) was a very interesting adventure for me. Growing up playing RPGs like Oblivion or Skyrim, I was never introduced into the more hardcore-ish subgenre. So naturally, it came as a surprise when the 1st creature I met was able to kill me in 4-5 hits, while I was still figuring out how attacking works.\nAfter finishing the game, with every quest except a few teleport stones left to acquire done, I was overrun by a sense of joy for finally getting rid of those Lizardmen (read: angry lizard DEVILS that don't care how much health you have and will still kill you in 1 combo because God doesn't love you), but at the same time a sense of regret for not exploring that road that I saw by chance, that I didn't take because i had something else to do, etc.\nThis is pretty much the entire pace of the game: You arrive on an island (read: crash in a very violent way) and wake up on a beach, with nothing but a stick and a useless female by your side, who you will ditch in the first 10 minutes of the game, never to see her again. From there, anything you do is guided only by your sense of curiosity and the choices you make. Some choices may be better, some may net you more gold, and some may help a poor woman survive through her illness, but what it matters is that its YOUR choice. By spending hours and hours travelling that island, killing those ANNOYING wolves that just DONT QUIT, you start to somehow love it, and want to see its people be safe and happy.\nAs seen in Skyrim, although this game is older, there is a moral choice that you must make between two factions at war, the Imperia.....uhm...Inquisition and the Don. Just like in Skyirm, one is looking out for the greater good on the long run of the whole population, while the other is looking out to its individuals just in the present. As always, there's fanatics, there's people who only care about money, and people who just want to be annoying (I'm looking at you, Romanov. Even  I had more gold on me than what was in that damned chest that everyone was fussing about.)\nThere's a lot of ups and downs in this game, the ups in the likes of finding a new awesome looking weapon/armor, and the downs being finding out that you STILL get 2-shotted by lizardmen because why not.\nThe quests are by no means boring from making you explore dungeons to having you fight Undead Lords for their rings to gathering that all-important Weed.\nAs a conclusion to my non-coherent review that says, in a lot of words, absolutely nothing, I would recommend this game to anyone with some spare time and a LOT of patience/skill. Its a great game, with a decent storyline and somewhat vast somewhat interesting world filled with somewhat annoying monsters that are somewhat repetitive.\nI'd give it a good 9 out of 10. And remember, dodging is your friend. Your ONLY friend.","October 7, 2015","true","38.1"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","34","37","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menycet/recommended/40300/","Menycet","Menycet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menycet/","246 products in account","Risen is a third-person action RPG that places you on a gorgeous and mysterious desert island named Faranga that's plagued by earthquakes and thunderstorms.\n\nLike in every Piranha Bytes game, you start out as a nameless protagonist. He survived a shipwreck and he's essentially a clean canvas that you have to build on. This allows you to think up a name and background for him (if you're one of those people who loves to make up stories and use your imagination), and your ideas will never be disproved during the game because neither the character's name nor his past is ever brought up.\n\nAlmost right off the bat you're told that sooner or later you'll need to join a faction, either the bandits in the Swamp Camp, who are outlaws and rebels in a sense, or the warriors or the mages of the Order of the Holy Flame that is now in control of the whole island.\n\nThe bandits use swords, maces, axes and bows; the Order's warriors fight with staves and use a bit of magic; and the Order's mages mainly use magic but can do a fair bit of staff fighting as well. This basically gives you different approaches to playing through the game and offers some replay value because picking a side gives you a different perspective on things. But everything still leads up to the same conclusion.\n\nPros:\n\n- A gorgeous island with lots of places to explore, treasures to find and monsters to fight. Most of the things that you find on the island are useful to you in some way, so exploration really pays off.\n- Killing a monster who you were too weak to take out before is quite satisfying.\n- In addition to doing more damage, you also acquire some new moves whenever you improve your fighting skills, and mages' spells become more powerful with each spell level.\n- Beautiful and memorable soundtrack.\n- The game takes about 30+ hours to complete which is a pretty decent amount of time for a rather linear type of RPG. There are 4 chapters overall.\n- A lot of the NPCs are quite interesting and seem to have distinct personalities, even if your interactions with some of them are rather brief.\n- All of the enemies (and even the animals!) dodge attacks, try to flank you or gang up on you etc, which makes the combat challenging and encourages you to stay alert.\n\nCons:\n\n- A few of the side quests might require you to do some research beforehand to get them done right because it's easy to f*ck things up by saying or doing the wrong thing.\n- Some bugs here and there that haven't been fixed to this day but, as far as I know, there aren't any game breaking ones. The latest unofficial patch has fixed some of them as well.\n- The island might be a bit too small for players who prefer an RPG with a huge open world.\n- Some might view the protagonist being a clean canvas as there being no real depth to him as a character.\n- Choices don't have any real consequences.\n- Learned skills can not be reset.\n- During the course of the game you find out about the real threat to the island and the people living on it but you never really *see* it. Some could argue that this adds an air of mystery and foreboding to the game but I just started to take the threat less seriously as time went on.\n- Lots of quicksaving and reloading that may become tedious.\n\nI enjoyed Risen despite all of the abovementioned cons. I think that this game has a lot to offer to any RPG fan and it definitely deserves a lot more attention than it got.","May 24, 2014","true","32.7"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","5"

This game definitely has a very unforgiving level of difficulty (especially for melee fighters) that is unusual for games today and plenty of interesting characters.  I did have a good time playing the game and "working" through it but some of the downsides include: repetitive backtracking, abusable ranged combat, predictable storyline, and far too simple puzzle mechanics.  On the other hand being a power warrior wielding a two-handed sword in one hand (a trained perk) alongside a shield, a crossbow strapped to my back with a slew of magical scrolls ready (for those not trained as mages) was an enjoyable sight.

First of all, the game doesn't just throw you into the world knowing certain basic skills (like sneaking, pickpocketing, lock-picking, etc). Anyone expecting "Skyrim with pirates" is going to be terribly disappointed, not because Risen is a bad game in itself, but because it's made to appeal a hardcore RPG crowd that enjoys games with more depth on characters, quest completion, exploration and looting. Risen excels in adding depth to all these elements, but that's not without its obvious flaws.\n\nCombat, while rewarding, feels excessively clunky. The camera usually tends to go a bit crazy when tackling with more than one enemy and animations look unnatural. It isn't until you begin to train on fighting skills and learn decisive combat moves like parrying when it starts to get fun and challenging.\n\nDuring the first couple of hours you're going to feel really lost. Without the help of quest markers you're going to have to find out how to continue with the quest on your own, which encourages you to rely on yourself instead of following a guided path with the help of a medieval GPS tracking system. There are no exclamation or interrogation marks on top of people's heads, so talking to them and finding out is the only way to begin quests. Memorizing where each character lives/works is recommended because you'll go back to them again and again on different missions, though Risen doesn't make that process easy either since almost all of the characters look exactly alike with some exceptions like hair color or clothes. Instead, you'll remember them because they each serve a different purpose in the community they belong to and feel like an important part of the world.\n\nCertainly, what I'm enjoying most about the game is the decision making. The island is mainly divided into three factions: The Inquisition who believe the artefacts from the temples that have just risen should be kept away because of the unknown power that lies within them; the Don's Men, who don't believe that the artefacts have any hidden power and instead want to loot these temples to sell them for gold; and the novices and mages who were trained by the Inquisition but do not want to become part of the Order; they sort of go by their own principles. The conflicts between both opposing factions are shown throughout the whole game and you will constantly be asking yourself which is actually the one you feel at ease with. The Inquisition, while imposing very restrictive laws and obliging every foreigner to enlist as a Warrior of the Order, certainly has a point when it comes to keeping the artefacts safe in case they have some hidden power. The Don, while being much less restrictive and welcoming, are all petty thieves who abuse shop owners for "protection" money. Each of them tries to lure you into joining their forces and give very good arguments (for example, the Don's men constantly tell you how the Inquisition doesn't really care about the island or the poor, while these same people are extorting money and commiting terrible crimes; on the other hand, the Inquisition still preaches about saving the people but are still very restrictive in certain aspects).\n\nWhen it comes to the looting system in this game, it isn't bad nor impressive either, it just serves its purpose: you collect things and then if you're experienced enough you can craft something with them.\n\nGraphically, the game is a hit and miss. The environments are lush and vibrant with life. The jungles look impressive because of the amount of vegetation everywhere, and shader/shadow effects look great too. Still, pop-up textures are fairly common here and there and characters look somewhat ugly.\n\nWith all this said, Risen makes up for a believable and immersive experience due mainly to its story, its characters, and its rewarding quest-making, but can only be enjoyed if you can overlook its flaws.","May 17, 2014","true","42.7"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","2"

I focus mostly on distraction and fun.\n\nYou really only need peek at the number of hours played to know that I thoroughly enjoyed Risen and recommend it. The graphics are good enough to keep me from cringing and closing it. I actually enjoyed the music and voice acting, especially Lena Headey, many of the quests and NPC interactions and even exploring and collecting.\n\nThe few things I found a bit disheartening were the finite number of foragables, the tapering off of NPC interaction as the game progresses and quests are completed, Andy Serkis did not have a flemmy-cat with a furball-cough at all and last but most definitely not least, the amount of rain in the swamps!

I'll tell you straight away: Risen is a masterpiece.\nRisen is a gorgeous looking game, in 2015 it still makes my eyes sizzle in pure pleasure, but in 2009 was no less than wonderful. Sure, it may have its shortcomings, like in female human models and npcs' aestethics overall, since they all basically have like ten faces in total. But it still manages to make npcs feel real, concrete, and a the same time parodic and funny. I won't ever stop repeating myself: Risen is a smelly game, in a good way. It manages to reproduce such dense atmospheres, with lush vegetation as well as sparkingly colourful environments and diverse climates. It feels like you can almost taste the salt and the humidity in the morning when waking up to a cozy sunrise in Harbour Town, and smell the tingling odor of brackish water. And good lord the soundtrack, it's not catchy by any means, but it is so fitting and captivating! It contributes strongly to the immersion. Risen embraces the player bringing him to Faranga without even asking, boots and all, like a good fairy-tale always should. Visually it hasn't aged one bit in the last 6 years, the presentation is still as effective as it was back in the days.\nWhen it comes to gameplay the only awkward moments arise when, during combat, the auto-targenting system kicks in and makes it quite hard not to hit innocents, forcing to reload. Zelda is perfect, you guys copy and paste that, we'll all be fine then. Still the combat is engaging, varied and most importantly based on skills, both the ones acquired while playing and the ones the players themselves possess. Which brings me to the most amazing aspect of the game: the roleplaying. The Piranha Bytes guys are true masters of their craft, and it shows in the rich and inspired dialogues, countless quotes, ironic moments and funny lines. When talking to an npc the player can really determine the course of action, choosing one path precludes other ones, but it often is more complex than just choosing A or B, rather the sum of actions brings you to intersect narrative lines through secondary quests, more similarly to a net than a tree. Skills are not unlocked just by repeating a single action, the player needs to spend experience points and gold to learn from various teachers all over the isle, and since Faranga's resources are limited it's impossible to simply grind a character to a godlike status: even in skills the player has to make choices which will not close any door in themselves, but the game still makes it so that it's not possible to just be everyone and do everything, like lesser rpgs allow. Roleplaying is about choice and consequence, and these devs got it and delivered one of the most refreshing, solid and engrossing games of the past generations, which will survive the test of time and be remembered as a pearl amongst pebbles.\n10/10, played it 8 times and still going.","July 5, 2015","true","29.4"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","1"

Here go the salutes from the troops) which is great.\nThe combat system gets good as you unlock skill levels in a type of fighting.\n\nNow for the problems :\nRisen tends to copy/paste encounters in the last part of the game. To the point of being absolutely awfully boring. You'll fight reptilian undead again and again and again.\nItemization is pretty straight-forward. Better weapons usually mean more damage and require more stats. Don't expect anything fancy. Even the massive legendary end-game weapon is actually a regular axe with a regular moveset.\nIn addition to copy/pasted encounters, have some copy/pasted quests ! Not only will you have to reckon the island to recover the necessary artifacts for the main quest to keep on at chapter II, you'll have to do it again at chapter IV !\n\nOverall though, it's mostly good. The end-game is very tedious though as I said but the experience you'll have is very satisfactory, mostly due to the different possiblities of progression (working for the don, being captured by the inquisitor's men, asking the mages to take you in) and the different quests you'll have in the different factions.\nConcerning the story, which I haven't really talked about, it got two axises : the first one is the struggle for the control of the island. This one is cool. The other one is the actual main story and, let's just say it's both cliché and boring.","May 9","true","41.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Well, you know the drill.\n\nI finally decided that this time when I started it, unless I got to the point where I really thought it stunk, I was going to finish it, regardless. Well, I finally did finish it and I truly enjoyed my experience. Once I got going, I found the game pulling me back and really looking forward to my free time to play it. It's a fun, charming game, in it's own way, but it's also fairly challenging and serious. (I also own Risen II and III, neither of which I've touched. So now, I'm looking forward to them both very much.)\n\nThe game does a good job leading you along to the point of having freedom of choice, but not feeling lost. And it really does offer you a lot choice... Who you ally with, who you tick off, what type of character build you want, where you are going to go next...

Risen feels more like Gothic game than Gothic 3 will ever do.\n\nI love Pyranha Bytes games. The third Gothic game maybe disappointed me a little but what they did with Risen game... wow. It feels so much like first Gothic game. I felt once again like a kid playing first Gothic game when it was out. It's simply amazing. Great atmosphere, great soundtrack, great graphics and open world which you want to explore. The story is fits fine for RPG game, characters and their stories are interesting and once again, you will need to decide whose fraction you will join. While fighting you feel respect towards monsters - you might know that from Gothic games but if you don't: one wrong move and you can lose your life. It starts rather easy, with a chance to encounter a "run for your life" monster and ends at "I want to run away from these dangerous beasts but I have no choice and I must fight it". If I can complaing about something...\n\n... yes, there are things in this almost perfect RPG game I didn't like much. Most annoying thing which made me start game again and again was jumping on platforms and climbing - I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M DOING WRONG, BUT WHY IS MY HERO FLYING TOWARDS SKY AND NOT COMING BACK, BUGGING WHOLE MENU. THE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT WAS TO EXIT GAME, START IT AGAIN AND LOAD LAST SAVE. Much later at game I bought over9000 levitation scrolls to avoid this annoying bug. While bugs are bugs, Risen have one thing which I'm really disappointed at. Like I said earlier, characters and their stories are interesting but they don't really feel anything towards main character. I didn't feel any friendships at all, nobody I could count on, nobody I could remember this much like some of first Gothic characters - and it's not only limited to friends, but enemies too. Maybe it's only me, maybe it's because I played this way not another.... dunno.\n\nSpending almost 50 hours in Risen and finishing it for the first time, I feel like there are still many things I left not finished and not discovered. Risen's world is big one, and playing a fine RPG game like this only once is really waste. There are also in game achievements, which can also count as reason to play Risen after beating game. I know I will be back one day to Risen and enjoy it like for the first time. Or maybe even more.","August 1, 2015","true","47.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","16","18","3","0"

Slow and tactical combat is still there, monsters are insanely brutal and quests very long. Only bigger con of this game is fairly weak ending, which forces you to run around the whole island(probably already totally explored) chasing bits of gear for the last boss fight that is more of a jumping and platforming puzzle than actual fight.

JoWood proceeded to prove that the failure was their own fault, by releasing the unspeakable horror that was Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods, and the complete snoozer that was Arcania: Gothic IV.\nMeanwhile, Piranha Bytes started from the ground up with a new world, new story, and new publisher, and gave us Risen, an RPG which restored faith in their ability to provide an essential open-world fantasy RPG. It's not perfect, but compared to Gothic 3, it is a masterstroke. The combat is skillful, though the auto lock-on can be a bit irritating. The variety of spells adds more interesting options to combat and exploration. The NPC's are all well-written and acted, including characters voiced by film veterans Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, and Lena Headey. The world is not to Elder Scrolls scale, but is full of hidden loot, challenging enemies, and sprawling yet expertly designed dungeons. Altogether, the game stands as a supreme tribute to the first two Gothic games that made Piranha Bytes a revolutionary figure in the RPG genre back in the years around 2000.\n\nPretty much the only thing I really disliked about this game was how much it got me to love it. Unfortunately, due to questionable decisions and a hope to really try something new, Piranha Bytes sunk the franchise into relative mediocrity with Risen 2: Dark Waters, only to be slightly redeemed in Risen 3: Titan Lords.","September 26, 2014","true","133.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

It is very much like Gothic 1 & 2. Characteristic features of these games are:\n\n- Exciting melee combat: just spam-clicking the mouse will get you nowhere, you need to actually think and time your moves (blocking, parrying, hitting). This is a challenging game, maybe even difficult for some.\n\n- Learning curve for your character: there isn't just a learning curve for the player but for the character, too. He needs to learn to fight better. As the game progresses and you level up, you actually feel your character get better. At first, his fighting style is pretty clumsy and you can barely kill a wolf. But later on, you'll fight with more style and finesse, and you can start killing stronger monsters that you had to avoid before.\n\n- Factions: there are three factions you can join. Each faction has their own set of preferred skills, weapons and armor. This adds to replayability. Playing a mage type character will be a completely different experience from playing a sword-and-shield type character.\n\n- Trainers: when you level up somewhere in the middle of the forest, you don't just 'learn' new skills or get stronger or more dexterous right there out of the blue. Instead, you'll need to visit a trainer who can teach you to get better or who can teach you new skills.\n\n- Great atmosphere: the settings, the NPCs, the music, the different 'hubs' for the factions, ... everything adds to a distinct atmosphere that only Piranha Bytes can create. Although I must admit I think Gothic 1 & 2 had even more 'heart' than Risen, it's there at its core. Risen has what Gothic 3 lacked and what made Gothic 1 & 2 the timeless classics they are today.\n\nNote about achievements: this game has achievements but they aren't visible in Steam, only in the game itself. From the game menu, click 'Game' and then 'Achievements' for an overview of the achievements. Risen does have classic Steam Trading Cards.","May 6","true","76.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Long story short, it's Gothic 2 rules set of gameplay shoveled down new texture pack without the game breaking bugs and shortcomings Gothic 2 suffered at some places.\nI remember being quite disappointed in this game first time it came out (2009) because of it. I was sure that the studio that made this game was far more better and ambitious and it would try to deliver a completely new experience, but what was I thinking back then? They've tried do that in Risen 2 and failed miserably in everything they've done. I guess some people have to stick the only thing they can do properly - in this case keep doing Gothic game over and over again, because any attempt of doing anything else results in a spectacular failure only buyer's regret and mind zombies are willing do defend.\n\nThe whole concept is a parody of Gothic's lore. Once again we're some nameless hero who lands in the hostile, isolated from the rest of the world area (we even have a magical barrier), who tries to sort his place in the new environment and eventually is involved into saving the world. In order to achieve that he has to ally himself with one of three guilds: a revolted group of greedy clique (Don), a devoted military order (Inquisition) or mages (duh) - the exact equivalent of Gothic 2 guilds: Onar, Paladins and mages (duh). During our journey we will encounter a set of characters who're renamed Gothic serie's people. Like, Mendoza is Cor Kalom, Eldric reminds Saturas, etc. Even a plot reminds Gothic 1's plot. Mid-game it comes out that something everyone praised and considered the only hope of survival is actually the biggest threat around (Titan being Sleeper). Of course there are some new themes, the biggest being the lizardmen race, which was very promising - but it was dumped later on. The whole lore and plot of Risen was dumped for the sake of making some kind of comedy Risen 2 (and 3) came out to be, based loosely (very, very loosely) on sub-plot of Patty's quest, since nothing adds up between this and later titles. They even forgot that in Risen 1 it's said that a mage banished the gods, not that they abandoned the human race (like it's said in Risen 3). And that's the second theme that could make an awesome sequel, the actual banishment of the gods.\nAnd all Risen recycled worked out well, since the world and art design is coherent and falls in memory. The graphics (although not top notch and characters' looks are dreadful at first), lighting music, ambient sounds are very good and have some kind of charm (now, compare it tho the pirates of the caribbean bs).\nThe gameplay, combat system and character development are top notch and everything Gothic 2 aimed for. It's balanced, the feeling of progressing is there. In the beginning you will fastly learn to stay away from some monsters and areas, just to struggle with them mid-game when necessary to maul them down in the end-game. After beating an ashbeast with few hits of magic missiles you feel the progress you've made, which is absolutely absent in Risen 2 and 3 (where you maul everything the game has to offer in the first few hours of the game and nothing new is delivered later on, making the presence of character development system abysmal and pointless at all).\nThe quests are mostly fetch'n'kill alike, but there are some exceptions. The investigation quest at the volcano keep is actually the best quest PB ever made (and which is clearly based on an investigation quest in Gothic 2).\nIt's nothing special or sophisticated of course, it's still the game about slashing things and making the numbers in a window to go higher and higher, but the overall experience is very, very good. Too bad it was ruined, ♥♥♥♥♥ and abused with sequels.","September 3, 2014","true","91.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Your choices matter, some paths open and other close depending on your choices, which i think is really cool. Many RPGs nowadays either allow you to get everything and be everything or just pingeonhole you in one role/class. Not Risen. You can walk your own path, a grey area, play both sides or stick to a single one, it's your choice, and that choice matters.

We have beaches, waterfalls, night and day, thunder and lightning etc. The way you interact with the environment is pretty easy and well thought out, left click to engage, right click to block and middle click to engage combat.\n\nYour inventory is infinite and therefore unrealistic. However, this means you don't have to worry about petty management but immerse yourself in the gameplay. Although many times I found myself carrying 50 swords and 4 shields! In your travels you can pick herbs as you would have in Oblivion and Skyrim. You can also harvest bits of dead animals that you kill. The system that allows you to create potions and spells from these activities is pretty basic but invaluable later on in the game.\n\nI played the game in normal difficulty all the way through and I have to talk about the combat. It is brutal. Basically you are ship wrecked nobody and the island is home to dangerous wild animals like wolves, boars and undead creatures who will EAT YOU FOR BREAKFAST in no time. BE WARNED. This is the first game, ever, that I had to save after every combat, and even in mid combat. The combat is challenging and requires you to block a lot and look for openings. It requires you to carefully watch what your enemy does to see if there is a pattern in their behaviour and find an optimum time to advance and strike. Often I had to back track or run to a single pathway or ledge so that my opponents could not gang up on me. Many opponents will circle you and attack from behind or the side. You will appreciate how it feels to be hunted. As your character grows and becomes more powerful, this does not change!\n\nThe game looks and feels a bit like my beloved Oblivion, however it suffers in comparison. The game world is smaller and with only two factions, there is less interaction with people. The limited XP available forces you to choose fighter or mage, although you can choose to go 'Paladin' and make and use your own magic scrolls. The end game story involving a volcano and titan battle seems trivial compared to the mighty end game battle in Oblivion. Saying all that, I really did enjoy exploring the island and progressing through the story. The combat really made me mad on many occasions and my failure in that partly explains my need to complete the game. I really did enjoy those occasions where to progress the storyline I had to transform into a little snail or use levitation or telekinesis. However, these opportunities were quite rare and the game would have benefited with more of that stuff.\n\nUnlike another game I tried to play recently (cough - The Witcher), the designers of this game really did a great job matching the potential game quests with open play. Many times I travelled around and did stuff in my own personal random order and the game mostly was able to make sense of all that and update the game world in accordance. That was quite impressive. For example, I did not speak to this creepy looking guy in the Bandit Camp but explored the whole area quite extensively. When I finally spoke to Mr Creeps my conversation options were amended to reflect quests I had already completed.\n\nGood little game, recommended to those who would like to visit a pacific island like Hawaii and have patience for the combat.

It's fully player's choice. Such an freedom is attractive and you miss many of game's flaws like bad difficulty balance, too simple trading and RPG part. Even the fighting system isn't that good.

Here goes my review.\nAt first I thought this game was bad it was overly difficult, anything could kill me, anyone i talked to wanted to ♥♥♥♥ me over and/or kill/rob/swindle/convert/enslave me. After some constructive help on forums, I am so freaking glad I followed through on this game, despite the fact I need break mainly because I havent slept in 2 days because of it.\n\nFirst Graphics, 8.5/10 modern   10/10 back in the day for realism .well you MUST play these graphics maxed out, it's gorgeous. During the day the world is stunning, better then vanilla oir vanilla HD pack skyrim easily. grass physics, water movement,stormy weather physics all wonderful. it really sucks you in, and at night, the fog off the swamps and fields, shadows in dark caves, enemies moving just outside of of a realistic torch range. Shadow casting has saved my butt twice from ambushes, and i ean they were real shadows, like you would expect in real life.\n\nSounds, 7/10 world feels alive, you have to play for hours and hours to realize some of the noises are recycled, but noise becomes as important in combat as is seeing the enemy, you know when they may pounce or are falsely playing dead to bait you into a pack ambush.\n\nCombat difficulty 9/10  it's not darksouls hard but it's rough. Don't think you are teh dragon born and can suddenly pick up an axe and drop 4 bandits at level 1, see that porcupine, while at the very start of the game you are ♥♥♥♥ed in the ♥♥♥, get to lvl 8 grab some armor, training and PRACTICE PARRY/BLOCK and he won't be such a ♥♥♥♥. Think a lizard man is easy to drop? Well if you let him get close you'll drop you in a hit, 2 if you're lucky, and while you are watching him you neve saw his buddy SNEAK around you and smash your ♥♥♥♥ up. you have to LEARN to fight, learn to engage, do damage at range and switch fighting stances/weapons and styles as they close in. Think you're an all poweful mage dropping an Ash Beast? I don't care if you ♥♥♥♥ thunder and crap lightning as a lvl 30, they have HP and while you damage stopped 2 the third just ♥♥♥♥ed your ♥♥♥♥ up. Welcome to as real fantasy like combat as you'd get with out getting sucked into another dimension. Once your butt stops hurting and you learn how to fight, you'll love every moment of it.\n\nStory seems slow to start, well guess what you are not a chosen one, you are a shipwrecked stowaway with about as much sense, money, power and prestige as a sack of ♥♥♥♥, you have to work to earn, and suck up to get ahead, and when you do you'lll get into the meat of the story where I am now, i really felt like I accomplished something, not just got handed the Hero Sword in a dark cave and was told to save the princess. You come from ♥♥♥♥ and rise to greatness, and you really feel it too, I havent beaten the game yet. I'm 20 hours in and only now beginning to get an inkling of the world. it really is much larger then I originaly though, and it's built to have you explore.\n\nBarring a few quick travels or events, the world has little to no load screens, want to break into the fully scaled town by levitating over the wall to skip the guards, go right ahead. See that mountain top, you can actually travel there, get isnide find a HUGE TO SCALE complex of tunnels that takes you underground to a lost civilization city, a real city, no loading screens or nothing.\n\nNPC's feel like they were given a purpose and a life, nothing to tug at your heartstrings but more to let you know that what you do matters and has consequences, and it does. Maybe whacking the dumb bimbo for her stolen ring won't matter in the grand scheme of things ending wise, but the town remembers, her butcher remembers her uncle sly you never met on the ♥♥♥ end of the island will know what you did and when you're sent on a quest to find a whatever and he could make it 3 hours quicker and he tells you to ♥♥♥♥ off. Well you get the idea. Though killing the same person gets you a map, a ring of awesome i won't spoil and friends as well. Or you could do something completly different and not kill her, maybe picpocket, maybe bribe her. Who knows, you may end up her friend from the get go. the Choices are yours, and multiple playthroughs can be done.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, this game is rough to beginners, but you give it half a chance, use forums and wiki some, and you will be a sleep deprived zombie like me. After I'm done writing this I'll go to bed.\nA truly hidden gem with a cult following, that deserves much more recognition then it received.\n\n9.1/10\n","June 25, 2014","true","29.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","4"

This is definately good graphics for 2009 (well with the setings maxed out.) but When the people at deep silver were making this Hardcore RPG they did need to cut budgets on a few of the things, one of them being the voice acting. The voice acting sounds like the people were half asleep when saying their lines, the best thing I can say about the voice acting is tht I've heard worse. There are some elements to the game which, I have to say I'm not a big fan of like if u want to pick up an item u need to put ur weapon away. If u want to cook u need to have a pan equipped but tose are just nitpics. The worst thing about Risen though, has to be the plot. The plot is u were a stowaway on a ship and said ship is destroyed by the kraken and u wash ashore on a beach. Then when u strt exploring the island u find the locals and they tell u there are strange ruins that have risen from the ground and u need to find out y. EXCITING STORY ISN'T IT? Another problem is tht when u kill an enemy ur game freezes for maybe 1 sec and I hear from xbox 360 players of the game tht their gamfreezes for about 5 secs some versions even longer. So u will need to be very patient with Risen. The AI seems a little too smart as they seem to dodge 9/10 of ur attacks so I recommend to first time players of risen (Even if u've plyed other RPGs) Play on easy first. There are a few times where the game can also get a tad bit boring but tht only happened on 2 occasions. The map is really hard to figure out aswell. Those are the only problems I can think of about Risen. u r looking at about 60 hours of gameplay with the main missions and side missions. I complete it on another PC of mine and I've just strted a 2nd playthrough on this one. The characters are unique they all seem to have a different personality. There are tons of dialogue choices in Risen just like those in Knigts Of The Old Republic. If u love looting in RPGs like I do hen this gaame is a MUST BUY. ur inventory is unlimited u can hold an unlimited amunt of items not like skyrim or fallout where u hve a weight limit but Skyrim and Fallout are still better than risen.\n\nOverall if u likeRPGs or u love looting this gme is a definite buy BUT MAKE SURE U GET THE PC VERSION because I've heard tons ofcomplaints about the xbox 360 version.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\nPros\n+ Tons of dialogue choices\n+ Unlimited weight limit\n+ Unique characters\n+ 60 hours of gameplay\n+ More of a hardcore RPG\n\nCons\n- Uninteresting and boring plot\n- Often freezes\n- Bad map\n- can be boring at times\n- Bad voice acting\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","September 10, 2015","true","10.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aeolina/recommended/40300/","Aeolina","Aeolina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aeolina/","467 products in account","After finishing Skyrim I did not want to play through it again and waste another a hundred hours of my time in this complex sandbox game. However, I was still addicted to its sandbox formula and the kind of freedom it offered. So I began my quest to seek something that could cure my itch. I came across the Gothic and Risen series and read up on its development history so I purchased both to see if they would satisfy my itch. Being a huge Skyrim fan, I will be making many comparisons between the two games within this review. You have been warned.\n\nPlot: 3/5\n\nPersonally, I enjoy playing games that have a deep, well woven plot. I understand open ended gameplay is a big thing right now (e.g. Dayz, Minecraft), but for me I find that after playing these games for a period of time, they begin to feel mechanical and repetitive. The plot in Risen can't be considered superb, but it does its job to keep me engegd the whole time. The player character possesses a very bland personality and his voice acting is also very stiff. In my opinion, I would rather prefer to not have the player character be given an identity or voice at all. A good RPG should be immersive. So much so that the player should feel like they are exploring a whole new world and their actions are going to have an impact on this world. Without this immersion, the game becomes a grind just like those free to play mmorpgs. Elements like drugs and prostitution are also sort of lame. They aren't outrageously over the top like the way The Witcher does it and they aren't exactly sensual and emotional like Mass Effect or Dragon Age. However, I really liked the way factions were implemented in this game. It was very hard for me to decide which factions to join at the start of the game because I couldn't tell who were the good guys or bad guys.\n\nGameplay mechanics: 2.5/5\n\nThis is the part of the game that really didn't sit well with me. First of all, I hated Risen's map system. I understand that for authenticity sake the player must first seek out an expert to draw a map before it becomes available for use, but even then, the map was confusing to use and I probably spent half of my time in this game running around and unable to find my way. The quest prompts were also too vague and I find the inclusion of the conversations with the quest giver to be utterly pointless. The varieties of creatures to fight in this game were also abysmal. Once the Lizardmen made their appearance encounters with other enemies became greatly reduced. To be fair the gameplay mechanics isn't all bad. I really liked some of the skills in this game. For example, I had a blast floating around with the levitation spell, and the in game traps were also well designed too.\n\nMusic: 2.5/5\n\nI may not be an music expert, but Skyrim's Dragonborn theme song and the female vocals that play during Dragonage's menu screen still resonates in my head from time to time. Risen lacks the sort of musical score which can make a memorable impact on its players but they are still nice to listen to. I do like some of the music that plays during battles or in the background as I explored the wilderness. For example, as I was exploring a dark ruin, the creepy ambient sound and loud shrieks really put a chill down my spine.\n\nGraphics: 4/5\n\nDepending on your systems, this game can be very pretty. The lighting and reflections were gorgeous and I took a lot of screenshots of the beautiful scenery.\n\nFinal Score: 3/5\n\nA good game, but only if you got it as part of a deal.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSkyrim通关以后不愿意再打开算是一种精神洁癖，认为游戏玩通关了就应该放下了， 繁复去玩让人头疼。但是对于sandbox游戏的热爱让我又开始寻找上古的替代品， 于是知道了gothic和risen系列， 只购买了piranha – bytes工作室制作的那几部。\n\n既然玩了，难免要和上古做个比较。\n\n故事情节：3/5\n\n之所以把故事放在最前面讲，是因为我是比较看重这个部分的。有一些游戏貌似很自由很开放，你在这个世界什么都可以做，例如最近热门的那些僵尸类游戏，但是玩久了你就会觉得有种机械工的感觉， 不停重复去做一件事情，乏味的很。而risen在故事设计上只能算是刚刚好，首先主角的性格就不那么明晰，配音也很僵硬，不如没有配音。 其余的配角的性格反超主角，这也是为什么大家都很喜欢patty而嫌弃男主，就是这样的原因。 一个好的rpg，要让玩家真正完全带入到角色中去，让自己感觉这个屏幕里奔跑的小人就是我自己，而不是一个杀怪的苦力。游戏中的抽大麻和妓女的设定觉得很无聊， 根本就是打擦边球，还不如直接干到巫师的级别，很黄很暴力， 要么就学学质量效应和龙纪元，玩玩暧昧。但是值得肯定， 游戏里游戏的阵营设定确实不错，这也是加分的一点，一开始确实让人不知所措，我该相信谁的话总是萦绕在脑中。最后犯贱的看了攻略才算石头落地。\n\n游戏设定：2.5/5\n\n为什么给了这么低的分数， 也许这样的系统设定真的不太适合我。。。首先习惯了上古那种地图以后这个游戏完全是生命在吐槽的感觉。。。我倒不反对地图为了逼真要真的去请人画地图，或者从一些探险者身上去扒取，我无法忍受的是地图给了就和没给一样，有些时候时间根本没有浪费在剧情上， 完全是浪费在迷路上了， 任务写的不明不白也就算了，你把一些有的没的对话写在上面是闹哪样啊！ 强烈不建议没玩过此类rpg的同学玩这个游戏，会十分不适应。。。要时刻记住，做好一个rpg游戏应尽的本分，不要弄弄就变成生存游戏了哦，玩家会闹情绪的说。而且怪物的种类真的少到要大姨妈都不想来了， 后面蜥蜴人一出来其他怪物数量大减啊，蜥蜴人是在刷存在么， 根本就是偷懒好么！ 但是一些技能真的很好玩，那个悬浮技能啊，飘来飘去的， 还有各种机关陷阱。。。\n\n音乐： 2.5/5\n\n好的音乐是什么。。。就是skyrim一打开那两句：dovakin dovakin，或者龙纪元一开始那个哼哼唧唧老娘们的吟唱， 一辈子都忘不掉。。。你问我risen是什么开头音乐。。。昨晚刚玩呢都不记得了我打开再听听。。。。 一些环境和战斗的音乐还是比较好的，特别是进第一个ruin的时候那个鬼叫给我吓毁了。。。\n\n画面：4/5\n在那个年代应该算不错的了吧。。。还是截了一些比较美丽的图片。。。\n\n总体3/5， 百分制就60分。。。艾玛。。。尊低。。。","January 24, 2014","true","36.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a free world adventure with quest lines and with amazing combat engine. I am in love with this game and you will be too. The best thing is that if you played Gothic before, and specifically Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods, you will find a totally different story here, but same health and mana bars, similar items, gathering and fighting, because it's identical engine and this is the true Gothic 4.\n\nBuy it!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LATABOM/recommended/40300/","LATABOM","LandoCalrisian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LATABOM/","838 products in account","In my opinion most should ONLY play this game if they've already finished multiple playthroughs of TES 3, 4 & 5. If the fantasy setting and roleplaying are what you're looking for, add Witcher 1&2 and Dragon Age Origins to that list, and if open-world gameplay is what you're after, add Fallout 3 and NV.\n\nThis game is one of the most solidly "slightly below average" games I've ever played. No aspect of this game is better than the equivalent mechanic/quality in Elder Scrolls Oblivion, and many aspects are worse than even Morrowind, a considerably older game. On top of that, there is plenty of plain old BAD DESIGN in the story, quests and levelling that shouldn't be excusable, but are unfortunatly trademarks of Piranha Bytes.\n\nSTORY is sparse, forgettable and poorly told. While the setting is an interesting one, the story just isn't really there, the end villain seems added on at the last minute, and none of the characters are memorable, except maybe the player chacter.\n\nGRAPHICS are ok, around Oblivion quality but with much better lighting for the most part. A big issue, though is that there is no Gamma slider. The Devs, apparently wanted nighttime/caves to be REALLY REALLY DARK as some form of "realism", but this makes sections of the game unplayable if your computer isn't located in a very very dark room, unless you make use of torches/light spells, which in turn make gameplay even more clunky. BAD DESIGN CHOICE!\n\nSOUND - some better-than-average voice acting mixed with some really amateurish voice acting. Totally forgettable sound effects and music, compounded by a bug (fixable by fanpatches) that breaks music in-game due to some sloppy sound file editing by the devs.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nCOMBAT is quit punishing/unforgiving early on due to the BAD DESIGN CHOICE of making armor only upgradeable at the end of each chapter. Enemies don't respawn, and the game is "Open World", but if you try to explore in the first couple chapters when decent armor isn't available, you'll be killed in 1-4 hits from most enemies. The combat system seems "deep" when you first start playing, but in reality each enemy type follows a set pattern and once you figure that out and have some ok armor, they are universally easy and actually don't really possess any sort of AI.\n\nOPEN WORLD really is open and you can basically go everywhere on the island from the get go. I like the fact that enemies don't respawn, which helps in the exploration process. I pretty much explored the entire island in "Chapter 2" out of 4, which made Chapters 3&4 only a couple of hours long each. The world is relatively SMALL, and there are only 3 real "types" of environment besides dungeon/caves, so there isn't so much variety.\n\nCHOICE is poorly handled. The story is almost completely linear, and dialogue options aren't really options, as no branching conversations are possible, and you end up getting 100% of dialogue no matter what order you ask your questions. All conversations could in reality have been non-interactive cutscenes. WITHOUT A WALKTHROUGH IT'S ALMOST PURE CHANCE WHICH CLASS YOU'LL END UP AS, which is frustrating, and the only real choice in the game only affects a small part of the early plot. THIS CHOICE IS EASILY BROKEN if you do a few quests for both factions. In my playthrough, I did some of each factions' quests, and ended up members of "both" which broke certain aspects of the game and made parts of the game not make sense.\n\nOnly after this started getting weird, when reading a walkthrough for the first time to try and figure out what went wrong did I find out that PIRANHA BYTES simply DID A HORRIBLE JOB PLANNING AND EXECUTING THE STORY STRUCTURE AND DESIGN. Judging from most internet forums on the matter, most people who didn't use a walkthrough got ♥♥♥♥ed in some way while playing the game.\n\nOTHER BAD DESIGN DECISIONS BY PIRANHA BYTES about in Risen. Stats can be boosted up to 100 by trainers, but well over 100 by potions. The game doesn't tell you this, though, so if you find and use the potions before training up to 100, you basically waste them. And if you have stat-affecting items on while training, you actually break the training process and LOWER how high you can train your stats. HORRIBLE DESIGN THAT WAS LEFT UNPATCHED BY A BAD DEVELOPER.\n\nTHE ENDGAME IS A LAZY BOSS FIGHT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE GAME IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY. It is followed by the games only pre-rendered cutscene followed by a black screen with a short voiceover, the credits and BANG - back to the main menu with no option to further explore the world.\n\nAnyways, I should mention that I inadvertantly left the game running for a little over a day in the background, so while my record says over 50 hours played, I actually finished the game in about 25 hours and did pretty much everything possible in a single playthrough.\n\nI enjoyed the first 10 hours or so in which I was exploring the island and not really advancing the main story, but after that, the horrible, sloppy design and gameplay elements began to manifest, and the last 10-15 hours were quite a grind. I honestly wish I'd just given up and had a 3rd playthrough of an Elder Scrolls game or the Witcher instead.\n\nPiranha Bytes should be ashamed that most of their games are broken/buggy and that they rely on fan patches and walkthroughs for players to be able to finish their games. I know they don't have Bethesda's kind of budget, but that isn't an excuse for releasing broken, mediocre games.","April 17, 2014","false","53.5"," 128 of 239 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","128","239","7","7"

I was more than interested to see if the game was going to be a continuation of the Gothic series and whether it could capture the atmosphere of the world of Gothic. I would classify this under two headings.\n\nWith respect to the continuation of the story, there was not much and there wasn't much they could do about it probably, what with the copyright issues and all. They did however use the same theme of what was left of the world after the events in Gothic 3 (won't mention them here to avoid spoilers).\n\nAs for gameplay, I was not disappointed though I did feel that there were several areas they could have improved. Firstly, the world is not open; it is quite small and limited, even compared to RPGs at around the same time. Secondly, the gameplay is similar to that of Gothic 3, which brings the advantage of commonality for Gothic players but has a Learning Curve for new players (people who bought Risen and never played the Gothic titles). Thirdly, the magic combat/use is lacking; you can only have one active spell effect at a time. For example, (you cannot have boost armor and boost strength at the same time).\n\nSo far as the story goes, I can say that Piranha did a good job and the Gothic fans should not be disappointed; at least I wasn't but of course that's just my opinion.I just felt the ending was a little too quick...\n\n","December 30, 2013","true","49.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Open World Action RPG. Unfortunately it does not do it nearly as well. The world is much smaller and not nearly as interested. Also far more linear exploration than in the Gothic games.\n\nThe graphics are not the greatest and especially the character models hurt your experience. The sound is generally poor with the German to English translation really hurting your immersion.\n\nThe leveling system and skill options are pretty good but very badly balanced leading to a huge difference in difficulty.\n\nThe story is fairly standard, as is the world.\n\nRisen isn't a terrible game, it just doesn't measure up to the games it tries to emulate. The Might & Magic series, the Gothic series, even Morrowind provides a better exploration RPG experience and that just leaves you with a very underwhelming feeling after playing Risen.","November 5, 2012","true","72.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

I prefer the story, setting, and factions in the Gothic games (Gothic's fantasy prison setting is way more interesting than Risen's rather generic tropical island), but "Risen" improves on the series in terms of gameplay. Combat is much easier to manage and while the open world does have some incredibly difficult enemies blocking off certain areas, they seem much less like arbitrary barriers as it's possible for the patient player to outwit and even destroy them early on (when I played, for example, I went exploring early on and accidentally found the best weapon in the game by running from/sniping the high level cave monsters guarding it. It isn't often that RPGs will let you just stumble onto and use high level main quest items before you even figure out what the main quest is). Like "Gothic" things degenerate into a linear monster grind in the very last hours of the game, but that's a minor quibble (someday PB will nail an ending...someday). Still, a great ARPG.","May 20, 2012","true","65.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's certainly not a game for everyone, and those looking for refined combat mechanics or hack and slash gameplay will be disappointed.\n\nAt it's core, Risen is about exploration, communication, steady character improvement, and mystery solving. The story starts off pretty simple with a shipwrecked character that lacks any significant backstory. While modern gamers may see this as a negative, it's actually one of the game's greatest strengths.\n\nThe whole idea of the classic RPG was to let your character forge a story as they interacted and played through the campaign. Risen grants players the freedom to choose a faction, choose their skills and talents, and ultimately decide to be a nice guy or a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You'll talk to people to solve quests that grant experience and rewards, play people against one another, and unlock the secrets of the island and the catastrophe plaguing the world.\n\nThe other great stregnth of this game is exploration. The Island is a beautifully handcrafted and seamless world. It's large enough to allow you to take your time and explore every nook and cranny for enemy encounters, crafting materials and treasure, but not so big and generic that it ever feels tedious running around on your quests. Later in the game, it becomes much easier to move about and track down things you might have missed.\n\nSo to wrap things up, here's a list of positives and negatives:\n\nPositives:\n- well crafted seamless world full of secrets and hours upon hours of exploration\n- camps and towns feel alive with NPCs who have various quests and belong to various factions with their own motivations\n- lots of skills to learn and items to find and craft\n- choose your path, and become a mage, fighter, rogue or a combination of any of those skillsets\n\nNegatives:\n- combat feels a little stiff and clunky\n- can be frustrating to figure everything out at the start for newcomers to RPGs\n\nMy rating:☺☺☺☺☺\nFive happy faces!","June 25, 2014","true","61.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's this certain kind of undefinable sublime quality of the Risen franchise, and with the first game in particular. It's in a fantasy setting, but with a gritty, hard-edged feeling that I immediately took a liking to. The game franchise shares a pedigree with the Gothic games (both developed by Piranha Bytes, but the Risen games having a seperate publisher) and I've read several times that in truth, the Risen franchise is really the spiritual successor of the Gothic games.\n\nYou can spot the similarities between the two series easily. In both series you play a "nameless hero". You have no character customization in Risen, you start as a stowaway on an Inquisition ship that capsizes and sinks. You find yourself washed up on the shore of Faranga, a large volcanic, mediterranean-like island. The game is open world, limited of course by the fact that the game does, of course, take place on an island. No worries here, the island is quite large, with various climates and distinctive areas.\n\nAs someone who loves to role-play, I really enjoyed playing a character that has virtually no back-story, not even a name. The game presents you oppourtunities to shape what kind of character you're going to be. Similar to the Witcher games, choices are often morally ambiguous. Neutrality is sometimes what the situations is called for, and often towing the line between being a hero or a heartless thug was really enjoyable.\n\nThat, of course, can't last forever. Eventually you'll have to align yourself with one of the two factions struggling for control of Faranga. The quests are numerous, and surprisingly contain few "fetch" quests. The writing is excellent, in my opinion, and the voice-over work really quite well done. The developers don't exactly hold your hand when it comes to the often multilayerd and multistaged quests. A certain amount of cleverness is required of the player, and I've found wrapping up quests very rewarding.\n\nI chose to go the route of the Fighter, and I've found the combat very enjoyable. It requires mastering the use of block and parry, counter-parry and attack. Leveling your character is also an interesting experience. At each level you're given 10 learning points. Depending on what you're going for, you'll need to seek out the assistance of trainers who can help you increase your statistics and skills. Right away I invested in swordsmanship, and strength, but also in sneaking and lockpicking. I found that gathering a lot of "thief" skills was a fantastic (and fun) way to finance my adventures. You can also dedicate yourself to the Ranger-type character, or a magic-user. Or mix it up, which I definitely recommend.\n\nThe game's visuals can sometimes leave a little bit to be desired, but truthfully I found I really enjoyed the style and the art in the game. It grew on me quickly, and I found myself snapping screenshots of areas and events I particularly liked.\n\nTo be clear, I've not yet finished all of the game. I'm nearing Chapter 3, which I believe is the final chapter. During nearly all my playtime, I had to play in Steam's Offline mode so my tracked game time on Steam is lower than the actual number.\n\nTo wrap up, I highly recommend this game to fans of the hand-crafted RPG. That kind of RPG that you can tell a team put their blood, sweat and tears into. It has huge depth, it's very rewarding.\n\n4 out of 5 stars.

These are only small annoyances though, and really only tiny once you realise there is a way around these problems.\n\nThe graphics are great, considering this is a 2009 game, just make sure you have the graphics settings to high.

It can be buggy, dated, and hackneyed at times. But if you're like me, and loved every second of the Gothic games, this game is a great update on the model. In fact, it's basically a remake of Gothic. This game/series has an open world exploration model unlike any other. For one thing, there is a finite amount of XP in the game. So grinding is impossible. That's ♥♥♥♥ing cool. Plus, you can wander virtually anywhere. The game doesn't really mind too much (i.e. it doesn't break) if you glitch your way into certain areas too early or whatever. What mostly keeps you out of places that you're not supposed to get to is that you'll get your ♥♥♥ beat. Monsters don't scale with level, and pretty much all of them are tougher than you at the outset. The actual role-playing isn't that deep (this game is the anti-bioware), but that doesn't mean that it's not fun to explore and immerse yourself in a new world.

Overall id give the game a 8/10 and a recommendation to all fans of RPGs to get this game. Now im off to play the sequal, heres hoping its even better...","March 3, 2014","true","35.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a fine open-world RPG, which connecting more sophisticated and modern newer Piranha Bytes projects with its roots, with the Gothic series.

A yes and no would be the most precise answer.\n\nAs a Gothic fan, I can see in Risen as its true follow up . It has all the playable elements that made Gothic a great game, such as the full open world , the way you develop the character and a well structured set of quests that gets you familiarized with the map, in case you arent a completionist player. The combat, is very frustrating indeed - but what people fail to realize is that it is also quite realistic in principle. Do people really expect to fight a pack of wolves with a stick without facing a serious risk of dying? The good part of Risen is also the amazing auto-save in key places. Again the comparison with Gothic is unavoidable... I am pretty sure that any former player would progress a lot without saving only to get killed by a crappy enemy, just because the fight went slightly south. With Risen and the constant auto-save, those frustrating moments when you realize that you just lost 2 hous of progress are over.\n\nThat being said, now the downside of Risen. For an open world game, it doesnt seem to offer much enthusiasm to go and try to find something new. Wherever you go in the island, everything seems the copy from one or another place. There arent enough hidden places, new creatures or rewards that would make the exploring part worthwhile. It is the sort of game that if you stick to the main story, you won't feel that you have lost much, when it should be exactly the opposite. When it is a full open world, the whole point is to explore and try to get something more out of it that the main plot doesnt seem to offer.\n\nThe story is bland and not at all interesting. I assume that at this point I am 3/4ths of completing it, and I am yet to find something that wouldnt be the same old, same old. I guess that the most original thing that I have seen is that if you get caught too early from certain NPCs, they will knock you on the head and force you to stick with a pre-set class type.\n\nOther minor thing is the lack of colour contrast , which makes it difficult to distinguish one place to another or even carry on playing without getting a blurry vision. Colour transitions are just too smooth.\n\nSo, I would recommend the game if you played gothic and liked it... but prepare to be slightly disapointed. If not, perhaps it would best for you to start with something else first.\n\n","March 13, 2014","true","35.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But very hard. At least, to me it is. It actually took me more than an hour to start enjoying Risen but once I got into it I couldn't stop playing. The Dialogue is hilarious at times and the main character often insults others in very amusing ways. The game is realistic in it's day and night and weather cycles and also how NPCs treat you based on how you treat them. There are many different abilities to teach your character and the game allows you to chose your own play-stlye. There are also usually multiple ways to complete quests which is a plus. Obtaining new/better armor can often take quite a while but feels quite rewarding when you do so. There are only a few things I dislike about Risen. First, you can't customize your character at all. I know some people don't care about this but in all honesty the main character isn't that great looking and it would have been nice if I could have changed his looks. Second, the combat is very difficult. Unless you are already a hardcore action gamer when you start playing Risen you will most likely have trouble with the combat at first. You can't just mash the attack button and whack things to death like in Diablo. Every fight, even with the weakest enemies requires patience and strategy. Granted once you start getting better at the combat it becomes a little more fun, it often feels repetitive or tedious. Aside from this though, the game in itself is a very fun play and I would reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a good challenge or even simply something to take up a good dozen hours of their time.","July 16, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is not as easy as Bethesda or Bioware RPGs. Every single enemy will block, dodge, parry, counter, flank and break your defense, even at beginning when you cannot do all these stuff. You start the game without any skill or weapon and die for the first Sea Vulture you find. Your best friends until the end will be F8 and F9. That said, allow me to make some points:\n\n•	Excellent graphics and atmosphere.\n•	Excellent music.\n•	Good story.\n•	Good NPCs and voice acting, with fun dialogue.\n•	Excellent monster models.\n•	Decent animation: I liked especially the running animation for the player character.\n•	Level up system is very good and unusual, same way as in the Gothic series, if you want more one point in dexterity, for example, you must talk with a trainer and pay gold for it. Moreover, gold is very hard to earn at the beginning.\n•	I also enjoyed the fact that almost every NPC you find is important. Just a few of them are “generic”.\n\nSome advices for who is going play the game for the first time:\n•	Get the shield near the first ruin you find.\n•	Put at least one level in smith, because the one-handed sword you make is better than any other you find in Chapter 1.\n•	If you level up Sword, you will be able to use ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-swords and two-handed swords in one hand, with a shield in the other. This works with Axe skill too, and axes make more damage.\n•	Max for Alchemy skill, because that will allow you to make potions that increase stats permanently.\n•	Increase the stat of your choice with trainers until they do not offer the dialogue option for this anymore. I think 100 is the max you can level up in this way. Then you can use potions to boost a bit more and it will be easy reach 200 or above in the chosen stat.\n\nAbout mage spells, I cannot say what to do since I have played like warrior. However, you will need to use spells in many places. If you want to be warrior too, then just get some scrolls and you will be all right.\n\nCons: I cannot remember anything bad about Risen. There are some bugs off course, but which is the game that has not? Some people think the end is unsatisfying. Perhaps they were waiting for some big cut scene, what is not there. If you wait for the credits, you will listen the hero speaking with Patty and will know what happens next. That final talk in my opinion makes room for a sequel.\n\nFinally, IMO Risen is a 10/10 RPG. A very hard and very rewarding experience. Every second I spend in this game was a memorable one.","June 27, 2014","true","59.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After Piranha Bytes failed with Gothic 3, and the franchise went to other developers, they cut back on ambition and delivered an experience much like Gothic 1.\n\nThis experience consists of being a funny bigmouth, that starts as a complete newcomer and nobody in a fairly isolated, but lively territory, full of political intrigues, other bigmouths and hordes of monsters that will help you advance in your career as the local tough guy. The game is very combat-centric, and quite tough, but also very rewarding - every new piece of gear or move is a big thing in Risen, and might spell doom for the monster that you weren't able to take on previously, and, thus, allow you to explore some more of the fairly beautiful world.\nOther attractions include dealing with pirates, smoking (swamp)weed and searching unsuccessfully for a guy you're supposed to meet in a brothel. And lots more!\n\nthe biggest downside this game has (and the previous gothic games, too, really) is the radical difference between early-to-mid game and late-game. just be prepared that this game becomes more and more combat-centric the deeper you get.\n\ntotally recommended, though.","November 29, 2013","true","26.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's from 2009, yes, but it is still really good and better than a lots of other modern RPGs. The Graphics are still good, sure there are better grphics now, but remember; its 5 years old and the graphics are really detailed, every corner of Faranga(thats how the island is called)was handmade, no generated s h i t. The enemys are not leveling up, which I really like cause its totally unrealistic when a wolf grows stronger and stronger and had at the end 10 times more damage. In Risen, there come new enemys when you enter a new chapter, and at these places where you shouldn't go at the beginning are harder enemys, real blockades are only at places for quests where it's simply nessesary. The Quest are realistic, too, I don't know why some people dont like them, I like these Quests more than  Kill-this-this-and-this-Quest, and there a lot of killing in Risen too.\nThe combatsystem is reallly good too, dont know why some slimshady guys here find it annoying, its really diversified, there are five types of weapons; Axes, Swords(one and two-handed), Crossbows, Bows and Staffs. There are many different weapons of these categorys, mostly swords and axes.\nAnd there are magical weapons, fire, ice and something which does average damge and fires fast.\nI recommend to take an crossbow, better an ice crystal and a 2-handed sword or an axe.\nYou can level your skills in these weapon category from 1 to 10, and at every skill u get a new attack or defense or somthing like that, because of that the combat never gets old like some guys wrote here. It's difficult, yes, but a game which is not challenging is really boring, isn't it?\nThe Story is very free(didnt know who to wrote that), and because of that the story is not very good, but good. You can choose a lot of things in this game.\nIn the End, I really recommend Risen, for players who start with RPGs and they who already played some.\nOh, and for the guys, who are too dump to beat the game, if you tap really fast minsky in game and then tap ^, u can cheat  what u need. I didnt.\nAnd P.S.: You sure can find bugs, u can do this in every game, but if you dont do really really stupid things, there are less bugs, and even if one appear, you can solve the problem with the console.","September 4, 2014","true","21.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It's almost like a Skyrim/Morrowind light.  Far smaller, simpler quests, but a decent world.  The BIGGEST drawback is the combat system.  It is not for the casual player.  If you want to just relax and crush some mob faces, this is not for you.  This game is big on player timed dodges, parries, and blocks.  Nothing is automatic.  The enemy can also parry, dodge, and block depending on their gear loadout.  This means you have to know how each and every mob likes to attack and tailor a different strategy for each and every mob type in the game.  You also have to know what attacks mobs can use based on the gear and type.  You can't just charge in and swing, you have to block, parry, dodge, counter-parry, and charge attack.\n\nThe margin for error is very small, especially on the hardest difficulty.  On one skeleton lord, It took about 35 strikes for me to kill it, while he would kill me in 3 hits.  This was pretty early on in the game but still, VERY little margin for error.  Wolves you have to lure into a tight pass where they can't dodge attack you, which is instant and practically unblockable.  Pro tip- Every mob in this game likes to circle to their left, which is to your right.  Strafe to the right as well to cut them off (footwork and positioning actually matters in this game)and stay away from their weapon hand.  If they lateral strike (yes there are also different swings and angles of attack based on your movement) and you dodge left you will still get clipped.\n\nAll that said, difficult/strategic combat and all, the BIGGEST flaw is the stupid console based forced focus system.  Holy %$#@ is that annoying for a PC user.  I get 3 boars charging me, I pull my sword and it sticky focuses the middle one, I strafe and it goes around the target and into the swings of another boar because your actions are based around your target, not just on your personal character control.  Developers just don't get how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ forced focus sticky targeting is compared to what PC users are used to (since xbox has no mouseplay).\n\nAll in all I did enjoy playing this game but it can be fantastically furiously frustrating at times because of the combat.  Oh and the clipping in this game is terrible.  Save often, you WILL fall through the world a LOT.  If I had a swear jar next to my PC I could have bought a new PC.","August 14, 2014","true","100.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klyxmaster/recommended/40300/","klyxmaster","Klyxmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klyxmaster/","320 products in account","This game was shamefully over shadowed by Oblivion (and similar big name games). You can check out other reviews, they will agree. This game is flat out amazing. Scenery, voice acting ( Andy  Serkis(Gollum LOTR) the Inquisitor and John Rhys-Davies (Gimli LOTR), as well as other HUGE actors that made you WANT to talk to NPC's instead of because you had to because you might miss something. This in itself made the game more immersive and drew you in as each of the NPC's felt they had their own personalities - something I felt OBLIVION lacked sorely.\n\nFor a game from 2009, the scenery was breathtaking. Even on standard settings, the folilage and buildings all felt natural and the colors blended in very nice.\n\nCombat, training and other "highlights" of the game were awkward at first. If your coming from a hack/slash game, be prepared to put the brakes on. Pulling that tactic in this game will get you killed on the first swing. It is completely different than most games. It really does require training (which takes lots of gold - which in itself is hard to come by). This made it feel more challenging, and required you to pay attention to your fighting, vs, just spaming hot keys. Blocking plays an important rule - fail, and you'll find yourself on the end of a booger-picking-gnome-sword.  Bosses can be tricky, but there is usually a "back-door" method to taking them out, if you are not skilled enough to fight them head on.\n\nWhile the game is a touch of linear - it is not forced. It does a good job keeping you on the storyline, but at the same time, you can go off and do other tasks for other NPC's or just explore and get more experienced.  Risen does a fantastic job making you feel you are on your own. and doing thing when you want to vs letting the game feel like its controlling you. This is very apparent when you come to a cliff, and you can actually fall off - so far, I have not seen any "invisible walls" that prevent you from going anywhere.\n\nspeaking of going places, the mapping system seemed much more real. Must like real life. There were no cheat arrrows pointing the way. It was just that, a map of the area you were in. It would show where you were at, but didnt hold your hand. Which was bad for me, since my memory sux (happens when you get old like me).  This alone, made questing quite a challenge, as while some POI was on the map, it was more of a reference point than a "go this way and that way". So you had to really pay attention to the NPC's that were giving out the tasks. Fortuneatly there is a script in your logs so you can re-read what you were told.\n\nThere was only one tiny downer. I did not care much for the models or their behavior. Their hands seemed disjointed, and most the women you talk to always had one hand on their hip in a pose fashion.  While this is no SquareEnix game, I felt some of the action of the models could have been better. But after awhile, you kinda got aclimated to it, and didnt think twice.\n\n\nIn my opinion, at 2014, this game still rivals most RPG/OPEN WORLD games on the market today - and any RPG fan would really enjoy it. The learning curve is high - espceially the combat. But if you can get over that hump, you'll find a very rich and enjoyable game that will last over 40-60hrs (I am a leisure completionist   http://www.howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=7843 ). I feel that the outstanding voice acting is what makes players get deeper involved with the cast, and thus explore more.\n\nSo pick it up. The only advise i can give, be patient in fights, keep your guard up.","February 18, 2014","true","22.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The Gothic series culminated in two games reknowned for their broken-ness but I still have played them for hundreds of hours and managed to enjoy myself. Risen is basically what Gothic 3 should have been (albeit with a different setting and plot but there are many similarities). The combat system is monumentally better and you can actually cast a spell without dying. The voice acting is still pretty terrible but you can get the picture and it doesn't detract too much from the game. People have likened the games to a low quality Elder Scrolls but the only real similarities are the open world and ... swords. Obviously the Elder Scrolls is better on an order of magnitude that can't be described but if you're into open world medieval settings and a pretty unique universe I'd say give it a go.

The background lore is just ok but the game world itself is very alive. It is a small to medium open world but it is dense and all of the npcs feel like real characters in a story.

On the normal setting it really isn't that hard; it is just tough enough to require some strategy and timing, and to make it feel well-earned when you eventually become very powerful later on.\n\nThe game has an immersive atmosphere. It's not always super polished but the graphics are definitely nice (very different than the xbox 360 version) and the way it handles the world's lush vegetation is especially impressive.

I've had this game forever and got it from some bundle. I decided to give it a try and I've never felt so bad for not trying a game earlier. The game has loads of your basic RPG elements, but there's some very unique ones too.\n\nInteraction.\nFirst thing that I noticed was how the interaction and fighting is implemented. You use middle mouse button to either draw or sheathe your weapon. While your weapon is drawn, you're in battle mode where you can't interact with anything other than hit stuff with your weapon. While your weapon is away, you can loot, talk and interact with items.\nIt's a great way to prevent you from accidentally hitting people while still making it possible to easily start slaughtering everyone, if you so wish.\n\nCombat.\nIt's hard. Closest comparison in my mind would be Dark Souls. The enemies dodge, parry and use multiple different combinations to attact you, they deal loads of damage and are a serious pain in the ♥♥♥ if there are more than 1. You'll soon learn to quick save after every succesful battle / anything actually, since even after learning to fight against a single enemy they might just destroy you anyway with a long combo and powerful attacks.\n\nLeveling up.\nInstead of just gaining levels and being able to choose attributes to increase on a stat screen, you gain points that can be used to have a trainer teach you skills. I don't know if I skipped some hints, but I definitely didn't know this for a while. I ended up playing 3-4 hours without improving my skills. I don't need to tell you that it was pretty hard. Trainers can teach you to increase your strenght and weapons skills, as well as learn how to prospect or gut animals.\n\nQuests.\nStandard RPG quests. You talk to people, run to someone else, kill stuff, help people, etc. Nothing too new, but some freedom to do things. For example you can kill a lot of creatures early and start the quest later and finish it right away with the creatures being dead.\n\nBugs\nThe most noticeable bugs I had was the one related to Vsync. I basically couldn't jump up on ledges as I would get stuck, and I couldn't die from falling. The next one I noticed was that you're allowed to enter chapter 3 area before actually taking the quest for it. This caused me to not be able to progress and having to lose 2 hours of gameplay.\n\n\nThe game looks slightly old, but not bad. It's loads of fun to play and I'd recommend it to anyone.\n\nMy favourite thing? There doesn't seem to be any kind of inventory limit.","September 9, 2015","true","30.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabit/recommended/40300/","rabit","therabit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabit/","1058 products in account","This is one of those game that deserve a neutral rating if Steam has one. Risen is an open world RPG, you are stranded on a island and has to join force with local factions and help them with their agendas to survive. I've only played a few hours at this point but the story is bland and uninteresting, VO can be all over the place. Most of the time it's not good.\nGraphically RIsen can be a mixed bag. Flora looks good, environment is ok for a 2009 game but NPC looks bad. Design is bland and the town is pretty ugly.\nAs for the game play, Risen is play in third person view and structurally similar to other open world RPG, you wander around, explore and getting tons of quests. If you've played an open world RPG before like fallout, elder scroll  or the gothic series; you already know the general flow of the game.\nThe combat in this game is quite clunky, you can equip 2 weapon, one melee/staff, one range weapon. You don't have a lot of option for melee combat, just an attack and block button, range weapon is very slow but enemies are very easy to kite.\nThe leveling system is obtuse, you gained learning points after a level but can't spend them unless you go see a trainer and pay them gold to get stats increase. This lead to hilarious situation where you're in a school supposedly learning things but can't get any stats increase because there's no easy way to make money. This make the early game quite difficult since quest payout is 20/30 gold while you need increasingly more money to gain stats. 1 stat point cost 10-20 gold and you earned 10 stat points per level. Basically you will have to try and scavenge everything.\nDepends on how you play the game though. the problem above can be completely trivial. You can get 1 point in sneaking and pickpocketing and proceed to steal everything from everyone. I became filthy rich just 30 mins after getting the skills and this broke the economy. Stealing is really easy in this game and require no trick, just engage in a conversation option and steal. I stole a soldier's shield as I was talking to him once, it's pretty funny.\nQuest design is my biggest complain about this game, in open world rpg a good developer would give you multiple options to finish a quest. Not really the case in risen. people in this game are very easily agro if you are in a room and open a chest you're not supposed to. I accidentally agro an NPC and proceed to woop his ♥♥♥ and he refused to talk to me afterward thus making it impossible for me to finish a quest that involving him (you can get a spell to make them forget but in the early game I have I've only found 1 scroll so far). In another instant, I was supposed to get training from some dude, he made me fight him as a test, I won but click 1 time too much and he's dead, another impossible to finish quest. Worst of all these quest chains are necessary for you to get out of the monastery and I was stuck with no option to go out. Luckily I found a place to hop the fence and book it.\n\nDespite all the ♥♥♥♥♥ing I've done, Risen still compelled me enough to play for more than 2 hour at a time and write a review for it. This is more than I can say for the CODs and ♥♥♥ creed out there. As clunky as it is, wandering around and ♥♥♥♥ing with the local NPCs is fun.\n\nHowever, when you look at it objectively, RIsen is not a good game, there are good ideas in it but it's too clunkly and in some cases poorly implement. There are much better open world RPG out there, the Gothic series, its predecessor is one example. I can only recommend this game if you are a big fan of open world RPG and has exhausted all of your other options. Overall a 6/10 for me and recommendation with serious reservations.","November 8, 2014","true","5.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

I would highly recommend it if you like RPG's. It is the spiritual successor to the Gothic series, and it is quite similar in many ways. You can side with either the Bandits, or the Inquisition/Mages. I side with the Inquisition/mages almost every game I play, because being a Mage is just how I roll in almost all RPG's. The Bandits are scum anyway. If you want to be a Mage, make sure to sneak around the back end of Harbour town and complete every quest there in favour of the Inquisition. You will get a letter of recommendation from the leader of town there and if you helped a Mage representative in town, you can become a true Mage at the monastery using this letter of recommendation. If you dont do this, you will be forced to become a Warrior of the Order, a Warrior Mage hybrid class who cannot use rune spells like a Mage, only basic magic attacks.","October 25, 2013","true","32.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ique/recommended/40300/","ique","ique","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ique/","388 products in account","Man this game was a blast. I had no idea what to expect going into it and after the initial lukewarm first impressions of the intro section I was hooked. The game strikes a very good spot in terms of difficulty where you need to put at least some thought into what stats you're upgrading and the equipment you use, but it never gets too hard or unfair. Even when you've gotten some baller new armour and weapons you never really feel safe against any enemy and fights stay fresh even if they technically are quite repetitive. The combat system itself is slightly clumsy but pretty fun overall, putting big emphasis on dodging or blocking correctly.\n\nThe world is very friendly towards exploring (being able to climb is awesome) and it rarely feels empty. Just when you get tired of walking long distances the game conveniently introduces its fast travel system. The game never throws that much info at you leaving you to find out what needs to be done yourself which is great. NPCs very often have new things to say and especially in the first half of the game you have a lot of freedom in how you want to complete your objectives. Discovering the game's intricacies never felt like a chore.\n\nOn the technical side I was a little annoyed by not being able to customise my mouse sensitivity or turn of acceleration. I also had physics bugs when climbing due to high fps, fixable of course but still annoying.\n\nGraphically the game is dated and I very highly recommending increasing draw distance. Sadly NPCs and enemies have a very noticable hardcoded distance at which they will pop in, but most everything else you can tweak. Google it. I also installed sweetfx with a custom profile which made a big difference in terms of a sharper and more colourful look.\n\nThe story? Mostly forgettable, but does its job.\n\nHighly recommend it, both for those that like RPGs and those that generally don't.","August 29, 2014","true","45.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Much like its Gothic predecessors, Risen puts the player in the shoes of an unnamed hero in an open world where resources and monsters do not periodically respawn and where the smallest mistake can punish you gravely.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but hard to master. It rewards those who grasp the need for timing and prediction as  Risen's enemies rarely signal their attacks and fighting large mobs of enemies is usually suicidal in part due the game's frustratingly flawed lock on system.  However, progression in combat skills offers flexibility in getting under an opponent's defenses rather than mere brute force, making combat somewhat easier, but requiring some level of brains to use it.\n\nRisen isn't a typical hack and slash RPG, it is nothing like the Elder Scrolls series either. It is fairly punishing from the early and middle game but offers a sense of accomplishment through its finite resources and respawns and unique items only available in some of the most treacherous dungeons.\n\nGraphically Risen isn't the most polished looking game in existence. Character models tend to look a little bland at times with tons of noticeable reuse popping up everywhere, but the tropical setting coupled with some of the mediterranean inspired architecture presents for a fairly interesting looking world once you get over the myriad of familiar faces. And unlike most open RPGS, Risen barely has any loading times outside of the initial start up--the world and all its dungeons are in one single zone rather than being divided into seperate ones--making for one of the most immersive RPGS I've ever played.\n\nIf you're a fan of old school RPGs, try out Risen as you might just like it.","November 25, 2012","true","35.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has great graphics for a 2009 game with some of the best lighting effects i ever seen in a video game. The exploration is probably the most strong aspect of the game, where you have an island to discover full of intricate paths, atmospheric dungeons, and fascinating creatures. In this aspect and others it may lack the presentation and ambition of the Elder Scrolls games but i felt more immersed in this one than in Skyrim. The way your character develops it's interesting as well, you start off very weak with some ragged clothes as armor and a stick as weapon and because of that you have to think if you want to engage someone in combat, but as you progress through the game and your hero becomes more stronger with better items (and believe me they are hard to get) you feel the sense of development, that your character has changed. The story is nothing of extraordinary as well the characters but it gets the job done.\nWhat can i say more about this game? Well a lot more really because it's one of those that there is more than meets the eye.\nPick it up, you can get it very cheap nowadays because Risen has been in several bundles.","September 13, 2014","true","35.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milkycoffee/recommended/40300/","milkycoffee","Agent Milky Coffee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milkycoffee/","262 products in account","Let's start with the fact, that this game reminds me a lot of the third Gothic. Probably because of the game mechanics and engine, but the feeling was nice. I really can't find any good games similar to the Gothic series. Fable was really cool, but the TES series in general is just not my cup of coffee.\n\nI've tried Risen three times. Twice it bored me and I stopped after an hour or so, thinking I'll never get back to it. When I finally gave it a chance the third time, I finally got into it. So if you're not convinced at first, I suggest you just keep playing.\n\nThe game turned out to be really great. The plot is simple but epic, and the mere fact that you have to discover it first as a castaway who knows nothing and is nothing, was something that got me sticked to the screen for hours. So what does this game have that other don't?\n\nThe unique feeling of progress (just like Gothic). You get to see how powerful your character gets over time, slowly, but once you reach a certain point you know there's hardly anything that may stand in your way.\nA living world that will feel like home after a while of playing.\nFreedom to become a warrior, a hunter or a mage.\nTwo ways to follow the plot (as a warrior/hunter or a mage), both leading to the same ending but each with a different line of quests and each with a different backstory/reasons. Before you choose your path you hear from the people what they all think of one and the other. Then you get to choose and, similar to Gothic, you can base your decisions on which you think is good or evil.\nLizardmen! Temples!\nAmazing music.\nBad sides?\nNo hunter game (I've spent hours hunting deer in G3)\nNo sprint (just walking is actually pretty fast but exploring may get a bit boring if you want to see every corner of the island)\nI invested a lot in crossbows but even with the best crossbow in the game they were pretty useless.\nGreat potential, but feels a bit like it could be used a bit better. It's still a very good game, well made and seems to be a good opening game for a series. I am disappointed with the second game though but I guess I should just give it another chance, like with this one.\nThe second Risen game is generally different. I don't like it (yet?) because I prefer the first, but if you don't like the first you might like the other one. Either way both games are worth checking out, especially if you're a fan of the Gothic series.","February 17, 2015","true","39.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Frustrating to the point where I couldn't progress. Whenever you strike or dodge, you cannot move until that animation is complete, making strategic manouvering useless. When dodging an attack to strike back, they perform an animation to step back, meaning you miss and they leave you open for attack while you helplessly complete the animation. Enemies can stagger you at the slightest hit, yet you cannot stagger them; this makes the combat feel very unbalanced. I'm an experienced RPG player yet I think this combat system completely ruins the exploration of this game.","August 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Do with this as you please.\n\nCombat: Slow and shallow BUT! Only at first glance. At a lower level in the game, you are pretty much the stereotypical ♥♥♥♥♥ swinging a blade with no actual angle of skill. Defeating enemies early on is purely out maneuvering your opponents and hitting them whilst their backs are turned or getting an opportunistic hit in between their shifts in defence.\n\nAs you progress and receive training, new tactics, such as parrying, become available and combat becomes remotely engaging and interesting. There's a sense of fulfillment when you've figured out the timing of your skill and the enemy's movements. (Ranged Combat and Magic are, well, Ranged Combat and Magic. Hit and run until dead.)\n\nProgression: Leveling and character progression in this game is a bit strange. Where most RPGs would either give you free control over your Skill points or simply assign them for you, this game gives you points but demands that a player goes between trainers to progress. This in mind, side quests and optional dungeon crawling is much more rewarding, as it covers the fees of your trainers.\n\nDialogue: Personally, I feel that this is one of the weaker points of the game. Perhaps I've only messed with minor characters or maybe I'm just used to the more 'mainstream' RPG. Either way, the voice acting in this game is Drone-like and a bit bland.\n\nGeneral Atmosphere: Well, the game's music is decent, the graphics are 'OK' and the Map/Board/Whatever you prefer to call it, is pretty detailed. There are plenty of things to explore and find and I can't say that the map is bad to look at.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd toss this a 7/10.","October 29, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The company behind Risen made Gothic, a series that I loved. Gothic has a tragic story, funding was cut from the expansion pack to the third installment, resulting in a buggy game that felt unfinished, and had the wrong voice-actors. The dreaded fourth installment that the orginal company wasn't even part of, killed the series, and I hear this is why they started Risen on the side.\n\nWhile I was initially excited about Risen, I feel like Risen is some sort of attempt from the company's side to "win back" their original ideas for gothic. It feels like they're trying to make the same game, but different.\n\nStill, Risen has a decent story, but Risen is a series, and the third installment just game out. I'll try not to judge Risen 1 on the sequels, but it's hard, because frankly Risen 2 feels like they retconned a lot of Risen 1 in an attempt to reboot their franchise as a sort of "pirate age" age game, even though it clearly felt like a high-fantasy gothic medieval game in the first installment.\n\nSeparately though, the games are quite good, it's just a bit of a snag to get over how poorly they connect, despite several characters making appearances in both games.\n\nIn many ways, Risen perfectly embodies the spirit of Gothic and does provide some not-seen-before elements. Where in Gothic, you felt like you were the nameless master-mind behind a gang of anti-heroes who follow you out of some misguided sense of loyalty (honor among thieves, I guess) rather than true friendship, always facing challenges in a hostile world as you go about, in Risen you feel like people actually have a more "human" relationship towards you. Sure, you're still a nameless guy but apart from a select few individuals, you're truly alone this time, but your friendships in the game are based on actual frienship, meaning the character actually has some relationships with people.\n\nRisen in no way beats or threatens the legacy of the 3 real gothic games, but if you liked gothic, you NEED to play Risen too.\n\nFun fact: Many fans believe that unofficially, Risen is set several years in the future of the original gothic trilogy.

It looks like the old games, it plays like the old games and there's so many ingame references to what happended in the old games, even if it's never said explicitly (mostly for legal reasons):\nAgain you have two factions (one in the swamp, one in the city - sounds familar?), and you can do missions for both sides before reaching a descision point. Neither side is really good, and both focus on different abilities. And again - in the end your decision doesn't matter too much, apart from defining the abilities your character can learn. You stilll only get new armor by advancing within the factions, and you still have to pay trainers to convert your skill points into actual skills...\n\nStill, after the fiasco of Gothic 3, it is also a return to the good (if you liked the formula) old Gothic atmosphere and story telling. If you enjoyed Gothic and Gothic 2 (which were absolutely great for their time), then this might be the game for you - just ignore the third Gothic and imagine that the unnamed hero and the wizzard (iirc Thardas?) from the first games together killed of the gods and thereby freed the titans that now threaten to kill of all of humanity. The storyline of Risen  and its sequels starts there - with a new unnamed hero beached on a mysterious island that is somehow still safe from the titans. And of course you will discover the reason behind that and unwillingly aid in compromising the safety of the island. Which you will then have to rectify. Not a very inventive story, but well told, with the roughness and shades of gray that is typical for the Gothic series. No one is really good (not even you) and no one is absolutely evil either.\n\nTechnologically it's quite dated and really just the old Gothic 3 engine with a new setting. Not too bad for it's time, but every third character has the same face, and just wears a different name and uniform. It's fun to play, though only for people who really loved the old games. By now it's also stable to play, something Piranha Bytes never manage on release.\n\nAs said at the beginning: if you liked Gothic and Gothic II you will probably enjoy this very much, if not, the rather have a look at Risen 2 and 3 which continue the story with a more pirat-like setting. These are more modern games that keep much of what defined the Gothic series, but with much improved technology, a more varied setting (several islands to explore) and a better story. Just don't expect a pirates in the Caribean swashbuckling adventure -  the Risen series stays true to the Gothic RPGs.","January 23, 2015","true","70.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Which of course had to be named something else because trademarks remained with the former publisher. But that is what Risen is: another Gothic. After the train wreck that was Gothic 3, Risen is, in concept, a return to what these developers do best. Relatively small island world, social progression before you actually get into meaningful fights, three factions with different attitudes. The pieces are all there, and sometimes it feels not like a new game, but like a "Best of Gothic" highlight reel, just missing many of the true highlights. Most quests and concepts are reiterations of the same things in earlier Gothic games, sometimes with only very slight or no variations. At times it feels like playing a homage game made by Gothic fans - copying what made Gothic great, but with no inspiration to go beyond that. Which is not all bad, depending on what you want. For true nostalgia, however, the old Gothic characters would have been necessary, and those are of course absent. Some characters start out interesting, but then degress into generic stereotypes, even the ambiguous Mendoza and the could-have-been-great Don Esteban.\nThis all spells mediocre game, and it is one. The most innovative thing is the (yet again) simplified character build, and it is not a positive innovation in my view. Especially the combat system is asinine and does most things worse than even Gothic 3. I should mention that I still consider the Gothic 1 combat/control system the best not only in the series, but the best that was ever made. It was simple, rewarding and scaled well. The system in Risen? Had me raging, and curse the developers in many colourful ways. It's random, stupid, illogical and unfair, at least if you are masochist enough to be a melee fighter. I didn't try magic, maybe that is better.\nI wanted to like this game, and at times, I did enjoy it. But unfortunately it fails on too many fronts to be truly recommended. The best game these developers could make is a remake of Gothic 1 with current technology, and Risen is not that game. It is not any other game, either. I hope this is just a transitional step, and Risen 2 will be better. Right now, I'm not eager to play that one. But I probably will anyway.\nFor old times' sake.","August 15, 2014","true","47.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And it does it pretty well. If you didn't get it on Humble Bundle, wait for a sale and play it right away. You won't be dissapointed!\n\nThings that I like:\n-good voice acting, a few cool and funny characters, as well as dialogues;\n-the monsters and creatures respawn; (triggered by certain things like new chapter etc. )\n-armor is very rare; it's expensive and you can only get it from joining factions. That makes you feel somewhat powerful and it's more rewarding this way;\n-pickpocketing is fun; (you can even steal items in use :D)\n-unlimited inventory, no carrying weight\n-leveling up and spending learning points is highly rewarding and satisfying\n-simplistic and cool UI\n\nThings I don't like:\n-the combat and it's animations are pretty clunky and it's kinda hard to excell at it\n-lockpicking involves luck, not real 'skill'. Locks are not random and you can abuse this pretty easy with a quicksave. I'm not really complaining about this, but it could've been better.\n-occasional bugs\n-lacks of minimap. I used to have a compass on my screen but that dissapeared somehow.\n\nOthers:\n-You can fast travel only when you get to chapter 2. There are 14 teleporting stones and you need to find them so you can be able to use them.\n-you are going to spend most of your time walking, quicksaving, dying and quickloading","March 2, 2015","true","21.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flametrooper/recommended/40300/","Flametrooper","Jade.Wu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flametrooper/","190 products in account","Risen is what I call a spiritual successor to the Gothic Series, more specifically Gothic 1 which the developers had previously lost the rights to before regaining them shortly after the release of Risen 2. Risen is by all rights an HD version of everything that was good about Gothic. The small map that seems daunting but becomes akin to the back of your hand after a few hours of exploration, tons of dense forestry with ruins to explore, and a relatively interesting story concept of humans banishing the gods and titans rising to take their place for dominance and destroy the humans.\n\nOverall there is nothing that can be said is explicitly bad about Risen, there are some changes/complaints which I'll list but otherwise was nothing worth dismissing this game from being playable. I know there are plenty of people who complained about the 'old-fashionedness' which I can see nothing of in my playthrough.\n\nIf you liked any of Gothic, you'll simply fall in love with Risen, the atmosphere is great with everything that I had liked about Gothic. Sadly I felt that the humor was a tad off from the Gothic days were I found every quip to bring a half-smile to my face no matter how corny. In Risen many of the jokes/quips are short one liners that simply don't hit the same mark for some reason, and it's hard to pinpoint why that is.\n\nUnlike Gothic 1, Risen decided to narrow the choices for the player with only including two different camps for the player to choose from with the Volcano Keep vs the Bandit Camp while Gothic had the Old Camp, New Camp, and the Swamp. It oftentimes feels as though Risen was originally going to have three divisions like Gothic but was changed to only have two instead, possibly because of compact the island was and how strange it would be to have three factions vying for control over the island. This was something I felt that Gothic had an issue with as the Old Camp was virtually non-existent until nearly the end of the game, which I think would have been the case if Harbortown was a seperate entity in Risen. My point is that in Gothic 1 both the Swamp and New Camp were interesting and everyone involved seemed to be pleasant which inticed you into a conflict of which faction to join. In Risen you have the Bandit Camp full of absolute dirtbags with the exception of the Smith and one or two other characters or the Volcano Keep where you get walloped until you join their faction unwillingly. Quite frankly I found myself hating both sides and often swindling whoever I could whenever possible.\n\nPortal Stones were an addition to the game not unusual from the Gothic Franchise and while the original Gothic had only three stones; each for a differing capitol, Risen rose above to a grand total of 14 teleport stones. The only issue I have with the stones is that it spawns lizards that hold the stones in a wide variety of places that the player has quite likely already been, resulting in missing stones with no quest map to avail their needs. Furthermore these stones are often too close together and not far enough apart, some regions of the map have no teleport stone to have easy access to the area without running around or inside a mountain. This brings me into the map issue where while the map is densly packed with things to do there are certain regions that are used marginally once, and never set upon again. This is also addressed in my various complaints log where I state that the search is often left undone as the best stuff in the game is generally handed out to the player in plain sight with very few hidden goodies to treasure. The Berserker Sword for example is in one of the five endgame dungeons but can be accessed before even that chapter, as early as chapter 1 and is easily one of THE BEST WEAPONS in the game.\nNow various complaints\n-Traits or skill trees were worthless for the most part, sword/axe trees were only useful to equip 2h weapons with 1h, which means that attributes give far more weight\n-Dexterity items were extremely lacking and it's disappointing that they put only ranged weapons in the grouping which were almost worthless\nTo me the sword skill should have grown off dexterity with dex having bows and swords - str having axes and crossbows - intel having staves and magic.\n-Blacksmithing level 3 was absolutely worthless with many weapons easily outdoing any craftable weapon, only level 2 was worthwhile with Goldsmithing\n-Acrobatics, Sneaking, Alchemy, Prospecting, and Gutting Animals were all absolutely mandatory and it seems weird that these were optional choices.\nIn that note Prospecting became worthless quickly after gaining the amount of gold you need and finding the jewelry you want. I collected well over 99 iron ore and obsidian ore with nothing of worth to create.\nAlchemy allows you to create 'additional' permanent stat points but the game fails to explain that you can't level stats with learning points past 100 of any attribute which tricks players into using potions or stat increases before they hit the 100 mark when they could go up to 200 of any attribute. Additional stats in my opinion should have been a seperate variable that adds onto the characters base stats.\n-When training skills if a ring is equipped that upgrades the skill you actually pay for the level ABOVE what skill you actually have.\n-Odd game mechanics coming into play at the very end of the game forcing the player to press the same switch to open different doors which was never implemented earlier (literally in the last dungeon\n-More about the final dungeon; there is an area that doesn't allow the player to use magics because the player could levitate over the gap and get stuck behind an immovable stone door. This was likely done to prevent players from getting stuck since it probably happened A LOT during the beta test of the game. It's extremely silly you can't use magic in only this location and made me fall to my death in areas located AROUND this location making me fall out of levitate for no reason until I got lower in the dungeon and found out why it was happening. Overall it was cheaply done to route the problem they were having instead of quickly designing a quick side path to let players escape, even a small hole could have supplemented with the transform snail spell.\n-Often warped up to the top of different buildings when walking INTO the building\n-Enemies would warp to a position around the player for some reason, especially annoying if you would get your enemy into a position to combo him easily to only have him warp around your character and combo you instead.\n-Combat was rough, and the lockon system often felt off. Sadly this game doesn't do multiple enemy combat very well which there is A LOT of.\n-Combat being Rough: Due to the jerkiness of the jump/dodge key which would terrorize combat with you being unalbe to jump back if a pebble or small incline was in your path.\n-Sometimes attacks would just phase through enemies can't even explain this one\n-Enemies jump back WAY TOO preemptively it gets really annoying and oftentimes you just have to force an enemy into a corner to stop them from jumping back\n-No merchant talent which I thought would be insanely useful to increase sale prices, since you will only get 1/20 of the worth of any item you sell.\n-Last boss was silly but I think most of the final bosses have always been silly for Piranha Bytes\n-Quest Map was a seperate map instead of overlaying the Map UI when clicking on a quest, I have no idea why these two were made independently.\n-Lack of 'dungeons' to explore, with final quest throwing 5 dungeons all at once that makes you hate everything about them. Think Oblivion and closing the 8 gates in a row, it just sucks doing it all at once.\n-Tons of secret areas but are rarely worth finding them, oftentimes used a spell like levitate to find 40 coins which isn't even worth the cost of the spell.\netc...","March 19, 2015","true","26.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If ever a game was created to frustrate and punish (not by way of skill cap) an rpg lover, it would be this game. Risen has all the appeal of dating a toothless Little Debbie taste tester without the great bjs or free snacks.  It boasts so many cool concepts and executes on NONE of them.  Easily one of the ugliest least enjoyable Rpgs I have ever played.\nMaking a list of pros for this game is next to impossible;  maybe the interesting creatures in the world could be appealing to some, but definitely not when weighed with all the filth this game manages to churn out.  The combat is complete trash, you button mash for melee and god forbid you try to use ranged.  No reticle unless you zoom and the zoom takes 2 seconds to focus. Now try to get a shot off while groups of melee  enemies rush your face.  Basically the only ranged strats consist of shooting before in combat and switching to melee (O don't switch weapons while zoomed cause it will stay there and u will have to manually zoom back out...derp) or breaking the stupid AI by diagonally strafing into enemies and shooting them when their character models begin turning.\nThe AI is laughable and insanely easy to take advantage of,  Running a group of enemies over tree roots and getting them stuck allows them to be easily picked off.  And again since most enemies are melee it makes it that much easier.  Enemies have one attack pattern that never changes, charge into you and do 1 of their often times 2 possible combos.  The game tries to mask this huge failure by making the difficulty extremely high.  If you're playing on hard enemies will kill you in a couple attacks.  Im perfectly fine with a game having a high difficulty curve...If it's fun (Dark souls).  This game is not fun at all.\nWhile the game says it has character customization and varying skill paths it basically boils down to being a bandit or a mage both of which have as much depth as a mud puddle in July.  Much like the skills, the quests have different ways of completion that would appear to have morale consequences tied to them but in the end its essentially more gold for making the "correct" decision and even if you completely screw over the npcs related to the quest  and they say they hate you, they will still interact with you the same way. The quests reminded me of an MMO, a whole lot of fetch and kill quests with almost no substance; given by countless npcs you will never care about.  Every npc has the same melancholy tone and you will remember none of them, much like your own character.  You can literally go into a town, find someone in their house, beat them till their health is gone, loot all their items, wait for them to get up and beat you to death (you dont die) and get up and keep everything.  Rinse and repeat. Such a well coded game.\nThe world is open for each map and you're free to explore as you like, likewise with quests you can pick the order of completion for many outside of crucial story quests.  This is a wonderful model for an rpg to have, unfortunately for this game the maps are bland and almost always dark.  There was no place I visited during my playtime that was memorable and quite frankly the game is ugly, like early original xbox ugly.  It's only fair to note that I never actually beat the game even though that was my primary goal.  So it is possible that the quests might have started to pick up and became somewhat interesting, but this in no way excuses the snore-fest that was the first part of the game.\nSo we have an ugly role playing game with terrible AI, boring combat, forgettable quests and a depressing cast of characters that only reflect how you will feel inside after you start playing.  The only way I would ever recommend this game is if it was at least 85% off and you have played almost every other rpg on steam. Piranha Bytes really dropped the ball on this one.  3/10 for this walking steamer.","April 5","false","3.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

I like the first two installments of the series (along with the Night of the Raven). I couldn't get over Gothic 3, Forsaken Gods and Arcania - they simply broke my heart.\n\nNow, please, turn on this track before you start reading this review. I insist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLpvT97bQGk\nTurned on? Okay, you're good to go.\n\nRisen isn't a perfect game, but it's good enough for me. I'm enchanted with Gothic, of course, but that's a legitimate reason for me to like Risen. The game has many references to Gothic (familiar character names, bandit camp in the swamps, Harbor City, civil war, an isolated island with tense residents - it just makes you feel like in the two original Gothic games).\n\nWhat can I say about graphics... I'm not someone who is familiar with the newest graphics. I played Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes and I can admit that the graphics there are astonishingly beautiful. What about Risen? They're... different than that. That's all I can say. I just lost track and can't really tell a difference. I guess it might be safe to say that this game's graphics have aged somehow, but they aren't bad even for today's standards.\n\nThe audio is lacking in something - particularly Kai Rosenkranz's music (EDIT: actually, I just found out that Kai *did* compose Risen's OST - but it is different for some reason, so different that I couldn't even tell this was Kai's music indeed). This is the thing I miss the most. Kai really had a talent to create great, varying moods throughout the entire games with mere music. Once you feel at ease, at another time you feel tense, and at totally another time you feel grave. I would dare to call him one of the best composers, I would even dare to say he's better than Soule. Risen lacks this atmospheric music, unfortunately. It changes your mood subtly, but it simply isn't as powerful as it was in Gothic. Still, it has some catchy tracks, but you just can't really remember where they play after you turn the game off. Gothic didn't have that problem at all. If you did as I asked you to do - turned the Monastery track from Gothic II, it should have ended at this point. If it didn't, you probably have heard a large portion of it, or at least it started to loop. You can finish listening to the track, or simply stop it. Your choice. However you decide to do, please, turn this track on right now. I insist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjXZJ2ZY5og\nThe difference is obvious.\n\n\nThe gameplay is the most important aspect to criticize here. And here's the trouble. I cannot be unbiased. Like I said, I treasure Gothic dearly, and this game *is* like Gothic. You have many references to it (or just self-repeating patterns because of the developers' laziness - but it doesn't bother me, I like it). If you played Gothic, you'd have no trouble figuring Risen out, no walkthroughs needed at all. But if you're new to PB's games, then I suspect this game will be a challenge to you.\nThe island is small (about the same size as Khorinis). But it is extremely detailed. I couldn't find any broken places with floating trees, rocks or other, similar stuff (hi, Todd*). The world is semi-open - just like in Gothic. It doesn't feel like you're crawling through dungeons and linear pathways. Of course, that means the world isn't randomly generated on the spot by the game, and everything is pre-defined, which can be either a pro or a con, depending on the perspective (this makes this game's replay value lower, I guess).\nThe fighting system reminds me of Gothic - you can't just click mindlessly, but time your clicks and have a tactical approach to fights. If you are stupid, you can be level 15 and get beaten by a pack of wolves. But if you're smart, you can defeat a tough, armored guy equipped with a decent sword when you are a fresh castaway. Your combat ability depends mostly on your skill as a player, not on your characters' stats. Of course, even the best players will probably lose against some opponents if the odds are impossible enough.\n\nIt is a specific game. Not for everyone. But still, is any game suited for everyone?\n\nAll in all, if you are a fan of first two Gothic games - do get it. I'm sure you won't regret it.\nIf not - get a demo and try it. Or simply ignore it. Maybe it'll appeal to you, maybe not. You will have to try it out yourself.\n\nMy personal rating: 8/10.\n\n\n(*Todd Howard, CEO of Bethesda Softworks, famous mostly because of The Elder Scrolls series and Fallout 3 and New Vegas)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7trmEmI5Js","July 7, 2014","true","60.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You'll be able to  get what you need with some running around and planning.\n\nFrom the little bit I've play the game seems to be the same. Some games are dumbed down and/or made easy. Which if true which means I can recommand it to those gamers who don't like easy games.","June 19, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While it justifiabley deserves more, I was hit with a bug that prevented me upgrading my swordfighting.\n\nThe game itself is quite brilliant. Controls are easy, the scenery's good, and the story is easily interesting enough.\n\nHowever I was hit by two things that slowed the game down badly. Early on, my recommendation letter was not accompanied with directions where to take it. I wandered for at least eight hours. Eventually I searched online and found where to go. Second my close combat was hindered by my inability to advance my sword fighting stats.\n\nAnother of my grumbles, is that about a fifth of Risen, is spent in the dark. Medieval torches did little to help, and you have to drop them to battle, if your're using two hands. In there I was locked in battles with lizard warrior foes that took me hours and hours and hours to defeat. Shame. [Plus the disgusting noise the lizards make - urghh. It's like the sound of regurgitation and growling mixed.]\n\nMany seem to complain that Risen is slow, but if you're patient you have masses of fun.\n","July 28, 2013","true","67.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I recommed it to whoever enjoys the adventure/fps-combination and want a bit more challenge to the fights than pumping attack key. The game tells you to save often, and in truth you should do it after every battle; if you get caught with your pants down, it's all over in seconds.\n\nGraphics and audio is very good, even if my machine gets overheated quick on 2880x1620.

It has a very long storyline, with wide side-mission list. The combat sometimes can be buggy, and annoying, but once you get into it, it's not a big deal.\n\nThe ability to choose between factions is great, however I only played it through once, so I don't know how much difference does it have between the playthroughs. The skills are mostly done right, you can't be in all role in the game, however I think that playing as a swordsmen is much more difficult like as an archer, or mage.\n\nI'd give the game a total of 8/10, so I think it's really worth a shot. You can get dozens of hours into it, and if you're a fan of RPG-s, you possibly won't be disappointed, if you don't take a faults of game too seriously.","August 21, 2013","true","39.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yet I just can't.\n\nI had already played it some, the leave it right after exiting the game. But, after noticing the sequels for Risen, inevitably I told myself,  Maybe the story is good, since it spawned up two sequels.  So I gave the game another try, searching for  any  redeemable quality.\nI have to say I really like the alchemy system, smithing, and how the game make use of magic. Creating scrolls yourself and whatnot. It is a hassle, but a rewarding one. I like it how you can use a 'Joke' spell to make up with a character you previously angered. That's about it, I guess.\n\nMoving on. Halfway inside the main quest, I sighed in despair. Realizing that I don't even  care for the Main Character  for me to start caring for any its secondary characters. And that's a huge flaw, considering I play RPGs for its main content: the storyline and a good vast of characters to help strengthen it. Though some RPGs are lacking in story, they backed it up with an amazing combat system, for instance. Or its huge amounts of loots. Risen lacks both.\n\nSo, unless you're a die hard of fan of RPGs, with sole purpose in life to play every RPGs out there is in the face of the earth, give it a try. But I can't recommend it in full price.\n\nBut I'm only a voice, telling my own experience with the game.\nAnd then is heard no more; it is a tale\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\nSignifying nothing.","July 21, 2014","false","13.6"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","21","44","2","0"

And for about 15 hours of the game everything was 'about' right. But the rest - boring, tedious at times, especially after chapter 2. I will try to explain why:\n- Story. Of course Gothic wasn't perfect by any means in this regard, but Risen is way worse. I don't want to give spoilers here, but i felt as if I were doing one big Fedex quest, which was lame and uninteresting. Maybe studio ran out of ideas and had to make something generic...\n- There's nothing much to do after ch 2. Befeore starting ch3 you can easily complete nearly every side quest in this game, leaving you almost nothing after then (apart from main plot). In both GI and GII it was completely opposite, world was changing and giving you new challenges.\n- City is totally dull. After you complete quests in ch1, there is rarely a reason to go back there. And city itself is minimal version of Khorinis.\n- NPC are uninteresting. There are mainly just a quest givers, without a flavour to them. Compare this to wide range o Gothic characters...\n- Chapter 4, with all this tomb raiding and boring (like designed for mobile devices) boss battle is a fatal end to end this game.\nReally, in the beginning I was (positively) shocked - "Hey, it's good pold game again' feeling. But as I mentioned, the rest was getting worse the more passed. I played for nearly 40 h, but it took me about 6 weeks to end this. Normally it would be two.\nThere are pros of course:\n- Graphics is very good\n- Interface is better thought than in previous PB games\n- Combat system seems to be better\n- It made me want to play original Gothic again\n\nIt is by no means a bad game, far from it, but for series lovers it can be a let down - for me it was, so I can't really recommend it.","July 19, 2015","false","35.9"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","8","18","2","0"

It looks like talking to (badly) animated tree stumps.\n\n===\n\nSpecial Section - About Gameplay, Combat System and Character Progression\nThis is an extraordinaire section i made just for THIS review, in which i will explain to you, esteemed reader, the abyssal flaws i have described up above.\n\n1. Combat System: Risen's combat system, regarding melee mostly, is such a mess i have rarely witnessed in my whole gaming career. First of all, attack patterns, movement animations, speed, parry system are wholly flawed beyond repair. Enemies can dodge your attacks which is fine, but they can aswell attack just after they dodged, in the span of a tenth of a second, which you cannot do at all, and then repeat their attack animation a random number of times consecutively, this can very certainly end up with your character being 1-shotted by an unstoppable series of attacks you cannot parry, for there is a little delay between when you are wounded and when you can again parry; this delay is larger than the delay between the enemy attacks, so you cannot do any action while under a barrage of attacks.\n\nSecondly, facing multiple enemies is totally unfeasible: you can focus your attention on just one direction while attacking, your attacks are bond to follow that direction as long as the animation goes on. This means, you cannot, say, hit one enemy with a slash then hit another one near him and then a third one. Attacking one enemy leaves you totally exposed from all other directions, from which enemy can attack you like i described before. Player cannot even lure single enemies, as triggering combat with one will very likely trigger the whole enemy field and drag you to a multiple combat you have zero chances to win, unless said enemies are very far below your level.\n\nThird, animations are clunky, unresponsive and generally really messy. Players will have trouble timing attacks and also to spot when an enemy is going to attack, since there is no pre-attack animations, nothing, enemies just stand there then attack instantly without any little notice, and then return to their idle animation.\n\n2. Character Development: Oh boy here we go. first of all your class is bond to the storyline you might want to follow: for example if you choose to be a bandit, you will not be able to be a mage. This because when you level up, this game has no normal RPG style level up system, but instead gives you Learning Points, and nothing else. These points can be used at specific trainers around the world to improve your Statistics or Abilities. Fact is, certain branches of the Main Quest will allow you only to learn certain classes' skills as i said before. This limits the experience a player may want to pursue heavily. Also, trainers cost Gold, each ability you learn costs gold, and also Statistics cost gold, other than Learning Points.\n\nThis system is totally failed and limits the developmetn of your character by a lot.\n\n===\n\nFinal Thoughts\nRisen could be a nice game with its setting and storyline, but many gameplay-breaking issues and bad art direction flaw this game beyond salvation.\n\nI do not recommend this game at all, unless you just want a world of pain and suffering.","May 22","false","13.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","1"

Without adjustment it doesnt seem to work on windows 7\n2. The autosave suddenly saves over your tactically placed manual save.\n3. Your character is super sluggish when reacting to button prompts.\n4. In addition to #3 the actions taken by yourself and NPC's once engaged are almost comical in speed. Making it impossible to respond to anything. Best part is that when you hit someone, they dont get stunned, they just hit you back.\n5. On top of being sluggish it is nearly impossible to gauge distancing in this game, you can suddenly just get hit from enemies.\n6. If you accidentally steal an item, that person and all his buddies want you dead. period. for what seems to be the rest of the game, this makes for a game- over like result when it autosaves right after it happens.. Great idea developers.\n\nI can handle harder gameplay, but bad gameplay is another story..\n\nI will probably give this game 1 more try, only because I hate wasting money on things.

I had hopes going in it'd be fun, given it has a different style to classic action-RPG mechanics but most of these differences were very frustrating because the game itself does an EXTREMELY poor job of, at least, making you aware of the changes. Did not make for a good start for a Let's Play series on YouTube.\n\nThe graphics and audio have aged well, though the characters are pretty bland and uninteresting for the most part... but I admit I haven't gotten far in the game. The lack of presence of the story also does not encourage me to keep playing. Without a solid anchor to the narrative, I can't really immerse myself into the game. For games like Skyrim, it works well because they hook you into the story within the first couple of hours but Risen just doesn't get the hooks and alludes to no concept of the story you're suppose to be experience in the first part. You're just some dude who got ship-wrecked and, for some reason, has to pick a side without knowing what the hell is really going on. (Which I am aware you find out later)\n\nMost of the controls I had to learn through trial and error, since the tutorial parts are either bugged or just stop after teaching you how to open your inventory, looking at the character screen, and how to swing your weapon. Things like blocking and parrying are fairly easy to figure out but dodging took some effort as well as how to upgrade my stats, since leveling up doesn't seem to affect them at all, which would have been nice to be made aware of at the start and I still don't think I understand the whole system revolving stats aside from blowing gold on trainers... who seemed rather expensive in the early stages.\n\nThen there's armor... probably my biggest issue with the game. The fact I didn't find a piece of armor at all but I was practically tripping over weapons was quite confusing. I honestly thought I had broken the game or was just being an idiot (I like to think I'm semi-good at video games, especially RPGs) but when I researched several walkthroughs on the game, it became very clear you can only recieve armor under particular circumstances or paying a lot of gold if you manage to find a vendor that's got a set so... that was a huge 'NO' in my book. Not asking to have everything I kill drop items like a pinata but there should have been as many options on armor availability as there were weapons. Gathering the gold was an unneccessary and annoying side track that ate into time I could have spent progressing the story... but then some of the enemies towards finishing up joining The Don were barely survivable unless you have impeccable block/parrying skills (which I did not).\n\nThough I, personally, would not recommend this game to anyone and have much more confidence in other RPGs from the same time that would be enjoyable... I'd say give it a shot if you're interested and draw your own conclusion. I just found this title to be no fun and that does not give me hopes for its two sequels.","December 14, 2014","false","10.8"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

'But it's good that it's hardcore, i like it that way' some say.\n\nNo it's not.\n\nPlay Inquisitor or Dark Souls if you want it tough. Plain bad does not equal hardcore. Not with the amount of good alternatives Steam provides today.\n\nTo put it bluntly: If you are considering to buy this then ask yourself - are you ready to spend lots of time playing out a luke-warm story that is constantly hampered by bad combat and aging graphics? I say don't bother.  I spent almost 5 hours on this and did not get anything out of it. Nothing. no memorable places or events or anything. Could not possibly be more grayer game start. And i really don't give a damn if 'it gets good later'.

By the end of it the best thing I can say about it is that I'm still interested in trying Risen 2.\n\nThe tone of the first half and the second half of the game is alarmingly different. From when you first wash up on the beach with a fellow castaway who proves entirely irrelevant to the point where the main plot is actually explained to you, the game spends its time impressing upon you how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the island you arrived at is and how the population is the exact mix of workshy, cynical and desperate to put you in a position of solving all their problems for them out of sheer exasperation. It's a fairly interesting setup that manages to keep the usual RPG fetch quest formula while also completely justifying it and making sure it never feels like irrelevant busywork.\n\nThe second half of the game is killing lizardmen in a dungeon crawl.\n\nI'm barely exaggerating. Chapters 3 and 4 of the game are spent almost entirely in one dungeon or another, fighting wave after wave of lizardmen. While the early half of the game was fairly restrained in its call to violence, to the point where I don't think I killed more than a dozen humans over the entire course of the game, limiting combat mostly to fending off ill-tempered wildlife, the latter half has you cut down hundreds of lizard men.\n\nAnd to be clear, there's a good reason the combat was so restrained in the first half - Risen's combat is AWFUL. Take Dark Souls, remove the stamina bar, but also take away dodge-rolling, slow block speed to a crawl, and only give the player five armor upgrades over the entire game. I admit with zero shame that I eventually got sick of this and activated godmode at around 2/3rds of the way through Chapter 3. The combat is tolerable in controlled doses, but the second half of the game is almost nothing BUT combat, which the system clearly wasn't designed with in mind.\n\nA few more warnings to keep in mind should you try it for yourself:\n- Don't sell your scrolls, at least not the Telekinesis, Levitation, or Nautilus ones. Despite the ostensible freedom of the RPG mechanics, most of the 'puzzle' mechanics blatantly only have one solution, that being magic. Maybe one in five will give you a problem that can be solved with a bit of athleticism or archery.\n- Speaking of, don't bother with archery. It doesn't do much damage and the entire group will immediately bumrush you after the first arrow. Additionally, the ranged weapon skills only upgrade draw and reload speed in 10% increments, with no further abilities.\n- The jump mechanics are quite possibly the absolute worst I've ever seen in a game. In addition to being just really floaty, Risen's edge physics are absolutely terrible. There were roughly a dozen instances where I'd climb up or dump down from a ledge only for the game to be unable to decide whether I'd landed on the ledge or was supposed to slide down, and instead of pushing me down like most games do, it simply left me hovering in the air forever, forcing me to either load a save or restart the program entirely. Unfortunately the game requires you to climb or jump more than a few times to progress, so all I can recommend here is to save often.\n\nWhile the overstuffed combat and the tedium of the second half thoroughly alienated me, I enjoyed the game's opening hours well enough that I'm still going to give Risen 2 a try, but personally I'd say this is one to skip.","December 2, 2015","false","38.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

First, lets get the things they've done okay to well noted down: The pace of this game very good but the story is about average, Cliche, but better than some. This is NOT a short 10 hour romp of patheticness that RPGs made now are and the leveling/advancement of your character are at about where you would expect. In addition the world looks amazing especially for when it was made and it doesn't hold your hand as much. NO LOAD SCREENS! Well, Almost none, you WILL be hitting quick load a lot, but I'll get into that later. For the world, story, and looks I'd give this game a 7/10. But, like nearly all seemingly good things this is completely ruined by the following:\n\nIt commits close to, if not ALL of the unforgivable combat gaming sins:\n-all enemies physical attacks are normally twice as fast as yours.\n-The game randomly slows your attack to 1/10th your normal speed, giving all enemies\naround you free hits as you can't get out of the animation, thus killing you by default through\nno fault of your own.\n-Your enemies, including wild animals, can parry your parries, but you as a player can't even\nwith max skills.\n-All enemies can attack and hit you instantly, you cannot. Your sword can literally be\nconnecting with them in your attack and the enemy will often instantly get a super powerfull\natack in that is so fast you can bearly see them move,\ndoing massive damage to you. You as a player are not capable of this.\n-Dodging is of no use as your enemies can track you through it perfectly and hit you anyway. You as a player can't\ntrack or hit, even by chance, a dodging enemy.\n-Enemies have unlimited numbers of attacks they can string together while the player, even with the skill that\nsupposadly allows such, cannot.\n-All enemies recover from recoil 3 times faster than you do.\n-Enemies sometimes become invulnerable and cannot be harmed, this is also not fixable by reloading a save and\nrequires the game to be restarted.\n-Your character is sometimes spun around by enemy attacks and of course, you are not able to do this to them.\n-If you save after you have an enemy's attention any reload of that save will load that enemy within stricking range of\nyou and attacking, no matter where they were when the original save was created. This renders such save unusable\nas you end up dieing the moment the game loads every time, no matter what the cercumstances before the save.\n-All enemy melee weapons have greater range than yours no matter what. Enemy has a dagger and you have a two\nhand sword? Their dagger out-ranges your sword. Even animals out range your weapons with their horns and teeth.\n-Enemy gaurding has a good wide range of defense from the front, But you only have defense for a tiny sliver of angle\nthat leaves you pulling your hair out as you watch blades swing THROUGH your shield to hit you.\n\nSo, all in all I'd give non-combat parts of the game a good 7/10. It is a good story and environment but it isn't anything we havent seen before and the story is cliche. But for combat I give it a definate 0/10, that's right, an actual ZERO out of ten. Combat is so buggy and un refined it renders the game completely unplayable a lot of the time and melee combat is based purely on you getting lucky. So unfortunately, I have to give an overall score of 3/10 and can't at all recomend this game to anyone who doesn't want massive levels of frustration.","April 15","false","41.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

Bugs like "I talked with X before talking to Y and then I don't have the dialogue options needed to complete a mission anymore". Or I slept before talking to X and he disappears, so my only option is to respawn him using the console.\n\nBut equally impressive was how easy it was to find out the console commands needed to redress each situation. Apparently these bugs are so common that there are thousands of forums and threads about them. And I read about so many other bugs while looking for my solutions that I just lost all desire to go ahead with the game.\n\nMy conclusion is that this game's scripting system is completely broken, and for me that makes it unplayable. I really recommend skipping this one. I got this game bundled with Risen II, and my real interest was on the second one. I haven't tried it yet, but now I'm hoping it's not broken as the first is.\n\nUpdate: I'm glad to say that Risen II is very solid. Finished it without a single issue.

Either I've grown too old and casual for such games, or there's something wrong about it.\n\nIts technically openworldish nature goes in stark contrast with limits and shackles pushed onto you in such a strict manner that it simply feels shocking. Yes, there are no corridors and no narrow passageways between sky-high rocks, but instead you are still separated from your whereabouts by invisible walls of creatures way beyond your level, prices way beyond your possible earnings, and quests way beyond your capabilities - even if you are exactly where you are supposed to be gameplay-wise and story-wise.\n\nIn RPGs of the kind, I usually act alone in the wilderness, learning stuff, training myself, exploring locations and occasionally going to towns for some quests and business. That gives me the feeling of freedom I need and keeps me comfortably independent from my surroundings. To keep things simple, I'll just say that nothing of this is possible in Risen, and I feel very frustrated about it.\n\nOne of the most painful limitations for me is the inability to develop the character by means of practice. To learn skills and advance your stats, you must get training from other people. To get training from people, you need money. To get money, you need to fulfill quests. To fulfill quests, you need... to learn skills and advance your stats. I must say, I became tired of running in such circles.\n\nMaybe it's all personal, and maybe I'm overestimating some stuff, because I'm going unusually emotional about writing this review, but at the moment I don't feel like I want to continue this game.","October 18, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

This game is exactly like the Gothic games, except in slightly better graphics. Tedious menial tasks such as harvesting, collecting, and finding n number of some item are back again. No story hook whatsoever. It's just a random island your character finds himself in after being washed ashore. To add to this, the character's walking speed is very slow and the map isn't detailed enough and shows no landmarks, making exploration a real chore.\n\nThere are a lot of items to find and the combat is semi-decent, but nothing in this game really stands out. Everything has been done before by other RPGs and done better.\n\nSome of the dialogue is not bad and can be kind of witty, but some of the voice acting isn't all that great, especially the main character, who hardly puts any emotion in anything he says, and this is coming from someone who is rarely ever picky about voice acting in games.\n\nSome NPC and enemy A.I. is a bit strange too. I got into the arrogant guard captain's house and stole stuff from his treasure chest right in front of him and he did not bust an eyelid. I then took a mug of beer from his table and he got all pissy at me all of a sudden. Another enemy was doing a decent job stopping a few feet away from me, letting me shoot them with a bow, then to chase me for a few steps, and to repeat the same procedure till he was dead.\n\nIf you liked Gothic games, you'll probably like this one too, but it's way too slow paced for me personally. The most fun I got from this was when I decided to stop doing any quests and to simply mess around. Piranha Bytes just keep rehashing the same old boring formula in every single game, and until they make something new and different, I don't think I'll be buying any more of their games.","April 9, 2015","false","2.1"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","13","31","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnbonne/recommended/40300/","johnbonne","Fistfantastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnbonne/","472 products in account","Risen is a game of 'let's pretend' for both its developers and devoted fans - let's pretend that it's a hardcore RPG; let's pretend that it's acceptable for a game to be bad until the second act; let's pretend that the combat isn't a chore to sit through. Risen wants to be seen as a no-nonsense "classic" RPG, but all it really does is make the game little more than a chore to sit through. The game starts out with promise, where humanity has forced the Gods from its island, only to face a new and much deadlier threat: the Titans. With the Titans coming to power, powerful storms destroy anything outside of the islands, and mysterious temples rise from the ground to spread fear and, to the adventerous, the urge to explore. Your character is a shipwreck survivor, and a wreck in every other way possible, and is stranded on an island he's never been to before. You're completely neutral from the start, with no intentions of saving the world or conquering it, making it very much like some of my favourite RPGs where you start with no goal. This however doesn't take long to change.\n\nFrom the very start of the game, the combat begins badly and is only worsened over time. At first, sluggish one-two punches and weak waist high kicks are tolerable, but as one acquires weapons, they feel weighty without being visceral. Fighting in this game is nothing like a hardcore RPG, in which you have to know each enemy inside out and strategise before every encounter because, quite frankly, it's impossible. There's absolutely no flow or grace to the combat, instead having clunky dodge mechanics and weird AI, not to mention the animations which make it look bad as well as feel that way. Despite all the moves you can learn with new skills, there's just no variety of moves - it's simple 3-clicks of the left mouse button, and perhaps a bit of moving involved. The worst part about this is that some minor tweaks to the fight engine could've made this significantly better. Instead, I'd sooner avoid fights than risk my sanity for some wolf pelts and raw chicken.\n\nSpeaking of which, the loot is pathetic. With armour only being available from a few vendors (and so far I've counted 4 pieces of armour in total, two of which are just ordinary clothes), expect to find crummy weapons like sharpened branches, clubs and rusty blades. Don't be disappointed either when you find little gold from the mobs you kill, most of which will be animals anyway, so unless you can find quests where meat and hides are the requirements, you won't get rich quickly, or really at all.\n\nBut you need to be wealthy in order to make use of your skill points, as with each level up you get 10 skill points to spend on combat and non-combat skills. Seeing as only your health increases when you level up, it's best to spend these points as soon as possible with a clear idea of what you want from them. Oh, and you have to pay the trainer too. Essentially you can learn about 2-3 skills per level, increasing either your stats, combat abilities with certain weapons or learn professions and thievery skills. However by level 10 you'll have learnt the most interesting stuff like pickpocketing (which in fairness is the most useful thing in the game), lockpicking and Alchemy to make potions, so you'll be stuck with saving up to learn how to fight competently.\n\nNot that you need to worry about fighting well too much, considering the best time I had in the game (and perhaps this will apply to you; it definitely will when you get into a scrap) was doing fetch quests and talking to people. I'm not one to tolerate MMO-style questing especially in a single player RPG where I want to get away from it all, but when you experience the worst Risen has to offer early on, anything looks better later on. Getting involved in both factions' stories, especially when they escalate in Harbour Town, was far more interesting than whatever's going on with the gods, titans and whatever main story I'm supposed to actually care about.\n\nThe biggest issue that plagues this game is not its combat, its painfully average writing, its lame voice acting, poor visuals or forgettable - but excellent - sound design; it's the pace. In a nutshell, it takes far too long to get to the decent part of the game, and even then it can be hit or miss. The game requires about five to ten hours, possibly more if it's your first time playing to get to Harbour Town where the two factions can be seen at their best. It's there where you'll find better gear and supplies, plus you'll probably be powerful enough to take on basic to average-level monsters. I don't know about you, but I firmly believe a game should be good the moment I boot it up, not have some potential, and then have to slog through 10+ hours of the most tiring quests I've ever seen to get to what may or may not be better quests.\n\nHowever, the game may appeal to those who can live without quest help and fast travel, for a time. Having to listen to quest dialogue and take notes about important locations or items is as "classic" as this RPG gets, because there's little in the way of map markers or quest pointers; instead you have to rely on the maps you've obtained and find the route to the red dot on it yourself. However if you're a TESIV: Oblivion generation player like myself, this may take some getting used to.\n\nI'm not mad because of the lack of modern features which could make the game significantly better; I'm mad because this game wastes too much of the players' time before they so much as feel competent. It's more depressing than disempowering, and for that I cannot recommend Risen. If you need a second opinion, check out my video review below.\n\nWARNING: CONTAINS SWEARIES.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agsjny6tN5k","April 16, 2015","false","22.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferniecanto/recommended/40300/","ferniecanto","FernieCanto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferniecanto/","131 products in account","Do you think Skyrim is too good for you? Do you think The Witcher has too many positive attributes for you tastes? Think Dragon Age may be too much on the "enjoyable" side of the spectrum for you liking? Do you prefer poorly designed, unenjoyable games?\nOh, you know what the punchline is. But no, actually, this is not a set up to recommend Risen to masochistic people who don't like enjoyability; that would be too generous. This game is one of the most baffling, unexplainably anti-gaming experiences I've ever had. This is the kind of game you use as an indoctrination tool to convince people that gaming is unhealthy. Risen can convince you that games are evil.\n\nNow, I haven't spent 18 hours in this game for nothing. I really, really hoped this game would be interesting. Open world RPG gameplay based on exploration, with a sufficiently intriguing main plot but enough diversity to allow you to carve your own paths, is totally up my alley. The plot of this game looked sinister and oblique enough to pique my interesting, the scenery looked pleasant and the musical score sounded beautiful. The positive attributes end there.\n\nRight off the bad, you realise this game is every bit as "open world" as Elvis Presley was an octopus. You're presented with plenty of interesting opportunities, but they're all locked off behind unbeatable enemies. The game forces you into the trodden path in the most disappointing way possible: by killing you off instantaneously if you dare to go out of bounds.\n\nBefore you even get to experience some of the gameplay, you're trampled by the uncaring hooves of the Plot. And therein lies about 90% of the game: walking around and talking to people. You are literally LOCKED inside a town and forced to do lots of talking and lots of walking before you can get to see anything else. You learn here that every action has a consequence: in other words, you're forced to either join one faction or the other. You're led to make some very tough moral decisions; in other words, you do horrible things to horrible people, or you do horrible things to OTHER horrible people. And that's how you're going to spend precious hours of your life and precious dollars (or whatever you local currency is) off your pocket.\n\nAfter that gruelling process, though, you finally get to go outside, and test the skills and the inventory you amassed with great difficulty. What awaits you outside is a battle system that... well, I don't mean to say that it is botched, but... It is botched. Frankly, the combat in this game is one of the most absurd things I've EVER seen in gaming. There's no tactics involved. There's no skills being tested. Nothing. Yes, you have your basic commands (move, attack, defend, etc.) and some extra commands you learn through training (parrying, disarming your enemies, etc.), but the combat ignores that entirely. For starters, EVERY enemy in this game attacks faster than you. And I mean EVERY enemy, including the very first creatures you see. Every time you try to attack, your enemy can attack and hit you instead. This is not something you can just upgrade, no: every single attack in this game boils down to a matter of luck. Also, after being hit, your enemies can INSTANTLY attack you back. There is zero recovery time for your enemies, and stunning them is beyond the game's vocabulary. Also, they can defend themselves indefinitely against any attack. Mostly you can also defend indefinitely, but some stronger enemies can stun you and kill you regardless of defense (this is what makes some of the enemies unbeatable). You think, maybe, that you can defend from your enemy's attack, and use their down time to strike back, but no. They have zero recovery time, remember? You think maybe you can dodge them instead, but no. That doesn't work either. Fighting in this game boils down to a single process: first, you defend. Then, you let go of your defense, and HOPE the enemy doesn't attack you. Then, you attack, and HOPE the attack lands. Then, you immediately defend. If you're feeling adventurous, you can try a second, stronger attack, but again, you have to hope. Finally, you defend again. Repeat. THIS is the combat. We're not talking about difficulty here. We're not talking about combat that is designed to be hard, after all, to insinuate this system was "designed" is an insult to the art of game design to begin with. We're talking about a combat system made by people who never played a decent game in their life. To be successful in a one-to-one battle consists of saving and loading the game over and over. It's a matter of patience, but at least it's doable, you know, it's playable. For that reason, most of the time, the game pits you against three or four enemies simultaneously.\n\nNow here is where the whole thing utterly falls apart. Fighting more than one enemy multiplies all of the problems. ALL the enemies are entirely transparent to each other's attacks; you can get hit by an enemy striking THROUGH another enemy standing between you and it. As long as you're holding the defense button, the character will "lock" onto the enemy in front of you, but an enemy standing slightly to the side can strike and hit you; but to lock onto a different enemy, you have to move your mouse SO far that you'll need three or four additional desks around you. Often, the character will be defending an enemy that is standing yards away from you, while one that's right next to you will successfully hit you, only because you were too slow dragging your mouse all the way to the Moon so you could lock onto him. Again, not only the enemy you're locked to can successfully hit you even if they attack you AFTER you started your own attacks, the other enemies around you can hit you as well, so the luck factor is multiplied. EVERY fight in this game is decided entirely by the random number generator and by saving/loading.\n\nYou think that you can tilt the odds in your favour by gaining levels and improving your inventory. Theoretically yes, but then we bump into another problem: the game is EXTRAORDINARILY STINGY. Deafeating even the hardest enemies will give you negligible experience boosts. Most of the levelling up you'll get from this game will be completing quests, which as has been said, boils down mostly to walking and talking. You'll get more experience talking than fighting. The same is true for money: the enemy drops are entirely worthless, as well as most items you find. And don't think that you can haggle for prices or look for better merchants: everyone pays exactly the same prices for everything. And trust me, you'll need money. The levels you get give you learning points, which must be invested in the skills you want by training with people. To train, you need to spend money, and it ain't cheap. But don't think you can just spend your hard earned money in the skills you so desperately need, no: in this game, many of the obligatory quests can ONLY be completed by spending money. But even if you do improve your skills, this does not mitigate the luck factor from the battles; it will just make them last a little shorter.\n\nAll of that just to reach some new area and advance the plot. Eventually the fights started to become entirely unavoidable, endless, repetitive, and of course, entirely luck based. I was playing just to justify the money I spent on it, but even that was becoming too gruesome. I was needlessly torturing myself for a game that wasn't worth it. Why should I play this instead of, say, The Witcher? Or Dragon Age? Or just Skyrim again? There's no point. There are many, many more things that are awfully botched in this game, but this review would go on forever. No wonder this game is so cheap and always on sale, but don't be fooled by it. Save your money and your time for a good game.\n\n18 hours...","August 18, 2015","false","40.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","5","15","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/recommended/40300/","serendone","Serendone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/","675 products in account","Where do I start with a game like this?\n\nI guess the first thing to do is denounce any notion that this is an open-world game. After you break out of the linear tutorial, you can't exactly go out and do your own thing. High-level monsters litter all but a select few paths, and the only way to figure out whether or not you can pass is to fight these monsters (and surely get your ♥♥♥ kicked).\n\nSo, of the few paths you can take, you'll end up in one town or another, with different factions, altough really, they're all the same: masculine-looking people who hate you. Almost EVERY person you meet is a total ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. I understand wanting to have a game where you're not instantly likeable, but this is way beyond that. I guess I understand it, though, since a thumbtack has more personality than whoever the hell you play as. He's boring, he's constantly finding ways to ♥♥♥♥ people off, and his voice acting is poorly-delivered.\n\nShaping and growing your one-dimensional protagist is no fun either. EVERYTHING in this game can kick your ♥♥♥. No matter how decent the combat is, if you end up fighting a group of more than two enemies, even if they're weaker, you're screwed. And for how good the combat is, you can't easily heal during battle, so if you don't land your blows right away, you're dead. If you wander off into the woods and into a pack of wolves, they'll chase you and kill you.\n\nSo, that limits your area of fun to the towns. Not only do people hate you and constantly crap on you, but the few quests you can actually figure out how to get are your simple MMO "get me 50 of something" or "go here and kill this thing" quests. Not to mention there are no landmarks, waypoints, or any other mechanics to help you find the places these people want you to go. Why should I bother finding these quest locations if I'm just gonna get wrecked by a camp of gnomes or a wolf that happened to be guarding the tracks?\n\nSo, you can't do quests. Maybe you can go out adventuring on your own somewhere? Hah! Your character is about as devoid of adventuring skills as you are. You know nothing when you begin, and it's not readily apparent *how* you learn skills. When I tell my character to use a chest, he looks at it and goes, "Wish I knew how to pick locks." When I try to use a cauldron, he goes "I don't know how to use that." When I try to use an anvil or a grindstone he goes "I'm not a smith."\n\nSo, you can't do anything in this game. Quests are boring, and even when you try to take them on you're greeted with either failure and defeat or the opportunity to get chewed out by complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥ delivering very bad dialogue. I've put about 5 hours into this game and I don't know how to improve my skills. So I'm stuck in an endless cycle of disappointment. This game isn't even fun in the "it kicks your ♥♥♥" kind of way. It's not fun in any way. Sure, the graphics are pretty and the music is excellent, but really, that does nothing to save this game. Risen is terrible. Don't waste your money.","May 3, 2014","false","5.1"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","1"

The combat here really is the worst I think I've ever experienced in any RPG, and it's almost nothing but combat in the last chapter, which is terribly unfun.  Before that, though, the world exploration and questing is pretty good once it gets going after a slow start.  I played Risen 2 before this and enjoyed it all the way through.  I suggest skipping Risen 1 and just starting with 2, and there's no real reason to go back to this one if you've played the others.  Playing Risen 2 first, the starting backdrop is a little confusing, but Risen 1 doesn't actualy clear things up much and is vague on the world building background.","October 20, 2015","false","34.7"," 14 of 36 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","14","36","0","0"

Personally this game didn't caught my attention, but rather left me frustrated about the fact that if I get knocked out by a NPC, my Hero throws away his weapons and I have to search them again (IF you find them...). Also the combat system is kinda weird, because it locks onto enemies, but yet you can accidently aim at another enemy, which is in a battle of at least 3 people or so, a bit annoying. Also it seemed to me, that every enemy was way stronger than I was and killed me with 3 hits or so. Blocking didn't do the trick sometimes as well. The map isn't really helpful either or the journal for that matter.

The story is entertaining enough, but I cannot stand the combat. Because early game weapons and armour are all but useless, everything kills you in a couple of hits, and it takes a lot of hits to kill opponents. This would not be a problem, but the hit boxes and dodging system are crap. Even though I have not even completed chapter 1, I would not recommend this game due to the faulty combat system.","April 30","false","8.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","1","9","2","0"

For an RPG it gets a lot of the basics wrong, there is very little in the way of character creation or character choice. You play an uninteresting potato head looking protagonist with no back-story or motivations other than you've been ship wrecked on an island in an unknown world. There are three different ways of playing your character, as a mage, warrior or hunter. You are able to level up various skills such as strength or sword fighting through training that can be purchased from various NPCs around the island. It's incredibly simplistic and offers no real choice.\n\nThe NPCs littered around the island in small limited number of locations are lifeless and bland. The voice actors sound as though they have no interest and everything is delivered monotone which is strange considering the vast talent they've arranged for the voice actors such as Andy Serkis and Lena Headey. It also doesn't help that the character models look awful like they've come from a game made in the early 2000s. I struggle to think of a single interesting character in the game and even the characters with some promise like Patty have woeful looking models which undermine the character.\n\nCombat is a clunky and frustrating experience, based on timing and luck. Enemies enter into attack cycles, you have to block until they've finished their cycle and it turns into a repetitive and boring game of waiting. When there are three or more enemies it becomes quite hard as every hit you take breaks your current attack and being hit from all sides gives you very little option other than running away. Whilst combat becomes easier as the game progresses it still remains an incredibly frustrating experience.\n\nThe menu and item system seem to have been an after thought. There is no limit on how much you can carry, at all, meaning I was running around carrying 500 heavy weapons. With no inventory limits it means you give little thought to what you loot as you can take everything. More often than not I just spammed the loot button on enemy bodies without bothering to check what they had. Added to this the serious lack of weapons and armour, I came across 4 sets of armour during the game and you don't get the first set of armour until at least 7 or 8 hours into the game. There is also no reason for half the items you pick up, food and frying pans are all meaningless after the first few hours. All you need are potions are spells and the small number of items needed to make them.\n\nThere are some positives, the environment looks pretty good with a great Island setting and the story moves along a fairly quick pace with a couple of great side quests. However it's not enough to make up for all the games flaws which outweigh what little good there is.","August 14, 2013","false","31.0"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRCheese/recommended/40300/","TRCheese","Τhe Rolling Cheese Wheel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRCheese/","4053 products in account","Risen is an RPG that continues to follows the same theme as the Gothic series. The story is generic high fantasy with forgettable characters with even more forgettable quest and storyline. Like most of Piranha Byte's work in this genre, the combat is abysmally bad. Risen would've been at the very least acceptable if it wasn't such an unnecessarily long winded and bug ridden game.\n\nRisen is chock full of bugs, many of which will break quest line. I personally couldn't finish this game without the use of console commands to fix certain quests. The game becomes an absolute cluster poop once you hit the volcano mid game as important quest npc's get stuck or the lever that was suppose to open gates stopped working. Console commands can fix some of these issues, but the customer shouldn't have to resort to cheats to proceed in a video game.\n\nI can only think of one other RPG with combat that is even worse than Risen and that is Gothic 1. Coincidentally that was also made by Piranha Bytes. The combat in Risen is reliant on a very bad target locking system; it locks on the closest target, and you cannot change targets manually. This means that if a enemies groups up on you, you are going to be swinging at the air as the bull poop lock-on system wildly changes targets automatically. You will then proceed to die as enemies stun-lock you in to oblivion.\n\nThe game store page indicates that this game is 60 hours of game play, which is mostly correct if you consider that 40 of those hours are spent wandering aimlessly to find the next place to turn in your quest. The directions in the dialogue are outright terrible and the lack luster quest marker made the questing even more tedious and boring. Now compound that with the fact that Risen is comprised of mostly fetch quests and you have a recipe for one of the most boring RPG experience ever.\n\nRisen is basically Dark Souls with none of the awesome or the refinement in game-play.","October 31, 2013","false","18.7"," 3 of 22 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","3","22","0","0"

Played a little by the year but half the time I played (47hrs) was last week. Ended the game on a marathon.\n\nI strongly recomend this game. Nice history, beautiful graphics, sound and gameplay. To end the game on 47hr I think is a fair lenght, not to little not too much. It presents you more than one patch to go, so not being to long is good to try more than one.\n\nThe map is "natural", it has the feling it's nature made, not (almost every part) "man made". It makes you want to explore just to see how it's there, to go on the top of that cliff and see below, unocover that cave and know what lies there.\n\nA great thing for me it's it is "reality like". You don't change armor or weapon every 5min. It's an island on medieval times, there are not that much options. But there are enought to chose while progressing and forming your character. It's the same as locations, besides a lot of things there are carefuly made setlements with a lot of relations between the npcs. It's feels good to enter harbor town and solve some problens there before going out. The choices you make are important you cannot be everything. I played a sword and shiled only, after aligned with the Don I couldn't learn every type of magic, only scroll, with is fun, you chose you have to feel the consequences. They aren't just cosmetic. The system that you pay a trainer to progress on habilities is nice too. I like to think that you didn't manege to spontaneously learn what the others trained their lives. On game time I have beaten on 3 weeks, how could my caracter self taught how to scrib scrolls on this time? Of course he needed a trainer!!\n\nMAYBE SPOILERS HERE. The game peace is really interesting. On the first chapters you know whats happening, you learn habilities and position yourself on the island, lots of side quest. On the last chapter (not very long, made it all on 6hrs straight) is a dungeon crawler. It's nice, you preper yourself for your task and you do it. It's a history, a narrative,you do diferent things at diferent times. I could say that chapter 1 are not the same game of chapter 4, but both are really rpg. It keeps the game interesting you do slight diferent things as the narrative flows. .Every dungeon on the game is of a fair size, you can start a session, beat it in not more than 1hr. Pretty good for us that didn't have much time every day. And the final boss, for me, was awsome. Entering the boss, trying till beat take no more than 30min. For me it's nice, a boss battle is something to enjoy not to try days and days.\n\nA 10/10. One of the most enjoyable games I played.","January 3, 2015","true","47.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sadfeelsbro/recommended/40300/","Sadfeelsbro","ｎｉｆｔ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sadfeelsbro/","125 products in account","Risen...where to begin? This is going to be long so hold onto your ♥♥♥♥, I recently replayed Risen and wanted to give it a review.\n\nPicking up from Gothic is hard since Gothic is Gothic and Gothic is unmatched. Saying that though, Risen *kinda* managed to do it in a way that brought Gothics scope back to earth, in a very good and very real way.\n\nThe thing is, Gothic was such a wide and non-linear game that it was incredibly hard to actually understand what you had to do (As opposed to Dragonage, where even a baby can understand the objective), the world of Gothic was designed with no key objective in mind apart from the user exploring the world, and even though Gothic dated, in time, it's experience never did and it remains one of the best RPG's of the last 10 years.\n\nRisen, like I said, brought that wide, vast experience, and although it cut out most of that stuff out, and boiled it down into a 35-something hour experience? it was still fully open, and still had callbacks to it's forefather. Is that a good thing? I'd say so, if you'd ever played Gothic.\n\nThe Good? What Risen was good at were key, small things, like guards robbing you if they defeated you in combat, decisions that actually affected you (More on this later), factions that actually mattered (Kinda), forced content tracks (Monastery) that weren't droll or felt artifically enlongated AND optional content tracks that had abundant (Often overpowered if un-nessicary) rewards.\n\nThere were items in the wild that meant something, mysterious subterranean caves overrun by creepy, overpowered, grimdark nightmare-fuel creatures (You think I'm kidding) with some of the best weaponry in the game. quest NPC's were 99% killable, some quests were unavoidable where others were completely optional but had great reward.\n\nyou could fight and kill some of the best mobs in the game if you employed their own traps and tactics against them in the early game, and these feats felt fun.\n\n"But that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! those things happen in the exact same way in Skyrim, Dragonage and Fable!"\n\nNo way, The reason I say this is, you'll not know a trap even exists until it kills you, or poisons you, or makes your path permantely impassable. Risen is a ♥♥♥♥♥, and it'll let you know you ♥♥♥♥ed up by making the content harder, rather than just killing you outright, and let's face it, Dragonage didn't have any of that and neither did Fable, the only thing that came close was Skyrim.\n\nFor instance, in Skyrim, I go into a cavern, and there's a fence of spikes, I avoid that fence of spikes OR I die to the spikes like an idiot. Boring right? In Risen, You take tons of damage, but the spike wall doesn't kill you -- it knocks you deeper into the cavern, into a location where, let's face it, it's incredibly "Unlikely" you're going to survive -- but the game still lets you move on, sometimes even forcefully saving the game and making you pay for your mistakes. (Think of a more elaborate Markarth Prison from Skyrim, but much more difficult)\n\nThis happened in a ton of older RPG's, where instead of just killing you, the dungeon had scenarios where if you DID ♥♥♥♥ up that you were put into a situation that was nearly impossible without some amount of skill or determination, and that's something Risen succeeds at. Risen gives you the option to do things the easy way (Like complete your monastery training like a good little idiot) or take on the guards and kill all of them, or escape, or do whatever you like really, there's no third wall breakage.\n\nRisen doesn't put invisible walls in your way, and it doesn't restrict you. Instead of saying "Don't go here" it puts incredibly hard mobs in the way or makes those mobs teleport you to prisons, instead of cliffs having invisible barriers, you can jump off a cliff if you like, but you'll most likely die (Without levitation). The only game I've really played that does this is Fallout New Vegas when you try to get to Vegas and it puts unkillable deathclaws in the way, but Risen is much better, because these mobs ARE killable if you aren't an idiot.\n\nRisen has so much choice and free will elements too, Let's say, instead of buying that sword with the money that X or Y (Often good or bad NPC's) gives you ,then giving it to them, YOU CAN steal that sword from the shop and keep the questgivers money (Often difficult and requires stealth), OR you could always just fight the shop keeper/questgiver which would take 90% less time and take it from his corpse, never having to talk to any NPC, or do any quest (But that would be *Unlikely*)\n\nInstead of doing the tutorial-esque experience, why not explore the beach, get all the herbs and the better weapons and instead find that hidden cave that's full of grimdark creatures that drop loads of lovely items, this happens so much in Risen and I really can't understate it.\n\nRisen WILL give you a quest to get that sword, but they'll be another 10 hours of gameplay required to actually get that sword and you'll have to co-operate with a lot of NPC's along the way in order to actually get it, when you get it, you'll feel amazing because of the fact everyone wants this sword and it's actually an incredibly good weapon that you can actually use, and not just a "Quest item" you can then give that Sword to whatever NPC you like and get other useful items in return (Which open optional content). Risen has tons of stuff like that, then, when you think you're solid, an NPC might knock you out and TAKE THE SWORD FROM YOU making the game much harder, I mean, what the ♥♥♥♥ are you going to do without that sword, and how the ♥♥♥♥ are you going to get it back?\n\nGameplay-wise, this game is one of the best, visually it's nothing special but nothing to be gawked at either, (Let's not bring up parrots or anything pirate related)  the voice-acting is sub-par, but every character IS voiced (And the voices are pretty comedic). bugs tend to run rampant but also offer key ways to skip parts of the questlines (Jumping out of walled cities when you're meant to be locked in) Major Lore is mediocre, bizarre and pretty stupid, however minor lore (Like quests) are actually decent if not a little generic.\n\nI'd be lying if I said Risen wasn't your conventional and generic RPG experience, but it's the Generic RPG experience done in the best possible way, the only problems you'll really get is with initial setup if you plan on playing this with a controller, and that's a 10 minute fix. On PC this is really quite fun when you get it hooked up with a controller. Some of the other huge problems include contrast issues (Mostly to do with the in-game torch mechanics) and saving your game (It's a ♥♥♥♥♥) Sadly, I'd also like to add that saving really ruins Risen, it really does.\n\nIn Risen, you have the ability to save before major events such as fights (Where you could lose money/weapons/die) and if you lose you can just reload your save without reprecussion. If I was a mod developer or even one of the developers on Risen I would've put in-game restrictions on this, for instance, when you "Die" (Different from being knocked out) You instead wake up in a safer nearby area and some NPC says that they rescused you or something, but time still moved on, and you lost items in the process. I'd also add durability and visible wear to stuff like shields, since they're pretty OP, you can block any attack in the game with the starter shield unless you buckle, and that doesn't happen often, I don't know, small ♥♥♥♥ to stop the third wall from being broken, since loading screens appear from deaths.\n\nI'll say all of the other ugly stuff in a comment to this review of course, this is all very postive so far.\n\nI'd say the sequels to Risen are complete ♥♥♥♥ and aren't worth talking about and completely ruin this franchise (You thought Mass Effect 3 was bad? Move over.) If you forget the piercing pain left by the sequels (Which I won't even delve into), this game is easily a 8/10","December 16, 2014","true","58.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

If you think you're going to be a baddass from the first\n5-10 hours you are wrong, you start off as a worthless piece of s**t with no armor and no good weapons. At the begginning you are given a choice to follow the Order (The "Law" enforcers) or the Dons men (Thieves, rogues and some warriors). A mage would gladly follow the order and a thieve, archer or sword fighter would follow the dons men.\n\nMAGIC\nIn about 10-15 hours into the game (If you followed the Order) you will obtain magical abilities. Now, don't get too excited, (TES fans, i am one myself) magic in risen is not over the top or Really Awesome! like in TES (The Elder Scrolls), you have your three crystals, Fireball, Ice, and Magic bullet/missile, these are self explanatory but magic bullet is basically a machingun spell :).\nYou also can create scrolls with the ingredients and a quil and of course empty scroll paper and the rune. Anyone can use Scrolls but you need training to make them and use crystal magic.\n\nCombat - Melee\nMelee weapon vary, you have your basics like; Sword, Two Handed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sword and axes, and many more like; Machete, Demon Blade, Titan Wing and many more. You can block with a shield or you two handed weapon like a staff or sowrd. Axes are slow but more powerful. You can dodge by double tapping W, A, S or D, and you dodge in that direction. People say combat is boring i think it is great. You can upgrade you Staff, axe, sword and your ranged weapons of course and gain new abilities like; Interupt an attack and more combos and more.\n\nCombat - Ranged\nYou got your bows and crossbows (Most should be self explanatory). Bows use arrows and Crossbows use Bolts. What else to say?\n\nAlchemy\nI cannot stress enough about how much i LOVE alchemy in this game, its not the best but its great for what it is. You can buy recipes or find them, they tell you the ingredients you need for potions and food (Thats for the cooking segment), you also need Vials for the potions and sometimes water. You need to go into nature and collect plants and herbs to use for the potions for example a Health potion needs 3 healing herbs and some other stuff. You also need to have the alchemy skill to perform ANY of this.\n\nCooking\nCooking important, fried meat could be the difference between life and death. You will need a frying pan and raw meat to use a fire, you can also use a cauldron to make soups and stews, you may find apples, onions, meat, carrots and many other ingredients threw out your experience, these may be used to create meals to eat. Some food restores healt and others restores mana but the best restore both.\n\nThe World\nYou will die MANY times if you are not prepared or just a plain dumbass, be prepared, always have 10+ health potions & mana potions for your safety, remember to block and use all skill applicable in combat. HAVE FUN\n\nFinal Verdict\nRisen is not the best RPG but it certainly is something new in an old genre. If you enjoy hard but rewarding games than risen is for you, if you liked gothic Risen is for you.","December 19, 2014","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes is has its short comings but it really shines in the fact that it doesn't hold your hand through the whole game and lets you figure it out on your own giving some feeling of accomplishment. The game is made for people that like a good challenge. It's very hard and easy to die but as you grind your way to better skills, do enough quest for better armor it works out a lot better. You have to earn whatever you get. I think the biggest thing that  detracts from the game are the bugs where you get stuck in walls trying to climb etc. so save often. The game is solid, has different paths and many hours worth of game play. I took the bandit path and didn't use magic so it was more work but rewarding.

In this open world roleplaying game you start off as a stranded noname and work your way up to save the world which is being attacked by creatures out of long lost ruins risen from the underground. Besides it's beautiful scenery and a worthwhile story the game offers a character system and an inventory with infinite space (great for looters like myself). Although the combat system has been overhauled in comparision to Gothic, it's still a bit clunky and fights against animals can be a bit daunting, as attacks can't be blocked. Nevertheless I would recommend this game to all Gothic and roleplaying fans who are searching for a game with a nice setting and a not too shabby story including the "hero with no name".","April 25, 2013","true","49.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the developers of the Gothic series... which you can tell because it's pretty much like those games but modernized. The combat is improved, and the graphics are very much improved. For 2009 this game looks amazing (with the graphics turned all the way up). The game isn't perfect... there are some glitches, but they're mostly minor and don't affect gameplay much. A big chunk of this game is about exploring. Most of the game you're exploring a huge island, and later parts of the game you'll be in ruins and underground caves. Most of the enemies you kill stay dead, but at the beginning of a chapter some enemies do respawn. The combat is challenging, but satisfying. The story starts alittle dull, but by the end it's very interesting. If you're up for a challenging Action-RPG, and your computer can handle it, then I highly recommend Risen.","August 23, 2013","true","78.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world is breathing, colorful and with great variety. And so is the quest system. Few of them follow the standard gather and kill pattern. Most are connected with each other and do a good part in taking you along your adventure, exploring the whole island of Risen. With no doubt the best part of Risen is the epic sound track. It's on par with background tunes from the elder scrolls, perhaps even surpassing it, as it drags you in, the moment you are starting your adventure. Voice acting (german) is top notch, with great dialogues which will be good for a laugh more than once. Promised ;) Playtime is around 15h-30h (normal) depending on your playstyle.

It's addictive... The game starts out, ok, very nice graphics, nice dialogue, nice animations very polished game. The voice acting was very good IMO, especially the smith oscar in the bandit camp... Loved the interaction he offered. I didn't care for the story, it felt cheesy and kind of stupid, the main character was likable and simple. The world itself is very frustrating because simply there is way too much ♥♥♥♥. What I mean is there is a very large amount of confusing forrest and little nooks/crannies. They jammed a lot of stuff in a small island. It's hard to navigate through parts of the world and until you get a map from Nelson the cartographer, you are completely oblivious to where you are. You can find multiple teleport stones which there are 14.... That's outrageous... Wayyyyy too many teleport stones. It makes the play impatient and rushed. Overall, I enjoyed the game but I felt myself very annoyed with how simple the main story was. It was very much, go get these items and come back to me. Oh ok you got them all??? Now we need you to go get these items and come back. That's literally all the game is. The crystal disc gathering, the titan armour gathering and then the boss fight. All the inbetween stuff is great but the main quest was lacking creative depth... go fetch quest are boring and feel like chores rather than gaming experiences... Overall I'd say 7.5/10 I wouldn't replay the game and honestly, at the end of my bandit camp playthrough, I just used console cheats to experience magic because I didn't want to play through again all of the go fetch quests. The magic is good in the game I would rather have done magic, the bandit character isn't developed at all and the crossbow is AWFUL. Even headshots do almost no damage to strong enemies, the titan crossbow does less than 1/10th health damage to a lizard elite.","July 28, 2014","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first this RPG seems quite dull, but as it evolves it reminds me of Gothic quite alot and that's a game I enjoy.\n\nI give this game 7.5/10.0\n\nAs one general positive point, it is an interesting RPG with good quest designs and combat mechanizm, and as a general weakness of this game is that the character is not customizable (as in charasteristics), combat is challenging (which can be a problem for beginners and people who refer to take it easy, but others, like me, find it somehow enjoying and frustrating at the same time), and finally after playing a game like Skyrim or Fallout 3/ New Vegas, I got used to the fast travelling after you visit a place, this game offerss teleporting stones in/after chapter two but they can only take you to specific places (this is a bit weird and means quite a bit of walking is involved).\n\nIn conclusion, its worth a shot for the story and another unique adventure to experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/recommended/40300/","jjst9","Doktor Egg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/","1081 products in account","I'd characterise this as clunky but good. Parts of it are better than any other RPG I've played and other parts are well, less good and very occasionally down right infuriating. Still the clunkiness adds interest. If you want something that offers something different from the typical thoughtless rollercoaster gaming experience then Risen is well recommended because it certainly offers that.\n\nThe combat for example is genuinely challenging and engaging. The first time I beat an ashbeast, after avoiding them as impossible walls of angry death for the first half of the game, was a genuinely great moment. The emphasis on flanking and positioning is good but makes it all the more infuriating when a glitch allows a mob to clip through the mob standing in front of it to land an impossible blow. The feeling of powerlessness at the start of the game is palpable which is something that a lot of RPGs lack. Transitioning the character from badass warrior to a bigger badass warrior is not really much of a progression. Risen on the other hand transitions the character them from being some half dead shipwrecked numpty with a tree branch to being a convincing badass warrior and it feels great.\n\nThe characters are similarly a mixed bag. Several of the characters are genuinely interesting and, dare I say it, funny. On the other hand some of them are laughably awful. Sara for instance, the first character you meet, turns out to be one of the most paper thin RPG characters I've encountered. It seems obvious she was meant to have a significant character arch or perhaps be the alternate main character but she ends up being basically dumped after the first fifteen minutes. That there is also no option to play as a female character seems a shame considering that the main character isn't exactly a well fleshed out consistent personality who would have had to have been completely re-written. There aren't that many female characters in general and none of them really stand up. It feels like someone wanted to try to be progressive but others on the team must have been complete Neanderthals. Patty is almost good but then at one point gets pointlessly damselled in a totally out of character fashion. The female bandit captain was a good idea but rather undermined by being an almost completely reactive character who doesn't actually do anything except talk to the main character and stand about cooking... yeah... oh and she only has power by virtue of being married to the bandit leader. Sadly the gender politics of this game ends up being on average typically rubbish.\n\nThe story is coherent, just about, but don't expect any real ending. My guess is that something more ambitious was planned but ended up getting cut. There is a gimmicky final boss that is actually easier than most of the normal fights and then a fade to black and a voice over. Not much is actually resolved though and not much has actually being accomplished as far as saving the world is concerned. Ah well, it is better than the first Borderlands, just.\n\nIt isn't a game for everyone and it isn't a game for people who aren't willing to tolerate its quirks but if that sounds as appealing to you as it does to me then you probably won't be disapointed.","December 7, 2013","true","51.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this open world roleplaying game you start off as a stranded noname and work your way up to save the world which is being attacked by creatures out of long lost ruins risen from the underground. Besides it's beautiful scenery and a worthwhile story the game offers a character system and an inventory with infinite space (great for looters like myself). Although the combat system has been overhauled in comparision to Gothic, it's still a bit clunky and fights against animals can be a bit daunting, as attacks can't be blocked. Nevertheless I would recommend this game to all Gothic and roleplaying fans who are searching for a game with a nice setting and a not too shabby story including the "hero with no name".","April 25, 2013","true","49.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes is has its short comings but it really shines in the fact that it doesn't hold your hand through the whole game and lets you figure it out on your own giving some feeling of accomplishment. The game is made for people that like a good challenge. It's very hard and easy to die but as you grind your way to better skills, do enough quest for better armor it works out a lot better. You have to earn whatever you get. I think the biggest thing that  detracts from the game are the bugs where you get stuck in walls trying to climb etc. so save often. The game is solid, has different paths and many hours worth of game play. I took the bandit path and didn't use magic so it was more work but rewarding.

It's addictive... The game starts out, ok, very nice graphics, nice dialogue, nice animations very polished game. The voice acting was very good IMO, especially the smith oscar in the bandit camp... Loved the interaction he offered. I didn't care for the story, it felt cheesy and kind of stupid, the main character was likable and simple. The world itself is very frustrating because simply there is way too much ♥♥♥♥. What I mean is there is a very large amount of confusing forrest and little nooks/crannies. They jammed a lot of stuff in a small island. It's hard to navigate through parts of the world and until you get a map from Nelson the cartographer, you are completely oblivious to where you are. You can find multiple teleport stones which there are 14.... That's outrageous... Wayyyyy too many teleport stones. It makes the play impatient and rushed. Overall, I enjoyed the game but I felt myself very annoyed with how simple the main story was. It was very much, go get these items and come back to me. Oh ok you got them all??? Now we need you to go get these items and come back. That's literally all the game is. The crystal disc gathering, the titan armour gathering and then the boss fight. All the inbetween stuff is great but the main quest was lacking creative depth... go fetch quest are boring and feel like chores rather than gaming experiences... Overall I'd say 7.5/10 I wouldn't replay the game and honestly, at the end of my bandit camp playthrough, I just used console cheats to experience magic because I didn't want to play through again all of the go fetch quests. The magic is good in the game I would rather have done magic, the bandit character isn't developed at all and the crossbow is AWFUL. Even headshots do almost no damage to strong enemies, the titan crossbow does less than 1/10th health damage to a lizard elite.","July 28, 2014","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd say the combat is mediocre and only half the enemies are challenging (then again I played it on Normal difficulty because I'm soft haha).  I'd recommend Hard difficulty if this isn't your first open world RPG. The protagonist has next to no background or personality, except when he's being sarcastic.  His sarcasm is quite funny, but hopefully whenever I get around to playing Risen 2 they will consider adding more depth to the main character.\n\nA few things I would have changed is adding bosses in some of the ruins/dungeons you explore.  The only actual boss was the final one (which was slightly disappointing in terms of mechanics, but visually it was badass).  The ability to forge not just weapons, but chest and head equipment would have been nice to have.  If there was a way to go about that, I didn't discover it.  My final problem was the auto-targetting feature which would often get you killed when fighting off a mob of enemies at once.  You do get used to it, but it was frustrating every so often.\n\n\nOverall i thoroughly enjoyed my first playthrough. Story is the most important aspect of an RPG for me, and Risen delivered.\nThe first half of the game was a little slow, but it was building up the backstory of the island and it's inhabitants.  The second half of the game is when the plot thickens.  I enjoyed the lore and look forward to what the devs accomplished with Risen 2.","June 9, 2014","true","59.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A rather unsavory bunch, and some miserable questing, till I lured a monster down from the mountain into camp who dispatched my most hated rival for me (to much maniacal laughing on my part).  Then I made my way to town working for the Don and played that side till I was able to meet the not-so-evil Inquisitor and actually started poking my nose into ruins - though killing monsters was still tough-as-hell.\n\nThen my computer exploded.  Damn, no save in the Steam cloud for this old game.  So I started over, this time starting in the town and working towards becoming a mage.  The story plays totally different this time, so I don't feel like I'm covering the same ground.  Want to get good with the spear, but my sword and shield are still better, so I'll stick to that for now.  When will I ever be able to cast a spell, I wonder?\n\nRisen is tough.  Loot is ultra minimal, especially armor, and you have to earn what there is.  If you like terrorizing the populace like a Skyrim Sithlord, this is not the game for you.  Levelling up doesn't mean you get new skills, it just means you have the potential to get them;  you still need a trainer and you need to pay them.  The character models and animations are primitive.  You can't choose your character's race/sex/anything;  you've got the standard Ewan McGregor model, and that's it. Combat is probably trickier than it needed it to be.  I still don't know what spells can really do, even after playing for more than 30 hours.\n\nBut the game is addictive.  The environments are compelling.  The town, especially, is beautiful.  Solid voice acting all around, and the dialog is well-written.  The overall story is interesting.  The music is soothing and suits the game very well.  And beating an antagonistic monster NPC - either through guile or battle - is very satisfying.\n\nI don't know if I will ever finish Risen.  It is a hard game, and there are so many Steam games vying for my attention these days.  But if you see it on sale (and there will likely be more once Risen 3 is released), I highly recommend it.  It has gotten me interested in trying out the Gothic games as well.\n","July 14, 2014","true","41.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The other thing is that, in the beginning you are weak as a kitten and the world is very harsh place,but in time however you will become more powerfull and exploring the world will get easier. That for some people is a gamebreaker, or atleast a turn off. Games usually are easy at beginning and get harder by the end, but here the game is hard at beginning and gets "somewhat" easier towards the end. Atleast if you use your experience points right.\n\nYou see, you can not be good at everything, you have to choose a path and stick to it.\n\nPros: In my opinion the fact that you are really weak at the beginning makes levelling up and getting stronger much more rewarding. The world is beautifully crafted and intresting, making it fun explore. Every quest feels meaningful and gives you a reason to go on, no quest feels filler. The storyline is kinda dull but the politics bethween factions still kept me interested. Menu system, abilities and the fighting mecanics are really good, but those are hard to get into because the game does not explain itself. There is crafting to be had too, which i really like, and it can be really profitable on this game where everything is expensive.\n\nI love this game and give it 8/10 but it is not for everyone.","November 2, 2015","true","75.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Collect five discs, act four - collect other five items and we will add some irritating places you cannot avoid in any way but having a few exact scrolls on you... And slash through hordes of some dumb lizards...\n\n(SPOILER: Yeah... REPTILES WHO USED TO REIGN THE WORLD! What an innovative idea...!)\n\nThere is a piece of titan armor left to collect but for now I just give up. Games are something what should provide fun for me, not irritate me, especially after i spend a few dozen hours playing it. Below what I wrote when I was in the middle of the second act - it is outdated now for the reason above...\n\n...\n\nI used to be a big fan of Gothic I and II with add-on (I did not find the third part as addictive as previous, mostly due to irritating bugs like disappearing essential NPCs and boring storyline). Several years later I decided to buy Risen I and II from Steam sale off (I have heard of the series before but I was not especially interested - I do not know why). Looks like I hit the bull's eye.\n\nI hate cRPG games which force you to have a party of dumbasses following your steps (if I want play with team I rather play some real RPG game or MMO). My limits are Neverwinter Nights, Dragons Age and Fallout -like teaming games, so this game is simply what I expect from good cRPG before I even start it. I can be a great warrior but also a decent thief with alchemy passions – because for hell's sake - am I a hero or not?\n\nThe main storyline is very addictive and your actions like joining either of in game factions have visable further consequences. Most of quests have a few ways of completing them. You need some item from a greedy folk and have no money to pay for? How about doing him a little favour, or simply pickopet or beat him to uzurpe it? Even when you are older and simply do not have that much time to hang around in game world and stick out from main story, devoting precious hours of your life, this game just force you to. Not because you must but because you want. The world of game is full of locations which are little stories themself, pressing your inner curiosity to check out as many of them as you can, turning your mind into the mind of the rough world scavenger, slashing and bashing his way through skeletons in searching for forsaken artifacts.\n\nI have played a lot of cRPGs in my life, as well 'high-ended' as indie or rogue-like productions. But there are just a few that I have found as interesting as Piranha Bytes productions. Honestly I have not found ANY cons in this game yet and there is over a dozen of hours I have spent playing it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/janusan89/recommended/40300/","janusan89","Archangel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/janusan89/","270 products in account","Short Version:\nWhile it takes a lot from the Gothic series, it's a nice change in both story and "choices", since the game has no proper black&white factions. Biggest flaws are the combat being extremely clunky and the start being very very hard, since you're unable to do much until you "slowly" upgrade your attacks, weapons, and so forth. If you finished the Gothic games, you might give it a try and see for yourself: be ready to die a lot and to plan every single step you'll do. And be ready to save a lot too!\n\nLong Version:\n\nRisen is an action roleplaying game that is highly reminiscent of Gothic, if not being the same: the mentality used for this game is the exact identical, with each level giving you points that you use for spending on upgrades for your swordsmanship, skills (like pickpocketing), and even magic. So for those who played Gothic, like me, will know at least the basics.\n\nThe game itself is set in a different place (for what I read, it's actually a continuation from the Gothic games, where gods died. I might be wrong however) from the start you'll have to work on everything: weapons, armors, money and health. Yes, your health is so low, you'll die so easily: be ready to spend minutes drinking water or using your bed! The game however becomes way easier as soon as your health gets higher, you get a slightly better weapon, a proper armor and some money, and as you continue your quest you'll finally be able to go around the island and start to explore: the island isn't big, but it's big enough that you'll like to go around and check for secrets, as well for killing the enemies, which don't respawn (at least not until you finish the chapters). In addition, the game has a nice theme: you can either join the crusaders or the bandits...but neither of them is actually the good ones! The Crusaders are actually keeping the population closed in the city and from the very beginning they tell you NOT to join them, since they'll forcefully make you an adept. And the bandits aren't good either, but they'll tell you that they were forced to move away from the city: both factions have a definitive "gray" side that really makes you think who you should join. I joined the bandits and while you can do the usual thefts and stuff, I actually felt happy when I could help the people in the city! Not sure about the crusaders (I forgot their actual names), but don't expect them to be goodie goodie!\n\nHowever, here comes sadly a big flaw: the combat is so clunky, it's unfair. You are able to dodge the attacks by quickstepping away, both sideways and, I think, also backwards, which is very useful. Too bad ALSO your enemies can do that, and more than often they'll dodge ALL of your attacks.  I repeat, ENEMIES CAN DODGE ALL OF YOUR ATTACKS. YES it happened to me more than once, where I was full health and BAM, died because he kept dodging and attacking when I was open. Unlike the computer, you can really predict their movements, and you'll see this happening a lot.\n\nBe ready to reload your auto saves...\n\nThe game has as a plot...but it literally stops at the beginning and restarts later on. Most of the times you'll forget that you're supposed to be on a quest too! They should have made it more constant but instead you'll just forget about it. The game is pretty long too, since you can play "two" campaigns based on which faction you choose, but the plot remains the same anyway and unless you go explore you'll really play about 30-40 hours tops. Weapons are lacking too (we have swords, 2handed swords, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords, axes, hammers, shields and bows. And I think crossbows?) and you'll really focus on one type of weapon, since you have to spend your skill points to upgrade your skill in weapons and you only get them with levelling up. And since you can't grind levels, it's highly recommended to focus on one weapon mostly.\n\nOverall...It's a nice game personally: has flaws, some major, but it's well packed and will give you hours of play if you manage to get past the harsh beginning. I could recommend it, if it's on sale.","May 28, 2014","true","51.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find this game refreshing. Although it's a bit older, it has some qualities that new games could take a lesson from. There's a lot of optional ways to play the game: Optional quests, the way your character develops both in skills and via the story, and the way you interact with different people all shape the game you're playing.\n\nIf you're into games of the Elder Scrolls series then you'll most likely enjoy this. Be warned though, it's a little tougher than those games! Once you become used to the combat and grow with experience you will begin to enjoy the difficulty of the game and at the same time you'll curse it once you're killed in one hit...Thank you auto-save!","June 20, 2014","true","45.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to be aware of that before you ever start playing. You start out shipwrecked on an island wearing only the ragged clothes on your back . This game comes about as close to a real life scenario as you can get.\n\nIf you got shipwrecked in real life with little to no combat experience or training it would be just like Risen. You have to find weapons, potions, food, and all the other stuff by exploring, learning to fight and getting experience killing various beasts and monsters.\n\nI love the fact that as I get more skills, training, better weapons and experience, that the game gets better. I was getting frustrated with getting killed all the time, but I slowed down and took my time to build up my skills. Pigs and wolves used to eat me for dinner all the time. Now I can pretty much just smack them down and get on with my travels.\n\nThe game is really hard for the first ten hours or so, but it gets a lot better and easier if you stick with it. I have seen a lot of reviews talking about the horrible combat, but most people judged it on the early game play. You have to train and level up to get more attacks and better combat.\n\nIf you stick it out and train enough, you will get some very effective and proper attack and parry sequences to use. You also have to have enough strength or agilty to make the combat more effective and deadly. Like in real life, you don't just know how to sword fight and use weapons. You have to train and practice non-stop to get the skills and experience. There is a reason people have to practice martial arts for years before the can call them selves a master or to even be above the novice levels of skill.\n\nWhen I first tried Risen right after it was released I hated it. I finally came back and tried it again and now I love it. It's not a perfect game, but it is a solid 8 out of 10 for me. There are some flaws, and some things annoy me, but so does real life. The length of time the game gives you: and the feeling of growing and getting better and progressing make it all the more enjoyable.\n\nOne of the only things I did not like was the lack of armor and clothes. You get a pretty fair amount of weapons, but the armor is pretty limited.  I can overlook that in light of the fact that in real life you would not have an endless array of new outfits to find. You get a lot of chances to get better weapons, both from enemy drops and vendors. Weapons are pretty satisfying, they fit with the game progression and leveling up.\n\nAfter finally finishing my first play through, I can see why this game has such a dedicated following. It's called a "cult" game on some forums, and I would have to agree. It's got a pretty good length, but not one where you get so bored with all the meaningless fedex fetch quests where you never finish it.\n\nI loved the Gothic games back in the day, and now Risen is on my list of extremely satisfying games. I am now going to do another play doing the whole bandit quest line. The game is that good that I want to fully experience every twist and turn from all the different progression/character lines.\n\nThe fact that you have multiple ways to approach all the quests, and very diverging paths and consequences make it something rare to find in today's modern RPGs.\n\nThe graphics are still pretty good, even though this game is five years old. The game world is amazing, lots of gorgeous scenic views and natural locations. Ruins and cities are very nicely done, if a bit repetitive.\n\nIf you have patience and love to play a game where you learn and grow as you progress through it then I highly recommend it for true RPG fans.","July 21, 2014","true","32.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story isn't nearly as strong as what you'd expect from an Elder Scrolls game... probably because it's not (which the good combat mechanics will immediately give away)... but it's certainly not bad, and the voice-acting, the dialog script, and pretty much all of the character interaction in this game will keep your immersed.\n\nPlaying this game is like rediscovering Morrowind.

Now I'm writing a recommendation here so I don't hate it, in fact I like it enough that I'm getting Risen 2. There is a good game here hidden under many many flaws. The first three will hit you right away, considering that this is the "superior PC version" as opposed to the awful console version one would expect key bindings, there is no character creator resulting in everyone playing as Mr generic & the combat is awful until you get used to it at witch point it becomes boring with every enemy being a pattern boss. The map is also pretty useless & annoying since you can only view some maps via the inventory at witch point you can't move properly. Magic & archery suck with mages needing a consent supply of mana potions & archery feeling floaty & weak like firing feathers from a piece of string & many of the skills such as blacksmithing are a complete waste of time. So what did I like? Honestly I can't say, but I enjoyed it enough to get through it.

You are still a nameless hero and there are some key areas that shine in this game in relation to Gothic, while others fail to compare to what I found to be the best RPG of its time.\n\nPROS\nThe world is vastly open and completely explorable, there are a number of things to collect for alchelmy, smithing, and food preparation; the puzzles are a good balance of challenging yet not impossible; you're character is yours: meaning just because you like bows doesn't mean you are limitied to them you can dabble where you like. Some additonal pros are the ability to use two handed weapons as one handers with enough skill and\n\nCONS\nMoney is easily found and little needed. Skill points quickly becaome irrelevant, you don't need to level most things and frankly theres not a lot to level up anyway. Choices for guild are very limited: Don or Inquisition with little difference between the two.  THe game is significantly shorter then Gothic. Little to no replay value.\n\nIn conclusion, Risen is a decent game, and I did enjoy playing it; however it is no where near as good as the Gothic series. I would recommend that you play this first and then work your way up the Gothic series, so your games get better as you go.","January 19, 2014","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll do good/bad lists as I prefer to read them myself as well because they are easier to read:\n\nGood:\n+ Voiced protagonist unlike many other RPGs\n+ Lots of dialogue options\n+ Quality voice acting\n+ Choices matter increasing replayability\n+ Idyllic setting, relaxing soundtrack\n+ Atmospheric environments, good lighting effects unless you tinker with brightness settings\n+ Burried treasures\n+ Challenging combat, limited and expensive gear\n+ Tomb raiding, dungeon puzzles, traps\n+ Immersive character building. Your hero doesn't learn stuff out of nowhere after levelling up, i.e. distributing skill points. Instead you gain LP (learning points) which you can spend at trainers (NPCs who teach you stuff).\n+ Class system doesn't restrict your play style too much. You can be a dumb bandit but still can use magic via scrolls if you want for example.\n+ Reminds me of other A-RPGs I enjoyed such as Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, Witcher 1, Fable: The Lost Chapters and Dark Souls.\n+ Fast travel system.\n+  I love some of the animations in the game. Particularly lizardman idles where they snap a fly in the air while standing around or look around like a paranoid or shaking their head. They are strangely cute and realistic <3\n\nBad:\n- No respec system in the game (can be done via console commands, cheating)\n- Sometimes you might wonder why you couldn't complete a quest. There is no handholding to the point you start wondering if the game is bugged but most of the time it is not. You probably need to talk to somebody but you haven't.\n- Some may find the combat too difficult at the start.\n- No sprinting. You can get Speed magic which is basically sprint which should have been in the game from the start instead of a spell which you can get quite later in the game.\n\nOf course recommended. 9/10. A must play.","September 3, 2015","true","67.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I notice most people do not have this problem and seem to love the game, so perhaps I have THE ONE THING on my machine that it isn't compatible with, or something.\n\nI spent hours attempting to solve a flicker problem occurring every time lightning struck (which is about every half-second when the game starts), and an associated striping problem, and managed to get it reduced, but not eliminated.  I won't go into what all I did, because there appears to be a 99% chance, or better, that you won't have that issue.  I figured, at this point, that I would just play through and try to get to a non-lightning scene.

There are lot of similarities, which is all well and good, especially since it is from the Piranha Bytes, the developers of the first three Gothic titles.\nEssentially this is an open world exploration RPG in which you don't know what you're doing unless you really focus. The map is quite large without and fast travel and you don't always know where you are. You can walk into an area where you are too low a level for, it's easy to not have the correct skills for a quest and be completely boned. In a nutshell, this is a game that is out to get you like a Dungeon Master that holds grudges.\n\nPROS:\n+ Good graphics for the time\n+ Physics are fun to play with\n+ Easy to get your butt kicked\n+ Big map\n+ Tons of things to do\n+ Many skills to learn\n+ Great for Gothic fans\n+ Fun to talk your way out of situations\n\nCONS:\n- Steep learning curve for people who have never played a Gothic game before\n- Sometimes feels more RPG than action, which does not feel right for the series\n- Some humans refuse to die\n- Perhaps too easy to die\n- Too easy to wander into high level areas when under leveled\n- You always seem to need a higher skill level than what you've learned, no matter where you go\n- Combat controls too clunky\n- Leveling up and learning skills is a chore, an EXPENSIVE CHORE","October 21, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/recommended/40300/","jjst9","Doktor Egg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjst9/","1081 products in account","I'd characterise this as clunky but good. Parts of it are better than any other RPG I've played and other parts are well, less good and very occasionally down right infuriating. Still the clunkiness adds interest. If you want something that offers something different from the typical thoughtless rollercoaster gaming experience then Risen is well recommended because it certainly offers that.\n\nThe combat for example is genuinely challenging and engaging. The first time I beat an ashbeast, after avoiding them as impossible walls of angry death for the first half of the game, was a genuinely great moment. The emphasis on flanking and positioning is good but makes it all the more infuriating when a glitch allows a mob to clip through the mob standing in front of it to land an impossible blow. The feeling of powerlessness at the start of the game is palpable which is something that a lot of RPGs lack. Transitioning the character from badass warrior to a bigger badass warrior is not really much of a progression. Risen on the other hand transitions the character them from being some half dead shipwrecked numpty with a tree branch to being a convincing badass warrior and it feels great.\n\nThe characters are similarly a mixed bag. Several of the characters are genuinely interesting and, dare I say it, funny. On the other hand some of them are laughably awful. Sara for instance, the first character you meet, turns out to be one of the most paper thin RPG characters I've encountered. It seems obvious she was meant to have a significant character arch or perhaps be the alternate main character but she ends up being basically dumped after the first fifteen minutes. That there is also no option to play as a female character seems a shame considering that the main character isn't exactly a well fleshed out consistent personality who would have had to have been completely re-written. There aren't that many female characters in general and none of them really stand up. It feels like someone wanted to try to be progressive but others on the team must have been complete Neanderthals. Patty is almost good but then at one point gets pointlessly damselled in a totally out of character fashion. The female bandit captain was a good idea but rather undermined by being an almost completely reactive character who doesn't actually do anything except talk to the main character and stand about cooking... yeah... oh and she only has power by virtue of being married to the bandit leader. Sadly the gender politics of this game ends up being on average typically rubbish.\n\nThe story is coherent, just about, but don't expect any real ending. My guess is that something more ambitious was planned but ended up getting cut. There is a gimmicky final boss that is actually easier than most of the normal fights and then a fade to black and a voice over. Not much is actually resolved though and not much has actually being accomplished as far as saving the world is concerned. Ah well, it is better than the first Borderlands, just.\n\nIt isn't a game for everyone and it isn't a game for people who aren't willing to tolerate its quirks but if that sounds as appealing to you as it does to me then you probably won't be disapointed.","December 7, 2013","true","51.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difficulty curve is fairly tough at the beginning as the world doesn't scale much. So you struggle at the beginning but it gets easier as your character gets stronger (be prepared to save and load a LOT).  It is fun though, and has interesting plot. Although you can build your character however you like "to a degree," plot directly prevents you from doing some skill combinations. (For example, some skills can only be taught by some people who are enemies of other people who teach other skills). As a result, sides you choose will significantly impact your play style. (Some things you can work around a bit, others not so much).

You do quests and join one of three factions (bandits/inquisition/order). You can roam semi-free across the island though you will be insta-gibbed if your equipment isn't good enough for some places. The faction you choose kinda determines your class as it limits your skill trainer choices just like Gothic 1&2.\n\nIt's a good RPG and while it has its design quirks and odd bits the exploration is fun. Don't expect a deep story. You slay stuff, get better, explore a cave, find some ring, sneak and plunder. Side quests, main quests, finish.

You are still a nameless hero and there are some key areas that shine in this game in relation to Gothic, while others fail to compare to what I found to be the best RPG of its time.\n\nPROS\nThe world is vastly open and completely explorable, there are a number of things to collect for alchelmy, smithing, and food preparation; the puzzles are a good balance of challenging yet not impossible; you're character is yours: meaning just because you like bows doesn't mean you are limitied to them you can dabble where you like. Some additonal pros are the ability to use two handed weapons as one handers with enough skill and\n\nCONS\nMoney is easily found and little needed. Skill points quickly becaome irrelevant, you don't need to level most things and frankly theres not a lot to level up anyway. Choices for guild are very limited: Don or Inquisition with little difference between the two.  THe game is significantly shorter then Gothic.

This is an RPG for grown ups.  If you rip off an npc in a shady deal, they'll glady tell you to go fluff yourself!  The gameplay is challenging and not easy so save often.  Even the mundane enemies pose a threat and combat is very tactical.  Swordplay is not all attacking, you must parry and learn the right moment to strike and use combos.  Magic is also strategic. Mana is limited but mages can be powerful, but still need to time their spells wisely and have a backup plan (staff or swords) or an escape route!  The plot is entertaining and the world is very believeable and realistic.  I would say this game is an acquired taste, but quite a gem in the rough.  I'd say it's better than Dragon Age and slightly below Fallout 3 / New Vegas in terms of fun.  One of the most rewarding things is the difficulty.  It causes you to think when you fight and use strategy (and save games) which most mainstream games are too scared to do.","July 4, 2011","true","36.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The unforgiving, really freaking hardness that makes you quit, cheat, or reload save games a LOT (death is permanent there FPS junkies!). For graphics, the human models are definitely dated but the flora, fauna and non-human entities are still quite good today (2014). The scenery might not be Witcher 2 quality, but it comes decently close. The night and day cycle with changing weather also makes running around the island an enjoyable experiance (bring a torch, it's scary out there in the dark!).\n\nThat said, this game drew me right in after I got past the constant whooping that I received by boars (yeah, pigs kicked my tush and I couldn't do anything about it for a while). I believe it was the muscial score that really slapped me in the face and made me stick it out.\n\nThere are two factions - the outlaws in the swamp and the mages in the town. Interestingly enough, your choice of which faction to join *can* heavily influence your weapon choices and whether or not you use offensive magic. Scrolls, which don't use up mana, can be used even by full on melee characters and are a requirement later in the game.\n\nIf you are caught stealing, the people near you attack! They won't like you much afterward, but you can cast a Joke scroll on them to make them laugh which makes them tolerate you again. Now that is an interesting mechanic, as I had knocked out several NPCs after being caught stealing only to be able to do business with them later with a Joke scroll.\n\nMelee and bow/crossbow combat is simple but elegant, with the only downside being able to effectively attack AND block. Some enemies can score 3 hits in quick succesion on you if you try to attack at the wrong time. Zooming in (manual aim) with a crossbow resets your FOV distance for your character, which is a bit annoying but not game breaking.\n\nThe storytelling is pretty darned good in this game - I was drawn in and actually cared not just for my character, but for several other NPCs throughout my questing.\n\nYou may be on a fairly small island, but there is a LOT to do and even more nooks and crannies to explore. All the while the musical score wowed me - yes it repeats, but it really clinches the deal and makes this an amazing game. I honestly didn't mind stopping to pick the plants that are everywere all while I listened to the haunting (almost goosebump giving) music.\n\nI am very, very happy to have come across this game years after its release. To be drawn in by the beautiful tropical island landscape, to lose myself in the music and story, and to jump right out of my skin when a skeleton bursts out of a just raided tomb makes this an almost perfect game - 95/100.\n\nIf you appreciate a little more structure than the Elder Scrolls series with a smaller world, you will love this game. Well, provided the boars don't make you quit ;-D","July 14, 2014","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the developers of the Gothic series... which you can tell because it's pretty much like those games but modernized. The combat is improved, and the graphics are very much improved. For 2009 this game looks amazing (with the graphics turned all the way up). The game isn't perfect... there are some glitches, but they're mostly minor and don't affect gameplay much. A big chunk of this game is about exploring. Most of the game you're exploring a huge island, and later parts of the game you'll be in ruins and underground caves. Most of the enemies you kill stay dead, but at the beginning of a chapter some enemies do respawn. The combat is challenging, but satisfying. The story starts alittle dull, but by the end it's very interesting. If you're up for a challenging Action-RPG, and your computer can handle it, then I highly recommend Risen.","August 23, 2013","true","78.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world is breathing, colorful and with great variety. And so is the quest system. Few of them follow the standard gather and kill pattern. Most are connected with each other and do a good part in taking you along your adventure, exploring the whole island of Risen. With no doubt the best part of Risen is the epic sound track. It's on par with background tunes from the elder scrolls, perhaps even surpassing it, as it drags you in, the moment you are starting your adventure. Voice acting (german) is top notch, with great dialogues which will be good for a laugh more than once. Promised ;) Playtime is around 15h-30h (normal) depending on your playstyle. Don't get turnoff by your first footsteps in the begnning. This is yet one of these few games which don't take your hand. It's not easy, but go on.

Probably one of my favourite RPGS I've played to date. It's very old, so the graphics and such aren't up to par with the newer games, but the storyline and the gameplay more than make up for that. I found the storyline enjoyable to play, and I liked progressing through the game in my own manner. Most things you can do in this game are very fun, and easy to get a hold of.\n\nComplaints include: There isn't any character customization at all, you're stuck with the same man as your character with the same look and same voice and there isn't much class customization either, you can use an axe, or a sword, or a bow, or go two-handed/dual wield. The mobs become considerably harder near the end of the game, as well, even with Titan-level weapons, and armor, the mobs prove to be very challenging, and annoying.\n\nOverall, this game has a fairly old school feel to it and has a lot of fun RPG elements involved, making it one of the most enjoyable RPGS I've played to date. Worth the money, I think.\n\n8.5/10","May 18, 2014","true","45.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to be aware of that before you ever start playing. You start out shipwrecked on an island wearing only the ragged clothes on your back . This game comes about as close to a real life scenario as you can get.\n\nIf you got shipwrecked in real life with little to no combat experience or training it would be just like Risen. You have to find weapons, potions, food, and all the other stuff by exploring, learning to fight and getting experience killing various beasts and monsters.\n\nI love the fact that as I get more skills, training, better weapons and experience, that the game gets better. I was getting frustrated with getting killed all the time, but I slowed down and took my time to build up my skills. Pigs and wolves used to eat me for dinner all the time. Now I can pretty much just smack them down and get on with my travels.\n\nThe game is really hard for the first ten hours or so, but it gets a lot better and easier if you stick with it. I have seen a lot of reviews talking about the horrible combat, but most people judged it on the early game play. You have to train and level up to get more attacks and better combat.\n\nIf you stick it out and train enough, you will get some very effective and proper attack and parry sequences to use. You also have to have enough strength or agilty to make the combat more effective and deadly. Like in real life, you don't just know how to sword fight and use weapons. You have to train and practice non-stop to get the skills and experience. There is a reason people have to practice martial arts for years before the can call them selves a master or to even be above the novice levels of skill.\n\nWhen I first tried Risen right after it was released I hated it. I finally came back and tried it again and now I love it. It's not a perfect game, but it is a solid 8 out of 10 for me. There are some flaws, and some things annoy me, but so does real life. The length of time the game gives you: and the feeling of growing and getting better and progressing make it all the more enjoyable.\n\nOne of the only things I did not like was the lack of armor and clothes. You get a pretty fair amount of weapons, but the armor is pretty limited.  I can overlook that in light of the fact that in real life you would not have an endless array of new outfits to find. You get a lot of chances to get better weapons, both from enemy drops and vendors. Weapons are pretty satisfying, they fit with the game progression and leveling up.\n\nAfter finally finishing my first play through, I can see why this game has such a dedicated following. It's called a "cult" game on some forums, and I would have to agree. It's got a pretty good length, but not one where you get so bored with all the meaningless fedex fetch quests where you never finish it.\n\nI loved the Gothic games back in the day, and now Risen is on my list of extremely satisfying games. I am now going to do another play doing the whole bandit quest line. The game is that good that I want to fully experience every twist and turn from all the different progression/character lines.\n\nThe fact that you have multiple ways to approach all the quests, and very diverging paths and consequences make it something rare to find in today's modern RPGs.\n\nThe graphics are still pretty good, even though this game is five years old. The game world is amazing, lots of gorgeous scenic views and natural locations. Ruins and cities are very nicely done, if a bit repetitive.\n\nIf you have patience and love to play a game where you learn and grow as you progress through it then I highly recommend it for true RPG fans.","July 21, 2014","true","32.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Luckily for my though I have an awesome brother that shared his game library with me so I would have games. Looking through his huge library I wanted to play a RPG, but lacking the graphics and processing power to play Skyrim I chose Risen over many better rated and more popular games. I went into Risen with a open mind and a mindset locked on the idea of going on an adventure as I go through a whole new world filled with foriegn beasties and skilled warriors. This game delivered many great hours of entertainment through an intresting and well designed world to explore, and intriguing plot characters. I felt immersed in this world with all it's beautiful landscape and lore, and I found myself playing it over and over wantig to get further. I haven't played Risen in a few months, but I am looking forward to picking it back up one day and continuing my escapade on this island of wonder and amazement. I highly recommend picking it up if you haven't played many RPGs and want to get into them. This game got my ball rolling to want to play more RPGs and I'm glad I was able to play it. Just as a post script I did buy the game even though I could play it for free from my brother's account because it had given me solid hours of play and was worth supporting the developers.","August 6, 2014","true","75.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Better controls and interface compared to 'Gothic', combat is more fluid and controllable. Story and quests are acceptable, immersion and atmosphere work rather well - there is a casual, ironic feel to it, mostly due to the sassy, sarcastic hero character (whom you don't necessarily have to agree or sympathize with, I know I didn't most of the time).\n\nJust like in 'Gothic', the pace is rather slow and the difficulty often demanding, you die easily and will have to reload a lot until you completely figure out how combat works and where not to go too soon (enemies do not scale to your character level).\n\nThat being said, you can mostly go anywhere at any time and choose the order in which to do things. I enjoyed this freedom and found the island an interesting place to explore, even later in the game.\n\nThink of 'Risen' as a top-notch B-Movie which fully recognizes its limitations and, instead of overreaching itself, chooses to excel in this role.\n\nI'm excited for 'Risen 2' and heartily recommend this one =)","February 23, 2015","true","66.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Need to master parrying, and side steps\n- Wild life likes to stun lock you and proceed to combo you to death so be cautious\n\nThe negatives don't break the game or made me want to stop playing but keep those in mind.\n\nOverall I  recommend to any RPG fan or someone looking for a nice adventure game where your choices matter.","May 10, 2015","true","92.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Probably one of my favourite RPGS I've played to date. It's very old, so the graphics and such aren't up to par with the newer games, but the storyline and the gameplay more than make up for that. I found the storyline enjoyable to play, and I liked progressing through the game in my own manner. Most things you can do in this game are very fun, and easy to get a hold of.\n\nComplaints include: There isn't any character customization at all, you're stuck with the same man as your character with the same look and same voice and there isn't much class customization either, you can use an axe, or a sword, or a bow, or go two-handed/dual wield. The mobs become considerably harder near the end of the game, as well, even with Titan-level weapons, and armor, the mobs prove to be very challenging, and annoying.\n\nOverall, this game has a fairly old school feel to it and has a lot of fun RPG elements involved, making it one of the most enjoyable RPGS I've played to date.

It took me a long time to really get sold on this game. The game play felt weird, and it never stopped teaching new mechanics, the ending bossfight is all new mechanics, for example. The writing was at times atrocious, but it succeeded where a lot of other games failed in getting me to care about some of the NPCs and what happens to them. The one thing that bothered me about it was that it felt the need to be a "mature" game meaning there were far to many references to sex, drugs, and rock and roll alcohol.

If you are a fan of the Pre-Gothic4 Gothic series I advise you to pick this game up. It's all that Gothic3 should have been on release; polished, fun and enormous.

The battle system is like the afore mentioned series, you never feel like you are a god, there are plenty of creatures that will kick your rear end for a long while until you get better skills, equipment.

Risen is unforgiving, there's very little hand holding so you'll actually have to play the game. To me that was the hook. I played for over 20 hours before I got any kind of armor. Money comes slow at first, speeds up as you go, but everything costs money.\n\nCombat is pretty damn good. You swing your weapon and get the feeling that it's heavy. If you block you may get knocked backwards if you parry you may get your wepon knocked aside leaving you vulnerable. The good news is with training you can  also perform these skills. Eventually you'll be pretty strong and able to handle just about anything, but enemies are dangerous always. It's entirely possible to be killed by the same enemy that killed you when you first started a new game.\n\nSave a lot, Risen isn't full of checkpoints every time you take a step. There are autosaves, but they're few and far between.\n\nLeveling up isn't particularly difficult, but you can't place skill points without going to a trainer and paying for them. I liked that too, you've even got to work a little to raise a skill. And choose wisely because even tho the crafting options can help you make up diferences, it's difficult to master skills while keeping a good balance.\n\nCrafting is cool, but pretty flawed. You can make weapons, but only swords, no axes, staves, hammers, or bows of any kind; these have to be found or purchased. You can make rings and amulets, but until you have all materials together you dont get to see what you can make. There are no crafting "plans" you just get options when you use a crating station, I.E. Forge, or goldsmith table. There are alchemy recipies and cooking recipies however.\n\nTravel is pretty basic, but be prepared to walk everywhere you want to go because there are no fast travel options. Later in the game you can get teleport stones to bring you closer to destinations, but until then you're hoofing it. I personally liked that, i like to explore in games like this.\n\nQuesting can feel fairly slow, but you get experience quickly and the rewards are usually worth it. Not to mention that the game is pretty linnear so you've got to do them anyway : )\n\nAs far as world environments go I liked the idea of a fantasy RPG being played on a tropical island. It was a pretty refreshing change from the typical forest and castle environment most of us are use to. Graphics are dated but in my opinion have held up really well. There's still volumetric lighting and shadows, the textures are great, and design itself looks good. If the polygon count were higher it would be on par with anything newer. Sounds are good, music is good, voice acting isn't amazing but it could be a lot worse. The dialogue seemed sort of jumbled from time to time, seemingly due to the dialogue choices the game gives you. Conversaions just seemed to occasionally be off subject.\n\nPlay value? Yep! I got almost 60 hours out of my single playthrough... Awseome. This is a big, big deal to me and one fact I love a whole lot. In a time when a "slow burn" is considered something like 10 hours it's excellent to get my money's worth out of a good title.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have is the very underwhelming boss fight at the end. And I mean really damn underwhelming. This however should not dissuade you from playing the game because pretty much everything else is solid and pretty fun.\n\nBuy it, play it, wonder why you waited so long.\n\n","November 6, 2013","true","57.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its one of those games that growns on you the more you play it, sure can be frustrating at start and quite demanding but you need to have alot of patience and be smart. Risen its an RPG that doesnt hold your hand meaning theres no arrows above your head pointing the goals of the quests, the quest map points you in a general direction and you have to explore for yourself, yes it will take time but its rewarding when you actually find something. As you play this for the first time my advice its to go Inquisition and arm yourself with a Shield and 1h Sword at all times, i know the appeal for a 2h Broadsword or a staff is huge but you will die alot more and learn fire magic asap. Learn the combat tricks like driving your oponent against a wall or use an nearby NPC.\n\nGraphics\n\nNot last gen but arent near as bad that you have to gouge out your eyes out with spoons in fact at times they can be quite pleasant.\n\nSound and Music\n\nMusic is great and adds to your imersition into the game while the sound is an hit&miss kind of deal where some NPCs dialoges are quite well writen and performed, others drop your IQ everytime they open their mouths but overall is good.\nIf you endured starpoint gemini 1 dialogues you can endure anything.\n\nGameplay\n\nNow heres the big elephant in the room and its the reason for most of the hate this game gets. The combat style in this game is NOT for everyone and requires a ton of practise, it's imperative that you have to learn and master your combat moves, spaming atacks will get you nothing but deaths and frustration. Block, roll will be your best friends aside from your shield and armor and get friends with your save&load buttons, you will use them alot. Use your head and tactics, fire an arrow or spell before meele atacks, use an NPC nearby for an extra sword, if the oponent kills you fast comeback later when youre stronger. Master all this and this game is quite rewarding.","June 28, 2015","true","47.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of the Pre-Gothic4 Gothic series I advise you to pick this game up. It's all that Gothic3 should have been on release; polished, fun and enormous.

This one may look a little low-res to modern players but the story pulls you in and the combat is very nearly "good", and best of all there is no mention of "voodoo pirates".  Has its faults, perhaps more than average, but compared to the later editions seems very nearly perfect.  Some minor choices are offered but these do not alter the overal game outcome in any way whatsoever.  Best played before the later versions, as often it's hard to come back to an earlier stage where the graphics aren't so good.  Dialogue is all over the place, as you'd expect when it isn't recorded sequentially, but in character sessions.  Has good replay value, which is always the mark of a better-than-average game.\n\nOne gripe: there are no "achievements" to be had, despite this being stipulated in some of the hype blurb.  Not that these are any real loss -- in the other two games, these are simply things you'd achieve while playing the game anyway, so they're valueless.  Perhaps these will come later?  Oh, and it doesn't cloud save either, so if you need to switch between pcs, or a hi-spec laptop, to play, you'll have to pop the savegame folder onto a flashdrive and transfer manually.

Casual gamers will likely die every 30 minutes. Also note it is quite very possible, particulary against certain creatures, that a low level creature will kill a high level player. This game requires a degree of strategy. This is not the kind of rpg where you can just order your attacks to happen 3 moves away from now. Combat is brutal! But, despite all I have said, for those who are willing, this game delivers a rewarding experience. Also, very important to note, at least through out my playthrough, the "jump to ledge" worked very little. I would be forced to press ctrl+alt+delete and bring up task manager and start up the game again. As frustrating as this is there is away around it (however, depending which of the 3 career paths you go down it can get quite expensive). Despite the very difficult combat and the jumping up to ledge issue, I did enjoy the game\nBtw, the 60 hours was just for 1 play through","September 30, 2015","true","60.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it works very well with the feel of the game.\n\nDan\nBsc Games Design\n","September 24, 2015","true","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From rags to riches, you start hitting overfed mosquitos with a stick, advance yourself through ranks as a trustee of 2 different factions( one in two denominations ) to find yourself hitting more fantasy lore revered monsters with a stick that has a pointy metal edge on top.\nYou get to traverse the maze of unmarked investigations, one thing already dead within the real of video game convenience as well speech checks, that if taken too far can land you with floor sweeping job, or without your head. Ah the possibilities.\n\nThe cons :\n\nThe game however, can be a bit too formulaic in gatekeeping certain content, directly tied in your equipment upgrades through main mission. The crafting is pretty basic and the advantages of advancing certain skill paths pretty unclear, especially that you will find yourself short on training points and gold most of game. Even if alot of quests leave you to your own devices in figuring out the solution, often they aren't as intuitive as they could. Resorting to a guide, if not often, isn't anything unusual when it comes to Risen. I mean, there are a lot of games to play.\n\nOverall if you know and enjoy games like Gothic 1 and 2, this game will click with you. If you like map markers and a combat where your character sommersaults from opponent to opponent with minimal effort on your side, it won't be a worthy purchase. If you like Witcher games, this might be a 50/50 roll.","October 18, 2015","true","43.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I then played through it out of obligation. The game has no balance. On the standard normal mode combat is next to impossible and you will find yourself saving after every battle just so you don't have to redo it WHEN you die. Difficult combat would not be a bad thing, except its the driving force behind the game, almost everyquest has some sort of combat in it. I could continue to rant on the broken combat system talking about how counters require inhuman timing or how every enemy is able to attack faster then you, or how controls don't respond and you find yourself stuck in a six attack combo when you wanted to block, but I feel like you get the point.\nOther aspects of the game such as the map and quest log are there but simple don't work 100% of the time (I've gotten them to work maybe twice).\nFear not there are some positives. First the game doesn't not look like complete garbage, no character customization, but the overall look of the game is moderatley appealing. Remember how I mentioned saving after every battle, well you can save anywhere, anytime (Even in the middle of a really annoying boss fight). The story is fairly intersting and about the only thing that has kept my interest in the game. For those who want a mental challenge many quests have a puzzle aspect to them.\n\nOverall the game would be fine if it didn't rely so heavily on a broken combat system.\n\nSide note: There is an entire main quest dedicated to becoming a pot dealer (best drug dealing simulator NA)","October 18, 2015","false","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would be nice if the quests weren't vague as hell and if the map actually showed you the region where you need to go so I'm not wandering in the swamp getting killed every time I turn around by a creature that can one-shot me. That's another thing. It would be nice if I you found armor or were given armor, or could buy armor. This way I wouldn't get killed by everything.

The Enviroment is well crafted and meticulous.\n5. Great Leveling system with brilliant idea of having the player ear learning points that they can use for training\n6. The crafting is rewarding after working hard to receive the materials and the schematics\n7. Quests are clever and exciting\n9. The dialogue is well worded, thee are plenty of options, and the voice acting is tremendous\n10. AI is generally good.\n11. The Atmosphere feels just right for a medieval tropical setting\n12. The enemies look awesome and killing "gnoos" (gnomes) is both fun and funny\n13. There is plenty of content if you look for it\nCons:\n\n1. The visuals appear somewhat dated (similar to Oblivion)\n2. The map is a bit on the small side\n3. The animations for the characters' faces do not line up with what they are saying most of the time\n4. Not as many choices as there could have been\n5.

DO NOT CLIMB ON OBJECTS WHILE INSIDE\n\nOverall the game is all that an RPG should be and more. It's an incredibly entertaining and rewarding game with great gameplay and combat mechanics. You will find that if you are a completionist, there is plenty of content. Play it twice (once a thief and once a member of The Order) if you want to expirience all that Risen has to offer. It is definitely worth purchasing if you are a fan of RPGs.\n\nHonestly, a 10/10","January 9","true","91.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Risen is unforgiving, there's very little hand holding so you'll actually have to play the game. To me that was the hook. I played for over 20 hours before I got any kind of armor. Money comes slow at first, speeds up as you go, but everything costs money.\n\nCombat is pretty damn good. You swing your weapon and get the feeling that it's heavy. If you block you may get knocked backwards if you parry you may get your wepon knocked aside leaving you vulnerable. The good news is with training you can  also perform these skills. Eventually you'll be pretty strong and able to handle just about anything, but enemies are dangerous always. It's entirely possible to be killed by the same enemy that killed you when you first started a new game.\n\nSave a lot, Risen isn't full of checkpoints every time you take a step. There are autosaves, but they're few and far between.\n\nLeveling up isn't particularly difficult, but you can't place skill points without going to a trainer and paying for them. I liked that too, you've even got to work a little to raise a skill. And choose wisely because even tho the crafting options can help you make up diferences, it's difficult to master skills while keeping a good balance.\n\nCrafting is cool, but pretty flawed. You can make weapons, but only swords, no axes, staves, hammers, or bows of any kind; these have to be found or purchased. You can make rings and amulets, but until you have all materials together you dont get to see what you can make. There are no crafting "plans" you just get options when you use a crating station, I.E. Forge, or goldsmith table. There are alchemy recipies and cooking recipies however.\n\nTravel is pretty basic, but be prepared to walk everywhere you want to go because there are no fast travel options. Later in the game you can get teleport stones to bring you closer to destinations, but until then you're hoofing it. I personally liked that, i like to explore in games like this.\n\nQuesting can feel fairly slow, but you get experience quickly and the rewards are usually worth it. Not to mention that the game is pretty linnear so you've got to do them anyway : )\n\nAs far as world environments go I liked the idea of a fantasy RPG being played on a tropical island. It was a pretty refreshing change from the typical forest and castle environment most of us are use to. Graphics are dated but in my opinion have held up really well. There's still volumetric lighting and shadows, the textures are great, and design itself looks good. If the polygon count were higher it would be on par with anything newer. Sounds are good, music is good, voice acting isn't amazing but it could be a lot worse. The dialogue seemed sort of jumbled from time to time, seemingly due to the dialogue choices the game gives you. Conversaions just seemed to occasionally be off subject.\n\nPlay value? Yep! I got almost 60 hours out of my single playthrough... Awseome. This is a big, big deal to me and one fact I love a whole lot. In a time when a "slow burn" is considered something like 10 hours it's excellent to get my money's worth out of a good title.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have is the very underwhelming boss fight at the end. And I mean really damn underwhelming. This however should not dissuade you from playing the game because pretty much everything else is solid and pretty fun.\n\nBuy it, play it, wonder why you waited so long.\n\n","November 6, 2013","true","57.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both Enemies and resources/consumables are finite meaning that there is no ''absurd grinding just to take one big baddie'', but at the same time the difficulty of the quests and monster placements have a nice curve to them so that you will most likely clear them in roughly the same order anyway. It's just that knowing that there's a natural end in sight aka: ''there's nothing left to kill'' makes the experience feel like your presence matters more in the world.\n\n2. While the first point isn't all that unique having that in a Open-World does give it more of a niche that other bigger titles like the TES's don't have.\n\n3. Item placements ( such as in chests or just laying around ) are static so after finishing it once ( or looking it up ) you can get a rough idea of where this and that weapon/consumables are, but while other may see this as ''lacking in replay value'' I see it as ''Nice gonna try to beat that tougher opponent to get a head-start next time'' since this again plays with the good difficulty they have. Also a lot of the good weapons have a pretty high stat requirement so you can't just go straight to one of the top weapons in game and use it immediately.\n\nAnd now some cons:\n\n1. The story tries to follow from the ending of Gothic 3 ( the neutral ending btw ) but at the same time try to be a new ''Original IP'' since they didn't have the license anymore after the 3rd game which might make fans of the Gothic games feel a uncanny valley effect throughout this game.\n\n2. The story itself is also IMO kinda lackluster, which is a shame but then again the preceding games mentioned above while having IMO a few better characters were sorta the same in overall quality so if you're searching for deep and engaging characters/story then you might want to look elsewhere. ( Although while not deep this and it's predecessors do have probably the most down-to-earth or normalish feeling cast ever IMHO)","October 15, 2015","true","42.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From rags to riches, you start hitting overfed mosquitos with a stick, advance yourself through ranks as a trustee of 2 different factions( one in two denominations ) to find yourself hitting more fantasy lore revered monsters with a stick that has a pointy metal edge on top.\nYou get to traverse the maze of unmarked investigations, one thing already dead within the real of video game convenience as well speech checks, that if taken too far can land you with floor sweeping job, or without your head. Ah the possibilities.\n\nThe cons :\n\nThe game however, can be a bit too formulaic in gatekeeping certain content, directly tied in your equipment upgrades through main mission. The crafting is pretty basic and the advantages of advancing certain skill paths pretty unclear, especially that you will find yourself short on training points and gold most of game. Even if alot of quests leave you to your own devices in figuring out the solution, often they aren't as intuitive as they could. Resorting to a guide, if not often, isn't anything unusual when it comes to Risen. I mean, there are a lot of games to play.\n\nOverall if you know and enjoy games like Gothic 1 and 2, this game will click with you. If you like map markers and a combat where your character sommersaults from opponent to opponent with minimal effort on your side, it won't be a worthy purchase. If you like Witcher games, this might be a 50/50 roll.","October 18, 2015","true","43.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, now that I'm actually into the game I'm finding that I'm seriously regretting this decision. It would be nice if the quests weren't vague as hell and if the map actually showed you the region where you need to go so I'm not wandering in the swamp getting killed every time I turn around by a creature that can one-shot me. That's another thing. It would be nice if I you found armor or were given armor, or could buy armor. This way I wouldn't get killed by everything. This is important since every starting quest you get involved having to beat up armored bandits to get them to do their jobs and/or wandering into the monster infested swamp.

I then played through it out of obligation. The game has no balance. On the standard normal mode combat is next to impossible and you will find yourself saving after every battle just so you don't have to redo it WHEN you die. Difficult combat would not be a bad thing, except its the driving force behind the game, almost everyquest has some sort of combat in it. I could continue to rant on the broken combat system talking about how counters require inhuman timing or how every enemy is able to attack faster then you, or how controls don't respond and you find yourself stuck in a six attack combo when you wanted to block, but I feel like you get the point.\nOther aspects of the game such as the map and quest log are there but simple don't work 100% of the time (I've gotten them to work maybe twice).\nFear not there are some positives. First the game doesn't not look like complete garbage, no character customization, but the overall look of the game is moderatley appealing. Remember how I mentioned saving after every battle, well you can save anywhere, anytime (Even in the middle of a really annoying boss fight). The story is fairly intersting and about the only thing that has kept my interest in the game. For those who want a mental challenge many quests have a puzzle aspect to them.\n\nOverall the game would be fine if it didn't rely so heavily on a broken combat system.\n\nSide note: There is an entire main quest dedicated to becoming a pot dealer (best drug dealing simulator NA)","October 18, 2015","false","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difficulty curve is fairly tough at the beginning as the world doesn't scale much. So you struggle at the beginning but it gets easier as your character gets stronger (be prepared to save and load a LOT).  It is fun though, and has interesting plot. Although you can build your character however you like "to a degree," plot directly prevents you from doing some skill combinations. (For example, some skills can only be taught by some people who are enemies of other people who teach other skills). As a result, sides you choose will significantly impact your play style. (Some things you can work around a bit, others not so much). As such, the world, although fairly open, feels like a world with it's own limitations... not arbitrary limitations, but the world feels solid.

But there really isnt much to explore. My game time shows 42.9 hrs. But when I sat down to actually play the game and complete all the quests, it only took me 25 hrs. Which is less then half of the time advertised on the "About the game" description below, which boasts over 60 hours. I highly doubt it would take that long to walk every inch of the island.\n\nThe combat is probably one of, if not the most, unwieldly, buggy, dissapointing systems I've ever encountered. It's hard to get used to. Timing seems everything, tossing the skill of the player aside. Stats seem to speed up the characters actions and damage and not chance to hit which I am thankful for. It wasnt difficult, it was just, annoying.\n\nThe best part for me was the storyline, and the side stories/quests. That's not to say they were all well written, it was just the best part of the game for me. Theres a side quest ****SPOILERS**** where to have to save a man from nightmares from a certain ring he found. The back story for the rings is awefully close to Lord of the Rings. Just felt generic and out of place for a game that has alot of lore.\n\nJust a few items above that irked me one way or another. Now time for the ratings.\n\nGraphics : 6/10 - Not great, but not bad. I would go 7 but some of the textures look like they just moved Gothic 3 to an island and said this is Risen.\n\nGameplay : 3/10 - Again, some of the worse controlls for combat ive ever seen. Plus, no way to increase your characters running speed except by scroll. And teleportation only comes about mid way through the game, so travel is slow and tedious. I also dont like using the left mouse button to do everyhting.\n\nStory : 7/10 - Not bad here. I enjoyed following the history of the island and some of it's inhabitants. The tie in to the Gothic seiries was a nice touch.\n\nContent : 5/10 - Im about even here. What there is to see is great, but the lack of content is disturbing. Also I should note, the only crafting in game thats worth having is Alchemy and Scroll Making. Nothing else is useful to warrent spending points in. Also, I had a hard time leveling. Even with completeing all the quests and the monsters I killed, I only reached level 24. Why? Cause monsters dont respawn. And after all the quests are done, what else can you do to raise your level?\n\nReplayability : 0/10 - Once youve beaten it, no reason to replay. the story does have a few alternate choices you can make, but the last few chapters are always the same.\n\nOverall Score : 3.5/10 - It's one of those games that probably deserve to be played, but players deserve to be given a better game to play. Again, it's not bad...it just isnt good. Im not sorry I bought it, but Im certianly not happy about it either.\n\nReccomend to buy if on sale.\n\n","September 27, 2015","true","46.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, very important to note, at least through out my playthrough, the "jump to ledge" worked very little. I would be forced to press ctrl+alt+delete and bring up task manager and start up the game again.

Best advice I can give is SAVE A LOT. Also, jumping is a nightmare in this game.\n\nBut damn, it's addicting! The combat system is very challenging and actually requires some skill, it's not just "click till it dies". The leveling system is pretty original too. You only raise your skills if you find some trainer after leveling up. Having played as a bandit, I'm not sure how well magic works in the game. The in-game world isn't so terribly big (compared to beasts like Skyrim), but it's still a vast open world with a decent number of side-quests to keep you busy. It aged very well for a 5-year-old RPG. Way better than the polished up sequel too.","June 26, 2014","true","40.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not very long and pretty varied in its gameplay. The story isn't particulary bright, but at least it exists. What shines is the wonderful island where the game takes place. It's not huge, but it's packed with things to do and mostly interesting characters.\nThe combat system may be frustrating at first, but becomes far more interesting as the game progresses. It's a bit repetitive, but you need to stay focused which helps break the feeling of doing always the same thing.\n\nAt the beginning of the game (first chapter on four), you mostly avoid enemies, rather focusing on dialogs and quests. I absolutely love this part though many players will be longing for some action.\nDuring the second chapter, you really go around exploring every nook and cranny of the island. This may be the part I like the least because of the large number of savage animals you need to wipe out. It's a bit tedious sometimes. Then again, you're not required to completely clean the island. But I'm a bit of a completionist.\nChapters 3 and 4 are shorter and will let you explore bigger caves and dungeons. I also really liked this part though it feels like a completely different game than the first chapter. Ennemies are tough but less numerous. There are lots of traps and exploration and light puzzles to keep you occupied. I was afraid it would be more Diablo-like, but no. It's still a RPG.","December 27, 2015","true","46.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I recently bought it on Steam again just to give credit for its excellent producers. It really strikes me as how well it is designed and presented. The background music is absolutely great and story of the game is unpickable. Although the game is a small-scalled as compared to Skyrim and such, it is nonetheless as complicated as the big titles out there. What really stands out is the combact system. When you learn a skillpoint, you actually learn a new move, like parrying with your broadsord or staff instead of getting a damage boost. And it feels great to duel with melee weapons unlike some games where you fell like hit a sponge or something. This game is somewhat difficult to grasp at first.

I know from the reviews posted here that the game is 'very positive' but I just don't know how that is but fair enough.\n\nThe story just does not grab me, npcs are lifeless and the combat is not my cup of tea - one of those is bad enough but all three; that is a game killer.  I need an emotional connection in a game, save rts games, I need to feel something for the story, the characters because if not why bother? Graphics, which this game does a good job of, is all well and good but without the aforementioned it lacks a soul in my opinion.  That all said I can't really complain too much as I got this game as part of a bundle, which included Metro 2033, for only £5 so I wasn't robbed.  My only advise if you wish to get this game is to do so during a sale.","January 26","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravybrainz/recommended/40300/","gravybrainz","gravybrainz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gravybrainz/","19 products in account","I have been out on my gaming for awhile; I use to play a lot of games then felt burnt out and overall just bored with video games in general. Its been around a year of me not playing games besides the brief occasions of dabbling for a few hours for the nostalgia. I recently had an urge to get into a fun rpg, something open world that had a survival feel to it. though I was very limited on games I could get, because I sold all my consoles, and all I have is a 4 year old 300 dollar HP pavillion laptop. So with hours spend looking up reviews then checking if my laptop could run them I decided on risen. I AM SOOO GLADD I DID!!! My choices were down to gothic 3, two worlds 2 and risen. Which all of them have mixed reviews so it was hard to decide. So HERES MY REVIEW.  GRAPHICS - To me graphics really don't matter much if the game is really fun and this is the case here. keep in mind I play on all low for better performance but even at that I think the world is beautifully done. The weather and the lighting are awesome. When the sun is shining its really bright and actually looks like how bright it would be in real life. When its dark its as dark as it really would be in real life. its soo awesome looking when its dark out, your exploring, its storming and lightening and you get flashes of bright light where you see everything, it really looks badass. (now on high settings the graphics are really nice for its time.) so torches are actually a must if your going in really dark caves or traveling at the dark of night or you can wait to journey and sleep in a bed till morning.  I think it really immerses you in the world. GAMEPLAY- Now what I really really like about this game is the overall small details that a lot of games overlook, that really make the world feel alive IMO. For a RPG I think these details im about to explain are really important to a RPG because theirs people who play and really wanna get into the role of there character and the world hence ROLE playing game. First I'll start off with getting food and cooking it. in this game food really does matter idk how many times i was out exploring and if i didnt have food to boost my health I would of died. and you can find water barrels to drink from that will boost your health when your in need like being out of potions or only having a few. I like how when you cook food you see your character really cook the food, and when you drink you see your character really drink or when you eat whatever your eating he will actually take it out and eat it. when you kill someone in the game no matter who it is they will stay dead for the whole game, IT MAKES SENSE. when you go into someones home they will get mad and threaten you, it makes sense. when you want to up your stats in lets say pickpocking or swords you have to find someone who specializes in that art and pay them to train you, again it makes sense. The map isnt that big compared to like gta or skyrim but I think its pretty much perfect because there is a lot of content packed into it and it feels actually pretty damn big because you only run as fast as you do in like fallout 3 and new vegas. Plus in the beginning there is a lot of unknown places you cant explore because there are monsters their that are just to hard to kill untill you get stronger and better gear. So it gives you something to work for on the side. youll find a cave and get halfway through it then find there to be a monster that is just to strong, so you take note, leave, build up, gear up, get stronger, and go back later. The game has so much dialog and you can basically talk to anyone, your character actually speaks what you pick and he is such a smartass 98% of the time I love it. The story is not that special but I think its cool! its kind of like star wars with no force, instead magic, and theres the iquisition(which is like the empire) and then the bandits/dons men (which is like the rebels) your fighting for control of the island basically, you have the choice to choose what side you want to support. Now a lot of people dont like the combat and a lot love it, I love it even though it is basically 2 buttons, block and attack, what makes it really fun is you have to be really good with timing, its kind of like a timing mini game. if you attack at the wrong time you leave yourself open to get hit. Blocking is really important and swinging at the perfect time is also important, cause this game is really hard and if you dont play smart you will die tons. If you like games that hold your hand this isnt for you. But if you like games that really give you a challenge then it is for you. #noquestarrows. theres a lot more I can say about this game but it would go on too long. This game has became one of my all time favorite open world RPGs. It is underrated. Overall I give this game a hardcore 9.5/10","January 11","true","43.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my first review.\n\nPros:\n1. The Storyline is interesting\n2. Many Characters are fun and you end up caring for them\n3, The Combat is brilliant\n4. The Enviroment is well crafted and meticulous.\n5. Great Leveling system with brilliant idea of having the player ear learning points that they can use for training\n6. The crafting is rewarding after working hard to receive the materials and the schematics\n7. Quests are clever and exciting\n9. The dialogue is well worded, thee are plenty of options, and the voice acting is tremendous\n10. AI is generally good.\n11. The Atmosphere feels just right for a medieval tropical setting\n12. The enemies look awesome and killing "gnoos" (gnomes) is both fun and funny\n13. There is plenty of content if you look for it\nCons:\n\n1. The visuals appear somewhat dated (similar to Oblivion)\n2. The map is a bit on the small side\n3. The animations for the characters' faces do not line up with what they are saying most of the time\n4. Not as many choices as there could have been\n5. I personally believe that the game discourages exploration.\n6. For some people a con would be that the enemies don't respawn until some major event takes place.\n7. Vey buggy. DO NOT CLIMB ON OBJECTS WHILE INSIDE\n\nOverall the game is all that an RPG should be and more. It's an incredibly entertaining and rewarding game with great gameplay and combat mechanics. You will find that if you are a completionist, there is plenty of content. Play it twice (once a thief and once a member of The Order) if you want to expirience all that Risen has to offer. It is definitely worth purchasing if you are a fan of RPGs.\n\nHonestly, a 10/10","January 9","true","91.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its one of those games that growns on you the more you play it, sure can be frustrating at start and quite demanding but you need to have alot of patience and be smart. Risen its an RPG that doesnt hold your hand meaning theres no arrows above your head pointing the goals of the quests, the quest map points you in a general direction and you have to explore for yourself, yes it will take time but its rewarding when you actually find something. As you play this for the first time my advice its to go Inquisition and arm yourself with a Shield and 1h Sword at all times, i know the appeal for a 2h Broadsword or a staff is huge but you will die alot more and learn fire magic asap. Learn the combat tricks like driving your oponent against a wall or use an nearby NPC.\n\nGraphics\n\nNot last gen but arent near as bad that you have to gouge out your eyes out with spoons in fact at times they can be quite pleasant.\n\nSound and Music\n\nMusic is great and adds to your imersition into the game while the sound is an hit&miss kind of deal where some NPCs dialoges are quite well writen and performed, others drop your IQ everytime they open their mouths but overall is good.\nIf you endured starpoint gemini 1 dialogues you can endure anything.\n\nGameplay\n\nNow heres the big elephant in the room and its the reason for most of the hate this game gets. The combat style in this game is NOT for everyone and requires a ton of practise, it's imperative that you have to learn and master your combat moves, spaming atacks will get you nothing but deaths and frustration. Block, roll will be your best friends aside from your shield and armor and get friends with your save&load buttons, you will use them alot. Use your head and tactics, fire an arrow or spell before meele atacks, use an NPC nearby for an extra sword, if the oponent kills you fast comeback later when youre stronger. Master all this and this game is quite rewarding.","June 28, 2015","true","47.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the start of the game anything can kill you in a few hits, your blows are weak and the weapon you have is weak. But then, depending on the path you choose, you can learn magic, improve your abilities and forge your own weapons and trinkets.\nThe story is not bad, the graphics are ok (REMEMBER TO ENABLE V-SYNC THROUGH NVIDIA CONTROL PANEL or in the amd one) and the variety in the environments is ok too.\nSo, is it worth playing? Hell yea, and when you are done you can could start again and choose a different path, basically changing the story entirely. I completed the game in around 40 hours the first run, now I will start the second playthrough as a Don lackey.\nhave fun!","June 30, 2015","true","41.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat and animations are terrible and the map is boring to explore, which may be because the world feels like a few linear branching paths and the movement is clunky. The worst animation though is the jumping. The space bar basically makes your caracter bend his legs and glide for 2 seconds. Loading takes 30 seconds off my ssd, ehich for a game this old makes no sense. I want to say something good about the game butI can't, though maybe that's because I have not gotten that far into it. I have leveled up three times but can't seem to distribute any points. In fact I have no idea what leveling up does. Maybe I need to be far enough into the game to get a class. All I have been able to do is find trainers which will improve stats and skills for gold.\nKeep in mind I have played a good bit of morrowind so I know how to extract value from a game despite the combat controls. I have found this game to be nothing beyond functional.","July 17, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
