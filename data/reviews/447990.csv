You don't need flashy colors, or pretty music to make a quality puzzle game. You just need a unique idea, and unique mechanics.\n\nI remember the days when people were playing preinstalled puzzle games like Minesweeper on their computers. Sure, it was simple, and looking back now it actually seems kind of boring, but at the time we had a lot of fun doing it! We were always trying to beat each others scores and engaging in a mostly healthy rivalry over it.\n\nSpectrubes is no different. The game doesn't really teach you how to play (aside from basic instructions), but you're expected to figure it out the mechanics for yourself. It counts how many moves you make, and I believe it spans roughly 100 levels. The difficulty curve is a little high, but this makes for unique and challenging gameplay! This isn't the greatest puzzle game I've ever played as it does get a little boring with time, nor is it a game for everybody. However, its unique mechanics and minimalist style give the game a certain allurement that both 80's kids and/or puzzle enthusiasts can appreciate!","March 25","true","7.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","1"

What is this game? Retro-mini-blocks maze. Two brother or sister blocks opposite sides of maze- "eye"-icon blocks. Some little compu-baby circa 1981 would call "cute." You look to the LEFT... move towards the apoca-portal; BUT wait, you need to look to the right, nudge up to the wall, move the other blockhead towards the other portal.. look LEFT. Nudge up to the wall, move that lil sister in place. If you go cross-eyed you lose. Use both eyes, one side of the brain. Take a sip out of the glass of cyan-blue, then take a gulp out the cyan-purple.\n\nClever little puzzle game. I added the game to my library a few weeks ago. Popped it on a few times. I'm on level 6. Might take me the rest of the year to finish all? (Not sure how many levels). In any case, I will have gotten my moneys worth, and quite possibility in this same time frame the dev might pop on the Steam version at least another latter complex level or two? Periodic extra levels would be desired and this game is certainly set up for such potential and more interesting "eye"-deas.\n\nIf you seek or want some retro C64/easy simple puzzler goodness, a cut above in wonderful simplicity, I recommend.\n\nGood game!","April 20","true","0.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
