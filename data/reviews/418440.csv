Enter for inventory / objectives, arrows for everything else.\nInventory is automated, if you have what you need, you'll do what you have to without even having to look at it.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good IMO (I love that kind of colourful pixel art).\nThe music is generally OK.\n\n\nIt's pretty cheap. So if you're looking for a nice short puzzle game, just buy it.","November 20, 2015","true","1.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

It's a short game, but I wouldn't consider that to be a bad thing since it's very well put together. The pixel art is gorgeous, and the music is excellent giving this little adorable island the perfect atmosphere. It is not at all a frustrating game either, just pure relaxing fun!\n\nI really hope they release the soundtrack as either a stand-alone album somewhere or here on Steam as a bundle or a separate 'DLC' so-to-speak.\n\nIf you have any interest in adventure/puzzle games, or just time travel stories in general, then I highly recommend this one! I am so looking forward to what the developer does next!","December 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The artwork and character designs are very nice and the animations are well done. The characters you'll be interacting with and learning about are charming and their dialogue is littered with wit and humour. It's an heartwarming tale and kept me fully engaged.\n\nMy complaints are only very minor. The title screen has a button to adjust the size of the game window and I had to fool with this multiple times each time I started the game to get it to be full screen. Tick Tock Isle is controlled using solely the arrow keys and it would have been nice to remind controls or be able to use the mouse. Lastly, the platforming sections were quite dull and I did not feel they added much to the game.\n\nAs I said, these are very minor complaints in an otherwise heartwarming and thoroughly enjoyable game that is well worth your time.","December 18, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has charming music, characters and graphics. I personally really love the colors in this game, it gives it the right touch of bright and bouncy. The music is also amazing, I love every single track, and if the OST was for sale I'd buy it in a heartbeat.\n\nI have conflicting feelings on the game's length, clocking in shameless clock joke at an hour and a half. The length fits this game well, you're able to absorb the the quirk and fun without being tired of the game. But I wish there was more. I want to know more about this world and about these characters. There are a lot of questions I have about what happened pregame. I'm also just a sucker for world building... Though these unanswered questions don't take away from the game at all.\n\nThis game is built on multiple play throughs, as there are many sidequests and items you can find to help you along your very short, very silly adventure, so if you enjoy a game you can play more then once then this game is probably up your ally.\n\nfor $2.99 you're getting way more then your money's worth\n\n9/10 Would take up arms against the Squid King again.","November 30, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's your job to help solve the problems of a family living on the island by doing a variety of tasks in the past to effect the future, and then taking things from the future to the past. It's actually quite addictive and intriguing to see what happens next.\n\n- Very confusing at what you are supposed to. Without a guide you will likely become frusterated, and I could not find one so I eventually got stuck... :,(\n- There's an inventory screen however it doesn't really tell you what you are supposed to do with the items you collect, or what they are for.

But, it's a small aspect)\n\n*Fixed window mode\n(It's better to play in window mode since all the graphics are sharper and nothing is cut off at the edges. But, when attempting full-screen by pressing Alt+Enter, the graphics were a bit blurry and at least the main menu was out of focus)\n\n*Continuity itch\n(It's a sweet, short, standalone game. But, there are a few aspects left unexplained, and it's such an enjoyable setting that I'd be very open to playing future entries if the developers decide to turn it into a series. Some may feel that 'continuity itch' in the end.)\n\n~.~.~.~.~.~.\n\nI really enjoyed the colorful pixel art (Unlike some other indie games, the colors aren't too bright or loud, they're very even), the relaxing soundtrack (flutes in an island setting, along with telltale tick-tock sounds are very fitting), and the endearing characters - each with their own personality and brief backstory - that change over time the more you interact with them in the hopes of improving their futures.\n\nIn a way, I guess it could be compared to classic adventure games like Monkey Island meets Back To The Future, it was a delightful and fun experience!\n\nI'm actually a little saddened that it wasn't a little longer, because I wanted to keep exploring and know more about the characters - especially Strike, our time traveler, I'd like to know more about him and his world.\n\nOverall, it's a charming game and it's priced at an incredible bargain, it's a win-win!","November 28, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I remember playing a prototype of it years ago back on the TIG Source forums. Props to the developer for sticking with it!\n\nSide-scrolling inventory adventure games have become a lot bigger lately (The Cat Lady, Case & Clownbot), and this brings a nice, clean art style and streamlined interface to the table. A lot of the interface is kept behind the curtain leaving you to simply pick items up and talk to people to solve various quests, as well as leaping back and forth through time.\n\nIt's really short, about an hour in length, but you're not paying $60, alright?? It's nice when a game ends right before its concept starts to wear thin, and Tick Tock Isle pulls it off.","December 24, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I highly recommend it if you enjoy pixel art, which the game tackles beautifully, and simple puzzles. The music, while not particularly memorable, is also handled very well; I played this game on a lazy Saturday afternoon and it was so incredibly relaxing to explore the clock tower, sipping coffee and listening to the calming melodies.\n\nThe game is, of course, very short, so this game may not be the best for those who would rather sink their teeth into meaty adventures. Mileage will vary slightly, but if you plow through everything at once, Tick Tock Isle will more than likely take you around an hour to complete. Despite the short play time, though, the characters leave an impression. They're all facing problems that are in many way familiar, yet these problems are expressed and/or solved in unique ways. The family musician, Melody is uninspired; Rod and his wife clash over his laziness; Rivet and Brazo, two other residents, lament their lack of skill in certain areas. Solving their problems are satisfying and the conclusion of the game, if somewhat abrupt, feels earned.\n\nSome other quick notes:\n\n1) It was lovely to see small references to other time travel-based stories in the game; I'll leave the matter of what's actually referenced a surprise, though.\n\n2) There's at least one secret/easter egg that I managed to catch on my game, which added an interesting little tidbit to the backstory (keep an eye out, near the very end of the game, of an area to use the cheese). And based on one item I ended up not using, I think that there could be at least one more. Just something of interest to mention for the completionists out there.","February 6","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was surprised to find that it was actually quite enjoyable.\n\nTick Tock Isle has interesting characters and a very charming aesthetic. It has so many hidden references to pop culture and literature, I remained interested in the setting throughout. Unlike many games like in the same sort of genre, TTI doesn't try to draw itself out with bad controls, repetition, a slow moving main character or non-interactive cutscenes. It just delivers a series of interesting events and challenges, held together by a story that wraps up before anything gets boring.\n\nIt's the perfect game for a Sunday afternoon - cheap, fun, not at all frustrating, and a good length.","February 13","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
