The game was removed from Steam and that weird item remained in my wishlist unable to be purchased. So as time went by I started to feel very curious about it. I immediately bought it when I heard it was available again. And turns out it's not very good haha. Actually, it's not a bad game either. What I like about it is its visuals, music and humor and this unusual context for stealth. It presents itself nicely. But some things in it displeased me. So read on and see if they can potentially bother you as well.\n\nThe control scheme. I played with mouse and keyboard, then switched to gamepad, then switched back to mouse and keyboard. Neither works well. The gamepad gives my left hand one hell of a workout, with movement and items all on my left thumb, while my right hand every now and then pans the camera around. The mouse and keyboard makes you move by clicking instead of using arrow keys or wasd. It does not accept click on solid objects, making it difficult to move close to walls, a very important stealthy thing in stealth games. To use item you press number keys, which is not awful but since we are using movement with mouse, why not let me use the right mouse button with scroll wheel to select item? Or, better yet, movement on the keyboard and camera and items on the mouse. The camera pan isn't smooth in either control schemes, it seems to influence my movements somewhat. Like I can't move down if I'm looking up, for example.\n\nThen there's the field of view. Considering the player and AI speeds, the field of view is way too narrow, with coworkers popping up on screen and spotting you instantly. This seems intentional as we do have control over camera pan. I can see that working to create tension, but not with that terrible control scheme.\n\nIt's also a repetition kind of game. Think of super meat boy but in a stealth gameplay. AI patterns are simple but they move fast, turn instantly and spot you instantly too. I'm NOT counting this as a problem of the game, because I do enjoy that kind of gameplay. I mean, I would prefer a more traditional stealth game that rewards planning and patience rather than trial and error. But the game has no obligation to fulfill random expectations of mine, it didn't want to be a traditional stealth game, it wants to be a trial and error game. BUT if you don't like trial and error games you will not like this one.\n\nSo to me it's all about the input method. These problems don't look difficult to fix at all to me and I can tell there's a pretty cool game underneath that. But I can't in good consciousness recommend  a game I can't play for a full hour.","February 19","false","0.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","2"

After 2 months of not responding to original supporters asking if we can get this patched but same game they had a change of heart and started communicating. On April 1st they granted all original owners this patched version. This is a great game.\n\nI was thinking “Level 22: Gary's Misadventure” was a sequel or expansion to “LEVEL 22” in my library, which I already own and enjoy. Sadly, I was quickly disappointed to find this is exactly the same game. I played through several levels and they are literally identical! The controls are tweaked a little and achievements added (just tacked on, they award after you close the game) but the gameplay, intro, level layout, and dialogue are all exactly the same. Original supports of the game were not given the update or new version. Why not just patch the original game or give the original supporters this version as well?\n\nCompare my "new" version screenshots:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023555368/screenshots/?appid=431290\n\nto my "original" version screenshots:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023555368/screenshots/?appid=293300\n\nLook at the original game “LEVEL 22, Gary's Misadventures” on Steam greenlight:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=191138179\nnotice that it says the game is out now but when you click to see it you'll get the steam homepage since the original no longer exists.\n\nHere is the community forum for the original game, now renamed to “LEVEL 22”:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/293300/#scrollTop=0\n\nhere is the community forum for the “new” game:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/431290/#scrollTop=0\n\n\nThis “new” (updated but same) game is named “Level 22: Gary's Misadventure”. In researching this it looks like they silently renamed the original game before releasing this same game with the original name.\n\nIn the forums for both games the developer(s) and publishers have been entirely absent from the topics asking if original supporters can get this same (minorly updated) version free. Most other games provide updates to the same game free or automatically give you the enhanced version, not sure why this game wants to burn all the people that helped make it possible.\n\nThe original developer sold the game to this company.\n\nEdit: Now they renamed this game to, "Level 22: Gary’s Misadventure - 2016 Edition" They are thinking about honoring original owners and supporters of the game with this patch, I'll update this if anything like that does take place.","February 26","true","14.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Also I noticed that many others are having issues and nothing has been done.\n\n· 2-2 The game would not let me click in the staff room to access the safe. I had to quit out several times, try and try again then after wildly clicking an unnatural amount of times propelling my carpal tunnel into a fever pitch of tingly numbness I supernaturally hit the butterspot which allowed me to enter the room and access the safe.\n\n· 2-4 I can’t get the Hyper Feat Boy toy. The game WILL NOT let me click past the security guard.\n\nTHEN when I reached the F-this-game point and quit out in disgust I received the ‘Mister Overyld’ achievement.

Even if its Gary’s birthday, he has been late to work for the last time, so if he’s spotted sneaking into work he’s fired. Think of the game as Die Hard without the guns or explosions. To sneak your way in, you’ll be dodging the view cone of fellow employees, dumping coffee on electronics, pouring laxative in coffee, hiding in a box, crawling through vents and using explosives on security guard bosses as you work your way to the end of each level or floor. I have a feeling its dumping coffee on electronics that will get him fired.\n\nMost stealth games put you in a soldier’s uniform, let you take down enemies, hide bodies or avoid monsters, but Gary takes it in another charming and happy direction. Dodging coworkers feels too lighthearted to evoke any dread like dodging monsters does. Along your way you’ll get calls from Gary’s friend Marty to explain via text dialog most of how everything works. Why you’d have a cell phone with a ringer is beyond me when you’re trying to evade attention.\n\nThe well polished visuals and old school chip tunes are the highlights of the game. The art style stands out and enhances the product. Everyone has big boxy heads so you can tell which of the eight directions people are looking. It looks different than every other stealth game out there. There are a lot of little details that show the care that went in. Such as starting in a parking garage and another moment where you’re on the high rise balcony sneaking past people enjoying the view.\n\nIts a tough game from the onset, perhaps too tough; you need to have eyes everywhere. The game lets you look ahead which is helpful, unless someone sneaks up from behind. You never see the vision cones until they can spot you. Even then most of the time you have a brief moment to duck out of sight around a corner. Other times its game over and you’re taken to a scene of your angry boss looking over a monitor. After each game over, you can keep playing and restart from the last frequent checkpoint.\n\nYou’ll need to play each level a few times to get a feel for everyone’s patterns. There are no tells if someone is about to turn around, they just do. So it can be a matter of trial and error. Each level is linear. There can be a moment of which way do I go? But there’s only one correct way. You’ll need to go that other way later once you have a box to hide in or whatever accessory you need.\n\nThere are a few office cabinets and car trunks to hide in. When you hop in one there’s a limited view, which makes it a gamble if someone will be standing outside when you pop out. Crawling through ducts has the same limited view. Has anyone ever crawled through an air duct before? They make a lot of noise. Sometimes vents are hidden by machines, so you’ll need to bump into them and they’ll move.\n\nThe levels get larger as you progress and before you know it you’ll have to juggle hiding behind newspapers in plain sight, running to safety and using doughnuts to bait guards away from their post or throwing erasers to distract them. Some of the items feel ineffective, because your foes are smart enough to spot a box that looks out of place. Yet somehow you can hide behind a newspaper in the digital age without being caught.\n\nAs you progress, you can find safes with extensive combinations that I was never able to unlock. Other than that there are toys that act to find around the office. These seem to only be collectibles rather than have an actual use or power. Their only real interest is how a Batman or “Dark Bat” toy can be allowed in a game. I have a feeling there are other things from popular media, but I have yet to find them. It would have been nice if these toys were alternate costumes for Gary. He could be dressed up as a ninja going through the office.\n\nIts easy enough to play with a 360 controller or keyboard, but the big problem with the controls are the items relegated to the D-pad. On a controller you move with the left thumb stick and look further with the right thumb stick, so having to take either hand off a thumb stick to use the D-pad when I’m running feels counter intuitive. It seems like it would be simpler to use the face buttons, since the only one that seems used is the A button for interacting. Worse than that the directions for each item can change. So if I have a stapler and explosive, then I use one, the other might then be reassigned to a different arrow. Its inconsistent and the directional arrow on the icon seems subtle when I’m focused on avoiding coworkers.\n\nWhile it does seem like a simple game of avoiding coworkers, there are so many fresh facets that keep it interesting and diverse more than other stealth game out there. Its just troubled in my opinion by its trial and error difficulty. As gorgeous looking and enjoyable the music is, its just a genre that makes it tough to enjoy.\n\nAnother thing holding the game back is how generic the title is. Of course it could be worse, it could be called “Stealth Office.” Off the top of my head, the name Gary or Garry has been in the title of two other games, but that’s why its Level 22 Gary’s Misadventures… which says nothing about the game other than how many levels it has. Perhaps Super Mario Bros should have been called Level 32 Mario’s Adventure.\n\nI’m on the fence about this one. If the game had lower production values or less charm, it would be a no. There are great game mechanics, its just tough to find the fun through all the challenge. I would like to thank Adrian for granting me a copy of this game. Oh and if a boss wants Gary fired, they’d look at his punch clock and call him up when they see he’s out, but then you’d have no game.","February 15","true","2.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","0"

That's what this game feels like all the time. This is a rare case for me, an Indie game that isn't terrible but is actually pretty damn fun. (Seriously, look at my other reviews, this doesn't happen much). I can honestly say I really enjoy this game despite its issues. Highly recommended (for me anyway). Price point may be a bit high for some though since I'm not sure if there's much replay value,  a community level editor would make this a much better proposition for the price.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NBYTlbNsfCM\n\nTechnicals: Not much to speak of, no fullscreen/windowing options, you can toggle music and sfx on or off and you can use gamepad or mouse and keyboard (I recommend gamepad, mouse and keyboard requires you to control the character with clicks like an rts which is very awkward, a wasd and arrow keys system would have been better). Oh and nothing is remappable.\n\nGameplay: You control Gary and try to evade coworkers and security guards as you sneak your way into work late. You hit a gameover when you are spotted by somebody (unless you just skirt their vision for a split second). The "enemies" have a cone of sight like in many games and you need to evade them.\n\nThis can be done by simply learning their movement patterns and dodging them, to using the environment to hide (vents, closets, toilets etc.) , to even sabotage. Sabotage how? Well you can break their equipment to distract them, chuck erasers so they look in that direction, knock em out, OR (my favourite) give them an overdose of laxatives -insert maniacal laugh-\n\nThe gameplay feels very smooth and it does get complicated at some points, I'll openly admit there was a couple points in the hour and I half I have played so far just raging. Oh, and did I mention boss fights? There are boss fights in this office lmao. These boss fights use mechanics you've already seen but in a way that feels much less like you're advancing a level than legitimately duking it out with the boss and it's great.\n\nBesides that there are little collectible figures, essentially pop figures with alternate names and some quirky descriptions. As well as secrets, these are hidden behind safes which require you to locate hints hidden throughout the level, on the first couple levels this is simply a case of spotting numbers hidden in plain sight around the level but later on it does become more difficult.\n\nMusic/sound: Pretty enjoyable, the pacing is good and suited to the game and I do enjoy some of the tracks quite a bit. The sfx are decent enough, the one issue I have in this department is the fact that you can hear the employees using printers when they are waaaay off screen, no matter the size of the level you can always hear printers being used from the other side. It's not a huge issue but it does detract from the music a little.\n\nGraphics: Pretty simple, nothi9ng flashy about it. Runs smoothly at 60 locked.\n\nOf course there are a couple bugs that do need addressing:\n1- I have multiple monitors and f0r some weird reason this game does not play in the primary but in my third monitor all the way on the left, this means if I were to play on mouse and keyboard I'd be at a very awkward angle. There's no in-game option to window the game so you need to alt+enter to window it then move it to your primary and alt+enter again to have it play on the right monitor.\n\n2 - On gamepad there's a button that will zoom in the camera and lock it there, I can't figure out how to zoom back out despite mashing all the buttons, this is fixable with a restart.\n\nFully recommend, this is honestly very, very fun for me. Nice pacing, it's got some difficulty behind it at some points, and the dialogue is quirky. I do honestly think using a gamepad will make the game feel much smoother though.","February 12","true","2.1"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","15","32","0","3"
