The graphics are 2D, so they are pretty simple. However, I like that this game is colorful, as well as the backgrounds of the areas make it more enjoyable. The textures are relatively decent, a better polishing would have been a plus. The atmosphere varies between 5 different environments, from the hot tropical climate to the cold polar climate, and further to the Moon. Every environment has its own buildings, background and especially population/vehicles, but sometimes… the weather could really affect the gameplay. Not only that it can be somewhat make the game looking more dynamic, but it can also cover your aircraft. The audio is pretty decent, even though sounds when clicking the menu/pause/resume icons should be added. The soundtracks are pretty nice, they suit every environment. The gameplay is relatively repetitive, but the surprise bonuses and the general being hold in an unknown building make the gameplay pretty decent, as well as the weather influences the ability to see your aircraft. The weather can cover it, so you cannot see where you are bombing. There isn’t any complicated story either, basically there is a guy who keeps coming to certain cities to bomb them, while he takes off from the ground (from hidden places, where usually a gate opens and the aircraft comes out to take off), and in the final, a cut scene appears with him and with his 5 aircrafts being happy, meanwhile a ton of fireworks are exploding on the sky in the background.  The user-interface is very simple, without any additional designing. The controls are pretty alright, you can control the game with both the mouse and the keyboard. The engines are alright, I I haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are pretty good everywhere, even though the bombs feel a little unnatural, especially when they fall. The damages of the buildings aren’t that realistic neither. But I like the constant burning of the buildings, they are relatively realistic. Overall, pretty decent mechanics, but some polish would improve them.\nPositive Points Decent and colorful 2D graphics\nAlright SFX and pretty good soundtrack\nRelaxing gameplay + weather makes it somewhat challenging\nMany types of buildings and environments\n25 levels to explore + 5 boss levels\nThe ability to upgrade your 5 airplanes\nGenerals and tricky bonuses in the buildings\nSteam trading cards and achievements\nNeutral Points The area of bombing should be bigger at higher levels\nA level editor would be a great feature\nNegative Points The graphics and the mechanics need a little more polish\nThe droppings of the bombs are somewhat unnatural\nIt could get repetitive for certain gamers sometimes\nGeneral Ratings\nFeature	Rating	Graphics	65/100	Atmosphere	58/100	Audio	60/100	Music	70/100	Gameplay	72/100	Story	50/100	Content Quality	68/100	Content Quantity	66/100	User Interface	45/100	Controls	75/100	Engines	70/100	Mechanics	68/100	Price Tag	100/100	Personal Rating	66/100","May 30","true","3.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","3"

Sure you can play this game in any screen resolution, but it’ll just stretch everything to accommodate your monitor, don’t fall for this stupid gimmick.\n\nPresentation wise, I can see where the devs placed their efforts. You have 25 stages set in five different locales, 5 boss battles and a hidden seagull level. Almost every locale had some pop reference somewhere and every plane had their own unique take off sequence. But everything is ruined by repetition, time and again.\n\nFirst of all, every plane performed the same way with the same upgrades earned by killing hidden generals. None of the bosses shoot at you ever and all of them were way too easy to beat. While you get to bomb buildings to the ground, they are always the same width of varying heights, with little variation on difficulty.\n\nThe biggest blunder must be the bonus crates, since they can punish the player by repairing buildings or "restart the stage completely". This mechanic has no design merits, and it can seriously annoy you as it did with other reviewers.\n\nLastly, this title can be completed within an hour, two if you go for every achievement. If you had to buy it, please do it during a sale.","May 2","false","4.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","5"

That's literally all there is:  drop bombs on buildings to destroy them piece by piece.  There are 5 stages that are essentially different themes, but nothing else changes.  Each stage has a new plane to fly, but it's just looks -- nothing different.  Each stage ends with a boss fight that is again just part of the theme.  The only thing different about them is the number of bombs you have and the number of parts you have to hit (first boss has one thing to blow up, stage 2 has 2, stage 3 has 3, etc.)\n\nI beat the game with 3 stars on all levels and 11/12 achievements in 90 minutes.  I didn't even get all the card drops from the thing before it was over, so if my time goes up, it's because I let it idle just to get all the cards.  I was bored after the first level, but I kept going wondering if it would get any harder or throw me any curveballs.  Nope.  The only comfort I can take away from this is knowing I can uninstall and cross this off my backlog as a game that I'll never have to think about again.\n\nI don't think it's terrible, there's just not much to it.  Recommended?  No, not really.  Maybe for kids, but I don't know why you want them to be bombing cities instead of making pie or something.  The game functions just fine, but you can get the same experience I just had by watching one of the above videos 45 times and save yourself 2 bucks.","April 11","false","1.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","15","21","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/453980/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","At time of writing Airstrike HD has a positive review record (4/1). Three of the positive and the negative are all private reviews. I do not get it. Is this a blatant attempt to promote a game by cheating the Steam review system? I can understand that some people may actually like this game but not to the point where eighty percent of the early reviews are positive especially when three of the four are private. I’ve played much better developed and less repetitive games on Kongregate than Airstrike HD. That’s an honest assessment of the game.\n\nThe game is just too repetitive after the first level or two to keep anyone immersed in the game. Very little changes. You have slightly taller towers and you see the introduction of weather effects. To aide you you have the most basic of power ups – the plane slows down, bombs are replaced automatically, you stay on the same level twice, etc. It’s the same thing over and over again ad nauseam. The only time the game ever changes anything up is when you hit a bonus and the bonus is actually a penalty – buildings rebuild or something – and it leads to a more riskier yet higher scoring level.\n\nIt’s not as though I am demanding that developers use the latest and greatest technologies at their disposal when creating games or that some repetition cannot be a good thing because some of the games that Steamified has featured and looked upon very favorably so far this year have been repetitive and basic. But when the entire game is repeating exactly what you’ve done without sufficient change  and the core mechanics aren’t that interesting – it’s nothing more than an inverse space invaders type game where the enemies don’t attack you – it leads to tedium and boredom very quickly.\n\nIf I were to say something positive about the game is that it does indeed work as intended. It also has some pretty easily obtainable Steam achievements and has a set of Steam trading cards. In this respect the developers have done a thorough job in making their game Steamified. For this I can appreciate their game on an exterior level. Otherwise, this one is a bit of a dud I’m afraid.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","false","5.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","16","26","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ararielfett/recommended/453980/","ararielfett","[ᴸᴼᴳ] Arariel Fett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ararielfett/","285 products in account","AirstrikeHD is one of those games that really requires no skill, no strategy or planning, just click and hope you destroy the buildings in time.  I've read a few negative reviews, and I honestly don't understand why people are being so critical. Were they expecting a significant upgrade due to it being released in 2016?  I can admit, the game is very basic, and there's really nothing to it, but it's far from being terrible.\n\nOne complaint I read that I can agree with is that there's really nothing to keep the game fresh.  The missions are the exact same thing, and while there are different planes you can fly, it's only an aesthetic.  Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable game, but it's not one that will be able to hold  your attention for very long due to how repetitive it is.  It would've been nice had there been some variation added.\n\nI'm not sure if this was intended or if it's just me, but there seems to be a millisecond delay between when you press the fire button and when your rockets actually launch.  This can end up being confusing as you're right on top of a building, press the fire button, but it doesn't actually drop said rocket until you've passed it.  This is frustrating, and makes you unsure of when a good time to drop the bombs are.\n\nThis may be a stupid thing to critique, but I'm going to mention it anyway, and it sort of goes along with the above issue.  There's a power-up/negative item you get that is a magnet, and will bring your plane down in altitude.  When you try and hit a tall building but can't due to the before mentioned issue, this magnet can really screw you over.  I wish this wasn't a thing - at least until your bombs actually drop when you click.\n\nAnother complaint I was was about the game having poor graphics.  Uh....what do you want?  1080p graphics for a game where the visuals aren't even important?  Come on, people!  The graphics are mediocre, but again, this is not meant to be a visually pleasing game.  The graphics are perfect for the style of game this is.\n\nI actually liked this game.  Basic, simple, and easy to get into. It just gets too boring after a little while.\n\nPositives:\n\nSimple, easy to play.\nCheap\nTrading cards\nAchievements\n\nNegatives:\n\nGets boring after a while due the gameplay being the exact same thing every time.\nDifferent plane models, but the exact same plane with no differences.\nSlight delay when firing rockets that causes you to not hit a target you're directly over.\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curations.","May 3","true","2.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

You have to time the bomb drop to hit the powerup box and the powerup box sometimes rebuilds the city, makes shields over the buildings, etc.  One seemed to restart the entire level.  I had only 4 building boxes left when I hit that one.  I was trying to AVOID hitting the powerups at that point, but it's pretty hard to bomb all the buildings without hitting any powerups.  Getting the b**bie prize most of the time makes this a chore to play.  That is NOT a good way to make a game 'harder' or 'more challenging'.  There is no challenge in a dice roll.

Even then there's not much going on on screen to keep them interested. As previewed in the freaking trailer it's literally a plane going back and forth across the screen and dropping bombs on buildings, almost like a reverse space invaders. That might sound cool but when have you looked at those things and thought they would provide riviting gameplay? You can't even move the plane on your own so the only thing you have to do is wait for your plane to fly over some buildings and spam left click. In the style of old, crappy NES games, it also provides a quite annoying loop of a soundtrack.

Oh, as for the achievements - you'd better not mess with the options menu, it may be punishing.\nAnd all those lovely details from the old games/movies! Oh, I've enjoyed the background of each and every level a big deal, though I should notice those backgrounds are rather distracting when you see them for the first time.\nAs for the music. It´s good enough, though pretty simplistic. Moreover, music on each level is corresponding to the location (I especially enjoyed the track on the first levels of the Egypt location, but to each his own).\nThe controls (heh) of an airplane are intuitive, and that´s all one needs to know. There were a few times when I missed the building I was aiming at because the plane hadn't responded to my command in time, but I guess it was my tireness after a hard working day rather than the game's bug.\nI've expected somewhat more from the bosses, 'cause they are too easy to deal with, but on the other hand they were not annoying and unbeatable as in some other games.\nOh, and there's also a secret level. Rather funny one (:\nAll in all, I liked the game. 9 out of 10","March 24","true","4.8"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","2"

Trying to tackle specific achievements, screwing up, and having to do it over again can make it get very annoying very quickly.\n\nAnother huge issue I had were the powerups. It seemed like a majority of the time, you can easily pass through levels without ever grabbing them, and in all honesty it's probably better if you don't. You rarely, if ever, will need the items that help you, but the items that hinder you are FAR more unforgiving, you can go from easily beating the level to automatically losing as soon as the item is grabbed. A good game would have some kind of insurance so challenge the player to work at completing the level, but these just seem like the developers went for more of the, "Oops you hit the box guess you lost this round ;-)" route instead.The item I seem to always hit is the pink reset item, which basically feels like the game raises a giant middle finger at you and tells you to play the entire level over again, even if you were only a few drops from completing it. Oh but don't worry - Your insignificant score will remain.\n\nThe upgrade system is also very weak. It's the same thing with each world (pass a level, get a little perk), and you don't even get the most useful ones until you face the boss (which you can destroy in one shot, without it even trying to attack you).\nWhy not have a system where the score is instead replaced with a currency, where we can spend this money to upgrade plane bodies, wings, bombs, etc? It's a concept we've been seeing in free flash games for years now, and a game like this underachieves in this regard?\n\nI realize these are very nit-picky, but the bottomline I'm trying to get at is Airstrike HD is no better than your standard internet game you can find for free anywhere else. I'm not sure why this game has a price tag at all. But because it is asking money, I would imagine these little things would have been given more thought, instead of just a glorified flash game with repeated and stale levels.","May 31","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
