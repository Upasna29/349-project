"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DukeBlackSpawn/recommended/332730/","DukeBlackSpawn","BlackSpawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DukeBlackSpawn/","2176 products in account","The game has been abandoned. At this point, only recommend buying it as part of a cheap bundle or for less than $4.99 USD\nReview At A Glance\n\nPros:\n* Chaotic, fast paced gameplay\n* Bash your friends over the head with grievous, nasty medieval weapons!\n* Beautiful, cartoony graphics and smooth animation\n* Satisfying combat and gore\n* Great sense of humor\n* Just pure fun!\n\nCons:\n*Single map\n*Multiplayer only, not many players at the time\n*Bots are pretty buggy\n\nConclusion:\nBarbarian Brawl is a fast paced third person perspective multiplayer brawler with a great sense of humor. It is the prototypical party game; ideal to dish out some virtual damage on friends and family. Controls are responsive and intuitive, and gameplay has enough intricacies to keep it interesting for countless hours. Sadly, game servers are routinely empty, so it is nearly impossible to drop into an on-going game. Bots are buggy at best, commonly getting stuck in different spots of the map. At this time, if you want to go for a fun ride, you'll have to invite and bring your friends. I recommend this game only if you have friends that have a copy or if you are willing to grab one for a few friends. Otherwise, you are better off waiting for the game to build a community or should hold off until bots are more functional.\n\nIn Depth Review, Proceed with caution!:\n\nStory:\nBarbarians are angry and hungry. They enjoy bashing things into oblivion with a varied assortment of weapons and they need ham, lots of ham. You and your barbarian adversaries spawn in a village rigged with multiple environmental hazards and terrain; ideally designed with hand to hand combat in mind.\n\nGameplay:\nA barbarian's goal is to annihilate every other opponent, and to hog all the ham. Destroying other barbarians is the most common source of ham. Don't ask me what ham is made of! To accomplish these goals you will have to be elusive and time your attacks/blocks to match the refractory period/attacks of your enemies while avoiding environmetal hazards.\n\nThere are 2 game modes: Free for All and Team DeathMatch. Up to 20 players can play at once. Overall, the gameplay is satisfying. There is no walking or crouching, only running while wielding your blunt or bladed weapon. Spacebar is default for jump, and the control of the character is tight and responsive. The jumping and landing are "sticky," which makes it easy to jump over and off of structures, allowing for maneuverability and better control of your player. While fast paced, its easy to be accurate and its fun to dart in and out of danger to get those hits in. After you destroy your opponent, you can kick around their remains and their weapon.\n\nControls are straightforward. The left mouse button is default attack button; a click results in a weak, quick attack while holding the button allows the player to do a charged, strong, slower attack. Right mouse button is default block,  Q key to Stun and E key to heal. Each time you heal, you use 1 unit of ham. Controllers are supported and mappings customizeable, my XBOX 360 controller ran flawlessly.\n\nSeveral power-ups that spawn during the course of the game: Berserk orb and a Ninja orb; these increase the power/damage of your hits and the speed of your player, respectively. There is also Ham, which only spawns in a designated portion of the fight map (Gladiator combat arena). Ham gives you points which you can use to buy weapons. A ham counter on top center of your screen marks the time of the next Ham spawn.\n\nAdditionally, there is a random pink cloud that spawns in designated portions of the arena. Staying in this cloud will either heal your wounds over time, at a faster pace than they would otherwise, or give you Mega Damage.\n\nDesign:\nOn game start, you are asked to choose EU or US servers. Even though either EU or US server games will contribute towards your steam achievements, ham and character unlocks accrued are specific to either EU or US servers. In other words, your character unlocks and ham will not cross over between regions.\n\nVisual polish abounds. The characters and the world have a cartoonish, yet detailed look. There are six characters to choose from, all meticulously desiged with a distinctive look. They have different Max Health, HP regeneration, Damage per second and Speed attributes. There are 11 different weapons, with different damage and speed attributes. Reach attribute is not described but also varies between weapons. The game is beautiful at higher resolutions.\n\nEven though only one map is available, it provides a wide range of terrain and locations. This allows for good variety in combat, terrain can be both foe or ally. Flats, grassy knolls, village huts, fences, bridges, narrow passageways, a round gladiator arena and a small forest are all encountered in the single provided map. These structures can provide both defensive and offensive advantages. Additionally, there is a small, deadly lake.\n\nThe environment is riddled with a cornucopia of hazards that spice the gameplay up. There are snapping bear traps, stationary wooden poles with rotating blades, guillotines and spike traps. These are always located in the same location of the map, so getting to know their location can again provide an advantage, as you can lure unsuspecting opponents into some of these traps. Its always fun to hear a "Snap!" go out behind you as an enemy attempted to catch you unaware.\n\nSound:\nThe music is epic and does complement the game appropriately. Sound effects are crisp and also fitting. Both accomplish their job without many whistles.\n\nReplayability:\n\nAt first start, only one of the 6 possible characters is playable. Playing with different weapons and strategies is rewarded with character unlocks. Each character has a description of the actions necessary to unlock it. Moreover, the more you play, the more ham you will accumulate. Ham is the currency used to buy weapons. The wide range of characters and weapons allows for some experimenting and interesting combinations to mix/match fitting attributes. The gameplay is simple but small details such as powerups, healing clouds, hazards and terrain spice up the game and keep it fresh for a while. Sadly, there is a single map. This map does contain many different types of areas and terrains, yet, a variety of maps would increase replayability immensely.\n\nIf there was an active community, replayability would be medium/high. Although it can get repetitive, it is great fun to smash other barbarians, especially if these are friends. As it stands, it is hard to find a populated game server/lobby.\n\nIt is fairly easy to get to 100% achievements in this game, a Steam guide is available and instructs how to do this in under 3 hours. Game has a total 6 steam trading cards and provides 3 drops.\n\nConclusion:\nBarbarian Brawl is a simple, fun, yet addictive multiplayer brawler. Even though there are bots that technically allow for single player, these are quite buggy and too unreliable to make for an enjoyable single player experience. Currently, game servers are quite barren and it is rare to find other players. The game is truly at its best when you are playing against friends. I recommend this game if you have friends that have a copy or if you are willing to grab one for a few friends. Otherwise, you are better off waiting for the game to build a community or should hold off until bots are more functional.","April 3, 2015","true","13.0"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","27","35","2","17"

In Barbarian Brawler you must fight other barbarians in order to win ham! In the game you play against bots and human characters alike on a map full of sneaky traps to kill you, if an enemy doesn't get you, a trap will.\n\nI struggled to decide whether or not I should make this a positive or negative review but since I had fun when I was able to play I have decided to put it as positive. Despite this being a positive review I would suggest you only buy this game if you have at least three friends to play it with.\n\n+Nice graphics and design\n+Quite a few different barbarians to unlock, new barbarians are unlocked through getting certain achievements in the game\n+A wide variety of weapons to unlock, new weapons are unlocked by earning ham which can then be spent on the weapons, each weapon has its pros and cons as well as its own price\n+Simple but fun combat\n+Simple controls\n+A number of different, deadly traps which are dotted around the map\n+It's a lot of fun when playing with friends\n\n-The multiplayer (bearing in mind there is no singleplayer) is almost completely dead so it's almost impossible to find a match unless you have friends to play with\n-The bots are very hit and miss, sometimes they run around trying to kill you but other times they will just stand still at their spawn location\n-Bots only spawn when there are two or more players in the game so you can't even play by yourself\n-Only one map, as you can imagine, playing on one map again and again gets boring very quickly\n\nVerdict:\n5\n\nA fun brawler game that is really let down by its bots and lack of players, only buy it if you have friends to play it with.\n\nEl K.","March 8, 2015","true","1.5"," 37 of 53 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","37","53","5","1"

Well the name pretty much states it you as the player get to choose from a list of 6 barbarians, but you really only start out with one, each barbarian has their pros & cons but i'm not going to get into that... Once you have selected your barbarian you then can either use quick battle or server browser, but since the servers are completely empty, you are gonna want to select quick battle. Then after a couple seconds you load into a map, noted there is only one map you can chose, which gets rather boring after a little while... now that you have spawned in, you really have to spend some time messing around, cuz sadly there is no tutorial, which in my opinion is the main source of why the servers are empty cuz you don't have a clue what to do. So after spending some time messing around i understood some things, bet i still felt that i was still missing some stuff, what i did understand was the health, the score, chat box, who killed who thing, but there was some other stuff i am still puzzled about... That was a summary of what i though of the game, i will go more into the pros/cons of the game below.\n\nPros\n- the death physics is cool, & really funny\n- can be a fun game if the servers were more populated\n- good soundtrack\n- game isn't demanding specs wise\n- has a cool cartoonish look to it\n\nCons\n-There is no tutorial which is a huge turnoff for the game, because you don't know what to do, so you can't fully enjoy it, & instead you become frustrated & lose interest, making a tutorial can really help save this game.\n\n-The servers are empty, i saw only one other player get on, which was probably due to no tutorial\n\n-since there is only one map it can get a bit boring, also the map needs some tuning, some parts of it will be stacked with traps, while other areas are completely empty, so the skilled ones are likely to not step within a couple feet of the trap-covered areas, since they would have the skill advantage, while the noobs would be more likely to hang out in the trap area, since it would be easier to get kills.\n\n- more gamemodes, there is only deathmatch, which like i said gets boring after a little while.\n\n- more warriors/weapons, with any mutiplayer only game, you need to keep coming out with new content/tweaking things in order to keep people interested.\n\nConclusion: I really don't want to give this game a thumbs down, because this game is fixable, compared to some games on steam, that devs leave out to dry, but since there is only a thumbs-up or thumbs-down option on Steam, i have no choice to give it thumbs-down, because i don't want to tell people to pay $9.99 for a game that is currently empty, & has some problems with it. I do wish though that steam would a third choice for recommendation in the review, like "Too Early to Say", or simpy "Unsure at the Moment", anyway the review will change for the game over the course of the next couple months as Thrillion makes some adjustments/tweaks for the game.","March 8, 2015","false","0.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I played it for a bit and then thought about the mechanics, which there isn't much of. I won this game in a giveaway and I really want to try it and enjoy it, but I can not. It's almost literally just 3 buttons from what I can tell. You can jump, attack, and block, but the whole concept is boring and not well done. There are traps that kill you instantly and it's too obvious that even that wasn't really thought out. So I can say without a doubt this game is unenjoyable in it's current state.
