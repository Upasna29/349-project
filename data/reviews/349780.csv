Began playing for fun and did not even notice how time has gone, the first 2-3 levels are simple and not very interesting, and then started a real hardcore, buttons to open grids, fog boxes. Oddly once poured into the gameplay forget about the disadvantages of the game, although they are not enough, but the game begins to take its labyrinths. I hope to continue the game will not be disappointed with the variety and complexity. For this price, this game is a sin not to buy.","February 22, 2015","true","5.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Fun for a few minutes in between games or if you just want a quick run. There is a nice progressive difficuly with the mazes, reminds me of a more modern version of Chip's Challenge back on older computers. It combines Speed Running with quick thinking, memory and making sure you have necessary items. Instead of Keys the levels have different items such as boats to travel across water, mushrooms and different things related to the type of enviornment Fatty happens to be challenging.\n\nYes, you play as a Fat guy stuck in a maze. 10/10.\n\nAs for price, get it on sale. Only paid about $5 for this.","February 20, 2015","true","0.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","7","11","3","0"

But there is all the small UI and technical stuff that gets in the way. Basically ruining my gaming experience. You might not experience it the same way. But I found it too annoying.\nMy biggest complains are not being able to play in a window. And then there's the controls. Far from a smooth feeling. But looking away from that. Sometime the character would turn in a direction without me telling him to. I could ignore that if you could just point and click where you would want him to go. But in that case he only move 1 block in the direction clicked. Meaning you have to click a LOT.","March 21, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
