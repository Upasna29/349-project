Played several 4X games and they had their pros and cons. Endless Space is one of the better 4X games and absolutely worth buying, in my opinion. Wouldn't have played 300+ hours else, heh. I am reviewing it including Disharmony expansion.\n\nGalaxy: Endless Space offers some variety of galaxy shapes and sizes, some favoring defensive players, some favoring offensive ones. Additional finetuning of the galaxy is possible. I miss the opportunity of creating a REALLY huge galaxy, but maximum size with just one opponent works ok as a sandbox mode. During exploring you will find nice bonuses, a few pirates, wormholes (basically dividing the galaxy until you can travel through them) and finally different wonders, so exploring is actually fun.\n\nBackground story: You learn about the Endless (usual Elder civilization which went extinct) during playing. The game lacks lore summary articles, but there are traces of this ancient civilization everywhere (galaxy wonders, technologies, factions, leaders), which adds to immersion.\n\nFactions: The games comes with 10 to 12 moderately unique prebuilt factions (depending on whether you get Harmony and Vaulters). Each gets specific traits, innate bonuses, ship bonuses and a few special technologies to encourage certain victory types and hence playstyles. Prebuilt factions are different enough to motivate you to try them all. Additionally, you can create your own faction by modifying a prebuilt one. Meaning you can replace their traits completely, but you have stick with their innate bonuses, ship bonuses and special technologies. It has still a high degree of freedom, I enjoy building my own faction a lot.\n\nAI: Computer opponents (artificial intelligences respective AIs) offer a solid challenge. Especially the 'evil' factions tend to attack you early on, so you cannot simply expand all over the galaxy or rush through the technology trees. Later most AI will attack you when they run out of colonization space - unless they are busy with other opponents. But they also attack each other for same reasons and their reasoning is mostly transparent (+x for long period of peace, -y for common borders etc.). At higher difficulty ratings they are more unfriendly (but not hateful) and get the usual strong production bonuses to offer more of a challenge.\n\nLeader: You can hire a few people for boosts to your empire or your fleets. They make a real difference and usually have a nice background story. It takes some time to learn about their feat trees, but once you became familar with it, your leader can turn a fleet into a nearly unbeatable force. Which you will need to fend off the many enemy ships at higher difficulty ratings... Using leaders to improve your empire helps a lot at the beginning but loses importance as it grows.\n\nProduction: Production is done on system level mostly, saving you some time compared to games which do it on planet level. So most buildings affect all colonized planets, ships are produced by the entire system etc.. However, you can specialize your planets (usually: food, industry, research, money), explore their moons and terraform the planets. Terraforming is an interesting feature here because depending on faction and situation you can be better off with unfriendly environment. Since production shouldn't be automated, you will spend a lot of time with tweaking your systems. But that's true for many of these games...\n\nTechnology: There are basically four technology trees and they sometimes offer different paths to specific technologies. It honestly needs quite a while to get used to them, but it offers interesting decisions to make. Technology names are often NOT related to their benefits, so at the beginning you will have to check their descriptions often. Other games did that better. Well, on the plus side you have many interesting concepts in the tech description texts - some scifi fans will like them.\n\nDiplomacy: The negotiation with aliens is a solid feature. At the beginning you are at "cold war", meaning you can invade other factions' outposts but not colonies - a bit confusing first. Of course there are war and peace. Peace can be upgraded a bit by two more treaties (open borders, cooperation) and there are alliances. Alliances are usually a short-lived thing with AI empires, but a few traits and technologies reward you for allying. Upgrading from war to cease fire to peace to additional treaties / alliance goes slowly since there is a hardcoded turn amount between them. For instance you have to be at war with your opponent for 10 rounds, then both sides can offer cease fire. At the beginning of the game this makes some sense (why ally instantly with some empire you barely know?), later it becomes kind of a burden. AI empires sometimes ignore the turn amount, speeding up the process. Beside this you can trade dust (basically money), technologies, systems and special resources. At the end of a long war you can even make an AI empire give you all its colonies.\n\nCovert operations: There is no secret service in any empire which is a bit of a letdown. Leaders can steal some dust (money) and technology points from other empires, but that's it.\n\nShip design: This game gives you rather much freedom how to design your spaceships. The weapon choices are a bit dull: Level 1, 2 and 3 versions of mass drivers, beam weapons and missiles, plus some fighters and bombers. You can defend your ships with thick armor, defense systems or simply taking out the enemy ships fast enough. Finally some special systems make your ships truly unique: Better engines for raids, better scanners to avoid getting surprised, siege for slow invasions, marines for fast invasions (they cost population!), multiple colony pods for quick expansion or multiple layers of armor to accept and shrug off enemy hits.\n\nBattles: Endless Space has a somewhat simplified battle system. You cannot control single ships or squadrons, instead you set the overall strategy by picking a card and probably refine it by formation and general targetting tactics. Leaders add a bit of complexity with their special cards. 'Manual combat' just means you can watch the battle (which looks nice) and change cards every combat phase. Of course this card system means you lose some control (compared with other games), but it also reduces micromanagement and makes the AI more competitive in battles. Some people hate it, some love it, I'd say it's ok.\n\nBugs: Endless Space crashes ocassionally, let's say every other game. In every case reloading the latest savegame fixed the issue. According to the error messages it's mostly about AI diplomacy - playing with less opponents and in smaller galaxies might help. Given the fun the game provides, I accept the rare crashes though.\n\nIf you like complex 4X games, you will (very likely) enjoy Endless Space and its addon Disharmony.","November 1, 2014","true","352.4"," 196 of 209 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","196","209","0","0"

DO NOT BUY AND PLAY THIS GAME NAKED!\n\nUnlike a lot of 4X games, Endless Space is more about building your empire than about developing your colonies or really fighting wars. Not that you won't fight wars, the AI is usually vicious enough to wait and plot and it will build up an overwhelming force based on your existing military might before waging war on you. And it WILL do that. Every single chance it can, unless it can't, it will do that. Never think it won't, since it has no reason not to.\n\nWe'll get more into that later, but right now let's focus on the empire-building. Building up the empire is the primary focus of this game. Oftentimes if you look at too little at a time, you'll tunnel vision yourself into a corner when you should be keeping yourself as distant as possible. A prime example of this is expressed in happiness. The morale of a system and its subsequent production bonuses are NOT more important than the overall happiness of your empire. After all, a 15% production bonus across 4 stars is better than a 30% bonus in just one. If, when settling a new system, you have a planet with lots of production, or a planet with a high amount of happiness-boosting, you pick the one that makes your empire happy, or you lose the game.\n\nNow then, let's talk about war. War is problematic in this game because A) it's inevitable, and B) it's boring. The game takes a very hands-off approach to combat and in the vanilla game technology is both everything and a linear arms race. The guy with the most ship tonnage and the best weapons will always win. You can employ tactics cards, but these will only have a minimal impact on the outcome. This leads to a very boring experience, and can force you into certain types of tech progression and thus certain modes of gameplay. To deviate from established doctrine is to lose in the vanilla game.\n\nDO NOT PLAY THE VANILLA GAME. Instead, do yourself a favor and get the Disharmony expansion. The Disharmony expansion does away with about 75% of the weapon-tech in favor of just four generations of guns. Each is a sizable improvement over the last generation, and keeping up the with the AI is definitely important, but with tactics, ship design, aimpoint selections, and formation management you can steal victory from the jaws of supposedly assured defeat.\n\nEndless Space encourages you to use your distant veiw not to mess with the minutae of your own empire, but rather to mess with the other guys. Through trade, trade routes, blockades, invasions, explorations, treaties, and wars you are charged to take away the choices of the enemy for as long as possible while you improve your own choices. How you do this is entirely up to you, and Endless Space: Disharmony actually allows you quite a bit of wiggle room on how you do it.","April 6, 2015","true","020.3"," 188 of 200 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","188","200","5","12"

The joy in this is the expansion and technological advancement. However, the space combat, while somewhat of a railroad sequence, remains entertaining with a fairly unique 'stance' selection mode where you can choose the tactics your fleet uses.\n\nThis game is also has incredible aesthetics, one of it's high points,with the ability to zoom in on planets, ships, the galaxy as a whole has clearly been crafted with love.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Get used to this game via a let's play video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVGjqDRgc6w&list=PLA980FA7E19F59120 the tutorial system is the long-winded sort and it's far more entertaining and less of a chore to learn by seeing and then doing.

The visual style of the game is simplified but it works extremely well for the game and it has a really appealing design which is gentle for eyes. Especially the space and the stars look just gorgeous. The music enhances the feeling of being in space well and it is one of my favorite soundtracks ever.\n\nThe gameplay is the usual for any 4X game but it's very well polished making it one of the better ones. In Endless Space you pick a race to conquer the galaxy through diplomacy, science, military, colonization or economy. In combat you get to control fleets and command them in 3 phased battles that involves long, mid and close range combat. You get to choose a special command for each of these phases via a card system that functions like a rock paper scissors game. The battle system is easy to grasp but it has good amount of depth into it once you research more of these cards.\n\nStill depending on your skill level with 4X games Endless Space might not be the most hardcore game out there, but for someone who casually enjoys the more popular ones such as Civ 5 it's a fun game to play and offers a good amount of challenge.\n\nAlso the effort put into creating the endless universe seems quite passionate and it is an interesting one to digest more into! (Amplitude Studios are even making other game series based on the same universe). All of the races have their unique flavor and it's easy to pick your favorite one out of them.","December 14, 2013","true","53.7"," 132 of 145 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","132","145","0","7"

It was interesting and had a good aesthetic (and still does). The developers were really responsive to the community and released a string of free DLCs that added many new features to the game. Even the expansion, which was reasonably priced at ten dollars, was interesting and fun, although the interesting, radically different Harmony faction was permanently crippled by two very, very bad design decisions.\n\n...but I digress.\n\nHowever, this is an example of a game that was destroyed by its updates. The final changes made to the game completely destroyed the diplomacy system and resulted in the AI repeatedly declaring wars on the player almost immediately after the player's score surpassed their own. It was a serious blow to the game's immersion factor and playability. It's not even like the wars were deadly, as it wasn't that hard on most difficulties to just endure the early sieges and produce a fleet of advanced Reaper-like dreadnoughts to wipe out the million tiny cruisers the AI would throw at you. Simply put: it turned Endless Space into a sci-fi version of the Total War games.\n\nThis was a great game; it's still a decent one, but I would not recommend buying it now. If you want a good 4X game, either buy Endless Legend, a much better game by the same company, or wait for Endless Space 2.","October 21, 2015","false","155.5"," 350 of 444 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","350","444","10","23"

It has that "one more turn" factor. Visually it's well done, and the UI is pretty clever with most complex orders only a few mouse clicks away. But then you find reordering production queues to be unusually clumsy. Most of the game is like that. A few solid hits then a terrible miss. [Queues have been improved in a recent update]\n\nThe races are good, well designed and presented, each with their own strengths and each requiring a slightly different set of priorities to succed. But then the difficulty modifiers kick in and the whole race balance goes out the window. Enemy AIs get bonuses to production NOT intelligence and you fight races that can outperform what you could do with them.\n\nThen the AI itself shows irreconcilable stupidity. If i could tolerate 6-7 dumb things the AI does per turn, it would do 10. All too often the AI fleets that could potentially beat you choose to flee (but waste your time, attack, or leave ships behind that blockade you), while i have had one completely unarmed and undefended fleet of invasion ships try to fight back (with tactics, not weapons ofc) and even somehow managed to flee with a few survivors. [AI stupidity has also been adressed with updates]\n\nThe AI can sometimes use tactics wisely and from what i saw has no knowledge of your own tactical choices, but the battles are a lottery decided far far ahead, back when you designed the ships. Some survive, some have no chance, and if your ships are very good, then AI will either allways retreat, or allways die, depending on whose territory you're fighting in. Sometimes the very outcome of a war or even game can hinge on the AI doing something remarkably stupid or you failing to understand some of the BASIC fundamental rules of the game. That... is beyond bad, that is awful.\n\nThe diplomacy model is one of the better i have seen. Most of it is really good, except of course the one part that kills it completely. It's all meaningless because ultimately your empire exists and therefore it would be better for a rival to take it all away from you. You're the weakest empire? Then die. Wait, you're strongest? Then die. You're in the middle, and a long term trading partner as well as supplier of strategic resources, benefits that far outweigh the problems caused by close borders (and you can see the exact numbers too)? Guess what? Today is the day none of that means anything. Prepare to set the relationship score to -200. And die.\n\nColonisation and expansion is arguably the strongest part of the game. Exploring the galaxy, triggering some halfhearted random events, scouting good spots for colonies. First contants. All good. But. The game actively penalises you for each and every system you own. Wheter you colonise it or capture it, just having a system increases the penalty higher and higher. Eventually it becomes high enough that it starts to hurt morale and that in turn drops production, research and cash flow. Yes, by colonising a system at a wrong moment, you can drop overall empire wide production by some 10-20%. Does that make any sense?\nYes, there are technologies that reduce the penalty, and yes, it's there to counterbalanc expansion but i am here to play a game, be emperor of space, not to oversee active game modifiers. They should be invisible and subtle, not hit me in the head. When i deliberatly skip average systems that are still well positioned, all just to avoid getting the expansion penalty down the road, i think i am playing a flawed game.\n\nCombat is neither good nor bad except when it's completely illogical. Designing the ships properly takes some experience and knowledge and if you do a good job your fleet will usually serve you well and survive for a long time or you will produce enough replacements for losses to not matter much. The main problem with all the tactical options, counters, different ranges, weapon optimisations, support ships, repair capacity, fighter/bomber cover, is that you very often feel like you just can't take your ships and tell them to "$#%^&* go and kill the enemy!", the MOST BASIC OF PURPOSES for your fleet, but somehow it gets lost in the myriad different things you have to tweak before you can fight. Long story short, i know what i want, the game wont let me, or i have to obey some rule/design feature/balance mechanic.\n\nSo while it starts pretty well, and has enough to be fun for a while, it eventually becomes a chore to try to complete a game. The AI has too many choices to make and inevitably it makes poor decisions (compare to SOTS' very basic but lethal AI) and all the strengths of the game are drowned out by the weaknesses.\n\nThe best turn based space 4X games have already been made. Master of Orion 2 and Sword of the Stars 1. Maybe even Birth of the Federation, though i am biased about that one. Other games of the genre try to do things differently which is unfortunate because sometimes imitation is the wisest form of flattery. Case in point: Xenonauts. For ages developers tried to recreate the perfect succesor to XCOM - UFO Defense. UFO: Aftershock is 99% as good, and UFO: Alien Invasion is an extremly good remake (but still unfinished). A slew of other games missed the mark completely or admittedly used the old game as a springboard for a new experience. Then Xenonauts imitated the original and surprise, surprise, it hit the bullseye.\n\nUltimatly Endless Space isn't solid enough to satisfy demanding 4x players, and it isn't "mainstream" enough to captivate the casual audience. So it ends up in between. Better than most, but not good enough.\n\nEDIT - 20 Dec. 2014\n\nSome of the complaints i've ♥♥♥♥♥ed about have been adressed by several patches released since this review. Production queues and enemy retreat logic have been adressed. Better late than never? Or thumbs up for devs supporting their game well after release? Both pretty much, and the game can't be hurt by extra polish & fixes.\n\nI will not change my verdict, but i will say it's still a game i would like to like. Probably more so than before with the recent updates.\n\nIf you're sitting on the fence know that you will probably enjoy exploring the game if you choose to buy it. Exploration and expansion are strong suits of Endless Space. It's just that ultimately i felt dissapointed with what i found, but have to admit it was fun exploring.","July 13, 2014","false","41.5"," 252 of 312 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","252","312","0","8"

As a fan of 4x strategy games they all look good to me but few live up to my standard.  This game has so much potential for and indie game and I really do look forward to an endless space 2 hopefully someday.  The complexity of it almost mind blowing.  The space battles between ships go 3D instead of the normal 4x game battles like the the most popular of all times Sid Miers Civilization.  The background story of the Endless Space Universe is fantastic.  The play between the factions is a little lackluster.  And the game leaves you wanting more of an in depth feel on the solar systems and planets.  But it is an Indie game and once you play you will see a few game play enhancements would be nice.  But the Universe is so expansive the technology tree is enormous.  The tech tree is broke down into four sections military, science, exploration, and economics.  If you research into exploration you might be able to build on any planet but it doesn't do you an good if you can't defend yourself.  If you go all science doesn't help if you can build the greatest advancements if you can't afford them because economy is weak.  That’s why I love 4x games and the seven ways to win expansion, scientific, economic, diplomatic, supremacy, and wonder .  And I all most forgot about  the ship builder I’ve lost myself for hours just building your very own customized ship. The disharmony DLC added some nice features and I look forward to more DLC's.

Can be a little frustrating at the beginning but once you get into it will consume you. Lore of the game is  really interesting , races are well designed and unique. AI isn't that great, even if its you best friend he will probably attack you becouse 1) you have a higher score than him 2) he has no room to expand. So yeah diplomatic is kinda hard in this game, one of the most difficult victories to achieve.\n\nThere is also a supremacy ( aka conquest homeworlds ) , expansion ( own 3/4 of galaxy )  and wonder victory.\n\nSo I suggest cooping with a friend becouse its always more fun. Games lenght depends on your map settings, they can last few hours or even days. There is lots of customization when it comes to the galaxy settings, like shape , size , ammount of planets and their size, events etc.\n\nRaces are also great. There is a race that devours worlds so they need to expand if they want keep their strenghts up, pacifist robots , religious robots , various humans sub-factions, et's , some kind of samurai aliens and finally my fav race Harmony.\nRace made of living crystal that wants to purge galaxy of dust ( aka gold, game income ).\nThere is also an option to modify current races and select different traits for them, its a fully customizable.\n\nSoundtrack is amazing, really enjoyable to listen.\n\n\nFlaws~~What are the minuses ?\nAI cheats a little , how is that possible that he can manage so many fleets and still have a decent income.\n\nCombat system is unbalanced. Kinetics op - even when they were designed for close combat they deal sick dmg at LONG range, just go full kinetics and every game is won.\n\nBomber units are useless.\n\nUI could be a bit better. Becouse later in the game micromanaging your entire galaxy gets a bit annoying, yes there is an AI governor to help with that but that isn't always a good option to choose.\n\nAnd many other small things that you will probably get annoyed by them and you will think "what the heck devs where thinking".\n\nSo yeah , its worth a money especialy when its on the sale.

Happiness affects everything, as in most 4X games, but unlike other 4X games, you don't seem to be able to invest much into helping your populace be happy (commenters claim this ability is merely hidden along particular tech tree paths, which seems restrictive -- do you have to choose those paths to succeed?).  Wars, in particular, make your people unhappy -- to the extent where an aggressive military playing style is basically out of the question.  The game's design limits the options for the "kind" of player you want to be -- you basically must play by the rigid set of rules the developer has laid down, or you are penalized to the point where you simply cannot beat even the normal AI.\n\nWars must be routinely tempered with diplomacy, and expansion must be limited during growth periods... or your expansion will fail, no matter how large your military, economy, etc.  Conquering opposing races is almost out of the question, unless it is done over a protracted period.  DIfferent races have different features, in this regard, but the trouble with such a setup is that your playstyle is largely known from the outset, by every other player in the game.  This basically boils down to a rock-paper-scissors "you chose your strategy, now live with it" game that is largely decided before the game starts.\n\nSpace combat is visually spectacular, and has some interesting tactical twists, in the form of a rock-paper-scissors tactic system.  Ship design, is fairly involved, even though weapons basically boil down to 3 types, with levels 1 throgh 5.  Ship designs can vary the amount of weaponry and defenses they have, but the game often boils down to something of a "who researched the right techs vs the other guy" fight, yielding a boring, balanced research mechanism as the most effective in basically any game, unless you know your opponent is researching rocks, papers, or scissors in particular.\n\nThe most severe issue with space combat, however, is that fleet size is limited by elements of the tech tree.  You can build a fleet of 50 cruisers, but can't put more than 1-2 in a fleet, plus a couple destroyers/corvettes, without researching the right aspects of the tech tree, and even then, the numbers are quite limtied.  Thus, an economically superior empire cannot necessarily win with sheer numbers, as each fleet engagement is limited by the number of possible ships in the fleet -- a small empire, with a fleet of 9-13 ships, with a similarly hard-to-come-by "hero" admiral (also limited to a very small number, unless you increase the number with tech), could conceivably defeat an armada of 50+ ships of the same technology level, based upon these nonsensical fleet-size limitations.  As such, increasing your effective fleet size is nearly the most important aspect of space combat, all by itself.  This enforces military balance between empires of radically different military sizes and capacities, effectively making large-fleet empires which rely primarily upon exploitation a weak approach, compared to empires which favor other 4X techniques. I would argue that the limitation is so restrictive, as to diminish strategic & economic options to the point of boredom.  No zerging, due to small fleet sizes.  No concentrated attacks.  Ship design heavily favors quality over quantity/inexpensive, etc.  Your opponents will be exactly the same as you, unless they're looking to lose through neglect of a balanced approach.\n\nThe inclusion of "heroes" in interesting, except that you are limited to a very small number of them.  It is nowhere near as easy to acquire, or utilize a hero in ES, as it is in a game like, for example, Heroes of Might and Magic.  You may have 1-2 heroes that are "Admirals" typically (the rest are typically governors of single star systems), but those heroes may not command any more vessels than are allowed by the fleet size limitation.  Thus, the benefit to a hero in a small empire is much larger than that of a hero in a large one -- and large empires can be easily overwhelmed by a sum of smaller nations, simply due to the number of heroes involved, and the fleet size restrictions.  Even 2 vs 1 can be almost impossible odds under these conditions, and the happiness issues with warfare.\n\nDiplomacy is limited in much the same fashion as combat is -- by options in the tech tree.  A player cannot even offer a peace treaty without researching the idea, first.  Thus, much of the diplomacy of a game is hidden until the mid-way point of a game, and even then its fairly limited.\n\nWIth all these important techniques locked up, via the tech tree at the beginning of each game, the tech tree seems reminiscient of a "tutorial" system, that locks down interesting aspects of the game in literally every game you ever play.  Since many of these options are fundamental to basic gameplay, as expected in most 4X games, your traversal through the tech tree is pretty much forced to visit these nodes each time... or you lose.  The nodes are spread out amongst the branches of the tree, and neglecting any of them seems like a typically fatal flaw... thus balance, balance, balance, at all times.\n\nEndless Space boils down to an exercise in walking down the middle of the road.  Straying too far in any direction is just an expensive diversion, and won't work against the AI, or in any interesting MP game.  No blitzkriegs, surprise attacks, radical technology developments, or diverse battle tactics allowed.","October 19, 2014","false","11.7"," 259 of 369 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","259","369","5","8"

This game requires a ton of thought. I'm going to put it plainly, it really does require a large amount of thought with it, but let's not start the review there. Let's start at the learning curve, and the fact that if you were to graph it that it would be a steep climb, then a flat line. When you first start the game, you don't get a tutorial, all you get is tool tips. These wont help you any because they barely explain anything at all so it will take you, depending on the type of gamer you are, anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours. This can push a few people away, but after you get past that you will love the game for what it is possibly. Key word being possibly. +6 Rating\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLets move on to the games factions. There are several factions in game that you can play as, or if you get Disharmony you can create your own faction. These factions are; United Empire, Sophons, Hissho, Amoeba, Cravers, Horatio, Sowers, Pilgrims, Sheredyn, Automatons, and Harmony.\nThe United Empire is a faction that just loves to expand and attack the weaker. They love to expand, but they don't expand quickly. If you're playing against them I would recommend you quickly grab your border systems so that they can't push in. U.E. can gather a military at a moderate place, but doesn't have the strongest military. The U.E. gets its military from its economy, and the economy from its colonies so if you want to destroy them quickly, don't allow them the colonies they want. If the U.E. sees a faction weaker than it that has a small military, and it doesn't think it would be able to defend itself well they will attack so be prepared.\nThe Sophons are a scientific faction that prefers Isolation unlike the U.E. counterparts. If you play as a nation that focuses almost entirely on your military you should make these people part of your alliance as they will give you some things they research for your dust.\nThe Hissho are a big problem when it comes to military as they don't like anyone most of the time. The Hissho will have a strong military that will become a pest if you don't try to get rid of it quickly, but they do research slowly. If you play a scientific nation become allies with these people. They will protect you for what you research.\nThe Amoeba are a faction of peace, but they colonize extremely quickly. Their people are happier whenever they are at peace with a faction, or a few factions. The Amoeba can quickly gather the Dust to prepare for war. If you are in need of dust, make sure you're on these guys good side, as they are very nice about giving it to you if you are.\nThe Cravers are a war monging, money hogging, system conquering faction. They are fun to play as, but they can not be in any alliances. Period. Don't even try to be nice with them.\nThe Horatio like to expand, and go to war when it comes to defense, or if they feel provoked. There isn't much to be said about them besides what I just said here.\nThe Sowers are an odd nation to say the least. They are a machine race that will either build a wonder to victory, or just attempt to conquer everyone else. This is literally all I can say for them until I get a better notice of how they play.\nThe Pilgrims are like the Horatio, and like to expand. They are a bit more like America in a sense though, they can be a bit unpredictable in some games as they have a good research rate, a good military, and a good ability to colonize systems. With all of this though comes the odd economy, it's definitely an interesting faction to play as, or with.\nThe Sheredyn is very likely to make an alliance with the United Empire, as according to lore they were at first the United Empires body guards for the Emporer. They are a very strong nation for military as they make it impossible for an enemy to retreat. They also have a pretty good economy at times. This is possibly one of the easiest factions to play as, but one of the harder ones to play against. That is my own opinion though.\nThe Automatons are a nation of building. Just building. They can do a weird resource gather thing if they aren't building anything, and if something large comes along to build that would take any other nation about 10-15 Turns the Automatons can likely do it 5-10 turns. This also gives them the ability to spam ships out sometimes.\nLastly the Harmony. They don't have an economy, and can populate systems rather quickly. They don't believe in using money because it can supossedly corrupt them. This means if you want to build anything you can't buy it out. Ever. They require patience when it comes to military. Calling them odd is the nicest thing to say as I could go even farther than calling the "Exuberantly weird" +15 Rating\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe game has smooth gameplay, and some good graphics that you probably wont be paying much attention to whenever you're having your fleets of ships fire lazers, missiles, and more at your enemies while they hold of the enemies own attacks with shields.\nThe battles in this game are basically exactly what I said above, except you pick an attack for them to do, a formation, and how you want them to attack, then you just watch. You can't control them in battle past this point.\nColonizing systems is pretty simple to do with easy mechanics behind it. All you do is build a colony ship, send it to a system you want, tell it to colonize and bam! You got a new system!\nThe alliances work as simply as this. Research the Alliances technology, bring up your approval rating with another faction, ask them to join. They can decide whether to join or not, and whether they do or not is simple as that. +9 Rating\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThere are several different ways to win one of the games you play.\nConquer the galaxy, own 75% of the galaxy, research the highest technology, build a certain wonder, or get a ton of money. These are all self explanatory, and give you several different ways to play the game giving "Play the way you want" a true meaning. +8 Rating\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe only way you're going to be able to play multiplayer is if you have some friends that own the game, the community is basically dead due to a "Chicken had to lay the egg, but the egg had to hatch the chicken" kind of thing. People say there's no multiplayer sometimes, so some people don't get it. There's no multiplayer because people don't get the game. +3 Rating\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWith all of this being said I think that I'll end the review here ending with a Rating Score of 41 out of 50. If you ask me the game is great, and a very enjoyable game. That's just One Gamers Opinion though.","April 20, 2014","true","171.2"," 65 of 75 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","65","75","0","0"

It took billions of years before the first life was given and further billions for the new rulers of space to conquer every star they could reach: The Endless. They traveled through wormholes, became masters of time and space, built outstanding monuments and structures and oppressed every lifeform that stood in their way, all with the help of a special gift called dust. The only ones who could make them fall were the Endless themselves with inner conflicts and arrogance. Millions of years later other empires arose from the stars. The Endless were gone but their technology, wisdom and Dust is still there, waiting for new conquerors. Which faction will dominate the others with science, war and dust? Hopefully yours.\n----------\n\nIt all starts with your chosen nation. May it the aggressive bird-like Hissho, the mechanical Automatons or the old human Imperials, they all come with positive and negative aspects that fit differing playstyles. Colonizing your first planet afterwards can be a tough choice. Planets differ and thus do the resources they produce. What you should keep in mind here is FIDS, standing for Food, Industry, Dust and Science. Basically, these four get your planets populated and fed, build ships and structures, offer the possibility for doing research and pay your running costs for ships, planetary improvements and heroes. Improvements can be portals for faster travel, refineries or habitats, just to name some out of a huge amount ES offers. Heroes are specialized commanders who can be attached to starsystems and fleets to further improve certain aspects like production or offense. They get XP, level-up and cost more while doing so. Better ships and improvements need more research and cost more Dust. See, it is the well known cycle you have to bear with. What makes it even more difficult sometimes are random events that can be a blessing but also a plague for the whole empire.\n\nHaving established yourself, there is room for more difficult tasks. First, acceptance. Planets, taxes and other effects influence your nation’s happiness. The higher the taxes, the higher the dust outcome. But who wants to pay taxes? People will likely start to get lazy and work less. It works the other way around too. Less taxes, more resources. Next task: luxury ressources. Once your scientists know how to deal with them, you gain the opportunity to build better ships, planetary improvements and use them as trading goods. Trading leads us to task 3, diplomacy. Venturing into the unknown will make you meet new friends. Or Foes. Fight or feed them? Living in peace means building trade routes for dust and science, luxury resources and even full researches. An alliance keeps your back when war is raging against You. But why even trading when there is the chance to OWN your friends starsystems?\n--------\n\nTalking about war makes it necessary to talk about the combat system. Since the whole game uses a  turn based system you might expect this happening for combat, too. It somewhat has “turns” but once your fleet started the battle, there is no way to stop nor influence it. Every battle is divided into 5 phases, were these are again divided into turns. Roughly Explained:  Remember turns as a term that got used in Baldur’s Gate where attacks and effects were happening in a specific amount of time? Take this, mix it with scissor-rock-papers referring to bullets, lasers and rockets and their defensive counterparts and add some tactical influence via abilities, used as “cards” ingame. These cards have to be chosen before the battle starts, thus forcing you to have a close look at your opponent. If you like battles à la Sins of a Solar Empire you will get disappointed. Fights in general last about 1 min if you choose to watch them and tend to look repetitive after a while. Still: Choosing the right weapons and armour can make your fleet win against even way stronger contenders.\n--------\n\nLet’s have a look at graphics and sound. Whilst the tactical overview tends to look spartanic, does a zoom make this game shine. Planets, Moons, Stars, everything looks nice and realistic and every faction looks unique in terms of ships. Although battles aren’t the most exciting part of the game, they still do have some nice explosions and fleet animations to offer. The UI can be overwhelming at the start but having played for 2-3 hours I already felt myself at home. To those complaining about it in other reviews: There is a tutorial that nicely shows and explains everything. My recommendation here: Take your time, read carefully. It is turn-based.\n\nThe soundtrack fits just perfectly into the setting of an unknown and unexplored galaxy. Sometimes thrilling, most of the time relaxing, I never stopped it while playing for hours.\n-------\n\nStory? Lore! It is everywhere in this game and it needs to be mentioned here. Every planet, every ship, research, hero, resource...every single fact comes with a nice and well written explanation and makes this game shine. Most of the facts are fictional though but still written in such a reasonable manner that one might want to look up a lexicon. Keep in mind: There is no single-player campaign, yet there is enough content to fill hundreds of hours if you choose to play every different faction. Everything happens in scenarios that can be set up before starting, like choosing difficulty, number of AIs, nations, single- or multiplayer. Multiplayer feels great and allows players from all over the world to play without having any ping-loss - the advantage of a turn-based game.\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\nPro\nTurn-Based 4x at it`s best - gotta manage them all!\nVarious factions to choose from, each with their own unique background story\nDozens of different planets, ships, researches, heroes and random events\nWonderful graphics that show details on ships, planets and star systems\nSatisfying diplomacy and trading\nRich fictional yet reasonable setting full of lore and text\nMultiplayer allows to form alliances with - or against - your friends\nChilling Soundtrack\nCon:\nOverwhelming start (Hint: Read the Tutorial!)\nCombat feels short, uncontrolled, even luck-depending sometimes and once you found the right answer for enemy ships, they are meat\nNo single-player campaign\nSummary:\nEndless Space. A game that uses the 4x in its description, roughly translated as explore, expand, exploit and for the sake of all: exterminate. Resource management, diplomacy, research and war, perfectly arranged for turn-based strategists who love to play at their own pace whilst planning for future turns.\n\nOne can not ignore that combat lacks the thrill other space strategy titles offer in exchange for strategical choices but graphics, depth and lore is what compensates and entertains for hours.\n\nMy personal verdict is 9.25 / 10","June 24, 2015","true","196.1"," 92 of 119 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","92","119","3","7"

I tried to love this game, I tried to overlook the bugs, but I can't, they are too obvious. It is a good game, but sometimes, I cannot tell if some of the stuff they have are supposed to be features or bugs. For example, enemies can move during MY turn. If I wanted my enemies to move at the same time as me, I would go back to Sins of a Solar Empire.\n\nBugs\nAnother frustrating thing is that my main fleet was trapped in a star system for X amount of turns because the AI, for whatever reason, decided to send 10 individual ships to that same system and set them on blockade mode. I can only kill 1 at a time so the chances of that fleet leaving on its own was close to zero, unless I mount a rescue.\n\nDiplomacy\nThe diplomacy is broken beyond believe. AIs often offer star systems and resources as part of their Cease Fire agreements. However, these agreements would be undone next turn, because the systems they surrendered contain the same resources in the agreement, so they have no more resources to pay me. Another thing that is annoying is that I do not understand why "create alliance", "cease fire" and such needed to be researched. When someone is beating your @$$, you would instinctively yell 'stop', not to these advance space beings apparently.\n\nTutorial\nThe tutorial is inadequate at best. After going through the whole tutorial, I still don't grasp the important points of the game such as battles and ship designs until I googled them. I figured the rest out because of my past experience with Alpha Centauri and Civ.\n\nAI\nThe AIs are dumb and overly aggressive. By 20-30 turns, my closest neighbour declared war on me for absolutely no reason at all. At least in AC or Civ, they would give you some sort of warning, but not Endless Space! It will f--k you when it feels like f--king you up, regardless of their capabilities. And they refuse to make peace when they just lost all their ships. Based on my reading on multiplayers, it seems that it is buggy as hell online as well. So this game doesn't have much going for it, since you can't play with the AIs and you can't play with other people.\n\nDifficulty\nIn Civ V, they have a nice range of difficulties, ranging from settler to deity (8 levels). In ES, they have something similar too. However, the problem is that the gaps between each is as wide as the Grand Canyon. Say, ES's normal is like Civ's Chieftain or Warlord, its hard mode is like Deity. So either the game is too easy for you to learn from, or it is so hard that you just can't survive past the 100th turn. I was either bored or frustrated.\n\nResearch\nRegardless of your fraction, you almost always research the same techs every time. Colonize planets, Enhances weapons, Make ships bigger, Enhances more weapons, Make ships even bigger, with the occasional resource unlocking, incoming increasing, happiness inducing tech here and there.\n\nVictory Warning\nWhile I appreciate the game for telling me that the AIs are winning, it doesn't need to start reminding me when they are only 10-20% complete toward certain victories. A even more ridiculous example is when I am at 60% completion, they warn me of this AI who is close to winning the game at 20%. Very helpful indeed.\n\nConclusion\nI paid around $15 in Nov of 2013 for both Endless Space and Disharmony. I want my money back and I am trying to save yours here. This game is great in the sense that it is like Alpha Centauri but on a galactic scale. It's like Civ 5 with levelable heroes. The management/production system is nice. But everything else is not. The concept is great but it is very poorly executed or maintained (based on my investigation, a lot of bugs seemed to stem from Disharmony).\n\nI have uninstalled this game after close to 100hours of play and it will take a major cleansing for me to reinstall it and give it another go. This game as it stands is worth $5 at best, anymore, you are getting ripped off. Spend your money elsewhere. Thanks for reading.\n\nUpdate/Sales\nJun.25, 2014 - currently at $7.49USD (75% off). Best discount I have seen since I bought the game. If this game interests you and you don't mind the bugs/features, then GO FOR IT quick. It is a good price.","March 10, 2014","false","92.3"," 574 of 880 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","574","880","2","45"

If you like the wide campaign part of strategy games you'll probably like it, but if you're interested in the battles you'll likely be disappiointed.  The map/campaign is great fun and very sleek, but the battles are basically a crapshoot.  You get 3 turns, a variety of abilities to use each turn, and they have a rock paper scissors quality.

Your best bet is to take your time and read the tooltips carefully. Almost EVERYTHING in the game has a tooltip of its own providing basic information and stats you can call on. If somethings unclear dont hesitate to try out stuff. Usually stuff "clicks" after a few turns.\n\nThe Ai follows the same rules as the human player but will receive bonuses to all kind of things depending on the difficulty level you select. Thats why I always suggest "newbie" or "easy" difficulty....no matter if you are a 4x veteran or not, those are the best difficulties to learn the ropes of the game.\n\nMake sure to check out map and advanced settings to create matches of your liking\n\nYour biggest priority at first will most likely be warfare. Be advised that Endless Space supports all kinds of different playstyles which can lead to victory. Pure defensive empires focusing on research and trade, warmongers crushing everything in their paths, scientists dominating the technological aspect, empire focus races growing like cancer (sorry for the pun) etc etc. I tried out so many different combinations already and I STILL find new ones I can enjoy and which challenge me in a different way.\n\nYou will always play maps versus 1-7 opponents and while the goal is always the same (dominate your oppponents and "win" the match) HOW you can achieve this varies drastically. Thats the replay factor which enabled me to pump so many hours into this game.\n\nVery polished UI and some of the best visuals for the genre make it stand out for me. The combat cinematics especially are able to entrance me. Immersion factor for me.....skyhigh.\n\nThere are so many factors in the game (planets, anomalies, technologies, diplomatic status and effects, invasions, ship designs, battle card system, traits, heroes etc etc) that it might take a while to find your way but its a very rewarding path. Once you understand and see certain synergies you wont notice how time flies past\n\nIn my experience the game runs very stable and the errors popping up can be easily fixed with a reload (which doesnt take long). Multiplayer matches do suffer from desynch errors frequently tho. That being said I consider it a single-player title.\n\n\nEndless Space might not be "the best" in any ONE department (AI, diplomacy, combat, infrastructure) but the combination/package of all things makes it THE best sci-fi 4x title for me personally.....highly recommended for the low prize.","August 26, 2014","true","422.3"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","41","46","2","3"

It is a double edged sword. The battles are simplistic and often a crapshoot, but inspecting your enemies capabilities and employing the right cards goes a long way to winning a battle, even if most of them are countered. The tactical combat also keeps the pace of the game up and helps you understand what happens if you skip manual combat.\n\nIn more complex tactical battles in 4X games (e.g. Fallen Enchantress, AoW3), you never want to use auto-combat because the game will arbitrarily kill off units when you know you would never lose them in manual mode, so you end up going through the tedious process of a turned based tactical engagement in a one-sided fight just to make sure you can keep a veteran unit. Endless Space battles, while not nearly as complex, leave you the option to auto-resolve battles with confidence, which saves a lot of time while doing battles with an overpowering force - which in my experience encompass the majority of battles in 4X games. Icing on the cake; sometimes manual combat in Endless Space is worth it just because you want to actually  *see* your new fleet/commander/ship design make your enemy explode.\n\nLong and short - plenty of reviews cover the simplistic tactical combat, even though it is more complex than Civilization V. If we take the tactical combat out of the equation, Endless Space is a near-perfect 4X game. You can design ships, empire management is meticulous, and there are many ways to win. If we do add in tactical combat, I'd rather be playing Total War, but I'm not always in the mood, nor do I have that kind of time. 3π/10.","October 25, 2014","true","54.4"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","45","55","2","0"

You can do whatever you wish, kill your enemies, buy them pretty much, culturally assimilate them, become the cancer of galactic population, research science, explore, terraform, and create a vast endless empire of galactic fear and sovereignty.\n\nI found this game fun because the turn based aspect did not make gameplay fast paced, and twitch oriented, and where APM (actions per minute) is not a defining feature of victory.

I don't think I got much fun out of it until the 20th hour or so.\n\nThe tutorial doesn't help, it's just a series of much too detailed non-interactive screens, which just make you want to say TLDR. Do I really need to read everything about super advanced diplomacy features on my 1st turn in the game?\n\nThe game interface is extremely well designed. It's beautiful, practical, both easy to navigate and feature-rich, has all the info you need where it needs to be. This game should be an example for all other strategy game devs out there.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful too, full of eye candy grade galaxies, planets and spaceships, different designs for each faction.\n\nThe management phase is the biggest success, and the most interesting to play. There are 4 base components (money, science, food, production), Each planet you colonize provides a mix of those depending on their type and the improvements you build. There are also 16 different luxury ressources + a bunch of rare metals, that provide you different benefits. You can also trade ressources as well as make other diplomatic agreements with other factions.\n\nThe research is divided into 4 different trees (military, diplomatic/financial, terraforming/space travel and production/science) in a clever way that will need you to think carefully about your future planning.\n\n\nThe combat phase, unfortunately, is a bit less interesting. A lot of players have described this is nothing but a game of rock, scissors and papers. In reality it is a bit more complicated but in essence it's correct.\n\nYou do not have full control over your ships like in similar strategy games. All you do is watch the battle unfold as you play up to 3 cards. You start the game with 8-ish cards to choose from but advance techs and heroes allow you to unlock many more.\n\nWhere it does get really more complicated then just Rock Scissor Papers is that each card, in addition to countering certain type of cards, and being countered by some others, also provide your ships with specific advantages, so by studying your opponents stats and making the wise choices, it's a little more tactical than it seems when you first play.\n\nBut yet, it's frustrating that the battles are just a show with not much user input. How you build your ships, group them into fleets, and which admirals you assign to them is the most important part in winning a battle, the card phase only changes the odds in a very minor way.\n\nOverall I still recommend this game, for trying to innovate with the space 4x genre, the quality of the interface, the infinite varieties of customization, and the overall adictive fun that it provides, despite the slow pace and the dissapointing space combat.","December 14, 2014","true","82.4"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","37","47","0","0"

As a 4X game, it succeeds and holds its own well.  The AI works the systems and the difficulties scale well as you learn the game.  If turn-based, steep learning curve games don't scare you then you should at least put this on your Wishlist.\n\nBefore giving up in frustration, there are some key mechanics to understand.\n\nCombat - You choose 'cards' in each of three combat phases, and set formations and tactics before starting the fight.  If you choose to 'Auto' the battle, it plays out exactly as it would if you were watching but without being able to shift your card selection.  Sitting through the fight in 'Manual' lets you see the destruction and alter your selected card for the next phase if you want to.  The cards can counter opponent cards and/or simply provide combat bonuses.  Combat mechanics aren't clearly described and can be confusing - the most important aspect is the relationship between ship size, defense, and weapon damage.  Late game AI ship builds will push you to have a good understanding of how to defeat them mechanically.\n\nShip builds - Ship building is fairly tame and comes down to adding categories of stats.  Ship builds generally stick to themes - the "Tank", the "Glass Cannon", and the "Planet Destroyer".  Trying to create balanced ships early in the game can work, but later they become a liability and it's better to shift to a strategy that involves either making a lot of small glass cannons or a massive tank backed by serious firepower.  Space limitations in each of the 6 chassis types means ships never get insane statistics on their own.\n\nGrowth - Colonization is key to conquest and can be tricky to understand at first.  It can be hard to balance happiness, taxes, and production - but with a few key techs it's easy to shift into overdrive and expand as quickly as the AI does.  The combat and conquest does suffer from grinding, especially later in the game, but that seems a common theme is in every 4X game and is expected.\n\nOverall, this is a worthwhile 4X strategy title and is recommended for lovers of the genre.","November 17, 2015","true","36.0"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

Endless Space sounds like the prime candidate; imaginative (enough) races, customizable starships, plenty of special resources and random events... But it falls short on almost every aspect.\n\nThe first problem is that I don't feel connected to anything that I'm doing. In Master of Orion 2, the planet view had all of the planet's populace was represented by tiny members of your race that you could drag from one task to another. It's strange how such a small UI feature immediately tells you that you're playing Trilarians, Psilons or Darloks. In Endless Space, there are these simple "meeples" that bear a striking semblance to a piece on a board game. There are no tasks. Instead, each unit of population produces an equal amount of everything, determined by the improvements in the star system. Yep. There aren't many planet-specific buildings; exploitation (which roughly means the primary focus of a planet), terraforming, moon exploration and negative anomaly elimination. Still, as far as I can tell, they go into the same system-wide production queue.\n\nThe next problem is the special resources. They're not really that special. All they really do is add a bonus to one of the basic four resources (food, industry, dust and science). If you have 4 of them, you'll get an empire-wide bonus that varies from +20% industry to leader experience gains. That is the luxury resourced. Strategic resources are even less exciting. More advanced ship modules require one of the eight strategic resource. Just having one is enough, but having more lowers the cost of said module. Again, having 4 grants a bonus, but it's just a more dramatic cost reduction.\n\nNext in line is the ship design. The way combat works in Endless Space is that there are 3 types of weapons, namely kinetic, beam and missile. They can also be adjusted for 3 different ranges, long, medium and melee, but each weapon type can only be set to one range. So you can't have kinetic weapons for long and medium range, for example. The second biggest problem is there are only 4 levels of each weapon, and that's it. The same is true for all modules, mind you. Everything is just a flat numeric upgrade. To make things even more confusing, there are a few different sizes of hulls, and each seems to have 2 different designs. Why? Because, for some inexplicable reason, the devs decided that it would be a good idea to have capacity modifiers for certain types of modules, such as +25% weight for defense modules and -50% weight for weapon modules. If only you were able to choose those modifiers...\n\nBut the worst part of it is how it plays out in combat. For someone who's used to thinking every fight through in Master of Orion 2, Endless Space is a nightmare. When the combat starts, you have two options; manual or automatic combat, but they really have no mechanical difference. "Manual" might as well be called cinematic, because it's just an animated representation of the automated combat. The only thing you can control is the maneuvers you can do at each range, long, medium and melee. At a point where most of my systems are hitting level 3 I have about 10 of them in total (though there are a few that you can research, and leaders can give some). All ranges have the same options. What makes things even more annoying is that pretty much all cards affect 3 things, and they not-so-subtly prod the player in a specific direction. So what really happens when you engage in combat is that you study the strengths and weaknesses of each fleet, choose the cards that play into your advantages and and gives the least advantage to your enemy at each range... and that's it. You can either watch the fight unfold, or skip it. Either way, you can't control anything else.\n\nIt might sound tactical, but in the long (or short, if we're being completely frank) run squinting at numbers loses its luster as well. Surprisingly enough, it does feel satisfied when you beat the odds because you chose your cards wisely, but even that becomes a chore. And this shouldn't even be a complaint, but the enemy learns from its mistakes, and to play into the weaknesses of a consistent strategy. So basically you have to scrutinize every ship in fleets that keep getting larger and larger so that you don't get taken by surprise. And you might have to keep changing your ships' design as well to keep the enemy from exploiting a specific design.\n\nCombine it with an irrational AI that keeps attacking your explorers (because the game starts with everyone at war with one another), and then doesn't want peace because they don't consider you trustworthy, and you're going to face a lot of combat. Even on easy difficulty level, enemy ships just keep pouring in from every which way. And it's not like they're going to attack your fleets either. No, they're always heading for the undefended systems, so you'll spend a lot of time chasing fleets that are rampaging in your territory. And when I say "every which way", I mean it. There are star lanes and wormholes in the game, but they restrict movement only in the early game. Later on, you can just ignore them.\n\nThere's a whole slew of other issues as well. The fact that the tutorials explain only the barest of basics in a few screens, while leaving the in-depth stuff (relatively speaking) is left for the wiki. Diplomacy is really bare-bones. Making deals is clear enough and offers a decent selection of offers, but again, the AI is just an inanimate cardboard cutout that barely says anything at all. It's also really difficult to understand what makes a specific AI tick.\n\nSo, to wrap things up, when I'm playing this game, I don't feel like a conqueror of space. I feel like a bureaucrat.","May 28, 2015","false","27.4"," 53 of 76 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","53","76","4","0"

But that in itself isn't a fully accurate description. Let's get to the meat, shall we?\n\n\nWhen I first started the game on my Netbook, I noticed how nice the graphics were and how it ran relatively smoothly on the Medium settings (It ran on High settings relatively well on my Mac) only slowing down in the late game when hundreds of fleet movements had to be rendered and checked. The game has only crashed once or twice, and that was mostly because I messed with a few game files while running the game.\n\nPerformance- 8.5/10\n\n\nAs mentioned previously mentioned, the graphics were very impressive. From the Character designs, Ship designs, Menu designs, Planet designs, the game has a very clean and polished look and has Lore related artwork that really makes the game a much better experience. I found myself taking screenshots of planets and systems as they were simply amazing. Wonders, Cities and Anomalies are rendered on the planets themselves, thus giving direct visual feedback to the user.\nOne critique relating to the graphics was the lack of variation in city aesthetics and a lack of visual feedback given when a Planet's exploitation changed.\n\nGraphics- 9.25/10\n\n\nThe soundtrack is what is to be expected from a Space themed game and has shining moments, especially the more ambient tracks, but nothing as spectacular as the theme from Star Wars for example. Still has it's good moments, but if you're sitting there for long periods of time, the soundtrack may get repetitive.\n\nSound- 8/10\n\n\nThe AI is interesting to say the least, at lower difficulties, it is hilariously icompetent, rarely making me run for the hills, but at higher tiers (especially Endless) the very nature of the spontaneously insane AI can get the best of you. It is important to note that some bugs exist (or maybe they were intentional, I can't tell) in the AIs interactions. Especially related to Wars and Cease Fires, as the AI may simply beg for mercy after losing a System before continuing on their blood thirsty rampage through your worlds. Overall, the AI is quite solid, albeit if you want a challenge, aim for the higher difficulties.\n\nAI- 6.5/10\n\n\nCombat is something that is often criticized in reviews of Endless Space, but I found it somewhat unique and I appreciated that the devs put it in. Even though it is essentially a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, it's still a slightly more complex Rock-Paper-Scissors. The combat system involves 2 fleets fighting each other and playing different "Battle Cards" (you can unlock more via the Tech Tree or through Heroes that you equip to your fleet) and in the Disharmony DLC, also includes specific targetting (such as the Nosebreaker tactic which involves you focusing on the emey's main ship)\nWhile Battle Cards will cancel each other out and play a pivotal role in the combat, you will have to equip your Fleets with weapons as well.\n\nShips can be equipped with 3 Attack "Modules" and 3 Defense "Modules". The 3 Attack Modules are-\n\nMissiles (Long Range combat)\nLasers (Medium Range combat)\nKinetic (Short/Melee Range combat)\n\nand the 3 Defense Modules are-\n\nFlak (Counters Missiles)\nShields (Counters Lasers)\nDeflectors (Counters Kinetic)\n\nEvery time a Module is added, it adds an extra Missile/Laser/Kinetic attack or defense capability. A battle will involve either an Automatically decided outcome, or a Manual Cutscene (in which you can still adjust your plans in Real Time). A battle has 5 phases (Intro, Long, Medium, Melee, Conclusion) of which 3 are the times when the ships fire at each other (Long, Medium and Melee of course). Ships will fire all the weapons during each phase, but some weapons will be more effective during their respective phases.\n\nDuring a battle, (if you own the Disharmony DLC) you will also have the option of adding Fighters and Bombers which add to the way combat plays out by giving/taking away an advantage. In the end, I enjoyed the combat and as with me taking Planetary screenshots, I did the same for the Battle sequences.\n\nCombat- 7.75/10\n\nMultiplayer is quite enjoyable as you can play with up to 8 people in a private or public lobby and have the option of using Custom Races or the Pre-made ones. In-game chat is available, but not Private Player-to-Player chat (I'd recommend Steam Chat). While it's not uncommon to find a Public game, ES is best played with friends. There are several sync and disconnection issues that occur once in awhile, but they are rare adn usually require a quick reload of the save.\n\nMultiplayer- 7.5/10\n\n\nVictory can be obtained through both peaceful and non-peacful routes and give every race a fighting chance at victory.\n\nRoutes to Victory- 10/10\n\n\nModding is almost non-existant in this game, so don't buy it if you expect mods (though it would be great if you knew how to program xD). I haven't divided into modding myself, but it's quite sad that the mod scene is minimal at best\n\nModding- 1/10\n\n\nI will keep updating this review on Diplomacy, etc. at a later date :)","July 21, 2014","true","147.7"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","1"

You can play in a randomly generated galaxy, the size of your own choosing, with up to 8 opponent empires. Endless Space also allows for full modding and multiplayer capability.\n\nThere are several stock empires ready for you to play as, or you can choose to create your own. You start in your capital system and then must explore nearby systems, colonize new planets, research and unlock new technologies, locate strategic resources to upgrade and more. As turn-based games go, this game was a lot of fun. I spent Five hours playing and ended up not getting much done in the way of review writing yesterday. The Space combat portion of the game, involves a different type of combat. Other reviews and game analysis have referred to it as akin to Rock-Paper-Scissors, and I think that is a pretty valid observation. Of course you can always allow the computer to auto-resolve the conflict, in which case the game takes into account the type and strength of ships involved in the conflict and randomly generates an outcome.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed Endless Space - Emperor Edition and may go out on the web to look for player-created Mods to make the game more challenging.

I like strategy games in general and 4x in particular, but there are just too many little nig-gles [stupid profanity filter] that turn it (overall) into something largely unfun. I could write a detailed analysis of everything, but tons of people have done that already. So... here's a little list of turn-offs that, if they bother you, you should leave this game alone.\n\n1. The AI cheats. A lot. Shunt up the difficulty, and it doesn't even bother to hide it, just straight-up in-yo-face BS.\n\n2. Limited replayability. I'm sure purists will disagree, but despite the attempt to give each faction a different feel, overall I felt that the game just plays the sameish way every time.\n\n3. Horrible, horrible, *HORRIBLE* achievements. If you're a 100%'er, do NOT pick this one up.\n\n4. A number of (imo) bad design decisions. I won't get into all the details, but the absolute worst (again, imo) is the "simultaneous turns" idea. Yes. Very fair. I can totally operate m&k as fast as my computer processes the AI's turns. PTFO. You can barely select a fleet before the AI moves ALL it's fleets and takes their actions.\n\n5. Poor diplomatic system. Too far behind, get attacked because you're weak. Too far ahead, get ganged up on because you're too strong. Maintain some sort of rough equality, and your idiot allies will drag you into stupid wars where either a) you don't support them, so they get eaten and your enemies get stronger; or b) you DO support them, and you have to cover their backs as well as your own, and then they turn on you because your fleet build up has pushed you from a non-threatening to an aggressive stance. Don't count on winning diplomatic victories unless it's the kind of I-got-all-the-guns-and-power sort of diplomacy. This game's "diplomacy" can die in a fire.","May 14, 2015","false","154.8"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","28","40","0","5"

They’re so-called for their emphasis on four key gameplay elements: explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate. Endless Space is aptly named, because you’re responsible for shepherding a spacefaring civilization into the stars.\n\nBesides expanding the borders of your civilization (with several unique races to choose from), you need to learn how to adapt to new planetary environments, manage relationships with other races, and handle the continued development of your own species. A four-branch tree of very different technologies, each focal point of which helps you direct your race’s development, either into exploration, applied sciences, warfare, or diplomacy and trade.\n\nAs your technology improves, so will your adaptability to the environments of different worlds you discover. You’ll also need to assimilate resources to grow. The four basic resources managed in Endless Space are Food, Industry, Dust, and Science (FIDS for short, an acronym you see pop up from time to time), and you can direct your civilization’s management of those resources on a colony-by-colony basis.\n\nDust is the “currency” of Endless Space, the gold bullion that greases the wheels of commerce, simplifies the development of technology, facilitates trade and commerce with your neighbors, and more. The uses for Dust are a bit of a wildcard, unlocked as you get further and further into the game.\n\nA growing interstellar civilization demands a fleet of vessels to manage exploration, expansion, trade, and defense. Fleet creation and development is an important component of the game. You can customize your vessels with a tremendous amount of detail depending on your needs and the state of your development.\n\nInevitably the expansion of a civilization’s borders creates friction for its neighbors, and in Endless Space you have control over how that friction occurs. Each of the eight playable races has a base disposition either using diplomacy and trade as your tool or, let loose the dogs of war. Combat in Endless Space is more football coach than player: You issue fleet commands to direct your ships in the two-minute skirmishes that follow. But like the coach of a football game, you can’t control the players on the field directly.\n\nEvery time you play, Endless Space produces a new galaxy to explore, so there’s endless replay value here. You can adjust the parameters of the galaxy extensively (though not endlessly) and you can customize the race you want to play. This leads to some daunting moments for the new player, but the reward is constant challenge no matter how many times you play.\n\nEndless Space is lovely to look at and sounds great too thanks to an electronic soundtrack which fits the stark beauty of the outer space visuals. The galaxy is your sandbox, and you will get immersed for hours, days, weeks at a time. If games like Master of Orion or Civilization appeal to you, there’s a lot to love in Endless Space.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 1, 2014","true","88.8"," 40 of 62 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","40","62","0","0"

(I almost did that) It takes a bit of learning... (probably not unlike the VERY first time you tried Civilization) But it's worth giving it a full playthrough as a race and then trying again with the same one. Once you get the basics, swap to another race and prepare for a whole new game. Each race has different perks and some have different improvements (not unlike Civ). But the best part is that the tech tree is slightly different for each race to capitalize on those perks.\n\nFor example, one race has a buyout bonus. Then through research they can gain money (dust) by killing enemy ships and build unique improvemnts that rake in cash. Then you can basically not worry about long build times because you can just buy everything in one turn!\n\nThe diplomatic system can be frustrating at times... not being able to declare war for a certain number of turns after a ceasefire or peace agreement. But the "Cold war" aspect is pretty neat.  Another drawback is that sometimes the AI will make stupid decisions. "Sure i'll give you the REST of my planets for a ceasefire..." or "I'm about to capture half of your planets in the next turn but ok... I'll accept this ceasefire for nothing in return."\n\nThe battles can be repetitive, but you also don't need to watch em...(there's an auto button that skips straight to the outcome... takes 3 seconds) And it's fun to watch the battles that you deem worthy. Watching 15v15 is almost as cool as watching 4v4 with capital ships!\n\nIn sum, it's a great game... give it more than just one shot. If anything it'll give you something to look forward to in the upcoming sequel!\n\n","May 19","true","384.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","18","24","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reshiram/recommended/208140/","Reshiram","Asriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reshiram/","134 products in account","I gravitated towards this game after playing Sins of a Solar Empire for a while.  I enjoyed the aspect of it feeling like a 4X game (Civ was a want at the time, but I didn't want to pony up 50$+ for a game that I was unsure of), while still feeling vaguely familiar.\n\nAfter playing Civ5 after this game, I can say that this is probably one of the FASTER 4X's on the market.  Games like Civ will take ages just to get yourself to any reasonable point in the game even on the fastest available mode, research and expansion-wise, whereas this game you can effectively start and finish a game in a few casual nights on the fastest speed.\n\nAnother perk of the game is just how beautiful the fight cinematics are.  Though most players, especially in multi-player, will skip these because of time constraints.  But the general presentation of the game is incredibly clean, things are for the most part explained out through hover-over text (Why is my approval rating so low?  Here's a list of every positive and negative affect on it within this system!), but there are its flaws here and there with this.  Some newer features haven't been polished up as much as the base game, but that's overlookable since everything functions just right.\n\nSpeaking of fighting, that brings me to another irk.  The AI can be incredibly stubborn regarding fleets, and the mechanics of the game can be bothersome as well.  Case in point: If you have a large fleet in enemy territory, a single scout ship can pin down the entire fleet and prevent it from doing anything unless you formally declare war on them.  And in turn, declaring war opens up your borders to their ships and doing the same to you.  So you can't attack a single piddly ship, nor can you get away from it, unless you either make peace or throw down the hatchet.\n\nResources in the game are fairly well presented.  The game bases around FIDS; Food, Industry, Dust, Science.  Every planet can produce some of these, and improvements can further add onto these numbers for a total at the top of every system.  Another fine thing is that each system is pretty much independent of each other, aside from a few exceptions of endless temples, wonders, and luxury resources.  But these are worded differently and imply that they are empire-wide instead of just in system.  So a rebellious and angry system doesn't drag down everybody else, but you can feel it as a whole in regards to your Dust rates.  Managing your empire is tough at times, but it's not improbable unless you make some terrible decisions early on (expanding too fast, hiking the taxes up to insane amounts for no legitimate reason, etc.) or end up getting assaulted by a warmonger later on with not enough ships available.\n\nDiplomacy is very well presented, showing your faction vs. everybody else's faction, along with every other faction displaying their current status with other players (Alliance, Peace, Cold War, and War) but there's not much else to it.  Trading tech, making deals, and what-not.  Basic stuff, nothing too insane.\n\nThe way the military system is presented is interesting.  Fleets cost dust to maintain, and fleets can only be so big, based on your current tech and starting perks.  Some of the science-based factions take smaller fleet perks, since they don't look to win by kicking everybody in the pants.  The one issue I have with the game is that it doesn't take into proper account fighters into the attack power strength, which can be incredibly overpowering at times as they don't really have anything to counteract them via battle cards.  Could be an interesting addition to the combat tree, if you know the enemy is using figs.\n\nA great game, worthwhile to give a play if you're growing tired of traditional 4X games taking a week of dedicated play to finish, and are looking for something small and fast to play in bite sized pieces.  I know most people gripe about balance, but when the game's randomly generated like this, there's obviously going to be a little luck involved.  But a good player should be able to counteract things and use their beginning to their advantage as best they can.","December 17, 2014","true","122.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

I've been playing it since alpha and have to admit that it's a sort of a mixed blessing. Let me list all the pros and cons as I see it to give you a better picture.\n\nPROS: Solid graphics with fantasticly detailed awesome planet textures, neat art style, memorable and diverse races, clean and slick UI, some of the core game systems, e.g. the FIDS concept (Food, Industry, Dust, Science), research trees are quite the beasts with many interesting techs.\nMIXED: Battle system is controversial. Player has a limited input on the battles - no direct control over ships, just cards (actions), formations and targeting. I don't mind the concept as a whole and it got better with the Disharmony addon, but  there's for improvement IMO. Heroes are also in the so-so category, their ability trees are dull and not diverse enough although I like the concept. Events are cool but too few and not detailed enough to my taste.\nCONS: Diplomacy is weak in its current form + you have to research even the most basic types of interactions which really hurts multiplayer, espionage is basicly non-existant. Fast early expansion aka system grabbing is still the best strategy for most races, the penalties are not strong enough to encourage alternative strategies in most cases.\n\nEven with many negatives I consider Endless Space to be one of the better 4X strategies of the last years. It lacks depth as a single-player experience IMO, most game systems are too straightforward and multiplayer has plenty problems of its own. Still, if you dig the genre and don't expect ES to be the best 4X strategy ever you might sink couple hundred hours into it not without pleasure.","July 28, 2013","true","171.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","3"

The streamlined interface, and the deceptively complex micromanagement make this game compelling and intuitive from the first turn to the last. Several design decisions may seem awkward at first, such as the movement phase not actually ocurring between any singular turn but at any point during anyone's turn. However, this minor decision and many like it (I.E. starting in a "cold war" instead of peace with newly met factions) add quite a lot of depth and decision making to a genre that normally severely lacks, in both departments, even though it thrives on each. This is ESPECIALLY true in multiplayer. While the AI is quite good on higher difficulties, nothing beats the chess standoffs that can occur in the functional (surprise! Multiplayer in a 4X game that works!) and fun 8 player galaxy spanning matches.\n\nDon't even get me started on the sound design. The music is top notch and I recommend any fan of ambient yet groovin jams to actually purchase the OST for this game. Music aside even, the little boops and blips as you navigate through the menus are satisfying and even gratifying, I personally dig the "you completed a research" jingle.\n\nEvery game has it's faults, though.\n\nThe space battles, however, lack in the sound department. The guns and lasers and explosions just don't have that "oomf" you'd expect. It's strange when pressing an "ok" button makes a more satisfying sound than having your fleet blow up a moon sized battlecruiser with space lasers.\n\nThe combat, also, I feel lacks a bit. Everything is automated with battle cards being selected. Where some counter others and have certain effects on your ships. While you can design your own ships in terms of the modules that they contain, the ships don't end up all being too dissimilar from eachother. This does work within the formula of the game, and I'm sure the inclusion of multiplayer might have something to do with it, but I would have preferred a turn based tactical battlescape ala Master of Orion 2.\n\nThe Disharmony expansion is also a must. Not because the new race is particularly cool, (Neat concept, very difficult to play as.) but because there are many minor tweaks that have been performed throughout the game, from UI changes to ship design and tech tree additions. It somehow makes the game even MORE polished.\n\nSpeaking of polish, I don't think I'd encountered a single bug in my play time with this game. It's almost eerie.\n\nSo yeah.

It's simple, it's easy to get into and mainly provides a power fantasy kind of experience. If you're looking for a Master of Orion's depth, you won't find it here. It's a good thing and a bad thing at the same time. It's a fun 4X lite, it's really a neat looking and seeing your empire expand is just worth your time. To a certain moment. Where you realise that no matter what race do you play and what kind of victory condition(s) you choose, you play the same all the time every time.\nIt might look it's diverse and complex, but it is not. Despite of trials to give an every race its own characteristic it all boils down to few starting conditions and quickly don't matter. They're just +% this -% that. No matter which race do you play, you will research the same science trees. It doesn't matter if you're bravely expanding communism into space as a mighty Soviet Space Republic or vegetating as concious crystals. Everyone needs the same bonuses and supermarkets! Of course there are few exceptions in the research, but again they boil down into +/-%. You could count Harmony out, which doesn't use dust at all, but it really doesn't feel or plays much different than any other race. After 100 or so turns you will hate menaging your systems building the same upgrades over and over again. You will hate stubborn AI with dozens of 1 ship fleets attacking you and taking your time to click in an unnecessary combat window.\nThe combat is severely lacking. Ship building boils down to 3 types of weaponry, 3 additional modules (infrantry and aircraft) and some % bonuses. Yeah, sure, visualisations of battles are really nice and fun to watch sometimes, but the rock/paper/scissors card mechanic just sucks and is too RNG based.\nThe AI doesn't help. Of course I played only to a high difficulty, but the AI acts the same all the time. One empire will expand immensely, the rest will vegetate in few systems. Every empire will build a ♥♥♥♥-tons of same ships often with 1 and only weapon type you will counter. And AI won't react to your ship designs, producing dozens of fleets with no protection againts your most used weaponry.\nEmpire management is better and really fun - as said above - but it grows old very fast due its simplicity. Again - it boils down to unifying all your planets to your race's habitat as soon as it's possible for the best population and production % bonueses. It's is entertaining until you research necessary technologies to transform your planets and mine/acquire a ♥♥♥♥♥on of strategic minerals and goods. From some point - it's just zerging your enemy turn after turn, not caring about anything - pirates are no threat after 20 or so turns.\nDiplomacy is non existant and - again - boils down to war/peace and trade agreements/alliance. There is no espionage at all, there are no specific race behaviour (only amoeba doesn't seem to declare war at all).\nThe game drops in efficiency after 100 or so turns making it to play annoying. The lag after your mouse clicks is sometimes 5 seconds long.\n\nIt's not bad, but it's not great either. I will surely come back to it after a while.","December 14, 2014","true","63.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The X it lacks, is eXtermination. Technology research, colony management, exploration, and spaceship design are all comparable to other space 4X games. You don't really know what is missing until you start fighting with the other races. There is absolutely no way to win consistently in space combat because battles are basically just a comparison of fleet size and strength with some modifiers thrown in based on the results of a pre-combat game of paper, rock, scissors. Forget all the other 4X games out there where you can command individual units and beat the enemy fleet with strategy and tactics. You pretty much just pick 3 tactics from a list and then passively watch the battle happen.\nThe computer is an amazing empire manager, so even on normal difficulty, you will find yourself at a distinct disadvantage in terms of technology and military strength when you encounter the enemy races. Once the galaxy gets divided up, wars are slow, boring, and repetitious processes of attrition. The end result is a game where any way the human player can gain an advantage by using their brain has been removed.","January 3","false","9.2"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","33","55","3","3"

It starts off with fairly amazing graphics, however, things quickly go downhill. The whole combat system is essentially pick a card by making an educated guess about what card the computer picked... and then you get to watch a 30 sec encounter of the ships shooting at eachother. After maye the first dozen fights these become increasingly painful to watch as you realize that if you wanted to watch a movie you have no control over netflix is probably the cheaper and better option. Essentially all of the combat and strategy are done in what you research and how you equip your ships (kindof cool for the 2 minutes it takes) of course by the late game it doesn't really matter what you do equipping wise as all ships are essentially paper airplanes flying around with nukes. (whoever has the most ships wins)... I'm going to quit writing before I get to the completely happiness (you have very very little control over) based economy as this much anger is unhealthy.\n\nTLDR; Deceptively disappointing game.

If you played Endless Legend, you'll find many things (especially the interface) very familiar. If you can, buy the Gold edition with the Disharmony DLC!\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful graphics; every planet and every anomaly has its own awesome visual. And space fights look gorgeous as well\n\n+ very clean interface, you normally find all information you need directly on screen or they are at max 1 click away\n\n+ very different species with different playstyles; not only will you have technologies that only you can research but also faction traits that require different playstyles. A war driven species won't bloom with diplomacy only. You can create a fraction with your own selection of boni and mali by yourself (though always using the ship design of an existing faction)\n\n+ planets and systems that basically become available over time; At first you can only populate very basic and life friendly planet types (like Terran, Ocean, Jungle). Through research you are able to populate lava planets, gas giants or even asteroids. But you always have to keep  in mind the happiness of the population. Just putting ppl on a lava planet because it will give you a lot of production won't work because your happiness will go down and decrease productivity. So you need buildings to compensate that or be lucky to have some anomaly or luxury resource that produces happiness in that system.\n\n+ the battle system; while some ppl hate it, I think it is a nice new idea over the old Civ like "Strenght X vs. Strength Y, so both Units get A and B damage"; first you have to design your ships with modules you have researched (no visual editing though). Each ship can carry a certain tonnage but may have a bonus regarding certain modules. While a bit overwhelming at the beginning it is quite easy (and fast) to do later while you can put of lot of time crunching numbers in it, if you really want. There are no things like firing arcs just basically how much of each weapon (3 types), defenses (for each of the 3 types) and other modules do you want on your ship. Your normal battle ship will have about 2/3 weapons and 1/3 defenses so nothing to worry about if you don't like designing ships. But it is a very tacital element of the game because you can hard counter enemies who focus e.g. on rockets by just using flaks (defense against rockets) and use the rest of the tonnage for weapons. After that you have to put your ships into fleets (each battle is 1 fleet vs. one other fleet) which have limited size but can be increased with technology. The battles themselves are divided into 3 phases: Long Range (rockets will do most damage), mid range (beam weapons are most effective) and close range (fire the ballistic weapons!). During each of these phases both players can use a certain tactic with various boni (e.g. +20% on beam damage or defense). Each tactic can be countered by an other tactic (nullifying its effect) of the enemy which gives the battles another nice tactical layer. While some ppl complain that this is pure luck, I think that it is just the reality of war tactics. Also if your enemy uses e.g. mainly rockets you may have an idea of the tactics he will use. And that also does not mean that a small army can completely annihilate a huge army just by using a "lucky" tactic.\n\n+ technology tree; there are basically 4 of them roughly focusing on warfare, diplomacy, expansion and science. While you normally do research in all of them (as the technologies get more expensive later on you will naturally research the cheap technologies in the other 3 trees before researching an expensive one in your favorite tree), it will give you an interesting way of focusing your empire on a certain thing. Your enemy may have a blooming economy but if you can get more advanced weapons faster than him, you will get a nice advantage in warfare.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- lack of late game buildings;  sometimes I have the feeling there is barely anything to build on your main systems in the late game except for more ships (or convert production into money or science) as there is not much to build. Many buildings focus on giving you more food on planets that normally produce barely any food and thus allowing for a faster growth but normally most of your systems are maxed out on population by then anyway (but there are exceptions!). In games like Civ, that normally happens more in the mid game where you are doing a lot of war anyway and you always have new wonders to race for.\n\n- no allied victory; while you can do alliances with your friends, there is always only one winner at the end of the game. Of course you can just stop playing when you annihilate all other enemies but that does not feel the same. And for e.g. the science victory you can't work together\n\n- ship design may be a bit confusing at the beginning; but there are plenty of wikis/forums/videos to help with that.","August 31, 2015","true","41.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This comes through voting (and with Emperor Edition your votes have bigger gravitas, apparently - I haven't tried it myself though). I'm pretty certain this helps with game's balance and also shows in the well designed UI which never let me down (you can easily find info you need and execute orders you want).\n\nWell, maybe it's somewhat hard to keep track of enemy fleets and their movement, especially that even if it is turn based, the turns are simultaneous, and you can't zoom out far enough to have eagle eye view of the entire galaxy, but this is somewhat alleviated by the fact that if you do see them, it means you or they are close and the intentions of fleets are pretty clear.\n\nAs far as 4X space strategies go, this game seems pretty standard and relatively not complicated. This is probably another outcome of quasi-communal design, I'd have to track its history to be certain. But I don't mean this as a bad thing - if anything, this lends itself to the final polish, letting the game stay focused on what it is trying to do. It still does some things its own way obviously, especially interesting feature are heroes who improve efficiency of your colonies or fleets if assigned a post and level up increasing their abilities.\n\nThis relatively not complicated approach also means it is a good place to start your adventure with the genre, if you're curious. The learning curve here is not as notoriously steep as usual in such titles (doesn't mean it isn't steep at all, though). And if you already are familiar with the genre you'll feel right at home and still get kicks from figuring out how the things work this time around.","July 27, 2013","true","240.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

' close to Orion, but not quite '...\n\nFor an indie production value however, this game shows remarkable efforts put to the overall artistic eye candy, for probably the best looking game of the genre at its release. Micromanagement exhibits several similarities with MoO and various clones, decent throughout but space combat remains shallow despite what the developers wanted to bring with their card system ( long/medium/short range ). Ship design could have been more flexible, few customisable options buried within an unintuitive user interface. Though the AI performs surprisingly well at a strategic level, signs of coding flaws at some tactical level like invasion or ship upgrades offset ( a bit ) an otherwise challenging game even for experienced players. It may be intentional or not, yet the game has a plethora of hidden features and buried formulae that even a ' galactic pedia' from AAA games couldn't cover entirely.\n\nPros: artistic direction; galactic settings; strategic planning; rightly paced micromanagemnt; some specific factions coerce the player to rethink whole new strategy and ways to expand ( namely Harmony, Cravers ); soothing audio track.\n\nMixed bag: AI ( like the vast majority of strategy games anyway ).\n\nCons: generic combat system; user interface ( many fonts too small also ); ship design needs more work; too many ways to win FOR the few ones that really matter for both AI and player; lack of some value to colonizing & terraforming ( untapped potential here ).\n\nBottom line: recommended to hardcore fans of the genre.","February 10, 2014","true","121.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It offers a ton of replayability with custom races and in depth ship design. Combat is shallow and the planetary invasion mechanic is a bit much to handle at first. After a playthrough or two you can easily get the hang of all of it. I would highly recomend it.\n\nPre-face:\nBefore this game I thought 4X was dead, I thought we would never see something quite match the joy I felt when I played Galatic Civiliazations II.\n\nInteresting Tidbits:\nThe guys down at Amplitude are not just making a game, the community is also in on it. They have a system called Games2gether where the community votes on features, additions, rebalancing, and even where to go next in the game. The community even got to add its own race, the "Atomatons". It's not just Amplitude's game, it's our game.\n\nPros:\n(+++) Extensive customization\n(+++) Perfectly realized aesthetic\n(+++) Constant updates, fixes, and free addons\n(++) Clean UI and visuals\n(++) Ability to influence Amplitude's future endeavors\n(++) Interesting lore and backstory to every aspect\n(++) Lots of bang for your buck\n(+) Cheaper then other many other 4X titles\n(+?) Every one takes their turn at the same time\n\nCons:\n(---) Multiplayer bugs that cause desynchronization on occasion (on their list of problems they are working on)\n(---) Performance problems and potential memory leaks\n(---) AI still having weird quirks and issues. Cheats on higher difficulties(+?).\n(--) Combat boils down to rock, paper, scissors and offers minimal depth\n(--) Custom races played to their strengths can demolish any of the pre-existing races\n(--) Elements of the UI are some times never explained\n(-) Updates have all but stopped as Amplitude moves towards Endless Legend and Dungeon\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is truely one of my all time favorite and made me a fan of Amplitude. They handled the community of the game the way all companies should. It's a example of how powerful a player base truely can be, and will continue to be. If you are on the fence about picking this game up, do it, you can thank me later.","July 16, 2012","true","161.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Maybe that isn't so but after a first runthrough learning the systems I was able to beat the game on easy on my next attempt in about 250 turns. Moving up to normal added little challenge. The game simply ended more quickly because the AI forced my hand earlier on. Strategy games thrive in that thin line between being too simplistic to have lasting appeal and being too complex to learn in the first place. Sadly, Endless Space is both difficult to learn and easy to master. It's the exact opposite of what a game of this sort should be.\n\nThat said I still had a lot of fun with Endless Space. I liked the addition of hero units to space based TBS Game. It's something common in fantasy titles but not something I had experienced in this specific type of strategy game. The combat to me was pointless. I found a handful of cards that worked and just used them in almost every battle. The AI didn't adapt to this strategy and I found myself easily winning every battle without having to fight it manually.\n\nThe main issue with the pacing of the game is that once you reach the point where you are close to victory you are so insanely powerful that there is little tension. In my first match on the normal difficulty level I built 4 of the 5 wonders needed to win the game and left the fifth one with a couple turns left to build and enough money to finish it instantly if I needed a quick victory. Meanwhile I also researched every single item on the tech tree but the science victory. I made numerous diplomatic agreements for no reason, getting my score very close to 100, and built up a massive army capable of destroying all of my opponents with ease. Eventually an opposing team got too close for comfort to reaching an economic victory, forcing me to finish my final wonder. But the point is that at the very late point in the game I was at, any victory method would have been viable. I was toying with my opponents. This is something I would expect to be able to do after a hundred or more hours of practice or on an easy difficulty setting. But it seems to me that unlike the best turn based strategy games, focusing on one area (say scientific research) does not have to hinder your abilities in other areas. That takes away from the strategy of the game.\n\nSo while I enjoyed my three matches of Endless Space, I felt by the end that I had nothing more left to see. I could play as one of the more unique races. I could up the difficulty and see if I could beat a cheating AI, but neither of those prospects excite me greatly. I still play Galactic Civilizations 2 over half a decade after it was released. And in my mind it inarguably remains the greatest sci-fi 4x game on the market.","April 25, 2015","false","28.4"," 41 of 74 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","41","74","0","3"

Endless Space is no exception. Using mechanics reminiscent of the Civ series of games, anyone familiar with such should be able to pick up the game easily and anyone not familiar with such will be able to get a feel for it quickly. The game's pace is solid, and in my experience the AI is able to present a challenge if you so desire. The best aspect of the game, in my opinion, is the customization. The ability to create your own factions, using in game factions as a template and then manipulating perks and flaws, is outstanding; I'd say it's virtually a guarantee that you'll be able to make something that fits your playstyle. The in-game system for putting together your own starships is also solid, giving an interesting tactical diversity for the game's fleet-based combat system. All in all this is an excellent purchase, well worth the cost.","May 10, 2015","true","153.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cerinier/recommended/208140/","Cerinier","Cerinier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cerinier/","160 products in account","In my opinion the best 4x game since GalCiv II.\nThere are 10 factions with unique techs, shipdesign and raceutilities (like cloning, locust swarm,...) in the main game and one more in the DLC. Each of them plays different and uses a very balanced concept of fighting for their goals. Like in common 4x games there are warlike, economic, diplomatic and scientific races which all try to reach their prefered kind of victory condition. But here all of them are also able to defend themself which increases the difficulty of the game even against peaceful neighbours.\n\nThe game itself plays like the most known 4x games where you have to colonise planets, build lot of improvements on your systems and finally create a fleet to defend your worlds. Each part of this is well balanced and keeps interesting even in late game. The Heroes which improve your fleets or systems with unique boni increase the impact of your choices and add an important and interesting point while playing.\n\nThe shipbattles are a little bit more tricky then in older 4x games because it isn't all about numbers. The battle runs in timebased turns where you could give a main order to your ships (like focus first ship, spread fire ect.) but you do not directly controll your ships (like you did in Armada2526). The fight will be simulated with your orders. The battle card system (tactical options for each turn like sabotage, weapon overload) are hard to understand during the first game but after some time you learn what is important in which turn.\n\nThe biggest advantage of Endless Space is the battle grafic which is amazing and unchallenged in classic 4x games. The overview grafic is also absolutly okay and after some time even the interface that may be confusing during the first turns becomes absolutly useful. The soundtracks fits well in a spacegame and give you the right feeling while playing.\n\nPeople who like 4x games and could handle to lose against an AI should buy this really amazing game. And yes, the AI is really hard and you will need some time to handle the game even on easy or normal. But for patient players that take the time to learn it will be a game for many, many hours.","December 11, 2013","true","72.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Immense and intricate but then hampers or limits the player in one way or another. For instance not only can't you negotiate at the start of the game, every diplomatic action must be researched in your tech tree before hand. Want to form an alliance? Research first. Open trade routes? Research first. It gets obnoxious when it comes time for trading resources.\n\nSay you want to trade X number of your anti-mater for X number of their space peaches.\nFirst you have research the ability to recognize anti-mater as a resource and then research the ability to trade it.\n\nThe same issue happens when it comes to fleet customization. The ability to build your own warships and customize their load out was one of the things that drew me to this game. Cause let's be honest, that's ♥♥♥♥ing cool.\n\nYou select your chassis and the type of armarments you want. Make a ship that's all offense, all defense, or somewhere in between.\n\nThe problem comes first with the lack of real-time combat. It's honestly the biggest dissapointment.\nBut you get the option to watch cinematic of the destruction and imagine what it would be like to actually play.\n\nBecause there's no real-time combat like the Total War series, you can't tell your fleet to target the weakest, strongest, or ship with the lowest current HP. You can't flank, you can't really do much of anything. This could have been solved with more attack formations, but we only get 3.\n\nCombat in Endless space is a card game. It begins like this,\n\nSelect your defensive formation:How your fleet is formed...remember pure defense in front, pure attack in back because the ships in front are targeted first.\n\nSelect your attack formation:Every ship attacks another ship, 1/3 your fleet engages 1/3 of theirs, all ships focus fire a single ship.\n\nSelect your special cards.Bascially you pick cards that have special effects like increased accuracy, increased damage, etc.\nThese card effects can be blocked or enhanced based on what the enemy chooses for their 3 cards. I can't stress how depressing this is. It's really just pure luck.\nSo use your Millenium Puzzle or "believe in the heart of the cards" and victory is assured.\n\n\nFinally kinetics are hilariously overpowered giving you no reason to use missles or beams which only further limits your strategic options.","December 8, 2015","false","23.7"," 79 of 147 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","79","147","7","4"

Endless Space is a Real Time Turn Based Science Fiction Strategy. Yeah, something like that. Basically turns happen simultaneously and next turn begins when everyone clicks "end turn". You have quite a lot of races to choose from, and if you don't like them you can create your own races from the other races' set parameters.\n\nThe first thing that hit me is that the lore of the Endless universe is absolutely stunning and well thought out. They have many mainstream sci-fi cliches but also very creative and sometimes funny technology tree. The first time you play this game you would think that it has a storyline due to the immersion and random events etc. The scope of the game, within some couple hundred games, is huge: you evolve from a species habiting one single fluffy terran/jungle/ocean/arid planet in a faraway galaxy into a galactic superpower with the ability to colonize gas giants and tear down space-time. What I really like is that they have actually managed to keep the game interesting even into the late game. For example, your population can be hard to manage, at least in the start (you can't expand too quickly or they will get very unhappy), but they won't get pushy and won't drag you to too many details. One way they have done this is that battles are pretty straight forward and there's really no strategy there, except good scouting and finding out how your adversary is equipped so you can counter him/her in the rock-paper-scissors battle mechanic. Hero is a must in a battle, and heroes can really boost your stuff, also when assigned as planet governors.\n\nOn higher difficulties and versus multiple enemies a lot of things are luck based. You can simply end up in a bad spot with a cheating AI with no way out. Also the fact that moving of ships & battles is somewhat weird, it actually happens in real time, and is not turn based is a pretty stupid mechanic especially vs AI. Sometimes you would want to move ships between fleets before combat but you can't because the other player forces you to enter combat. I suppose the point here is to cut waiting times in multi player so that turns can happen simultaneously. I have not played MP so I can't say anything about that, although I would "guess" that the game's balancing probably favors single player.\n\nIn single player you can easily beat all opponents on easier difficulties, but the game gives you lots of options for handicapping yourself. Too bad that AI is mostly quite stupid, and like many other games, higher difficulties only give bonuses for AI and handicaps for the player or make the AI cheat but I guess that's the only way to make challenging AI's in strategy games... One real point of discontent is the planet menu, it is really hard to organize when you have a lot of things queued, and there is no "bring to top of queue"-button. This is really frustrating if you want to manage things yourself. You can always automate buildings though, but it's not very feasible if you are playing vs 8 AI's in endless difficulty and need to be pretty precise about things. In the trading system the AI is pretty smart though, and is really difficult to cheat.\n\nOk, so I wouldn't pay 20€ for this game, but definetely recommend it especially if you get it on sale. If you are looking for the ultimate competitive strategy experience, then I don't think that this game is it. However, it can be quite fun to play. I also have Dungeon of the Endless and recommend that as well.","October 31, 2014","true","233.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Beautiful Graphics, 4X, Addictive (...just, one more turn, appeal), terraform planets within star systems, within a customized galaxy of different sizes, types, age, and more.\n\n-Compete for planets, resorces, influence, military dominance, technological supremacy, or become a galactic trade empire.

This game is a must for every Civilization fan that would like a unique Civ-esque experience in space.

Yes, it's that addictive!  Be warned!!\n\n\nI highly suggest watching Arumba's Playthrough on youtube, if you are on the fence about aquiring the game... I bought it before I made it all the way through his the 3rd video and I'm in love with this game.\nArumba's Endless Space - Disharmony - (playlist): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBSL_HAWOTk&list=PLH-huzMEgGWAWsM2s9m1MW3kLH_Eolw4f\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSuggestion(s) to the Developers:\n\nFrom what I've read, this game has been put, "on the shelf" for now, and will NOT be getting updates until after EL is released...\n\n'Endless Legend' is finally out and 'Endless Space' still needs some TLC (ie. patching/updates, make the game more conducive to modding.  I've only been able to find 3-4 mods for this game.  If you are no longer supporting a game, allow for an effective modding scene.\n\nPlease maintain Amplitude Studios' good name; abandoning all support in lieu of creating a newer game is a terrible longterm business strategy and ultimately self-sabotaging.  Why is this bad for business?  Simply put, this business model is completely unsustainable.\n\nPeople will not continue to buy games from a company/developer that has a reputation for abandoning support for current games and are still charging $$$ for.  Why would anyone with any sort of rational mind want to buy a game or product from a company/develepment team known for abandoning perfectly good projects barely a year old.\n\nIf you want to make a good name for the 'Endless' franchise, your customer base needs to come first, and be able to trust the fact that you support and stand behind all your products, not just 'new releases.'\n\nI am interested in purchasing 'Endless Legend,' but I won't even consider it until I know this company supports all products it currently charges $$$ for including the existing release in 2013 of 'Endless Space.'\n\nOnce support resumes for 'Endless Space' and it gets a few much needed updates, I would support and purchase 'Endless Legend' or any other Amplitude Studios' game for that matter.   By this time, you will have earned my brand loyalty... and I know I'm not alone in my sentiment.\n\nEndless Space's has so much potential,  Sure, the AI needs to be reworked.  But please, for the love of all that's good,  DON'T forsake your current player base, it's bad business.\n\nI've seen many developer's with great potential, fall by the wayside because they do not provide continued support for their products or opt to make new games, instead of fixing current ones.\n\nStudio's... small and large: in  favor of short term profit gains via newly released games/products, rather than making existing games work properly is not a sustainable business model.  You will lose brand loyalty, and brand loyalty is a major factor in the gaming industry upon release(s) or newer games/products.\n\nWith trust comes loyalty.  Loyalty = Sales.  ex. I have so much loyalty to the Civilization franchise, I felt confident pre-purchasing their newest game, Civilization: Beyond Earth without playing it or even watching a playthrough for release on October 24, 2014.\n\nUntil then, I'll play ES.... (hoping) for an overall update that improves AI mechanics, as well as other minor tweaks.... this would restore my faith in Amplitude Studios and give me hope for the future of this, potentially, promising studio.","October 5, 2014","true","12.6"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

It has a lot of similarities to Master of Orion or other Space Empire Sims. Often the question arises if this is a worthy heir to an old name, in this game you can say - it is. It's even better than the original series in some aspects. The 4x genre has many stars, one of them is here.  Now for a more in depth look.\n\nGraphics/Artworks: They are fitting and atmospheric to this game, of course there is room for improvement but the game is in many aspects an eyecandy. The artworks of the different races are also a good atmospheric stimulus to what to expect during the run with your choosen race. Of course, at times this games sometimes looks like a MoO 3 clone at times, and this was giving me sometimes a hard time.\n\nMusic/Soundeffects: Ok, we are decades now out of the beep, beep, beep sound of Convox and I am very happy about that. This game has a thick, atmospheric background sound. The sound effects fit to the game and don't disturb the flow of the game. Sometimes this game has a meditative stance.\n\nPlayability: The game is for 4X quite easy to learn, yet hard to master, even in a small galaxy with only few other competition the game can quite easily overwhelm you, if you don't build your strengths to the right degree. Balancing the different aspects of research, industry, resources and budget can get you into a good deep mess at times. And it is for each of the races quite different, yes, in this game it can be challenging to choose from the different races. You can sometimes ponder a long time over a decission on your turn - and still not be sure if you choice was dictated by wisdom or foolishness.\n\nGenre and Developement Issues: The game is, like some of it's predecessors a turn based strategy and exploration game, exploration though, as in this type of game typical is only superficial, you can't enter the planets surface and look for strange alien artifacts, strange alien lifeforms and so on ... therefore the so often typed 4X is kind of a stereotype. If you loved Master of Orion, Pax Imperia, Ascencion or other games of that type that come in your mind, you might be on a good way with this game - it offers endless hours of fun, has a great replayability value and a very customizable universe. The mix of races is good, you can choose between very different stances of gameplay, just by the the choice of race. There were and there are still some bugs in the game, they are minor and mostly don't disturb the gameplay - some of them are only cosmetic issues.\n\nValue: At 30 € this game might seem expensive, but - it has a lot of hours with great and wonderful gameplay to offer. The price "might" seem steep, but it is still worth the money - especially for fans of this genre.\n\nI can recomend this game. It's a must if you loved the MoO series or you are a Science Fiction fan.","December 11, 2014","true","101.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I enjoyed my time in it, but it felt too skewed towards the early game (it's tough early, but once you're out in front, then there's really no stopping you, so the last 75 per cent of the game is no challenge - or you get smashed early and the game's over - or it's easy early, and then crazy easy for the rest of the game), and could have done with more work balancing the strategic AI and the difficulty curve over the length of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atermonas/recommended/208140/","atermonas","Transhumanist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atermonas/","7 products in account",""Endless Space" is a very interesting and fun game. It's almost like nothing you've ever played before. OK, sometimes, it might remind you of the "Civilization" series, but, a little more detailed and complicated. Of course, I do like its concept  myself, so I'm totally into it.\nThe graphics are beautiful. The player can pick any kind of galaxy out there and a faction with balanced pros and cons and achieve different types of victories. Scientific, economic, military...\nAnother amazing thing is the game's music. I'll say no more about it, just take a look at YouTube by yourself.\nI'll add that the game has a mythology of itself, which makes it unique and not some simple TBS with nothing much to offer.\nOne last thing that amazes me, is the research behind the game. It seems like the developers trully gave their best so as not to fall in the waters of pseudoscience. Thus, the technologies are actual (present day) ideas and  theories, somewhat futuristic and simplified but real! So, the player will find teleportation, wormholes, black holes, Casimir effect, quantum entaglement and stuff like this that can make a Science student go mad!\nThere are only two things that bother me:  (a) The Tutorial. It's not messy but it's a lot of information at once, without giving the player the chance to practice it,  a bit. Someone might get overwhelmed but you get used to the game pretty quick. It could be better, though.  (b) The Battles. They don't occur the "usual" (whatever that means) way, but it's all about advancing technologically, picking Heroes as Admirals, having a few ships and most importantly (!) picking the right cards. I've never played anything like this before and I know that the developers don't have unlimited money, time and mood to create a game *that* much detailed, without disappointing the consumers, but, in general, yes, battles could be a little more *alive* and a little more simple!\nNvertheless, I do recommend it! It will be an unforgetable experience!\nHave fun!","December 9, 2015","true","11.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And I don't regret any minute I have spent in it, since.\nIt's a beautiful game and you can see that the Devs really did care about it.\n\nEvery Description in the Tech Tree offers a great understanding of what you are actually researching there and I also love the small details, that when you reduce the anomaly of a planet, in this case Meteor Strikes, that it actually names the scientist who had the idea to fight back against this force of nature.\n\nOr  when something bad happens in your Galaxy, you are able to blame it on Scientist XYZ. It's just beautiful. Furthermore the humor in some texts, or the way the AI replies to your offers, it's just great.\n\nNot to mention this is the only 4X Games which's Soundtrack I can actually stand.\n\nFurthermore, this game has a lot of details, that show how your Population reacts to certain things, and everything is understandable, and you know why they are feeling so.\n\nAnd last but not least, FREE DLC. There is only one DLC that costs you something. Disharmony, which is a great DLC which offers a different perspective of the game. But the rest? You get in Updates. New Factions, new Gameplay Mechanics. For nothing.\n\nAll the factions you can play, are quite unique. (From generic humans, to giant amoebas to robots, who want to terraform every planet in the Galaxy, you have everything) And each of them plays differently. For example you can go full-war with humans, as they are a war nation, but with a scientific faction, your ships are slightly worse than the ones of the humans, so you rather go the diplomatic way.\n\nBut of course, this game has some downsides.\n\nFor example the System of how battles work. Two fleets meet, and when you start the battle, you have to chose Tactic Cards on what your fleets should do, like a Rock-Paper-Stone IN SPACE. But yeah, it's really weird, and it's more luck than anything else, especially if you go against another player.\n\nAlso, what I disliked about the Population System is that it doesn't matter if you are at war or not, that even after 300 lost battles no voice of protetst is  to hear. (This is more of a personal opinion than anything else, but eh.) So you could have an eternal war and your people simply don't care. I hope they add this little immersive feature in a later update.\n\nOverall:\nA great 4X Game, maybe the best out to date!\nI can just recommend it! It's tons and tons of fun!","May 24, 2014","true","18.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's nice to look at, being able to customise your own empire and game settings, and the diversity of play-style involved is all very nice. The battles at first i thought would be an issue but as you get into it, it's quite easy to understand that the developers have thought it through so that battles in the late game can be auto'd quite successfully to save on turn time using a form of rock-paper-scissors approach with cards, while some can be manually done to watch the pretty explosions. The UI is very intuitive to use, provides all the information you need to cut down the micromanagement needed to a level of enjoyment and not tedium and I love the system view used in this game.\n\nI spend most of the play time on the expansion ES: Disharmony which has expanded on the core idea quite successfully IMO and adds some nice features such as the Harmony race and I'm enjoying trying to get achievements, experience different play-styles and fine tune my custom race, something that this game does really well......\n\n..BUT...\n\nAs much as I like this game there are some glaring flaws that must be mentioned.\nFirstly, the tech tree is not nearly as large or diverse as I would like it to be. It's really easy to finish which is disappointing and I don't like the military tree. The weapons only have a few levels each of which consists of a weight reduction / power increase which is too simplistic an approach and kind of cheapens the combat thereafter. The techs themselves have massively misleading names; eg Dark Energy Shield - immediately you think "woah, that's gonna be good" but it only unlocks an armour module which does what? More defence power, more ship hp, the same as the rest of them. Only a little bit of variety would add a really nice twist.\nInvading systems is in the firing line next. For such a neat ship-combat system this game lacks an invasion system at all really. It consists of; put invasions modules on ships, go to system, invade, wait. You have no influence over the invasion whatsoever which can be a major pain in some games when you need to make key moves quickly and you're held back by invasion speed. Once you research into troops you can bypass this by directly invading with a % chance to succeed but this itself is flawed because by replacing a couple of siege modules with troops and maintaining moderate amounts of siege ships you can insta-take systems quite easily, swinging to the other extreme.\nNo culture-flipping / major effects of influence is disappointing personally. Lovely way to add pressure to empires without using guns and hulls that could be implemented that isn't currently.\nI've heard a lot of knocks at the diplomacy system, I don't think I notice / care with how I play but might be worth investigating if you do because it is quite simplistic compared to something like MOO.\n\nHaving said all of that, it might be easy to think this game isn't worth it but I think it is. Yes it needs some TLC and I hope the developers are interested in providing some but for now it has entertained me for over 120 hours and I get bored quite quickly of things so to me that's a success.\n\nMy suggestion if you are thinking of buying it, read more reviews, watch a let's play or two on youtube because I did and I found that very helpful in making up my mind.","January 10, 2015","true","165.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Even though I haven't played the multiplayer much, for the time I have played it, it has been very fun and addicting. And did I mention the space battles are totally epic?

Things you would expect in a game like this are present - wonders - different factions - designing your own ships, diplomacy. AI exists in the dumb and adaptative flavors, I keep it at dumb because I am not that great a strategisgt and I learn something new everytime I play the game but its nice to know the option is there. This game also has some mods for it floating out there and the multiplayer is fairly solid me and my mate enjoyed that quite a bit as well... So if you skipped this when it was early acess and never looked back and this falls on your radar again you might seriously consider it.

The terrible UI\nI haven't moved a guy and yet its beeping at me when I try to move him. Never tells you what's wrong. Just PING PING CHING CHIME. Its like WTF?\nSelect guy 1 from planet and move him. Oh I get a second move? Nope, auto-selected guy 2 whom you never clicked and whom you needed to garrison a planet and now he's off someplace else leaving critical planet exposed.\nClicking a specific location and WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY GOING?? WTF through enemy territory when its not even the shortest path!!! ARRRGGGHJHH\n\n2. Arcane Game Systems\nDespite an INCREDIBLY ANNOYING and PERVASIVE tutorial system that constantly interrupts your gameplay, the game systems are totally arcane. For example: nothing tells you what the collapsed wormhole thing is, even when you really need to know, or how to get around it. Nor does it tell you how your 5 destroyers, by far the most advanced in the galaxy, is beaten by 5 corvettes from a far inferior race. Nor does it describe why supposedly-"nice" races whom you're not at hositities-with, simply waltz in and start invading your worlds. Do they even read their own fiction??? Or... more likely still: there is no differences in the AIs and the "fiction" is just a fascade that has no bearing on the races true intentions. WHY HAVE FICTION IF THE GAME DOES NOT FOLLOW IT. You're just being deceptive!\n\n3. Game-breaking Randoms\nWas in a game tonight, and found myself on a dead-end part of the galaxy behind a collapsed wormhole... twiddling my thumbs for something like 40 turns before I could research the technology to get past it, and by then, most of the galaxy was already taken. They should probably have in their galaxy-generation algorithm, some kind of invalid state checker which will prevent the game from generating maps that prevent the player from actually competing in the game.\n\nWorse still is the combat system, which... I kid you not... consists of picking 3 "cards" for 3 "phases of combat", a formation, and a firing doctrine. Now... your cards rock-paper-scissors against the "cards" that the enemy selected, and somehow this is what they call strategy. Seriously? Selecting cards, by trying to out-guess an AI (which is probably just randomizing) is the tactics of game combat? I made better combat systems when I was 10. Literally. War of the Worlds board game. Was awesome. Much better than this abortion of intellect. Worse still is that there are blatantly invalid ship configurations that are invalidated by your card selection. I made a fleet of laser-heavy ships, and upon first engagement discovered there are NO laser-based cards in the early game.\n\nA good game designer respects their player. You do this with a good UI, short non-invasive (preferably -fun- tutorials) that cover the basics and, if they want you to start the game a certain way (like "Lasers are better towards the end-game") will warn their players away from gimped configuratrions... or even-better: make it so all the configurations work if used properly. They don't take the lazy way out and make you use "Battle cards" that are actually quite meaningless. And they will check their random generator for broken starting configurations.\n\nI hate to say it, because I like indie games, but this one actually FEELS indie. Completely unprofessional.","April 24, 2015","false","24.3"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","0"

It does have that just one more turn feeling going on and there is a lot of options to play around with, but even after playing for hours I came away feeling cheated. Cheated because I have bascially no control over what happens durring battles. you send your fleet against another fleet pic a battle plan (which are like rock paper scissors defense beats offense, sabatoage beats defense) then you just watch as the battle is played out with no control at all. I repeat again there is absolutly no control over battle besides picking stragegy cards for long range combat, medium range combat and short range combat.\nIt also gets so annoying when you are trying to attack and get rid of an enemy fleet and they just keeping fleeing combat then jumping to another of my stars where they try to invade. I go over attack them they run away and set up shop and my next closes star system. I clearly over power them and I have to chase them around. Some times I had a higher level hero (lv 23) vs (lv 13) hero and my fleet is a bigger stonger fleet and I lose. All because the choice of the wrong staragegy card means I lose my entire fleet. This is just so annoying because I had no control. I could take it if I had lost because I messed up the battle myself but losing with superior force and a higher level hero that I had level up to specialize in combat to be my main general while not having much control over it just makes me say no thanks.","October 2, 2014","false","9.3"," 35 of 65 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","35","65","2","3"

It plays very much like Galactic Civilizations II, but there are many differences. For one, this game is not played on a grid. Star systems are connected via direct pathways, and movement is only possible on these pathways. Because of that, the exploration aspect of ES did not feel as exciting as exploration in GCII (or any Civilization game). The tech tree consists of four entirely independent tech trees, with little overview of the whole. Going from one tree to the other takes a lot of scrolling, and personally I found the lack of oversight disturbing. There are other area's in which the game lacks overview. For instance, diplomacy can be really cutthroat because your friendly neighbor could attack you next turn, without _any_ warning apart from "your high score is a reason for concern". Also, you can see how well you're doing on economy, science, military etc. but you never get a graph or direct comparison of the numbers.\n\nDespite these shortcomings and a slight lack of depth (compared to civilization or GCII) I still played quite a few hours because of it's one saving grace: the graphics. I honestly find the interface refreshingly beautiful and stylish. It might not be user-friendly and it sure has it quirks, but it does look very spacey. Unfortunately, a colorful UI does not a great game make.\n\nAs it is, I can not full-heartedly recommend the game, but I have nothing against it either. If you are in dire need of a sci-fi turn-based strategy game and you have already tried Galactic Civilizations II, you might just enjoy yourself for a while with Endless Space. But even so, I would advise you to wait for a discount of sorts.","July 23, 2014","true","59.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That sounds like they really love burgers or something. Perhaps it is because the dev team is French? I think they should hire someone to go over their language for little things like that. The translation is actually pretty good, but I can't help but imagining there's an entire race that's populating the galaxy in order to develop the most delicious snack food. On the other hand, I kind of want that. Eternal leaders of the Cravers, Seekers of Extreme Flavor. Also, space may be endless, but you are limited to only looking close to the galaxy you start in. I know, I know, The Endless are the missing ancient race in this 4X. Maybe they have the knowledge the Cravers need to make their burgers. That works. They did have the tech to allow one guy to clone a race of himself that's another faction. Which is great, by the way. It's like a Blood Elf found a cloning machine.

You pick one of 10 factions, plus with the Disharmony DLC you can create your own faction. To win a complete game, you must acheive one of the following: Scientific, Diplomatic, Economic, Miltary, or Wonder. it is ideal to choose the Victory type parallel to your faction's focal point. Your ultimate goal is to search for the Fabled Augria, one of the many wonders in the game, once found and colonized you can achieve your Wonder Victory.\n\nOnto to the ship building and fleet managing, If you crave for war, go for the advanced hulls. Every RTS has a Unit CAP, this game's cap depends on the research you have invested into economics and military. Ship creation, is completely customizeable. Fleet managing is where its a pain.

This game is a great 4x strategy game in my opinion but for some people who like to get instant satisfaction when playing games such as shooters will not enjoy this. This is because Endless Space is slow it isn’t something you can go in and expect amazing entertainment from instantly. This is the type of game that you must invest yourself in and while I find that easy and have easily put 100+ hours into it I do know of others and people who have or would easily get bored with this. Now with that out of the way let’s talk about the game. It is amazing I absoluetly love it if you have played any other space strategy game they usually have a focus towards combat or a fast paced destruction mechanic and while this games combat is similar the core of the game is focused on exploration and colonization not war. Its soundtrack compliments this very well and it is a big relief to see a game focused more on exploration just like galactic civilizations 2 was. Not much more needs to be said about this game other than that the combat scenes are very enjoyable to watch and the AI on higher difficulties will give you a run for you money. With each play through I have I always learn something new and while everyone has their strategies there is a lot of depth in how these games play out. So to sum it up yes I definitely recommend this game to strategy fans because of its great gameplay focused on exploration, its amazing soundtrack and the combat sequences which are very fun to watch.","January 31, 2014","true","203.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Great game.  All of the 4x action I loved back in the day with MOO/MOO2.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out the space battle commands and the rock-paper-scissors of ship and fleet composition.  There is a nuance there that just doesn't exist in a lot of other 4x space games where you literally throw the largest stack of the latest tech at your enemy.  Instead, in Endless Space, your fleet sizes are limited by command ratings.  So, getting the right mix of missile boats, mid-range energy weapon platforms, and knife-fighting kinetics is a constant juggling act with a definite need to defend your empire in depth.","January 2","true","29.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The combat side is quite streamlined but it's very functional, if you're looking just for epic fleet battles there are better options.

Kinda like Civilization, except in space.\n\nPlayers choose a race (or build their own) that has their own sets of strengths and weaknesses to fit their play styles and what kind of victory they want to achieve. Players advance their civs awesomeness by researching a linear tech web with several distinct sections. The tech tree is very large with a lot of different things to get that affect all aspects of gameplay, allowing players to research specific technologies to best complement their civilization.\n\nPlayers fight other civs by building fleets based upon ships of their design. Players fit ships based on a hull design, propulsion, power, weapons and a few unique things like colonists, siege guns, and other stuff. Players then use their fleets to go kick other fleets in the ♥♥♥.\n\nCombat in this game is resolved auto-magically by the computer based on the opposing fleets ships compositions. I was hoping it was going to be in real time when I bought it based on screenshots, but alas I was decieved. The game does give you a very nice cinematic cut scene of the fleets going at it though, however you can only watch and can't control your ships.","December 29, 2014","true","30.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It involves countless hours of fun, amazing lore, and a soothing soundtrack. It's at one point calm and serene, at another point frantic as haphazard plans are thrown together, and from these haphazard plans rushes a great victory.\n\nGameplay\nEndless Space, as my first 4X Space Strategy game, has not dissapointed. The genre has some very lauded titles, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they stack up against the gameplay of Endless Space, which is almost always consistently engaging. Whether you're colonizing new planets, building improvements or conducting diplomacy, the UI is very well done and easy to see, use and activate. Although there are many systems that are relatively more complex than they initially seem, so some tinkering and experimentation is required. Everything just gels together really nicely, and it's very fun to explore all the different possibilites, Hero skill combinations, research tech paths, military ship creation: there's a lot of content to keep you satisfied. Probably the weakest point of the vanilla game would be the combat, which is essentially a card game with admittedly cool cutscenes.\n\nStory\nIt's a strategy game, and as such, it doesn't really have a main story. It does have overarching lore and history of the Endless, but other than that there's no story. Nothing wrong with that as it's a 4X strategy title.\n\nGraphics, Atmosphere and Sound\nThe graphics for Endless Space, running smoothly on my computer, are shiny but some of the ship textures really aren't anything to write home about. However, planets, stars and diplomatic figures are all very well done.\nThe atmopshere is very nice, with cool randomized events and diplomatic messages. Very enjoyable to play and experience.\nThe sound is worth listening to by itself, and the soundtrack, I am in infact listening to it right now it's that good. It's very serene and beautiful, and a good calmative after a long day. The main theme is probably my favorite piece.\n\nConclusion\nIf you haven't been paying attention- do you like strategy games? If so, buy it. Do you like science fiction? If so, buy it. Do you like interesting backstories and creating your own custom factions, with their own custom backgrounds? If so, buy it.\nPretty much what I'm saying is a big thumbs up. You will lose yourself in this great strategy game. As the old adage goes... 'Just one more turn!'","November 17, 2015","true","25.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Now the mame Endless Space is a worthy name for the game. For it really is endless fun, an endless hours worth of effort which reaps endless amount of joy, (if you dont mind a bit of hard core strategy action every now and then with indie games)\n.--------------------------------PROS------------------------------\n1.The game has a Hero system which distinguishes it from other strategy base building games. The plus side is you're not bored after long while playing this game,it adds variety to the game play, slightly opens up the multitude of outcomes, and gives a sense of control to the players which is unmatched in the entire game.\n2.The tech tree is unique in that it has four varieties: diplomacy, applied sciences, military, exploration. Each has its own flavor. Military provides might, diplomacy gives keys to diplomacy, applied science sometimes reveals new resources or helps in development of a star system, exploration lets you colonize new planets and star systems. Together they give a unique blend to the game play.\n3.Exploration of the galaxy is fun for any newb or experienced player alike\n---------------------------------CONS-----------------------------\n1.Some technolgies hold the key to survival. For example if you dont discover wormhole travel you cannot travel to other planets or star systems, similarly if you dont discover applied technologies you are more then likely not going to discover hidden advantages of certain resources.\n2.The game uses a point system for rating players. Problem is, once your points overtake any of the A.I.s the A.I. attacks you where you're more than likely to lose the war.

It's much more Master of Orion-esque in that, but if you liked that kind of game, then you will certainly enjoy Endless Space.\n\nEndless Space is a space 4X strategy game developed and published by AMPLITUDE Studios.  It's a sleekly presented 4X game that's something of a wonder child for the UNITY engine, and certainly proof that more complex games can be made with the engine, although it certainly also highlights some of the flaws in the engine.\n\nThe presentation is both the strongest suit of the game and also what puts some people off.  It's presented in a very clear and logical format, with items presented in a logical selection of sub-screens.  It's very clean, and that's also the crux of why it puts some people off.  Unlike Star Control 2 that had some great personality to the different races available, the presentation of racial interaction and diplomacy is just as sterile as the rest of Endless Spaces' interface.  It's unfortunate.  For some people this sinks the game.  Personally, I would say that it is certainly say what has kept a good game from being a great game, but it is still a good game regardless.  It just has an unrealised potential that could have been tapped to make it better.\n\nGraphically, the game is indeed pretty impressive for a UNITY engine game.  Together with the polish in the interface and the gorgeous loading screen art its graphically rather impressive.  The camera view in the combat sections makes for some sweeping shots of starship combat that are quite nice.  There's certainly shinier games out there, don't get me wrong, but the game has a careful attention to the production values all the way through that shows.  The music that accompanies the game is likewise quite good.\n\nI spend as much time on the presentation as I do because the mechanics are bog standard.  They're done competently but there's nothing particularly new to the genre here.  The one thing that is done differently from the genre standard is the combat.  It's kind of a halfway between tactical combat and simply ordering a unit to attack and getting an auto-calculated result.  Instead, you choose tactic at long range, medium range, and close range.  There are a variety of different categorizations of tactics and each tactic is strong against one category and weak against another.  So essentially it creates a paper scissors stone game in the mechanics that is kind of simplistic.  Some of them don't seem very balanced though.  There's a few you'll be to unlock after some time in the game that are just objectively better than any other tactic in the category.  Nonetheless it does add a small amount of depth to combat that is otherwise auto-calculated.\n\nAt the end of the day its a well-executed game that does the genre pretty well but doesn't have anything that really sets it apart other than the high production values.  It's certainly well-made and a good entry into the genre, however.  It just isn't going to set the world on fire.\n\nPublished: http://www.highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/88-review-endless-space","April 23, 2014","true","14.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Its a fun game and very approachable, and the graphics are really nice too. It's not really "Turn-based" since the AI moves its pieces during your turn, but it's not something that will break the game entirely. All-in-all, this could be a great game to spend a few hours playing, however...\n\nBut this game harbors a dark side.\n\nNo matter what you do, no matter what difficulty you set it to, you just can not win!...ever! I know it sounds crazy, but it is true! A game needs to be able to be won at the easiest difficulty if you are ever going to try the harder ones. Nobody ever said "Geez, that AI was really hard to beat, but when I quit my day-job and set up a database to help me keep track of every calculation in this game, I finally was rewarded with a victory."\n\nAt the easist level, a game needs to be able to be won if the player is ever going to get better, or to be rewarded with a higher difficulty. In a way this reminds me of that person who offered to teach you a game like chess, and instead of going easy the first few times so you could learn they game, they just beat the bejezus out of you. Ever had that experience before? If so, chances are you do not play that game with that person anymore, no matter how good you have gotten since.\n\nThere is a DLC pack for this game. I do not advise getting it either. The money you spend will be spent in agony.","July 14, 2014","false","106.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I like that there are numerous victory types for this game (science, economic, dominance to name a few).  The in-game story is pretty good (not cheesy like other games).

Aside from that the actual stories are very intriguing, and I spent a long time reading them without losing a single bit of intrest.\n+Custom race maker\n+The perks for each race are a nice edition, like the Sophons being mainly scientific, but they are fairly weak, etc. (adds more thought put into choosing a race rather than just choosing a race because you liked their appearace.)\n+Option to change your empire colour\n+Endless Space has in fact the best artwork I've ever seen in a game, and the fact that some of the artwork is in the loading screens, makes the loading screens more enjoyable to look at.\n+Optimization is great\n+Backgrounds for the galaxy in-game look beautiful\n+Ship design is phenomenal (My favourite ship designs are the Harmony, the Sophons, and the Automatons)\n+Each star and planet are highly detailed and have great names\n+Managing your solar systems (and tax) are very complex and requires a lot of attention if you don't want your  empire going into rebellion.\n+The research tree for the game is... just.... AMAZING. So many options, and sheer amout of research you can do, is just magnificent. Endless Space has the best research tree that I've ever seen in a strategy game; and is one of my favourite parts of the game, to be honest.\n+Exploring through the vast galaxy is fun and simple to do\n+Choosing different productions for each star system adds more strategic planning to do\n+Random events are great and suprising\n+Empire AI is superb\n+Special planets are a nice addition\n+Different types of ships (Colony, Defender, Scout, etc,) are good with their different stats and functions.\n+The fact that they added a option for you to build your own type of ship and modify it for different jobs to do is just exceptional\n+Space fights are cool\n+Free camera movement and a locked camera for space battles\n+Trade routes and just trading alone is fun\n+Diplomatic screen looks beautiful and is very clean\n+Many different type of resources and luxury resources\n+Different actions (in a card shaped format) to choose from for you next space battle\n+Population of a star system have their own opinions\n+Graphics are decent\nI think I'll stop listing pluses now, because I could list them forever.\n\nLets head on to the cons of Endless Space.\n-Game breaking glitches here and there (for example, me and my friend encountered a glitch where the game was stuck on standby for 30 minutes, and never went to the next turn. We had to restart Endless Space and revert to our last autosave to fix it.)\n-Don't turn on the A.I. to manage your star system, like if you turn on the A.I. for one star system, the A.I. may tear that star system down to hell, causing that one to go into rebellion. I don't really recommend turning the A.I. on for managing the star systems, manage it yourself.\n-Graphics options are simple and not the detailed, not allowing you to tweak it for the best preformance.\n\nwell, I guess there isn't that much bad things about this game then.\n\n\nEndless space is a outstanding game that is now one of my favourite strategy games, beautiful work Amplitude Studios!\n\n86/100","December 7, 2014","true","39.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

This game has many hours of fun and one really nice function is you can design what your ships have for example you can make it fast with high defense options but no weapons or you can make it slow and all teeth which is really cool makes for interesting fleat designs.","July 28, 2015","true","82.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fun game that you can pour several hours into if you manage to get into it. A single game could last you entire days to complete depending on how you set it up. The game can be a little slow at first which could be a turn off for those who prefer RTS instead of Turn based strategy.\n\nSpace combat in this game revolves around research, ship build, and card choice. There is no actual individual control of the units in the fleet assembled during battle. It's basically two fleets go head to head until one overpowers the other in quite the spectacular light show.\n\nOverall, I like it. I'm usually more of the "straight into the action" strategy game player but this game is still something I'd recommend for those who want a 4x game to play. It may be a little slow, but the combat and the occurence of unexpected events is something I enjoy.","April 23, 2015","true","59.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then 16 hours later I was okay with it.   This has some cool things in it and is quite fun.  At first the Rock Paper Scissors type cards and limiting it to Long, Medium, Melee phases of combat was something I was not happy about.   Later the three phases make sense if you are actually playing this in multiplayer.    The cards actually end up being pretty cool after you get the hang of them.   I'd like to be able to design my ships a bit more micro level than you do in this, and I wish it had a system view so, you could have multpile teams colonize planets in the same system.  This is more the systems are the smallest territory unit, and the the planets are like slots you claim, and upgrade.   Overall, it is a lot of fun.   It is a bit different, and worth trying out for 4 or 6 hours before you throw up your hand and say "It's not like MOO2", or "It's not like Gal Civ II", or "It's not like Space Empires"...   it is partially like all of those.

The game mechanics are quite simple to understand but they are also deep and polished, and the graphic aspect is great for this kind of game, with a lot of beautiful planets and some nice explosion during space fights! The random galaxy generation, the huge amount of special features that planets can have (for example anomalies, strategic resource or luxury resource) and the random events that can occasionally occur make every game unique. Endless Space also offers great customization options (pirates, game speed, events, galaxy size and shape...) and a lot of interesting features such as heroes, that can be assigned to fleets or systems to upgrade them, planet production customization, moon exploration, which can lead to important and powerful discoveries, and a fantastic tech tree with interesting and funny descriptions for every single technology!\nEndless Space isn't surely perfect, beacuse some technologies are definitely too powerful and unbalanced, the combat system (real time combat divided into 3 parts with a card strategy system) may not appeal to everyone, and some annoying bugs still afflict the game, but it has been created with a lot of attention for details and is a great title for everyone who's looking for a solid yet not too difficult and extremely addicting 4X Sci-fi experience.","March 2, 2014","true","58.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Suffers greatly from "One... more... turn!"-syndrome. I can't even imagine the hours I lost to this time-devourer from beyond the void.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot less busy and redundant than Civ in terms of building your empire, and far more streamlined. Diplomacy actually feels worth a damn, sometimes, too - even with the AI. It's always fun to be an interstellar Space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, too.\n\nCombat takes the form of card-based-pseudo-turn/real-time nonesense that amounts to a rock-paper-scissors game in 3 phases per battle, except it keeps adding cards that utilize different effects, can neutralize others and sometimes counteracts themselves and oh no I've gone cross-eyed.\n\nWhat's important is this: Combat consists of spaceships of increasingly large size and fleet compositions shooting the hell out of eachother with laser guns, full-auto railguns and missile barrages, and it is friggin' cool. Once you wrap your head around the combat system, it also becomes very rewarding!\n\nVisually it's quite gorgeous in my opinion with great, interesting and unique designs for each faction - and immense attention to detail, as you might find out! Not only that but all the tiers of weapons, defensive measures and dirty tricks have very distinct appearances which makes the combat glorious to watch.\n\nHighly recommended - especially as it comes quite cheap!","April 27, 2013","true","217.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had a hard time finding documentation to help me along at first, but the Steam community has published some nice, solid guides that showed me what I was doing wrong. When I took their advice (hint: pay attention to approval/disapproval!), the game was opened up for me in an entirely new way.\n\nBattle sequences are a roll of the dice, as opposed to having RTS elements. You can build, modify and upgrade your fleets, but other than choosing tactics during battle, you can't target individual ships. This was different than I expected, but fits within the overall theme.\n\nExpansionsts will find this frustrating if they don't pay close attention...you pay an approval penalty for overexpansion. Basically, this is the anti-Civilization. There are ways around that though, I'll let you figure it out so as not to spoil anything.\n\nIf you like building empires in a turn-based setting, this is a very easy game to get hooked on.","September 10, 2014","true","77.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Easily in the top 10, if not top 3-5 of it's genre imho.\n\nHow I would describe this game:\n*a dozen factions to choose, all quite different and almost completely customized factions can be made as well.\n*basic custom map generation\n*Civ's turn-based strategy\n*'Sins' tech/war themes.\n*Gal Civ's tech tree\n*resources = money, research, production\n*construct things on your planets (buildings or ships)\n*optional ship customization a bit like Gal Civ, Stardrive or something\n*Hero/governor/generals which you get to choose how to level up via a nice long, deep skill tree system.\n\nPros:\n-Everything is "just enough" in proportion; the viduals are nice, the management is just enough, there's leveling up, customization of play style, storyline type immersion, and there's a bit of real-time combat in the battles (choice of auto or manual), which keep things interesting.\n-UI is pretty clean, and the tooltip system for everything is fantastic.\n-The DLCs and updates have actually been good. They have done balance and bug fixing updates which I thought were well done and reasonably timely considering it's not a huge company, and it's a mostly single player, turn-based game.\n\nCons:\n-Slightly on the pricy side if you ask me, but inflation and whatever I guess... at least it is less than those big name thieves like Sid Meyers, Total War, and the rest.","September 18, 2012","true","151.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Suffers greatly from "One... more... turn!"-syndrome. I can't even imagine the hours I lost to this time-devourer from beyond the void.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot less busy and redundant than Civ in terms of building your empire, and far more streamlined. Diplomacy actually feels worth a damn, sometimes, too - even with the AI. It's always fun to be an interstellar Space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, too.\n\nCombat takes the form of card-based-pseudo-turn/real-time nonesense that amounts to a rock-paper-scissors game in 3 phases per battle, except it keeps adding cards that utilize different effects, can neutralize others and sometimes counteracts themselves and oh no I've gone cross-eyed.\n\nWhat's important is this: Combat consists of spaceships of increasingly large size and fleet compositions shooting the hell out of eachother with laser guns, full-auto railguns and missile barrages, and it is friggin' cool. Once you wrap your head around the combat system, it also becomes very rewarding!\n\nVisually it's quite gorgeous in my opinion with great, interesting and unique designs for each faction - and immense attention to detail, as you might find out! Not only that but all the tiers of weapons, defensive measures and dirty tricks have very distinct appearances which makes the combat glorious to watch.\n\nHighly recommended - especially as it comes quite cheap!","April 27, 2013","true","217.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just...one...more...turn!\n\nThis is an empire builder, but it isn't Civ. Some thinking and forethought are needed to succeed. I had a hard time finding documentation to help me along at first, but the Steam community has published some nice, solid guides that showed me what I was doing wrong. When I took their advice (hint: pay attention to approval/disapproval!), the game was opened up for me in an entirely new way.\n\nBattle sequences are a roll of the dice, as opposed to having RTS elements. You can build, modify and upgrade your fleets, but other than choosing tactics during battle, you can't target individual ships. This was different than I expected, but fits within the overall theme.\n\nExpansionsts will find this frustrating if they don't pay close attention...you pay an approval penalty for overexpansion. Basically, this is the anti-Civilization. There are ways around that though, I'll let you figure it out so as not to spoil anything.\n\nIf you like building empires in a turn-based setting, this is a very easy game to get hooked on.","September 10, 2014","true","77.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Still a lot of limits though but this is something! I just always wanted a true sandbox space civ sim game, without these pre-designed civilizations and background. I also like the battle mechanic: it is a series of orders which can counter each other, and there are quite a number of different orders depending on tech advancement, commander and ship equip. And the thing which impressed me quite much is the space, especially in battles. It's beautiful. The graphics are not something outstanding but still looks very nice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whesto/recommended/208140/","whesto","Whesto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whesto/","154 products in account","Endless Space, a turn-based 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) game set in space. It certainly isn't the most adnvaced 4X game you'll play but it is a good one no doubt. If you are looking for a reliable game in this genre and setting this may be for you.\n\nBefore you start a game you can decide how small or large universe you'd like to play in with various tweaks available, such as number of players and types of planets and shape of the universe. Then you have a set of factions to choose from. Each faction have different pros and cons that you should consider depening on how you want to play.\n\nThere are several winning conditions and ways to play this game: Economic, Scientific, Diplomatic and Military. Different factions are prominent in one or two of these things as well. It is possible to combine these playstyles as you like.\n\nNo matter which way you chose, you will do Research.\n\nThe research tree is rather extensive with 4 branches. Each branch are focusing in certain areas different from the other.\n\nLeft branch: mainly focuses on economy, trade and diplomacy.\nTop branch: is mainly for military research.\nRight branch is mainly for technologic research and resources.\nBottom branch is mainly research for expansion, terraforming and colonization.\n\nExploration and colonization is rather satisfying. You have various types of solar systems with different types of planets as well as asteroid belts. Each can be colonized if you have the right research completed. Once colonized, the planets can be exploited on their resources for your empire. Different planets also have different effects on your colony on said planet.\n\nDiplomacy and trading with the AI is fairly basic and you will notice that the AI can change their mind  over a deal several times over. It is possible to form alliances, trade resources, systems and research. You can of course declare war! With research you can unlock more options for diplomacy and ways to improve your trade routes.\n\nLets not forget the military side. You can build and manage armadas of ships of various kinds. What kind of ships is mainly up to you. You can make customizable ship blueprints that are then available for construction. Each ship blueprint has a set of slots that you can choose to put different modules in. Such as weapon types, defense, utility and smaller ships (fighters/bombers). Your main ship has only room for a certain amount of weight that can be put on them (more available with research). The overall look of a ship can't be modified.\n\nYou can research and build larger battleships and you can assemble armadas to fly as a single unit on the world map. Armada size is limited by Command Points and you can get more points with research for larger armies. In a fight, only one armada can fight at once even if you have several armadas in one system.\n\nThe actual fighting is pretty uneventful. You don't actively control the fight yourself but there is a small element of tactics involved. A battle has 3 stages: Long Range, Mid Range and Melee Range. Missile weapons are good for long range, Lasers for mid range and Machine Guns for melee range.\n\nBefore a battle you choose a card for each stage. Cards have an offensive or defensive condition (like extra armor or weapon damage). There is a planning stage before the battle where you make your decisions. Some cards negate other cards based on the type of card that is in play. Your card could be put out of play and the enemy card will get buffed or vice versa.\n\nWhen battle starts there isn't much you can do but watch, which is the main weak point of the game. You can choose firing mode for each stage however.\n\nAll in all it is an enjoyable Sci-Fi 4X game that can keep you occupied for hours. Try and pick it up during a sale and it will be worth it if you are into these kind of games.","January 4, 2014","true","30.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I picked it up during the Steam Summer Sale at a fraction of the full price, and I'm very happy with what I got for the money.\n\nWould I feel the same if I had paid full price? Probably not. The simplistic gameplay makes it easy to enjoy without the frustration of a steep learning curve, but does not justify a top-shelf price tag in my opinion.\n\nThat said, the Endless Space universe is full of beutifully detailed graphic depictions of all types planets, including various sci-fi anomalies such as ancient ruins and gravitational disturbances. Each star system you discover reveals unique challenges and opportunities for colonization, keeping the experience enticing.\n\nCombat is a little strange, consisting of 3 phases which essentially represent long, medium, and short range exchanges of damage and defence. There are no maneuvers involved; every class of ship is essentially a slow-moving platform for weapon systems and countermeasures closing in on one another, The strategy for each of the 3 phases is selected before combat, and you are given the option to skip straight to the results or watch the action in real-time. The latter provides the opportunity to change the selected strategies along the way, and some decent eye candy. Nothing that would rival the likes of EVE, but far more exciting than a Sid Meyer game's combat system.\n\nTrade and diplomacy are both present, as you'd expect from any sort of nation-building strategy game. Having chosen an empire which relies mainly upon military superiority, I haven't experienced enough of either to judge their implementation. However, the fact that you have a wide of choice of empires ranging from evil militants to peaceful industrialists means you can play-your-way, selecting the definintion of "victory" that suits you.\n\nThe game also includes randomly generated events, rare and valuable resources to find, pesky space pirate attacks, and a handful of other surprises which keep things from becoming stale or predictable.\n\nWhat it does NOT include are cinematic sequences, voice acting, linear storytelling, city-level management  or integrated mini-games. I expect that casual gamers may find that to be a bit bland, but strategy purists will appreciate the lack of distraction.\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you're a fan of turn-based strategy, civilization building, sci-fi warfare, and looking to add another solid title to your collection, then put this on your wishlist and wait for the next sale.","August 22, 2015","true","26.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/recommended/208140/","silentzero1","SilentZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentzero1/","21 products in account","Introduction:\nEndless Space is a turn-based 4x strategy game similar to the popular Civilization series, which has been a long-time favorite of mine. To be perfectly honest, strategy games aren't really my forte, but I do get quite a lot of enjoyment out of them occasionally, often losing track of time and suddenly wondering, why is the sun coming up?--ooooh dear god, I have to be at work in two hours, wtf happened!!  The sci-fi space theme of this one really got my attention though because I'm so used to strats that take place planetside: land, sea and air.  Managing fleets of spaceships and star systems, colonizing planets and discovering artifacts of lost alien civilizations... Pretty amazing stuff!  But Endless Space isn't without its dangers....\n\nTLDR Highlights:\n++ Customizable Ships Builds\n++ Nameable Star Systems/Ships/Fleets\n++ Graphics\n+ Decent Learning Curve\n+ Music\n\n-- No Campaign/Story Mode\n-- Rock, Paper, Scissors Combat\n- Disappointing Diplomacy/Trade Relations\n\n= Room for improvement, potentially in a sequel?  Absolutely.  But it's far more amazing than not, and a must-have in the turn-based 4x strategy genre, especially for fans of the sci-fi/space theme.\n\nReview:\nPROS --  Truthfully, it didn't take long to get into this game.  Based on the reviews that I read beforehand, I was very concerned about the learning curve and the lack of a decent tutorial, but once I started a match and began navigating its different menus there were detailed tutorial popups that explained just about everything I needed to know in order to play.  If you skim/skip through it to get to the action faster, however, then yeah, you'll run into that learning curve everyone talks about.  So read up!  Many Bothans died to bring us this information.... No wait, that was Star Wars.  But I'm sure a few interns had to fetch a lot of coffee and make burrito runs while the devs stayed up late just to make us this tutorial.  So if not for yourself, then do it for them!\n\nOne of the first things that I really came to love in Endless Space was its customizability.  You get to name your own star systems and fleets which is fantastic, but the best stuff is when you start creating new ships.  Want another ship type?  Then create one!  Put whatever modules you want on it (given you've researched the necessary prerequisites) and give that new ship design a name of your choosing.  Maybe the naming feature isn't crucial to gameplay, but I got a kick out of it at least.\n\nThe graphics are pretty stellar, especially for a game of this genre.  No complaints there at all.  The music is great too, but a little more variety couldn't hurt.  After a while, you may want to pop in your own Awesome Mix cassette to listen to while you're out getting into trouble around the galaxy.\n\nCONS --  There's no campaign mode!  I suppose these aren't hugely common in strategy games, but they should be.  Playing a standard match is fun and all, but it can get a little stale after a while.  Having a campaign mode, with varying types of missions that require different strategies to accomplish objectives, and (gasp!) a story that tied it all together??  Come on, that would be awesome.  And making a unique campaign for each race would be out of this world!  Unfortunately, no such luck.  Just your typical choice of race, map size and number of opponents -- ready, set, go....\n\nJust as bad probably is the lack of any real strategy in combat.  Most battles/wars can be won with sheer numbers.  Researching the military tree and designing ships helps some, sure, and choosing so-called battle plans can potentially make a little difference, but in the end it really just comes down to "Paper, Rock, Scissors" and either a little luck or a lot more ships than the other guy.\n\nLastly, I found the diplomacy and trade relations with other races rather disappointing.  I wanted to feel like these were real, living beings that I was up against/allied to, with feelings or ambitions or bloodlust or a combination of different things, but they aren't anything more than pieces on a gameboard.  Other than a list of some numerical stats and an emoji (literally, an emoji), there's nothing to suggest your diplomatic actions, trade, or aggressive behavior affects them or your relationship with them, at all.  For me, its about immersion I guess, and the difference that a pop-up with an animated ambassador would make is significant.  If you don't care about that kind of thing though, then this point is probably moot.\n\nOVERALL --  I had zero trouble putting nearly thirty hours into this game right away, and I'll still put in more over the course of time.  Even though it lacks a campaign mode to sink your teeth into, the standard matches are still very fun to play, and there are plenty of races and ways to gain victory (not just combat-related) to keep you entertained.  Lots of amazing little details add up to make this one heck of a game, and even though it lacks in a few areas none of it is enough to bring it down.  If you enjoy turn-based 4x strategy games and sci-fi/space themes, Endless Space is a must have.","March 2","true","29.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Resources: The FIDS system is pretty much forward and allows to manage your empire on a very easy understandable, but yet not so easy to master level. The decision too whether transform a gas planet up to terran/jungle/ocean or not e.g. isn't as simple as it seems first - provided you do not have all improvements unlocked yet. But in the end, this has a feelable impact on your overall resources. Another thing i really like is the fact, that you have to gather stratigic resources to be competible. So in this department i can clearly say, the devs did it right.\n\n2. Diplomacy: Okay - this is one of the bad parts of the game... I really had a hard time to understand, why this game was delivered with a subpar diplomacy system. Okay - you can choose how far to bond with the other factions (from only beeing at peace, over trade relations to full scale alliances), but still it seems a bit to simple in the given options. Another offset is the - IMO - strange diplomacy rating towards your faction. I still don't get, why some of them really hate me, although i play these extremly harmless, but cute Amoebes... - perhaps it's because of the amorph appearance - who knows...;) The only thing it's good for is to gather strategic resources and gain some money and research from your traderoutes.\nSo in general diplomacy isn't a real strenght of this game.\n\n3. Combat: Yeah, some of us still remember the good old Masters of Orion games. At this time i loved the combat mechanics. The cool thing about Endless Space is, that i am somewhat reminded of these glorious times... :D\nGuys and Girls: Do NOT only stick to the general rating of your fleet! in the end it all depends on your fleet setup, skill choices and knowledge of the enemy. I've easily won fights against a higher rated fleet, just because of a few bombers on my ships and the right battle action choices. The manual fights are - compared to the rest of the game - a bit of an eyecandy, but pretty useless and timerobbing at least. After about 5-7 fights i started to stick to the automatic mode - it'll do the job ;)\n\n4. Planetary Management: This is the spice and flavour of the game! I really liked the micromanagement in the first to second third of the game. As in every good 4x game you sometimes have to think twice, when managing your colonies. Maximum research output, although some planetary bonuses are more cropfriendly? Standard situations in managing your systems/planets. This is something Endless Space gets right! I really love the fact, that a lot of improvements solely depend on your planettypes, the resources and percs of them. It does make a slight difference just to have a moon, special resources or anomalies. Last, but not least the graphics are quite nice... ;)\n\n5. Races: Yeah - this is the section, where the devs got it right. Good balanced and nicely designed races and the ability to costumize your own races. I simply love this one.\n\n6. Longtime Motivation: A 4x game must have a high replayability. Given the extremely high level of customability, this is a yes for this game!\n\n7.

I have tried, tried SO hard to play this.\n\nThe tech tree is an incredible mess, the combat is not that great (but I understand why it is turn based), and the A.I. does nothing but spam and attacks at random. Usually in most 4X games I can figure it out after the 10th hour and have fun... This game? You have literally no idea how to play out any of the races and what techs are good for the start because of how spread out everything is. Pirates are so bad I had to turn them off to keep them from wiping my defensive fleets out.\n\nI've played on Normal, and the A.I. will almost always have more fleets with a total strength of 5000-10000 compared to the measly 3000 you could churn out. There's literally no way for you to pump out a good enough fleet without going bankrupt (even then you can't win against an endless stream of fleets being flung at you), because the A.I. has advantages even on the easiest difficulty.\n\nYou know if I could support a good enough fleet to hold off the endless hordes of ships I wouldn't complain about the research. The research tree just pads out the game's playtime since everything is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ spreadout. Especially when there is technology you really need in order to have a competent fleet. Heck, even on 'Fast' I couldn't get anything done because of the research tree's overall design.\n\nOkay, I get that there are limiting factors to you expanding but... the A.I. has NO limits and expands wherever it can even if it is within your borders. The A.I. gets bonuses that allow it to continue to expand and because of this I am guessing this is where this endless stream of fleets come from. Whereas YOU on the otherhand have to deal with constant disapproval rates and economy.\n\nNo matter how I played or what I did to improve my play the A.I. (or pirates) just sends it's endless fleets of ships and destroys everything I have. It's almost as bad as the Infinite Elephant beam from Civ. Almost.\n\nEndless Space?

However, it is also missing a lot of the personality both those titles portrayed.  It plays a lot faster, but in general is a lot less "involved".\n\nPros:\nCustom Races\nMultiple Tech Research Trees\nMore Streamlined With Less Micromanagement\nCustom Design Ships\nStrategic Resouces Really Matter\nEasy Access Information VIA Sortable Charts/Tables\nCan Manage All Systems From A Single Screen\n\nCons:\nVery Little/Limited Diplomacy\nVery Simplified Combat (blessing or a curse depending on tastes)\nNot Very Immersive (most of your time is spent looking at data in charts/tables, giving it a less organic feel)\nTravel Between Systems Is Too Restricted (does not have the open world exploration feel of typical 4x games)\n\nThe degree of control you have over governing your race and systems is brilliant.  You can micromanage as much or as little as you want.  Instead of individually micromanageing every planet, this is more system based.  Upgrades such as building improvements are system wide, yet you can still terraform individual planets and set a planetary focus.\n\nCombat is very much like it is in Galactic Civilizations 2, but with some added tactic options that can be employed in each of 3 combat phases.  You do not individually control your ships, but instead issue a fleet wide order each turn.  This makes combat take a min instead of an hour like in Masters of Orion 2, yet you still have some tactical options that actually matter.\n\nIf you enjoy custom designing and controlling a space faring race with a focus on maximum efficiency, while having control over the degree of micromanaging involved and having turns and combat that don't take forever,  then this may be the game for you.  However, if you are looking for an immersive tactical experience with personality, you may wish to give this a pass.\n\nI personally feel that it's a dencent game overall, but it could have been better.  It's nice to have a 4x game that is fast paced, but you sacrifice a lot of depth to get it.","March 25","true","152.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

RIGHT?\nThen out of nowhere Endless Space pops out, BAM! I certainly didn't expect it!\nThough as this one is no accident, it's like "Oh it was in development? WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THIS CROSSOVER-LIKE CHILD?!"\n\nWell, atleast now it came out and it's beautiful, i wanted this.\n___________________________________________________\n\nWithout further due, here's the review of the game:\n\n\n-The gameplay's awesome and the visuals are just stunning, this game hooks you up in an instant!\n\n-At first it's a bit difficult to get used to, due to the complex elements like Civilization (Resources, managing, politics etc.)\nYou'll learn the basic ropes in an hour, but the harder knots in a few hours more.\nBut it's fun and immersive!\n\n-The sound effects are Ahh and Ohh and the combat effects in beam-weapons are just music to your ear\n\n-Though traveling from one star system to another is EASIER than in MoO2 due to the quick links (makes the exploration much enjoyable)  colonizing planets is just as dope as in MoO2!\n\n_______________________________\n\nNow to the negative side of this:\n\n-The combat camera might be tricky at some points and the soundtrack might seem looping the three songs all over, it might get on your nerves at some point of the game.\n\n-Combat consist of three stages on the strict time-line:\n1. Long range\n2. "Come closer and say that to my face"\n3. "Pirates of the Carribean -close" Du du dun dun du du dun dun, du du duuu...\nWhich reminds me, that you probably can't BOARD the ship, which you could do in MoO2 and capture (i haven't figured that one out...)\nWhat if i'd just want to stay like... Long range and beam 'em?\n\n-Combat's NOT turn based, it's completely automated. (Which is a bummer in a turn based game, thank you based space)\n\n-Planet invasion has no animations.\nIt's either you bomb the living hell from the buildings or the people liberate them, OR then you ODST down to planet surface (again automated) and deliver some 'Murican freedom right to their doorstep.\n\n-MISSILES, MISSILES and... MISSILES! what else you might need? Oh, ARMOR. That's all you need as the beams and laser-pews  are just plain useless against the PROTON TORPEDOES! (MoO2 had them, atleast they hit in the same turn)\n\n-The contact of another factions is dull and boring\nNo animations on the different races which would give them some personality (like in MoO2, in which every race seemed like an unique individual in the contacting of it. neat animations, distinct soundtrack and expressions, you could maybe say the same thing is in Civilizations)\n\n-No goverment of any kind.\nThe population is just dead silent and the only thing they're showing is how satisfied they are. Some kind of civilian-contacts from planets would be great, atleast from a secretary who's in charge for the population.\n"The people would like some heaters on Planet-X, it's freezing there!" or something like that.\nThough this would have a double-sided effect, it would be a nice detail though it might annoy in a long run. Ofcourse, ignore has been a darn effective way of saying:\n"k well lol no maybe later."\n\n-Further into the game it just pops up some notifications from time to time about a trade, alliance or whatever.\nThen the question is everytime. "Now who was that... the Reds? uhhh... Sowers? was i in allegiance with them or... what?"\nThe game could have distinct Leader names, so i could know who the ♥♥♥♥ i'm whooping and who's under my wing.\n\n-The AI in this game is in favour of Sowers, Sowers, Sowers, Imperium and Sowers, which Sowers fill the rainbow of faction colours. (They should rename this game Sower Space, come on, some variety in the AI random selection, eh?)\n\n-Big bad guys are missing.\nThe one's that threaten your whole existence.\nThe one's, who's home universe you would invade with a whole fleet for a retaliation and rip out the whole root of evil.\nThe ones that are really ugly.\nMaster of Orion's Antarans.\n♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and their little peashooters that swiss-cheesed my Titans. (Okay, everyone's. They were just a plain in the tail-end.)\nYet, i wish this game had these kind of forces of evil, atlaest the kinds that are in Mass Effect. Cowards. Tentacloids.\nNo, not a fetish thing srsly. Gotta prease the Japanesu honoruru popurashion\n\n-The voice acting in this game.\nWait. Is there? I wish there was. It's too quiet. I guess nobody can hear you talk in space...\nI'm lonely... *sob*\n\n-The ship designs are a bit too... Confusing.\nInstead of looking like spaceships with combat capabilities, they look like dump-trucks with a lifting arm on them, centipede-spiders, butt-plugs, nailclippers and yachts (without the swimmingpools on the deck and palms) if the designs of different ship-classes could be interchangeable (like stolen blueprints from different factions or something like that) it would be just pickle-pleasing.\n\n-I want to preview my planet up close and it's cities.\nIt seems like only the big things are visible from the viewer.\nNot a phallic thing, you creeps\n\n-Population assigment is non-existant\nAs the development of the whole star-system is completely driven by infrastructure and it's improvements (That means, if you have a tricked out star-system later in the game and you colonize the late-planet in the same system, it's gonna have all the straws and pops too)\n\n-A story mode for each race would be so wished, that i'd start a second christmas for it.\n_______________________________________\n\nThings that i'd personally like, something fresh in these type of games:\n\n-Minigames!\nPlanet exploration with a fighter, collect resources and have rescue missions.\n(maybe implement Dungeon of the Endless somehow on the significant planets)\n\n-3D Hangar\nPreview your ships and customization of some sort.\n\n-Objectives\nWhat could be nicer than random generated objectives or race-specific ones, that provide you some dough and experience points?\n\n____________________________________\n\nNow to my conclusion:\n\nAs this game is young, these things might have been forgotten/overseen while the devs have been drunk and have  probably planned all that later in the game (which i certainly hope they do so. When sober.) these are just the details of it.\nThe core-idea's strong and gameplay is solid and the atmosphere in this game is pleasantly void.\nIt was about time, that there was a game that was even compareable to Civ and MoO2\nat the same time.\nAs a teenager of a game, this doesen't focus on small things, but the bigger ones that matter.\nThis is forgiveable for now, but when Endless Space grows, you'd expect more of it.\nAs the parents the Dev's should improve this game instead of making a new child (in that case they should be slapped and put in the corner to shame.)\n\nBut let's hope for the best.\nAs this game might be the next big thing, what the younger generation would remember like i'd remember Master of Orion.\nLet's hope so.\n\nShould you buy this?\nYes.\n\nFor a full price?\nNot at this stage, but when it had it's improvements... i'd pay more.\n\nLike the merchants in the Metro 2033 would say:\n"Better than your TBS.

Appalling, nonsensical idiocies simply ooze out of this game.\n\nExhibit A. Linear, corridor combat where even ships with no guns can 'blockade' your attacking force and prevent it from moving until you destroy those ships. And you must destroy them one fleet at a time regardless of their relative strength. Fleets of tiny cardboard scouts or huge bullet sponges with no guns can thus blockade overwhelmingly strong armadas and entire star systems for an indefinite number of turns as more worthless ships are churned out and added to the stack, or retreating ships immediately return and rejoin the fray. Combat pointlessly drags on and on where more sensibly you would blast out the entire stack of fleets in one turn or better yet, go around them because they don't have the firepower to prevent you. But not here. Here you are stuck in a 1D corridor and must blast out the barriers one at a time to get through. This is simply an appalling game mechanic for a 3D space game. No. No. No. *No!*\n\nExhibit B. You cannot destroy planets only take them over after a minimum of 8 turns of siege or a highly costly invasion that can quickly deplete your population. This is simply a recipe for dragging out combat. Overwhelming strong sieges (100:1 or more) still take 8 turns whereas they should just blast right through the guy so you can move on. Here there objective seems to be to explicitly inhibit crushing weak enemies by blasting them into dust or by sweeping over them. This slows combat down and turns it into a slog.\n\nExhibit C. Negotiating peace with one member of an alliance immediately forces peace with all the other members without compensation or negotiation. Nor can you negotiate peace with them all at once to get something from everybody. Very beneficial peace settlements with one member must therefore be ignored or the game grinds to a halt while you wait out the peace delay to continue your war with the rest of the alliance. Again, this just artificially drags out the game for no reason and no value.\n\nAnd I could go on, but *despite* these debilitating design decisions, Endless Space is still worth playing.\n\nThe reason that this is so is because the other aspects of the game compensate for the dumbnesses and the grindy combat. The excellent and deep research tree, the ability to terraform your planets, the special race base characteristics combined with the very broad ability to customize your own race, and the excellent art assets all come together to produce something worth your while. You will need patience to put up with the grindy combat and the ability to turn a blind eye to some of the nonsensical things that go on, but if you can, you will be rewarded with an enjoyable and interesting game with significant replayability.\n","May 3, 2015","true","123.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No other genre has the power to keep me going, turn after turn, well past the time that any sane person would have collapsed from sleep deprivation. I grew up on Master of Orion, and I honestly have to say that I enjoy it more than MoO or MoO2. That's mostly due to the convenience improvements that this game has over those older games, plus it just looks beautiful. The "synchronous turn" approach works brilliantly.\n\nShip combat is a bit of a mixed bag, though. I do miss the turn-based combat of MoO, but I recognize the advantages of the CCG-style approach. Ship combat could get tedious in MoO and often wasn't that compelling, since it didn't require a great deal of strategy. In Endless Space, each battle is over quickly, and battles over star systems can last many turns. This means that each battle could be just a small part of a larger, ongoing conflict that is much more interesting. On the other hand, I'm not a big fan of the weapons system. I honestly don't know why you should pick one weapon type over another, but it just so happens that the weapon type I chose worked pretty well. *shrug*\n\nI could go on with the comparisons to MoO, but most of you probably haven't played it. Basically, this is a really great 4X, empire-building game. I highly recommend you give it a try. It could be a bit daunting at first, though, so I'd recommend starting light with a "throwaway" session, where you just try things to see what happens. You'll pick up most of what you really need to know as you play the game.

Plus the customary massive range of other things (repair systems, weapons boosters, troops, anti-population/infrastructure weapons, scouting modules, etc). You can try to specialize (with "wall" ships protecting "glass cannons" at the back of the fleet, specialist support ships that carrry power modules that increase the rest of the fleets weapon damage, and many other options), or just lots of similar ships maybe not as strong due to being jack of all trades, but meaning damaged fleets can just merge together without missing a key element, etc. And that is even before considering what your scouting of enemy fleets tells you about what weapons systems and defenses they are using and whether you want to adapt your fleets to take advantage of that (and risk being weak against a third party attack, or the next wave of his fleets that have a completely different weapons systems/defense preferences).\n\nThe battle system is pretty much "auto calc" only, although you can watch (and they look fairly cool the first few times through), and you make a few strategic choices (and if you watch you can adapt to the enemies tactics or changing situation slightly). Personally I think it works fine here - it keeps the strategic part of the game flowing, especially in the late game when there are lots more fleets around and turns would otherwise take an eternity while at war (as many half won games of MOO2/MOO3/Ascendancy/etc. got eventually abandoned due to being too close to autocalc everything, but too slow to actually feel like taking the time to grind out the last remnants of the enemy).","January 16, 2015","true","684.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The level of immersion is wonderful. Everything is extremely customizeable. The whole tactic of having to balance your resources within the system--managing happiness and food--makes it a very unique experience (especially when these systems are highly randomized). There are a number of factors that make replayability extremely high, including the wildly diverse tech trees, unique factions, race-specific technologies, advantages, and disadvantages...\n\n...but my god. The tutorial system.\n\nAs someone whose job description includes writing how-tos, I can say, with tenured authority, that their tutorial system is absolutely horrible.\n\nThe 'tutorials' are screens that pop up the first time you play, and give you a screen cap (of a sampel screen) with numbers, and a wall of text on the right. No context, nothing leading you through--it's like getting an instruction manual, whose pages are only accessible while you're playing the game. To put it into context, it's as though you were taught to play Monopoly using a tutorial that didn't tell you that you could buy houses until you've acquired your first set by pure accident.\n\nThere's no campaign, no tutorial mission, no walk-through, no 'live example'--hell, the damn thing doesn't even tell you how the various win conditions work.\n\nWhich, with a game as rich and deep as Endless Space, is absolutely appauling.\n\nWhat's worse, the complete lack of interactivity makes the tutorials extremely boring, and the fact that it only pops up to let you read once you've encountered an immediate need for it means that these boring walls of text will pop up as you're finally getting into the action, bringing the whole experience to a grinding halt.\n\nIf you've got a lot of time and patience to learn all the subtle nuances (mostly on your own, since the tutorials, boring as they might be, are also woefully inadequate in offering context), then you'll likely (eventually) get a hell of a kick out of Endless Space.\n\nFor everyone who doesn't have that kind of time, and just wants to be able to jump on, colonize some planets, sign a treaty, kill a bug, and shuffle along your merry way, then I cannot warn you vehemently enough about how throughly the tutorial will ruin your gaming experience.","June 27, 2014","false","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

In my mind if you have a fleet that has a higher military strength then your opponent then you should win. However I have been in battles where I have done close to 0 damage and the enemy does 10,000’s in damage even though I have a higher battle value. That to me shows that there a flaw in the game.

What happened to it being my turn?\n\nJust overall not a well-thought-out game.","April 18, 2015","false","35.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

A lack of an effective unit cap results in WAAAAAY too many repetitive and boring battles, forcing you to partake in far too much of the worst acpect of this game. We are talking of 50 to 100+ NPC fleets. The tactic is also abundantly used in multiplayer matches. It feels cheap runs counter to superb unit customization, hero abilities, and fleet building mechanics.

Verdict still doesn't change, as I think you can buy far better games.\n\nFirst, let's start with the Pro's of this game.\n\n- The Cinimatics are nice.\n- The Soundscore is awesome.\n- The U.I. is very clean.\n- Ship design is unique and cool looking.\n\nNow, for the long list of Con's.\n\n- The A.I. is cheaty and only seems to play one way.\n- There is no real feeling of exploration.\n- No visuals of any kind for planetary upgrades.\n- Limited ship builds which are very basic.\n- Simple bugs such as destroyed enemy ships warping cinematic never fixed.\n- Gameplay leaves you longing for more.\n\nBasically, this game feels like a good Beta build.  Much of everything is there, but lacks a lot of polish which would make this game exceptional.  The A.I. does not seem to hide the cheaty nature of what normally would be impossible play for a normal player.  Little things such as showing devlopment of planets when you upgrade them, were never added.  Even building your ships have a severe hindrance of being very very basic in design.\n\nMany little details leave you feeling like this is an unfinished game.  Small bugs which should have been patched out long ago, like seeing a 'warp away' cinematic even if you destroy all the enemy ships, still remain in this game.  Exploration consists of visiting the next planetary system over, but has left out any other type of 'anomaly' exploration.  (ie. no Blackholes, Vagrant ships, Pulsars, etc.)\n\nIn the end, with a bit more devlopment, and the addition of just a few things, the game would have improved significantly.  It feels like a format for a game was designed, but a vast majority of content was left out, leaving some nice eye-candy, but nothing filling.\n\nI would not recommend this game if you are looking for something long-term... I mean, unless you are interested in playing Multiplayer only, because Single player, the A.I. pulls fleets of ships from nowhere.  Management is minimal and a lot of the game focuses solely on moving ships around and your research tree.  Really, there is no depth here.","November 25, 2015","false","74.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","3"

Not to mention, throwing almost endless high powered fleets of ships if war is declared against the player and to add further insult, knowing almost intimate information about the players empire so it can attack your weakest points at any time, like many 4x games - basically the AI is programmed to cheat since thats the easiest way to program an AI to give a human player a challenge, even on the newbie difficulty A.I difficulty makes me want to face palm.   I'd like to know how its possible for an A.I player with a couple of planets to have nearly double the score I have sometimes when I have nearly triple the star systems, wonders and a large fleet of ships?\n\nSome would say its a "Smart A.I" but there is a difference between a proper smart A.I and one that has been programmed with cheap bonuses that more or less gives it a clear winning edge against the player.   Also, I think the galaxy map isn't big enough, the so called "Huge" map feels quite small by comparison to other 4x space strategy games with maybe less than a 100 star systems without mods.  Many of the good mods unfortunately break the game completely as they haven't been updated, these mods we're perhaps the saving grace of the game but now its more or less been abandoned.\n\nLike someone commented, this game seems to be better played co-op against A.I players.  Single player just isn't worth your time, especially if your a 4x fan - ES seems to be more like a zerg rush than empire building, which weakens the gameplay considerably -  so the title really should be changed to Endless Zerg or Endless Fleets.\n\nI think the premise of the game is fairly good, the graphics, sound - all that is fine.   The problem really lies with the execution of the gameplay, thats where it falls down.    I think a sequel that fixes all the major problems the original has would be a good contender for the top 4x space strategy title,  but they need to fix a lot of problems and make sure they don't make the same mistakes.\n\n4x space strategy is about expansion, empire building - in a nutshell turtling out your empire, building fleets - defending choke points - exploring the galaxy.  ES does this, but in such a way it all takes the back burner,  the galaxy without 'working' mods is way too small - The AI cheats too much to make the game fun or interesting, so a sequel needs better programmed AI without infinite bonuses or other stupid stuff.\n\nOverall, 4/10\nEndless Space isn't 'terrible' per say, but AI does heavily let the game down.  GalCiv remains the king of 4x space strategy games.  I'm glad I got this from the Humble Bundle sale, I would never pay full price for this.   I would like to see a sequel to see if they can improve the game.","July 24, 2015","false","20.7"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","3"

All you do is wait for research and colonize.\n\nTutorial pretty much sux, you just have to learn it as you play.\n\nIt seems that the AI has unlimited resources and is only interested in fighting you. You have to actually research diplomancy, like cease fire. Only 1 game did I not get my ♥♥♥ kicked on easy level. How you supposed to learn a game when the AI just walks all over you constantly.\n\nOne senario I had 20 systems (every planet colonized), AI had 4 (with 1 or 2 planets colonized) and yet managed to keep up with me in research and it had way more ships then me. Which meant it only builds ships and nothing else. I had the AI blocked in, attacked a planet with my 25 ship fleet (cruisers and battleships)  and then all of a sudden it was pumping out 25 ships (corvets initially,  then cruisers and battleships) per turn. Just walked all over me, since I couldn't keep up in ship production, since my ships take anywhere from 4-20 turns to build, depending on improvements. I did manage to capture 1 system, and yet it had no improvments at all.\n\nI also don't like how you capture systems, evey ship can be used to capture a system. You don't have troops, bombs or anything like that. Just move a ship into a enemy system and it can capture it. Ofcourse the bigger the fleet, that faster it can capture a system. I had ships defending a neutral system, meaning any enemy ship entering that system was supposed to be attack immediately. Yet that didn't happen, AI just shot right past them. Didn't even notice it until it was too late.\n\nI should mention that everyone has exactly the same research options. There's no unique research for different races.\n\nEven though systems have multiple planets, you only build as a system. Six planets and you can still only build as a system, why even have multiple planets in a system if you can't build individualy on each?\n\nTHere is  an approval rating, but I can never keep it in the green, no matter how much you try. Frankly I just ignore it, doesn't seem to have any affect on thing. Went 60 turns with a zero approval rating in many of my systems, it didn't slow anything down.\n\nLots of thingss I still don't understand about the game and never will, it just gets boring and it frustrates the sh*t out of you.\n\nThe most annoying bug in the game is that all of a sudden in every system everything takes 999 turns to build, meaning you will never build anything again. Happens randomly, earilest was on turn 20, latest was on turn 70. I clicked forward a couple of turn to see if it clears up, it didn't and I quit that game. Haven't been able to complete a game yet.\n\nI quit playing this months ago, thought I'd try it and it's still a pile of sh*t.","August 2, 2014","false","31.9"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","0"

Long before our eyes gazed upon the stars they flew between them, though all that remains of this people is what we call Dust. A substance found scattered or in forgotten temples, it once gave powers to admirals and galactic governors.\nThere's no denying, that Amplitude Studios' debut is spot on. There's epicness and complexity that make the player use tactical thinking, teach management, panience and provr that war isn't always the key to victory. Despite a few setbacks, Endless Space is a very well made, relaxing game. It's no revolution but clearly shows that 4X games won't be forgotten.\nI could honestly write a thousand words more on what makes Endless Space so much more addicting and absorbing than the bulk of its contemporaries. Visually, it's detailed and opulent where it needs to be, yet simple and clean everywhere else. It makes its voluminous level of complexity accessible with a terrific interface which affords a pace and ease of management that few other games in the genre can match. But I'm not going to write those thousand more words, folks. I've got a galaxy that's waiting to be conquered, one more time.\nEndless Space is a tribute to intelligent design and meticulous polish, offering endless hours of micro management goodness on all fronts. Whether you are duking it out against an accomplished AI in the games single player or vying for cultural dominance online, this 4X turn based wonder accommodates all levels of experience and play styles, providing countless sessions of entertainment for newbies and pros alike.","July 17, 2014","true","123.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Among the first games I started playing were the Command & Conquer games (they were SO good, until Zero Hour.. Then it went downhill), so I have experience with fast paced RTS's. I also have sunk many hours into Alpha Centauri, which is more of a 4X/Civ building game. I have played games such as Rise of Nations, Empire Earth, Age of Empires, and many other Strategy games. Now I feel like I know a good Strategy game when I see one, and let me tell you this one of those good ones. Endless Space is a great game for those of you that are 4X/CIv Building fans (not so much for the faster paced RTS fans though you may still enjoy it with the game speed cranked up). If you liked Alpha Centauri, and games like it, you will likely love this game (it is not as in-depth compared to Alpha Centauri too). So far I have sunk 40+ hours into the game (playing on normal speed, so that's only been 1 completed game and 2 that I have yet to complete). I have only played as 3 races thus far. The Sowers have been my favorite of the ones I have played as, they seem the most balanced and have a great late game ship class. The other races I played as, the Siphons and Sherydn (not sure on the spelling of those two), didn't seem as well balanced but are still very playable. Graphically and soundtrack wise the game is great too. I have had a few minor bugs (ship health being displayed incorrectly and one of my fleets derping out) but they were not too bad. As I said, just minor bugs.\nOverall, it seems like a well put together game. If you're a fan of Alpha Centauri or games like it, get this for sure. I got the game on a Steam Sale, but I would have payed full price for it. It is well worth 30 dollars. Sorry, about the long review. Again, my main point is if you are a strategy fan and want a good space/sci-fi game then get this!","July 11, 2014","true","143.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only did it combine both of my favorite genres, but it was an indie game as well. So I decided to take it for a spin. Little did I realize that I would be sucked into a vibrant universe and asking my wife to allow me "Just one more turn!"\n\nEndless Space plays like a standard 4X game. The player guides his race in gathering resources, researching technologies, building up a military force, and managing star systems in an attempt to conquer the galaxy. What sets this title apart from its peers is how it combines these elements together. First off, the game is easy to learn. This is because the interface is clean and very intuitive. Gone are the days of sifting through various menus to find out what something is and what you are working on. For example, if you want to see what you are researching, just click on the research button. You are then presented with an easy to read research tree with the current project highlighted. Also, if you are unsure what something is or does, just mouse over the item and it will tell you what it is. As with any game of this type, managing your far flung empire later in the game can get tedious. Amplitude Studios combats this problem in a unique way. When an event happens you are notified by a pop-up that will take you to the event when you click on it. If multiple events are present, this pop-up will remain until the player dismisses it or has addressed all the events listed. While this goes a long way to ease empire management, it does not totally resolve the problem. Later turns can still be long and drawn out while you deal with these events.\n\nThe combat in Endless Space is where the game excels. The player can either have the computer resolve the battle automatically, or the player can take control and fight the battle. It is one of the few titles that I have played where tactics are essential. Do I send my fighters in first or do I bombard the enemy from a distance. Each choice affects not only if you are successful, but how many losses one sustains. The game also rewards players for using a mix of ship types. While yes, one could win a battle with a battle group composed of only battleships, but a "combined arms" battle group will make the battles quicker with less losses. This creates a world where each battle is different, and sometimes the "weaker" side will win.\n\nThe only problem with Endless Space is that the factions are balanced too well. No matter what faction you play, you have some sort of built in counter that negates the other faction's abilities. At first this made the game really easy to play and but soon it can become monotonous. Most of the balance issues have been addressed with the Disharmony DLC and patches, but some of them still remain.\n\nOverall, I have to give Endless Space 9 out of 10 stars. This highly polished and easy to learn game has raised the standard for not only games from the 4X genre, but indie games as well. I highly recommend it to not only fans of the 4X genre, but new players as well. Just make sure to say goodbye to your friends and family before you play!","April 26, 2014","true","33.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It would be one of my favourite games, if it was just a bit better balanced. There are so many stats and sub-systems in place, that the AI easily gets out of control, and reacting to that requires hundreds of turns (hours). It's easy to find out that the more efficient, optimal, way to win a match, is to complete one of those endless tech tree branches and get a "tech/political" victory. When  you win this way twice, after endless, frustrated, attempts to follow other strategies, you just lose your interest for the game. Still, it was fun and joyful to play.

It has pretty great civ customization options, a pretty good galaxy customization scheme, and a neat approach to in-universe tech explanations. The devs are pretty good with long-term upkeep, and have released regular updates so far.\n\nHowever, it is a bit awfully easy to win using economic, science, and wonder victories. As in, extremely easy unless you're playing on the top-tier difficulties. The combat isn't particularly deep and doesn't really get any better, and the hero system is pretty useless sometimes.\n\nDisharmony adds a neat dimension to the game by removing a quarter of the economic system as a challenge, but you'll only end up playing as the Harmony once you're comfortable with the game. Since they're packing a lot of new features in updates for Disharmony, I'd say it's probably worth it.\n\nAll in all, Endless Space + Disharmony is a good purchase at prices below $20.

Jokes aside, I do really like the 4X genre... But for some reason I seem to have poor luck with them. Even when I seemingly do everything right, something goes wrong. But, such is life- right? As a wise Space Captain once said,\n\n“It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness; that is life.”\n\nI feel like that sums up my time so far with Endless Space. Except the mistakes part, I’m sure I made a lot of those. And while losing isn’t a bad thing, it’s certainly a bitter pill to swallow. Especially when you’re boxed into the eastern arm of a spiral galaxy and one hundred fifty galactic years of bitter and vicious war only let you expand your borders by one system, because the giant Space Amoebas swoop in and steal your hard fought systems out from under you with their super stupid advanced technology…\n\n...\n\nThis review is WAY too long to post on steam, it literally won't let me! so if you like what you've read so far head on over to 100hoursave.com to read the rest! http://wp.me/p4gn9l-il more specifically.\n\nBut I think it should go without saying, this game is dope as hell and you should buy it.","January 14","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Afterall, that's what made Homeworld such a fantastic game, was the minute RTS control of the entire fleet including the economy.\n\nHowever, I found that the pace of this game, and greater focus on Empire building and Macro development to more than make up for the battle instances.  And while it took me awhile to appreciate how the "cinematic turn based" fighting occurred, I became a big fan of sort of "issuing a strategy" and then watching as missiles, lasers, fighters and bombers did their work on the opposing fleet.\n\nWhile not quite as deep in ship design, as say, Galactic Civilizations, the interface is at least intuitive without needing to try to figure out "where to stuff something."  This ship design has X amount of things it can fit - and you fit what you want.\n\nMost importantly - the ability to retrofit your units to more modern designs as technology becomes available is simple, and keeps the game moving smoothly, since you usually have a bunch of other things to take care of each turn.\n\nIn short, this is perhaps my favorite space-based 4x game I've played in the last decade.  And I really enjoyed the usual (Sword of the Stars and the like) ones, but for me this game has stood out.  It is not as complex as many of the games in the genre, but in my opinion really captured the spirit that I have not happened since I was a 10 year old sneaking onto the computer late at night to play Master of Orion until it was time for school in the morning.","January 24","true","73.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are the emperor of a galactic empire. You start off small and slowly through warfare, trade, diplomacy and exploitation you grow into a huge empire spanning hundreds of stars. There are a variety of empires to choose from ranging from a hive of robotic insects who wish to devour the universe to your standard galactic human empire and a gelatinous mass of cells who are peaceful and only wish to socialize. Another excellent point are the resources. There are your basic 4 resources Food, industry, science and dust (FIDS). But there is a wealth of others to choose from. There are 2 main types of these: Strategic resources which can be used in shipbuilding and luxury resources, which confer permanent or temporary bonuses on your empire. The tech tree is a mixed bag. It's HUGE. Now this may be a good or a bad thing. There is loads to research, almost too much. With many of the coolest ones at the very end. Even very important ones are locked away. Want an alliance? Well, you have to research about 3 techs to lead up to that. Found a new resource? You're going to have to research it. Want bigger and better ships? You need to research that too! This brings us up to the next point, ships. Ships are fully customisable. With about 6 ship classes and a wealth of add-ons and modules the possibilities are endless. Unfortunately, using the ships is a different kettle of fish. When engaging in a conflict you must pick 3 "action cards, " these come in a variety of formats, but basically work like rock, paper, scissors. But when the engagement begins you get to watch it play out like a battle from Star Wars. Its cool for a while, but it soon gets old.

It will of course lead you to that good-old "just one more turn!" syndrome.

Lots of GUI glitches, quirky fleet controls, odd AI behaviour, sometimes even resulting in situations that can only be resolved by starting a new game.\nBehind the bugs, Endless Space is a solid turn-based strategy with an insane tech tree which not only has three zoom steps, but also a search box(!). It has a few base factions, each with their own design, but you can also create your own faction by picking an existing faction design. selecting an affinity, and picking perks to customise the game to your liking. Furthermore, the game is moddable, so with a bit of technical skill you can change the entire game around if you want.\nIf you can excuse a few bugs, Endless Space is definitely worth looking at if you enjoy space strategy.\nTake a look at my screenshots for a few impressions.","June 29, 2013","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Long before our eyes gazed upon the stars they flew between them, though all that remains of this people is what we call Dust. A substance found scattered or in forgotten temples, it once gave powers to admirals and galactic governors.\nThere's no denying, that Amplitude Studios' debut is spot on. There's epicness and complexity that make the player use tactical thinking, teach management, panience and provr that war isn't always the key to victory. Despite a few setbacks, Endless Space is a very well made, relaxing game. It's no revolution but clearly shows that 4X games won't be forgotten.\nI could honestly write a thousand words more on what makes Endless Space so much more addicting and absorbing than the bulk of its contemporaries. Visually, it's detailed and opulent where it needs to be, yet simple and clean everywhere else. It makes its voluminous level of complexity accessible with a terrific interface which affords a pace and ease of management that few other games in the genre can match. But I'm not going to write those thousand more words, folks. I've got a galaxy that's waiting to be conquered, one more time.\nEndless Space is a tribute to intelligent design and meticulous polish, offering endless hours of micro management goodness on all fronts. Whether you are duking it out against an accomplished AI in the games single player or vying for cultural dominance online, this 4X turn based wonder accommodates all levels of experience and play styles, providing countless sessions of entertainment for newbies and pros alike.","July 17, 2014","true","123.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love getting immersed in the feeling of space exploration and being challenged by every new system. You have to ponder 'Should I colonize this system right now, or wait until I've researched more terraforming technologies? Should I specialize it as an industry system, or use it for economy and research? Is building this huge, expensive improvement worth it, or should I stick to the smaller improvements in this system?'.\n\nThe other side of this feeling is that the things you do in this game are at the macro-strategy level. You don't build single buildings on planets, you build improvements for the whole solar system. You don't manage single trade routes, you build trade improvements in systems, and the trade routes will automatically connect your systems with those of other civilizations you are at peace with, in the most profitable way. You don't tell every single ship in a battle where to move, you set fleet formations at the beginning of a battle, and choose general strategies (Things like 'weapon overclock', 'camouflage', 'sabotage', 'repair', and many more) and aiming patters ('spread fire', 'concentrate on one enemy' etc.) for each battle phase (Long-Range, Medium Range, Melee Range), and aside from that, can't influence the course of battle.\n\nMany players criticize this, but I have the impression that this is part of the narrative, and implementing micro-management options would rather hurt the game flow. In this game, you are responsible for the grand strategies, and this is reflected in the mechanics.\n\nOther elements of this game that are important for my recommendation, personally:\n- All of the factions are interesting and have a ship style that fits them well\n- The music, made by FlyByNo, is magnificent! It enhances the game greatly.\n- The User Interface is amazingly clear and elegant. With 4X games generally being complicated, this makes Endless Space significantly more beginner-friendly and comfortable to play.","December 28, 2015","true","133.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love 4x space games, and like a lot of us am still waiting for the successor to Master of Orion 2 to come along. I'd been hoping ES would finally succeed where so many others had failed. In fact, I periodically download and play it again hoping that maybe I was wrong and there's a good game buried in there somewhere.\n\nThere's not.\n\nAs many people have written the biggest problem is combat. There's nothing interesting about it. There are three types of weapons and three types of defenses. Each gets linearly more powerful as you tech up, and each defense stops one type of weapon and is useless against the other two. If you have the right defense against an enemy ship you win. If you don't, they win. There's a system where you play three cards to influence the battle, but it moves too slowly and has too little impact to make any difference.\n\nThere's no diversity of units like in Civilization nor tactical combat like in Master of Orion (or the brilliant Total War series). There's just a big game of rock, paper, scissors. One side wins, the other side loses, you rebuild and repeat. Don't bother with any other type of victory either. There's no room for cleverness in a rocks/paper/scissors system and no stationary defenses, so if you don't put everything into your military the player who did will crush you every time.\n\nIt's the same with domestic policy. Your systems have to specialize, so you pick whether a system will produce money, tech or industry, plug in all the appropriate buildings and then auto build cash, science or ships. You don't really decide which to do, because each planet is good for one particular thing so the system composition pretty much decides this for you. There's nothing interesting happening in the galaxy or territory uniquely worth fighting over, no external threat or game changing discoveries. Even the little tactical interest that comes from star lanes and wormholes is gone shortly into the game once ships can fly through open space.\n\nBy the mid-game your empire is pretty much running on autopilot. Cash and science systems tick away and your only interaction is to build fleets and throw them at the enemy. Periodically you upgrade the design of your ships for new science or if the enemy switches to a different weapon.\n\nMost of the problem came from the developers' focus on making a multiplayer game. They stripped the mechanics down in order to keep them balanced, and that ultimately made the game *much* less interesting. The wonders, for example, confer system bonuses instead of being big, powerful icons that can change the course of play. System bonuses aren't interesting. I can catch up to that with a few extra factories and don't even need to if they show up on a lousy planet. But the multiplayer would be unbalanced if one person could, by random chance, stumble across a game changer.\n\nIt's the same with everything else. There are no weird discoveries to make in the galaxy or overpowered planets, like MOO2's gaians, because that would advantage one player too much. Military tech marches up rails up three branches and that's it, no clever or assymetrical weapons or decisions to make for fear of breaking things. Even the races are just a collection of relatively minor statistical differences from each other, nothiing that feels truly different or unique.\n\nThere are a lot of little things wrong with Endless Space and a couple of big ones, but ultimately the game just isn't that much fun. It feels flat and lifeless. One play through is pretty much exactly like every other and by midway through your second game you'll get bored.","March 8, 2014","false","69.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On lower to normal difficulties, victory conditions feel almost formulaic, and increasing the difficulty only serves to grant the AI opponents bonuses that still result in most combat being massive death stacks fighting over border planets, without actually increasing the complexity of AI decision making. Highlights in an otherwise lacklustre strategy title include the ability to customise ship loadouts to purpose-build a fleet to your playstyle.","March 9, 2014","false","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics are so rigid as to prevent any real play variance. For example, you are compelled into a strict regimen of  play - as any variance either too far ahead or behind results in being attacked. There is no real diplomatic and trade based approach. IN the same way, if you want to pursue a science theme, forget it - as the game is designed to "reward" following a path that essentially linear across the whole possible range of improvements. The time to discover items becomes so distorted if you try to follow a "theme", with turn times blowing out from 2-5 as an average to 30 plus if you try to go a specific route.\nThe planet developments consist of just letting it be automated - trying to decipher half the meanings of some improvements is both frustrating and pointless - there is no visual or other queues to show what you need to stop youe empire constantly going into near revolt, with half of your systems "on strike" - even at the easiest settings. As an example, at the lowest setting, playing the Empire, every system has to be set at "approval enhancements" for it to work at all.\n\nThis may sound harsh, but this was NOT a $10 game - and having played MOO II 10 tens ago, which absolutely blows this away, I expected far more than I got.","March 16, 2014","false","232.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of them that involve planets yet to be colonized mostly require advanced crap to even colonize and it may take about 50 turns to even get to that point and by then the ai has already colonized it. This may sound like "oh thats because you cant play it right", but I can beat this game, I have beaten it many times. The diplomacy system is stupid, trade is cruddy, pirates spawn way too often if you let them spawn, and the "happiness" of your empires citizens are just way too touchy. Not too mention boring space battles, which this game trys to lure people with. I do not regret paying for it per say, Just make sure you know what your getting sucked into. Oh and final note. the "community" is really nothing more than a bunch of trekkies trying to get amplitude to make a star trek mod for the game.","June 16, 2012","false","56.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have played a very wide range of titles in the genre, including MOO2, Sins of a Solar Empire, Space Empires IV and V, Galactic Civilizations II, StarDrive, and Endless Space.  I have even played some of the much older titles, such as Stars! and Spaceward Ho!\n\nUnfortunately, I have to agree with TotalBiscuit's assessment of this game: it is well put together, and it is executed adequately, but it lacks soul.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n*The user interface in this game is one of the most easy-to-use and informative Space 4X UI's I have ever seen.  I can usually get all of the information I need with a couple of clicks.  Queueing up production, changing tax percentages, or checking which systems needed my immediate attention was very accessible and intuitive.  Gone are the days when I had to make 5+ clicks just to find the information I was looking for, and then 3+ more clicks in order to implement a decision based on that information.\n\n*The music in this game is fantastic.  If I could, I would rip the music from this game and use it in the other Space 4X games that I enjoy.  I was also impressed by the fact that the music was somewhat dynamic; when I was in the main space view, the music played with its full instrumentation, but when I went into system view or ship design, the instrumentation scaled back dynamically and played a more sparse version of the same music.  I suspect they have two simultaneous tracks going on at the same time and the game dynaimcally fades from one to the other based on user actions.\n\n*The game is challenging early on.  If you don't expand quickly into different systems and establish the borders of your empire, other races will come in and take neighboring systems much earlier than you would expect.  Moreover, if other civilizations don't see you building up a strong enough military early in the game, many of them will simply declare war on you because you look like an easy target.\n\n*The tech tree is extensive and varied.  With four main branches to work through, there is plenty of new tech that can be researched through early, mid, and late stages of the game.\n\n*Victory conditions are varied and well developed.  The traditional military victory is available, of course, but you can also win the game by expansion (own a certain percentage of the galaxy), science (research enough tech to 'ascend' to a new form of existance), diplomacy (ally yourself with most/all other races, and prevent war for a certain amount of time), economic (earn/control a certain amount of resources/cash), and others.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n*Combat is by far the most disappointing aspect of this game.  Don't get me wrong--the combat is rendered beautifully, with cinematic camera movements and fabulous explosions.  Sadly, however, combat is NOT user-controllable.  Granted, you can pick rock-paper-scissors style cards that have effects on the stages of combat, but that is as far as user control goes.  I wanted to be able to direct my big battleships and dreadnoughts to strategic positions on the battlefield, while keeping close tabs on the ships that were damaged so that I could steer them away from danger.  No such luck.  As beautiful as the space battles are in this game, I found myself simply picking auto-combat again and again.\n\n*Though the races in the game have interesting back stories and differences of starting attributes, in actual gameplay, the races don't really feel much different from each other.  Sure, there are a small number race-specific techs that can be found in the tech tree, but even these don't feel much different than what can be researched by other races.\n\n*Planetary colonization and development is boring and forgettable.  There are a few key structures that you can build on each specific planet, but for the most part, the entire star system feels like a single 'colony', for which you build system-wide improvements.  The 'value' of each of these 'colonies' is vastly determined by the number of planets in the system and the amount of population that you can grow system-wide.  Gone are the challenges of a single, resource-rich, but barely colonizable planet that you have to carefully grow to become a viable production center; as long as there are other more hospitable planets in the system, then a low-value planet is virtually pain-free.\n\n*Diplomacy in this game is absolutely ridiculous.  While I like the fact that you have to research more advanced diplomacy actions (i.e. trade treaties, tech swapping, alliances, etc.), I felt like the AI was grossly weighted against you in most diplomatic situations.  Even when I was fully allied with a race, with full friendly relationships, they would still ask me for my arms, legs, first-born child, and the soul of my fleet admiral in exchange for a single new technology.  After many attempts, I simply gave up trying to trade technology with my neighbors.  Furthermore, even good races would break treaties with you seemlingly on a whim--I found myself unable to reliably predict how long my good relations with other races would last.\n\n*Ship design doesn't allow much as far as meaningful decision-making.  Most of the time, you'll be designing ships with the absolute best weaponry and armor that you have researched; there is very little reason (aside from production cost) to ever use a lesser tech.  Every once in a while, I created a specialized ship (such an invasion ship with high planetary attack capacity but very little ship-to-ship offense, or a carrier that had very little weaponry but loads of fighters and bombers on board).  In many other Space 4X games, I have the ability to design support ships (i.e. refuel, re-supply, repair, or even mobile ship construction yards), transports, miners/resource collectors, star bases, etc.  Not in Endless Space.\n\nI wanted to love this game.  I really did.  I put more than 80 hours into it, playing as various different factions (good, neutral, and evil).  But in the end, the lack of controllable combat, the clumsy and unforgiving diplomacy system, and the uninspiring planet/system management process eventually made me decide to go back to other Space 4X games.","June 26, 2014","false","86.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love 4x space games, and like a lot of us am still waiting for the successor to Master of Orion 2 to come along. I'd been hoping ES would finally succeed where so many others had failed. In fact, I periodically download and play it again hoping that maybe I was wrong and there's a good game buried in there somewhere.\n\nThere's not.\n\nAs many people have written the biggest problem is combat. There's nothing interesting about it. There are three types of weapons and three types of defenses. Each gets linearly more powerful as you tech up, and each defense stops one type of weapon and is useless against the other two. If you have the right defense against an enemy ship you win. If you don't, they win. There's a system where you play three cards to influence the battle, but it moves too slowly and has too little impact to make any difference.\n\nThere's no diversity of units like in Civilization nor tactical combat like in Master of Orion (or the brilliant Total War series). There's just a big game of rock, paper, scissors. One side wins, the other side loses, you rebuild and repeat. Don't bother with any other type of victory either. There's no room for cleverness in a rocks/paper/scissors system and no stationary defenses, so if you don't put everything into your military the player who did will crush you every time.\n\nIt's the same with domestic policy. Your systems have to specialize, so you pick whether a system will produce money, tech or industry, plug in all the appropriate buildings and then auto build cash, science or ships. You don't really decide which to do, because each planet is good for one particular thing so the system composition pretty much decides this for you. There's nothing interesting happening in the galaxy or territory uniquely worth fighting over, no external threat or game changing discoveries. Even the little tactical interest that comes from star lanes and wormholes is gone shortly into the game once ships can fly through open space.\n\nBy the mid-game your empire is pretty much running on autopilot. Cash and science systems tick away and your only interaction is to build fleets and throw them at the enemy. Periodically you upgrade the design of your ships for new science or if the enemy switches to a different weapon.\n\nMost of the problem came from the developers' focus on making a multiplayer game. They stripped the mechanics down in order to keep them balanced, and that ultimately made the game *much* less interesting. The wonders, for example, confer system bonuses instead of being big, powerful icons that can change the course of play. System bonuses aren't interesting. I can catch up to that with a few extra factories and don't even need to if they show up on a lousy planet. But the multiplayer would be unbalanced if one person could, by random chance, stumble across a game changer.\n\nIt's the same with everything else. There are no weird discoveries to make in the galaxy or overpowered planets, like MOO2's gaians, because that would advantage one player too much. Military tech marches up rails up three branches and that's it, no clever or assymetrical weapons or decisions to make for fear of breaking things. Even the races are just a collection of relatively minor statistical differences from each other, nothiing that feels truly different or unique.\n\nThere are a lot of little things wrong with Endless Space and a couple of big ones, but ultimately the game just isn't that much fun. It feels flat and lifeless. One play through is pretty much exactly like every other and by midway through your second game you'll get bored.","March 8, 2014","false","69.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics are so rigid as to prevent any real play variance. For example, you are compelled into a strict regimen of  play - as any variance either too far ahead or behind results in being attacked. There is no real diplomatic and trade based approach. IN the same way, if you want to pursue a science theme, forget it - as the game is designed to "reward" following a path that essentially linear across the whole possible range of improvements. The time to discover items becomes so distorted if you try to follow a "theme", with turn times blowing out from 2-5 as an average to 30 plus if you try to go a specific route.\nThe planet developments consist of just letting it be automated - trying to decipher half the meanings of some improvements is both frustrating and pointless - there is no visual or other queues to show what you need to stop youe empire constantly going into near revolt, with half of your systems "on strike" - even at the easiest settings.

I played for quite some time still illusioned. I still think about playing once in a while when i get bored of everything else, but this game in my opinion is just too rigged. I can understand making it a challenge. I love challenging games. This however gives the ai players all the good planets within reach and leaves you with jack squat. Random events make no sense what so ever. Most of them that involve planets yet to be colonized mostly require advanced crap to even colonize and it may take about 50 turns to even get to that point and by then the ai has already colonized it. This may sound like "oh thats because you cant play it right", but I can beat this game, I have beaten it many times. The diplomacy system is stupid, trade is cruddy, pirates spawn way too often if you let them spawn, and the "happiness" of your empires citizens are just way too touchy. Not too mention boring space battles, which this game trys to lure people with. I do not regret paying for it per say, Just make sure you know what your getting sucked into.

Or some parts that seem down right BUGGY. Multiple games I had my fleet of military ships stuck on a single star system because the enemy fleet could endlessly retreat from battle and still prevent me from going anywhere. Or my last game I had where I conquered one system and when I moved into the next all my fleets where stuck and unmovable. Literally no action could be made with them, no fighting or invading and I couldn't even move new troops into that system either.\n\nAnother terrible part of this game is that if a system is invaded even if the ship(s) have no way (or reseached the tech) to invade will still prevent all units from being made or instanly bought there. So the computer can and will incapasitate you from building military or expansion.\n\nLike when I first started playing on the easiest of like 7 difficulties newbie, there are pages and pages of tutorials for everything and every menu in this game. But thats fine its a civilization simulator, except that the AI will still beat you on newbie, they expand faster, build military faster, and anything else to win win the game better (Even if that's not their forte). Funny Civilization 5 (and civ 3) has their AI brain dead on the easiest level, so players can sandbox the game while they learn.\n\nThe fun parts arn't all that fun, but you can expand and compete for the best planets and manages your species and their approval. You and can build fleets of military ships and enjoy what amounts to reletively the same prerendered cutscene but with diferent ships and most of all random camera angles.\n\nI really did try to like this game, in fact I've play far too much civ 5 and I wanted to like this game but I don't.","January 5, 2014","false","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

LONG READ AHEAD !!!\n\nI had about 40 hours of gameplay on the clasic Emperor Edition and I loved it. Then I bought the Disharmony DLC.\nFirst thing that changed (to the bad imho) was the tech tree. The warfare tree got dumbed down. Yes, it has new features like bombers and the Siege tech to invade systems but the ship weapons pulled the short one.\nIn the description of the game they say how good it is that now you can select if you want Long, medium or melee weapons on your ships which imho is stupid. In Emperor Edition you just put the best weapons you had and if you still had space, you could put on some weaker ones to maximize dmg. In Disharmony you cant do that. If you want put Long, medium and melee weapons on the ship = you cant do that. If you put,lets say, medium range torpedos then thats all you can add in the torpedo section. You cant combine long, medium and melee.You can have only 1 type of torpedos. You also cant put weaker ones in if you want to fill up the space of the ship as I mentioned above.\nNext, the bugs.\nI said I had the Emperor edition before. When you launch the game it asks you which key to use. You have 3 options. Honestly I dont even know why are there 3 keys there. Does using the last key of the game give you some extra stuff? I dont know but there you have it.\nAfter downloading DISHARMONY all my saved games from Emperor Edition got lost. I sent them a report which didnt help at all. At that time it was a 35 hour gameplay that went Houdini. So i had to let it go.\nI started to play Disharmony. It was all good. but at the 40 hour timer buggs started to show up. 2 bugs to be specific. I dont know what they are. A window shows up and describes the problem in some programing language. 1 Bug stopped showing after a while. Dont know why. The second bug when it shows then freezes your game and you have to shut it down via Task manager. So I started to save my files more often but you also have autosaves.\nThe next that dosnt work is private multiplayer with a friend. Let me explain.\nMy friend has the Emperor Edition only (I have both). So we wanted to play a private multiplayer.\nWhen you start the game the window shows up again with 3 Emperor Editon keys and 1 Disharmony key. So I pushed the clasic Emperor Edition key so the games are compatible. But heck knows why it always starts Disharmony instead of Emperor Edition. And after the game loaded a window pops up and says that I have to launch the clasic verision of the game so I can play with my friend. No ♥♥♥♥ Sherlock. We tried so many times but it just would not work.\nOk. So we gave upon that too.\nNow I am at about 65 hours of gameplay (as Steam shows me here)\nI wanted to continue playing.\nI go to the LOAD section, pick my saved game and start it. And know it freezes at the loading. After about 20 seconds the loading freezes and I have to close it via Task manager again. I tried the autosaves. All of them. Same ♥♥♥♥. It freezes the whole game.\nSo I played 1 map for 65 hours and now I cant play it.\nHow can a game get buggier after more gameplay time?\nOther features. It says that you can put the fighters/bombers or your main battle ships in formarions. I didnt even find where to do that. I searched for some options at the Battle window when you start a fight. I searched all the HUD in the manual fight. I found nothing. I dont know if Im just so lame and cant find it even when its somewhere visible or it just isnt in the game. Also some TARGETING, which I thought will be an option that will let me target specific ships in the manual battle. Didnt find a thing that would seem to be a option like this anywhere.\n\nIn conclusion. Buy the Emperor Edition and have fun with it. Dont buy the Disharmony DLC. Its worthless\n\nI sent a long message to Amplitude as well. I hope they fix this ♥♥♥♥ of a DLC and do something about it.","January 12, 2014","false","74.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If I choose Offense and you choose offense, we both get the full effect of it and so on and so forth. That's really lame space combat add in the fact that you can't really a huge fleet.  If memory serves, only 3 big ships can be in a fleet.\n\nThe rest of the game is fine but that part is so cruciel to the gameplay that it's hard to get past.","January 22, 2014","false","110.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Set in a galaxy populated by strange, diverse races, you must expand throughout the galaxy, with the goal of dominating the galaxy through many different way, ranging from very peaceful to military subjugation.  In my time playing it, I was quickly grabbed by its clear mechanics and an awesome interface.  It wasn't until playing this that I realized what a big difference the UI made in the enjoyment of complex strategy titles.  The game is clearly inspired by the Master of Orion series, though for my money it's actually better than them.\n\n\nAs a 4x game, it has several features of the genre: expanding, researching, ship building/war, and diplomacy.  I'll talk a bit about each.\n\nEach 'star system' in this game functions similarly to a single city, in thats its production, food, science, dust (the game's currency), and approval is bound to that one system.  Each system contains up to 6 planets, of different types, that the player expands to once a planet in the system has been settled.  I found this to be an elegant middle ground that allows for a galaxy full of planets, but without the need to tediously micromanage each planet.  The different planet types range from comfortable earth-like landmasses to inhospitable lava planets.  The more difficult to settle planets offer substantial bonuses things like industry or science, but cause unhappiness and lack food of their own.   Later on, players gain the power to play god and terraform planets to suit their strategy.  Managing how to best exploit these systems is a great part of the appeal to me.\n\nStar systems are linked in a node system, though later technologies loosen things up.  I felt this provided much needed structure to the systems, and allows for strategic placing of outposts and fleets.\n\nThe game constantly presents the player with difficult choices.  I always feel pulled by several extremely useful technologies, not to mention each race's custom technologies. It always feels like there are many viable strategies to pursue, and the tech trees allow numerous ways to meet challenges.\n\nI've often found the ship building to be too complex for my tastes in other games, but everything here was straightforward for me, there were still difficult choices between weapon types and the balance between defensive and offensive units.\n\nWhile most of the game is told from a crisp overhead view of a galaxy, combat will happen (though it's possible to play very peacefully).  Fortunately, the combat is gorgeous.  Ships for each race are diverse and detailed.  Combat moves through three main phases, with each phase allowing combatants to play a 'card' that grants specific offensive or defensive bonuses.  While it cannot totally turn around lost battle, clever usage of them can enable you to overcome superior foes.\n\nThe diplomacy is simpler than I'd prefer, as is the lack of a leader screen.  It feels like an opportunity to add more personality to the game was lost.  You can set up all sorts of trade deals and alliances, but it lacks some of the more sophisticated elements that a series like Civ has.\n\nFortunately, some personality is added to the game through random events, ancient relics found on planets, and heroes which can be recruited to you empire, each with their own backstory.  Each hero can be assigned to a fleet or system, potentially making it much more powerful.\n\nThere is a satisfying snowball effect as your empire becomes more powerful.  In fact, with proper terraforming manipulation, you can easily quadruple a particular type of output across your whole empire in less than 15 turns.  It's hard to see this game reaching over 200 turns.  My first win came at 165 turns, and my third and most recent clocked in at 112.\n\nAs a nitpick, there are some mechanics for the game that I wanted a deeper explanation of.  While there is a tooltip for almost everything, I wished there was something in the game like a Civilopedia that catalogued every mechanic in depth.  It's really only need for min/maxing, but it would save having to dive into the wiki many times.\n\nOverall, this is a 4x game that I highly recommend. I've tried many, but few ever interest me like this.  It's mechanics are simple to grasp, but there's enough depth to allow for interesting strategies.  The 8 different races for the game each feel liek the bring a very unique playstyle, and if that's not enough, there's the option to create your own.\n\nTwo final notes: I've not tried the multiplayer, but I've heard it's perfectly functional.  Also, some new users find the game very difficult, but that has not been my experience at all.  Holding out a planet against the AI can be done with ease, and the AI seems to always accept lengthy ceasefires. There are plenty of helpful guides out there that teach the fundamentals.","January 12, 2014","true","108.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love getting immersed in the feeling of space exploration and being challenged by every new system. You have to ponder 'Should I colonize this system right now, or wait until I've researched more terraforming technologies? Should I specialize it as an industry system, or use it for economy and research? Is building this huge, expensive improvement worth it, or should I stick to the smaller improvements in this system?'.\n\nThe other side of this feeling is that the things you do in this game are at the macro-strategy level. You don't build single buildings on planets, you build improvements for the whole solar system. You don't manage single trade routes, you build trade improvements in systems, and the trade routes will automatically connect your systems with those of other civilizations you are at peace with, in the most profitable way. You don't tell every single ship in a battle where to move, you set fleet formations at the beginning of a battle, and choose general strategies (Things like 'weapon overclock', 'camouflage', 'sabotage', 'repair', and many more) and aiming patters ('spread fire', 'concentrate on one enemy' etc.) for each battle phase (Long-Range, Medium Range, Melee Range), and aside from that, can't influence the course of battle.\n\nMany players criticize this, but I have the impression that this is part of the narrative, and implementing micro-management options would rather hurt the game flow. In this game, you are responsible for the grand strategies, and this is reflected in the mechanics.\n\nOther elements of this game that are important for my recommendation, personally:\n- All of the factions are interesting and have a ship style that fits them well\n- The music, made by FlyByNo, is magnificent! It enhances the game greatly.\n- The User Interface is amazingly clear and elegant. With 4X games generally being complicated, this makes Endless Space significantly more beginner-friendly and comfortable to play.","December 28, 2015","true","133.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I eagerly anticipated Masters of Orion 3, but it left me disappointed.  In many ways, Endless Space is what Masters of Orion 3 should have been.  The graphic are very visually appealing.  I sometimes find myself just gazing upon my planets when I zoom into a system because they are so pretty.  Another plus is that you manage your empire primarily at the system level, rather than the planetary level, so you don't get bogged down managing build queues for several dozen planets.  However, despite this system focus, each planet does offer unique contributions to your empire.  The game allows you to create customer races in a manner similar to MOO2.  You also have the ability to create customer starships, although not at the same level of detail as MOO2.\n\nOne of the games drawbacks is the combat.  You control combat at a very high strategic level, issuing just a few commands each round, and then twidding your thumbs and hoping for the best as the battle plays out in front of you.  There is a skill element to it, in that you have to try to pick a strategy that complements your fleet but also counters your opponent's strategy.  But often times this ends up feeling like a flashy game of rock/paper/scissors.\n\nAnother drawback is that the victory methods seem very mathmatical.  For example, you win a diplomatic victory by making deals throughout the game.  Each deal contributes to a percentage that adds up over time.  Once you reach 100%, you win.  To me, this makes victory feel anti-climactic.  I can't help comparing it to games like Civilization V or even Masters of Orion 2, where a diplomatic victory can become a very exciting effort to accumulate enough votes to win an election.\n\nUltimately, I would recommend this game, with two caveats.  1)  Unless you're super impatient, this game isn't so great that it's not worth waiting for a 50% or 75% off deal.  2)  If you are going to get it, buy it with the Disharmony expansion, which improves upon the base game a bit.","January 11, 2014","true","192.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Set in a galaxy populated by strange, diverse races, you must expand throughout the galaxy, with the goal of dominating the galaxy through many different way, ranging from very peaceful to military subjugation.  In my time playing it, I was quickly grabbed by its clear mechanics and an awesome interface.  It wasn't until playing this that I realized what a big difference the UI made in the enjoyment of complex strategy titles.  The game is clearly inspired by the Master of Orion series, though for my money it's actually better than them.\n\n\nAs a 4x game, it has several features of the genre: expanding, researching, ship building/war, and diplomacy.  I'll talk a bit about each.\n\nEach 'star system' in this game functions similarly to a single city, in thats its production, food, science, dust (the game's currency), and approval is bound to that one system.  Each system contains up to 6 planets, of different types, that the player expands to once a planet in the system has been settled.  I found this to be an elegant middle ground that allows for a galaxy full of planets, but without the need to tediously micromanage each planet.  The different planet types range from comfortable earth-like landmasses to inhospitable lava planets.  The more difficult to settle planets offer substantial bonuses things like industry or science, but cause unhappiness and lack food of their own.   Later on, players gain the power to play god and terraform planets to suit their strategy.  Managing how to best exploit these systems is a great part of the appeal to me.\n\nStar systems are linked in a node system, though later technologies loosen things up.  I felt this provided much needed structure to the systems, and allows for strategic placing of outposts and fleets.\n\nThe game constantly presents the player with difficult choices.  I always feel pulled by several extremely useful technologies, not to mention each race's custom technologies. It always feels like there are many viable strategies to pursue, and the tech trees allow numerous ways to meet challenges.\n\nI've often found the ship building to be too complex for my tastes in other games, but everything here was straightforward for me, there were still difficult choices between weapon types and the balance between defensive and offensive units.\n\nWhile most of the game is told from a crisp overhead view of a galaxy, combat will happen (though it's possible to play very peacefully).  Fortunately, the combat is gorgeous.  Ships for each race are diverse and detailed.  Combat moves through three main phases, with each phase allowing combatants to play a 'card' that grants specific offensive or defensive bonuses.  While it cannot totally turn around lost battle, clever usage of them can enable you to overcome superior foes.\n\nThe diplomacy is simpler than I'd prefer, as is the lack of a leader screen.  It feels like an opportunity to add more personality to the game was lost.  You can set up all sorts of trade deals and alliances, but it lacks some of the more sophisticated elements that a series like Civ has.\n\nFortunately, some personality is added to the game through random events, ancient relics found on planets, and heroes which can be recruited to you empire, each with their own backstory.  Each hero can be assigned to a fleet or system, potentially making it much more powerful.\n\nThere is a satisfying snowball effect as your empire becomes more powerful.  In fact, with proper terraforming manipulation, you can easily quadruple a particular type of output across your whole empire in less than 15 turns.  It's hard to see this game reaching over 200 turns.  My first win came at 165 turns, and my third and most recent clocked in at 112.\n\nAs a nitpick, there are some mechanics for the game that I wanted a deeper explanation of.  While there is a tooltip for almost everything, I wished there was something in the game like a Civilopedia that catalogued every mechanic in depth.  It's really only need for min/maxing, but it would save having to dive into the wiki many times.\n\nOverall, this is a 4x game that I highly recommend. I've tried many, but few ever interest me like this.  It's mechanics are simple to grasp, but there's enough depth to allow for interesting strategies.  The 8 different races for the game each feel liek the bring a very unique playstyle, and if that's not enough, there's the option to create your own.\n\nTwo final notes: I've not tried the multiplayer, but I've heard it's perfectly functional.  Also, some new users find the game very difficult, but that has not been my experience at all.  Holding out a planet against the AI can be done with ease, and the AI seems to always accept lengthy ceasefires. There are plenty of helpful guides out there that teach the fundamentals.","January 12, 2014","true","108.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had received it as a gift awhile back and from looking at gameplay videos on YouTube, I decided at the time it wasn't for me. I was dead wrong. This is my first 4X game (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) and have passed on other popular games like the Civilization series thinking that they would not be to my liking. Where should I start?\n\nGraphically speaking, the game looks and performs very well. Are they top of the line, burn your motherboard-type graphics? No, but for what this game offers, I have been very pleased. As you can see from the pictures provided on this page, you'll spend most of your time looking at either the beautiful galaxy map or the various tabs located at the top left of your galaxy screen. Aside from staring at the galaxy map when zoomed out (which I particularly enjoy), the most eye candy you'll see in-game is of course the "manual" fleet battles that I'm sure you'll encounter during play. I have my graphics set to the maximum settings and the frame rate runs easily above 100 per second. "Manual" fleet battles give you a visual representation of the battles as well as an opportunity to change your strategy as it progresses.\n\nThe tabs at the top of your screen consist of various actions you may queue up and/or perform on any turn. They range from your overall progression score compared to the other factions in the game to a comprehensive system list to manage your assets, research tree, fleet shipyard, diplomacy and finally your hero cards. These different tabs also range from useful to rather unnecessary. Later in the game (usually after 70 turns) I found myself using this tab the most so I could manage all of my systems happiness, tax rate, system improvements and resources and trade routes. The research tree is absolutely necessary to do anything in the game, but what I found out to be more important was to skip reading guides online and simply just sit down for an hour and read through all of the different tiles. The fleet shipyard isn't required much as you simply just research new ship types in one of the four available tech trees in the research tab along with your various weapons, defenses and support modules in other trees and just make your own designs to build. The hero tab is rather ho-hum as quite simply you look to hire hero cards to place on a system or in a fleet. Managing your ability points as your level them up can be done elsewhere.\n\nDiplomacy on the other hand is somewhat frustrating. Split between a sort of good and evil with some rather in between, 10 factions in the base game offer a wide variety of gameplay. There are tiles that you upgrade diplomacy through your research tab to give you various bonuses, however what it won't take into account is that each faction responds differently to diplomacy. Some won't engage in it and are completely hostile, others are hermits and avoid you almost altogether and others hate your guts if you're beating them economically like I have and take forever to form alliances and cooperative trade agreements. I don't quite like how it was designed and wished there was a little bit better way to draw up diplomatic relations more quickly and efficiently. If you're all for blowing them up and conquering systems, then diplomacy won't even be an afterthought for you.\n\nPersonally, diplomacy has been much to what I described. They tend to either be violent due to the inherited nature or they hold a grudge against you for being better than you for a good two-thirds of the game and then suddenly they become bootlickers and ask for the most ridiculous trades imaginable. Example: I was playing as a peaceful Amoeba faction, exploring and expanding to three arms of an eight arm spiral galaxy with 5 other factions. One hated everyone and was suspicious of anyone (Cravers), one was constantly making threats and talking about glory and me being beneath them even though I was the master race for the whole game in terms of knowledge, diplomatic, expansive and economic power (Hissho); and the others kept to themselves and refused to talk to me until they decided I wasn't going anywhere (Pilgrams, Amoeba and another Hissho). The first Hissho decided an alliance would be good, but thought I was worthless and demanded I pay them a bunch of fuel resources to make the deal. After that I invited the pilgrams since they were 2nd to my capabilities and the Hissho eagerly agreed. Next the Amoeba decided that I'm peaceful enough that they may want to trade with me. At this point, for the rest of the game they kept asking for trade deals that are the worst imaginable. "How about I give you 2 marbles and I'll throw in a jacket with a torn sleeve for 5 units of rocket fuel? Promise not to shoot at you? Our people believe this to be for the glory of the Empire!" Blah Blah Blah.\n\nYou get the idea.. These "allies" of mine are chumps and couldn't be trusted to fix a crack in the pavement let alone build an empire. Good luck getting good trades in of your own unless they love you to death for not shooting at them all game long. Lastly in regards to diplomacy, take care when you're in an alliance. If you declare war, your allies might not like this and then declare war on you, or in my case, I was in an alliance where one declared war on someone, bringing us into the fight when we didnt want it and I decided to stay whereas my other ally turned on me for staying. Let's just say that didn't end well and I learned my lesson. If you wish to side with other like-minded allies, just be careful when war breaks out.\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind with the game is to read through each of the factions before you play. Very important as the traits allocated to each one is specific and will help cater to your particular playstyle. In other words, if you have a certain playstyle in mind, you might later on discover that other factions are better at accomplishing those goals. Once you get the handle on the game, take a look at designing your own faction. I haven't come close to mastering the game yet for me to go there, but I'm looking forward to it.\n\nOver all, as the 4X title suggests, you get to do a bit of everything and even if it doesn't seem like it will be fun, it is worth another look at the very least. I came from enjoying real-time strategy games like StarCraft, WarCraft, Red Alert and Company of Heroes to loving this game to death. I've only put 24 hours into this game and I've barely scratched the surface and will most definitely put many more hours into it. Even though the diplomacy aspect of the game is somewhat limiting, there is something there for someone who wants to build rather than destroy as well as the capability to just wreck havoc in a pretty decent space game. The faction biographies are fun to read as well as the little bits of information you glean from discoveries around the galaxy as you explore, expand, exploit and exterminate.

Its more than just the gameplay. Basically, one of the themes of this game (I personally feel) would have to be space. The music adds to that theme, the descriptive writing adds to it, the whole game gives off this awe inspiring mood to it. Not just it being epic, or cool, or relaxing. Whenever I play this, no matter how many times, I always feel like there is so much more to try to get at.\nYou are put on a random system in a randomly generated map type of your choosing. The other factions are also placed randomly. I can honestly say I have never gone through a game the same way twice. The ships are fully customizable except for their appearance.\nWhen you play this game, it should come across your mind on how big the map is. You're not just in a solar system, you're in a galaxy. Your fleets are traveling to other systems, almost impossibly far away to imagine. The developers somewhat increased the size of the systems just so we can see these points. In reality, we wouldn't see anything from how far away the view is.\nThis game is awe-inspiring, fun, and overall a great game.","December 20, 2015","true","47.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is nearly impossible to achieve a diplomatic victory, making winning through diplomacy not an option. The combat system is too simplistic. Generally, whoever has stronger ships wins. The strategy aspect is reduced to a rock-paper-scissors style of choosing one of a limited number of tactics.

Diplomacy was interesting with the use of cold wars so you can fight another faction without a declaration of war.\n\nDefinitely worth a play!","December 28, 2015","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love getting immersed in the feeling of space exploration and being challenged by every new system. You have to ponder 'Should I colonize this system right now, or wait until I've researched more terraforming technologies? Should I specialize it as an industry system, or use it for economy and research? Is building this huge, expensive improvement worth it, or should I stick to the smaller improvements in this system?'.\n\nThe other side of this feeling is that the things you do in this game are at the macro-strategy level. You don't build single buildings on planets, you build improvements for the whole solar system. You don't manage single trade routes, you build trade improvements in systems, and the trade routes will automatically connect your systems with those of other civilizations you are at peace with, in the most profitable way. You don't tell every single ship in a battle where to move, you set fleet formations at the beginning of a battle, and choose general strategies (Things like 'weapon overclock', 'camouflage', 'sabotage', 'repair', and many more) and aiming patters ('spread fire', 'concentrate on one enemy' etc.) for each battle phase (Long-Range, Medium Range, Melee Range), and aside from that, can't influence the course of battle.\n\nMany players criticize this, but I have the impression that this is part of the narrative, and implementing micro-management options would rather hurt the game flow. In this game, you are responsible for the grand strategies, and this is reflected in the mechanics.\n\nOther elements of this game that are important for my recommendation, personally:\n- All of the factions are interesting and have a ship style that fits them well\n- The music, made by FlyByNo, is magnificent! It enhances the game greatly.\n- The User Interface is amazingly clear and elegant. With 4X games generally being complicated, this makes Endless Space significantly more beginner-friendly and comfortable to play.","December 28, 2015","true","133.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seperallis/recommended/208140/","seperallis","Seperallis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seperallis/","229 products in account","TL;DR, a solid 4X with a couple unique & nifty features; lacks complexity, but it's at least not mind-numbingly easy. A solid intro to the genre on easier difficulties, and nice for veterans on hard+, definitely worth the price of admission for any fan of the genre...and at least worth a look if you're not, if you can snag it on discount.\n\nWith three games played and considering a fourth, something about it has me hooked, so I guess that's recommendation enough. This game is feature complete and isn't a platform for 4+ years of continuous overpriced DLC, so there's that too, I guess.\n\nThis game is the definition of what I think when I hear "Civilization in space," and is just about the same as Civ in how much of a repetitive slog to inevitable victory it is despite its shipbuilding & combat systems, and SUPERBLY crafted factions each with unique art/units/style, backstory, and game mechanics; I fell in love rather quickly. Sadly, as time went on and the veneer of starry-eyed wonder wore off, I discovered that the game ultimately lacks depth, as you end up rushing the same buildings & tech, and falling in line with the same battle strategies regardless of enemy or faction.\n\nThe Pros?\n\n+ The Factions. As stated above, it's clear a lot of time was spent to make them all different, with detailed artwork & backstories, unique models for all faction ship classes, and game mechanics. I'm not just talking superficial changes in how they play, either: unique improvements, tech (and a mixup of where certain tech is in the tree), different specializations on your different ship classes, and a specific set of game rules - not just modifiers, but actual mechanics - endemic to each race that attempt to steer you into a particular playstyle with that race.\n\nI mean, this alone makes me start up new games with factions I haven't played.\n\n+ The shipbuilding, the real meat that sets Endless Space apart from many 4X games. The ability to personalize every part of your ships' systems and loadouts really adds a personal touch to your empire, and made me feel (rightly or wrongly) that any combat failures were my fault, that any overwhelming/surprising successes were my doing, and not some dickery of the game. There is no inevitability of overwhelming enemy numbers: as the supposed "weakest" empire in my first game, my 9 little gunboats held the border against the entire enemy armada from the empire with more than double my score, simply by hardcountering its build.\n\n+ The aesthetics. The music definitely fits the whole "intergalactic space empire vying for supremacy" thing, and the map, artwork, ship models and planet models are all still a glory to behold, even after all these hours. It's pretty, I guess.\n\nThe Cons?\n\n- You can - and eventually will - be dicked over by the galaxy generator. That's just the nature of the beast, sadly. A crafty player can overcome a bad start position, at least, but if you're looking for a quick game, you'r ebetter off just surrendering and restarting. The AI has deep difficulty in overcoming bad starts; I'm talking entire galaxy arm with less than half of their planets colonized by turn 120 (on normal speed).\n\n- Every faction plays the same. "But what about those different mechanics you talked about?" Yeah, forget it. Notice how I said the different faction traits "attempt" to steer you into certain play styles. Ultimately once you've found your groove and know what works, you'll rush the same techs & improvements every game, regardless of pressure from the game itself to play differently...because there is an optimal way to play, and it just simply works best regardless of the faction.\n\n- Combat is dull; you'll want to just autoresolve about 95% of it when you learn what you're doing. Sure, you can pick formations (which determine what your enemy shoots at) and strategies (which determine what you shoot at), and you can select from certain tactics cards to give an edge in a nearly "rock-paper-scissors" fashion...but ultimately, "manual" fleet control proves useless in a game where combat is just two fleets colliding into each other with no maneuvering, and really only has a use in changing your attack strategy to "guillotine" or "nosebreaker" when things unexpectedly go ♥♥♥♥-up and you try to get as much damage done before inevitable defeat. Even battle tactics become trivial after the early game, as you unlock ones that are just objectively useful in all situations.\n\n- The tutorial is objectively ♥♥♥♥. It's pages of text overlaying screencaps of the game, talking you don't understand when you first boot the game. It's 2 hours of reading for an info/text dump that'll just leave you vaguely confused; you're better off finding a friendly FAQ/guide online somewhere...or do as I did, and stumble around in your first game learning as you go.\n\n- The shipbuilding. It is vital, a necessity to know what you're doing with ship loadouts in order to survive, & WILL be the cause of you losing your first games. Also, hard-countering your friends is fun. Being hard-countered yourself is not fun, and will will be the cause of much raging and quitting when your entire armada is slaughtered by 9 piddly gunboats.\n\nYeah...I think that's about it. Probably forgot something, but that's what I remember off the top of my head.","June 4","true","63.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You choose an alien race/faction (or create your own!) and then setup your game, dictating things like number of opponents, difficulty, and even style of the galaxy (a spiral?  a ring?  a big ellipse?)\n\nOnce you start play there is an awesome and super detailed tutorial that guides you through each screen and explains how the game functions.  You colonize star systems and then specific planets, and build a combination of planet specific and system specific upgrades.  You also build fleets of ships (from designs you create!) to do battle against space pirates and the other factions.  With multiple ways to win and everything being generated on the fly, this game is just pure awesome for strategy lovers.","December 27, 2013","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have not yet tried it with the expansion.  If I ever get the expansion, I will update my review.\n\nI felt conflicted about whether to recommend this game or not.  In the end, I decided that the pros outweigh the cons.  That being said, it has a lot of missed potential, and I hope they improve on a few things for the sequel.\n\nPros:\n- The game is a lot of fun, especially beginning and mid game.  A lot of thought has been put into certain details, such as the tech tree, which makes it fun to explore all the different techs.\n- You can customize your own race, and choose its advantages and disadvantages.  This, to me, is one of its strongest points.  I had a lot of fun creating my own alien races to play as and play against\n- The game has an AI function that allows you to automate system management.  I didn't discover this feature until my 2nd playthrough, and let me tell you, it sped up the game a ton!  Now, you still need to keep tabs on what it is building and where, as the AI will not always make the choices that best suits your strategy, but for the most part it really speeds up the mid game.\n\nCons:\n- The game as a steep learning curve.  The tutorial is more or less useless.  It took a lot of playing around with settings and features before I was able to figure out the ins and outs of the game.\n- Ship combat is a little boring, albeit fun to watch at least.\n- The End game leaves something to be desired.  Once you get past the mid game stage, the game tends to drag on.  This is especially true if you are trying to achieve different types of victories, such as the science or diplomatic.\n\nIn conclusion, This game is fun, but requires patience towards the end.  I hope that when they do the sequel, they tap into the potential that this game had.\n\n6/10","August 12, 2015","true","35.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gtAngel/recommended/208140/","gtAngel","gtAngel♪","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gtAngel/","83 products in account","Endless Space is a 4X game (expand/explore/exploit/exterminate) in the same vein as Civilization, with a lot of similarities to Civ IV. The game has a lot of interesting unique mechanics in addition to the normal Civ gameplay including a uniquely structured tech tree, purchasable heroes that can lead your troops or your planets, and a unique way to utilize your planets (cities essentially) for resources. In addition, the many traits that the different civilizations have change the dynamic of the game and your priorities. The ability to make custom civilations by mixing and matching these traits also gives a lot of room for creativity and new experiences.\n\nHowever, the main flaw of Endless Space is that it feels somewhat lifeless. It does a lot of things well, but there isn't anything it does particularly amazingly. The game ends up feeling somewhat generic because despite the unique mechanics there isn't anything that stands out as a large improvement over other 4X games.\n\nOverall I would recommend Endless Space to fans of 4X games, especially those that enjoyed CivIV more than CivV, and for people who enjoyed Endless Legend and want to try a similar game. However, for people who aren't huge fans of the genre I would recommend sticking to Civ or other common 4X games instead.","June 24, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have spent so many hours playing Endless Space and telling myself "Just one more turn..."\n\nThe procedural galaxies, stars and planets are wonderful.  The tech tree is deep and broad enough to make exploring it's extents.  Diplomacy and trade seems to work better than previous examples i've seen.   "Dust" as the answer to instant gratification works great and tales and remnants of  "The Endless" really add flavor to the universe, even if they do ask more questions than they answer.\n\nHaving heros with buffs and nerfs that you can move around your empire to govern your worlds or command your fleets is nice.  I just wish they had a bit more charecter.  Some personality could be delivered by way of the occasional message to the player in the "voice" of the charecter via the game notice system.\n\nOther minor niggles include the font size (which was too small for my eye-sight, so i'm running the game at less than optimum resolution) and production tasks getitng queue behind instructions that repeat forever.\n\nEndless Space is my new favorite 4X, dispalcing the aging Imperium Galactica 2.","June 19, 2015","true","174.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For an indie game this is pretty amazing.   If you are expecting pure combat, I don't think this game is for you.   It is more about system development and expansion.   I lost the first couple of games on weakest AI because I was focused on military.   I finally won a game on easy using Science.\n\nMicro management of the systems.\n\nThis is actually very interesting.   I'm 40 hours in and I don't think I've mastered this at all.   My mid game, around 80 turns was very strong.  But my early game is still poor.   What is fun is to put the game in a window.  Then pull up dirty pleasure tv show off to the side and then just clicking through your planets to make them rapidly develop.   You actually have to read the system improvements because one size does NOT fit all.   In other words, on some systems it is a complete waste to build every improvement.\n\nTech Tree\n\nAgain another piece of the game that makes you think.   You don't need everything, especially if your are targeting a specific victory condition like dust, tech, aliance, etc.  Read and decide.  You must look at the planets near your home world before you unlock the colonization for those worlds.   Sure eventually you will get all but you need to race to unlock key strategic systems\n\nExpansion\n\nThis is very cool.  It is easier to expand in sytems you own rather than sending out ships.  Makes sense right?   However you still need to send ships out to seed systems.  And you need to seed systems that either block other player's expansion or give you huge development potential.  And you haven't always developed the right technologies to seed the planets on the target system.  This makes for a great game play balance in the game.\n\nShip Upgrades\n\nI really like the modification and retrofit system.  Very easy to use and key to keeping your fleet uptodate.\n\nCombat\n\nThis is a bit dull but not the focus of the game.   You pick attitudes for three rounds of combats, long range, mid range, short range, then your ships do their thing.   I've found repairs to be pretty good.   But again I don't think the focus of the game on combat, especially since you only have about 5 classes of ships to fly with various mods on them.  It is easy to win other ways.\n\nDiplomacy\n\nI'm still a bit lost.   I don't quite understand why I can't initiate peace treaties.   Maybe that is the way amoeba's are.   Not sure.   Alliances seem good until you get thrown into a battle you don't want to be in.\n\n\nNay Sayers\n\nIt always reminds me of players that want to play the way they think rather than the way the game allows them to think.  Sure we all have had our frustrations with that.   Even I had that with the first couple of games.  But once you start looking for other ways to do things, the game opens up.\n\nValue\n\nI picked this up on steam sale.  Great value.   Fun little game completely worth the money.\n\n\n","June 11, 2015","true","39.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Intended to be more of a sandbox start where the stage is set with back-story, races and factions, but it is up to you to define the story after that. While lacking some of the charm and character of a game like Civilization 5, where the characters were very immersive and the feeling of writing history compelled you on. Endless Space, while comparable to Civ 5 and other space strategy games, is not trying to be a copy but a beast of its own. The game also runs fairly well on machines built from crumpets, like mine, 100% 7 year old genuine golden machine right here.\n\nThe games strength lies in the screen you will be spending a lot of time with, getting to know, making tea for and so on; the galaxy view, also FIDS is a guy you will have to get friendly with, get to know FIDS real well – FIDS stands for Food, Industry, Dust and Science; optimizing these will be important. The interface on the default view and the leaves that stemming from the branches connected to the galaxy interface are simple and relatively easy to navigate; the economy is rather solid, with many resources to monopolize and exploit, – my favourites being Bluecap Mold and Hydromiel - with resources set on low it can create some interesting situations. Managing and growing your empire is can be done easily, but to keep an empire at its optimal level some loving care to keep it in check and sound engineering ideas  are required to achieve a lovely, green and flowering empire. You can also zoom in and out of the galaxy view and into systems which you will find at helpful and the planets vivid colours pleasing to the eye.\n\nHero’s can be important to your strategy too due to their boosting abilities and a variety of roles they can fill either in administration or fleet command, however they are not essential pieces to make keep your empire spinning – just be sure to pick them up and assign them to tasks if you can.\n\nExpansion is a very good thing and is a big part of the games early stage. Systems contain planets usually of varying tiers with nice planets being tier one and smelly gas planets + floating rocks being the highest tier, needless to say tier ones are better. You should probably colonise lots of systems as quickly as possible... but not too many at a pace your empire cannot keep up with... that could end very badly and happiness will snowball out of control very quickly; also keep an eye on the happiness of the populous, try to avoid planets with really bad happiness modifiers early on unless you have a good reason to colonise that system – such as a good happiness modifiers outweighing the bad one or a burning desire for that system. Initially colonised systems become outposts and over time will become colonies, colonies are better in many ways, for one they have an influence ring which is good for you but bad for your enemies systems if it swallows it whole; during their outpost state they can still be attacked without war being declared so you might want to defend them from the unforgiving galaxy until they mature. Also be sure to have each system doing something, even if it’s just Industry to Dust conversion, wasted turns don’t come back.\n\nResearch, is a bit like a big expanding circle, you can plough through in one direction if you wanted to but before long you will have to turn back and follow up the other branches for important and relevant technologies; in game terms, N-Way Fusion Plants & Isolation Shields in the Applied Sciences tree is important early on while Applied Casmir Affect in the Exploration & Expansion tree is very good for early expansion, there are techs in the Diplomacy & Trading tree that is important to happiness and keeping yourself protected is always imperative to your survival so the Galactic Warfare tree will be visited regularly.\n\nThe somewhat unusual combat system has a somewhat offhanded approach to it. The cinematic battle sequences while pretty and enjoyable to watch lacks some of the interactivity people are used to, where normally you needed to rely on positioning and particular manoeuvres in battle; however instead you rely more on the way you have set up your fleet beforehand which is assisted by a cards which designate actions your fleet can perform, whether or not a heroic Admiral is in the fleet and fleet targeting options during the battle. These battles can be auto-resolved if you wish; you can also invade systems with a number of methods such as a general siege, bombing or sending in the troops – of course you can turn to place to ashes after if you wanted to. The battles are not grand and truly epic but are enjoyable and perform their role rather well. Ships are arranged into fleets, which can be managed from the fleet tab on the galaxy screen, are custom built from hull designs, while the general blueprints are not yours to play with, the toys you attach to it are. Good ship design is essential to defend yourself from hungry Cravers or invade some helpless Sophons on an isolated system; while some understanding of the combat system and understanding how to achieve your design goal is crucial for success, designing the ships in question is quite easy once you know where to find shipyard is.\n\nAmplitude while being a small - French – studio, have put a lot of love into its first game, they have also allowed the community to get involved in a number of occasions to help make decisions for the future of the game through the Games2Gether system and forums and are updating the game regularly with content and fixes. Visit the Amplitude forums if you have any questions about Endless Space; discuss the game, query problems or related waffles on your mind. You can also check out their other upcoming* games Endless legend – another strategy game - and Dungeons of The Endless – a rouge-like-dungeon-delving game – if they snatch your interest and run of with it. So, lead your empire to victory in the deep darkness of space, through the vibrant jungles, across desolate barren landscapes, scorching hot sand dunes and towering metropolises.

Unfortunately, the smaller details of this game's mechanics are not well-documented; while the mechanics overall are easy to understand, there are many sneaky factors that can cause a large impact on the game. For example, a star system outside your colored influence circles generate only HALF the science and money - but nowhere is this mentioned, save for a small "distance from empire" factor when you examine your science output in detail.\n\nThe military system in Endless Space is often criticized. Indeed, space battles quickly devolve into mashing the auto button over and over, as you watch your indestructible ships blow up the AI's endless stream of useless fodder. Because of the common rebalances and redesigns of ship-building, it is extremely difficult to reason about the effectiveness of ship designs. Additionally, capturing star systems is less than glamorous, with bombardment reduced to watching a colored circle fill up and a turns left icon count down.\n\nDespite its flaws, Endless Space is in the end still a strong 4X game.

I rate it as the best space-themed 4X[en.wikipedia.org] game (of course, it's also among the newest) and second only to Sid Meier's Civilization games for best 4X[en.wikipedia.org] overall.  It would be tempting to call this Civ2 in Space, but that's not quite accurate.  Certainly, if you've played Civilization or any other 4X[en.wikipedia.org] game you'll recognize that the basic ideas and goals are the same - learning the /massive/ tech tree, manipulating heroes, and mastering the nuances of unit behavior will still take some time, however.  The interface is, unfortunately, clunky and hard to read in the same way that the old Civ games were.  The presentation problems are primarily related to the tiny fonts that don't seem to scale with screen resolution and the amazing complexity of the game.  Here, each hero has multiple disciplines with unique talent trees for each.  Deep options for ship customization almost make for a game within itself, as much time can be spent min/max optimizing weight budget by rotating out varying armaments, engines, colonization pods, hulls, and more.  Planetary systems are similarly complex, and require a fair amount of micromanagement for min/max players - it's a lot like the way it was necessary to position each villager for each town in old Civilization games at harder difficulties.  Unfortunately, it's also rather tedious.\n\nIf you're a fan of Civilization and the idea of Civ in space sounds enticing, then this is the game you should be looking at.  It's not perfect and the learning curve is substantial, but there's a lot of promise here.  I'm not sure if there is a follow-up in the works or not, but this is an amazing first effort and I can absolutely see the potential for successive versions to challenge Sid Meier's lordship over the 4X[en.wikipedia.org] genre.","February 25, 2014","true","99.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I only haven't bought Civ: Beyond Earth yet because I'm a "value gamer" (read: cheap - waiting for the price to drop). For context, I've owned the original Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, among others.\n\nMy impression is that this game was made by experienced turn-based 4x players who wanted to make "their ideal game"... And thus made this game for themselves first... And turn-based 4x afficinados second. And it shows, IMO.\n\n"Above-par" things about this game (IMO):\n\n+ Excellent tech tree - best in the genre, IMO. Although I haven't played Civ:BE yet... I've seen screen shots of its tech tree... And it looks suspiciously like this one.\n+ Lots of race customization options. You can pretty much set your (custom) race's starting attributes however you wish.\n+ "Just-right" levels of (micro-)management (IMO). (Bear in mind that I consider aspects of both SMAC and GalCivII to be excessive micromanagement.)\n+ For long games at higher levels of difficulty... The terraforming system is terrific.\n+ You can bypass battle-level animations (beautiful to watch... But they get old after a while, and they're not tactically relevant... Hence, after a while... You just want to bypass them. In the end... It's just eye-candy serving little real purpose otherwise).\n+ Variety of *achievable* victory conditions, even for a player who isn't otherwise waaay far ahead, absolute points-wise ("come from behind" and/or stealth victories *are* possible).\n+ Procedurally-generated starting conditions enable lots of variety (enables enhanced replayability).\n+ "Just-right" levels of ship customization (not too many options/ variables... Not too few, IMO). In my experience... Ship customization is essential for gaining an edge over AIs in combat.)\n+ Unique "wonders" don't grossly unbalance the game, and/or build up unassailable momentum (something that annoys me about Civ5 - grrr...)\n\n"Below par" things about this game (IMO):\n\n- The AI could use some work, in two main regards (IMO): (1) when playing against multiple AIs of a common level of pre-set difficulty... One or two will "runaway" from the rest... And, after a certain stage of the game, become unassailable (such that one wonders whether said 1-2 AIs are set +1 level, relative to the rest), and (2) there's no easily/ elegantly predictable, gradul escalation of difficulty between "Normal" and the next higher level. (As in... You may be regularly winning "Normal" games... But elevate it only one tier higher (and there are several more)... And you'll end up getting your @$$ handed to you every game.) It would be nice to have a more gradual progression of difficulty levels that is in alignment with the # of options made available. (I can't imagine the level of difficulty for their "suicidal" level - I'm just not that hard-core... :-( ).\n- Menu (build queue) management could be made a bit better/ more sophisticated. In short... You'll be doing a LOT of menu/ build queue management thoughout the game... And the interface for such leaves a lot to be desired (IMO). I would also appreciate it if they allowed some alternative views, where there was more screen real estate made available for menu lists and related queue management.\n- Multiplayer isn't very fault-tolerant (e.g., player temporarily loses connection = they can't reconnect to the game...)\n\nOther things I (don't) like about this game...\n\n+ Its operational footprint is sufficiently low that you can play it on a modern ultrabook with Intel CPU-integral graphics at decent frame rates (if you bypass the battle-level cut-scenes)\n+ There are enough game setup options to enable great levels of replayability\n+ You can set up your custom race to behave like race A, but masquerade as (look like) race B. (read: in multiplayer, it would be wise to presume that another players race that "looks like" a race you've played against (as a standard race) in AI mode will not necessarily have similar (dis)advantages as the standard race you've played with/ against in the past. In other words... Don't assume anything regarding races in multiplayer mode.).\n- I would prefer the option for larger galaxies (80 systems is the limit), as - when playing against 7 AIs (8 players total), the skies become crowded fairly quickly.\n- I would prefer a greater array of options regarding the formation types of galaxies which one may start with. Such may break from relative realism... But enhance replayablity (IMO). I find the options available are too similar to one another, with only three distinctly unique types (spiral ("star"), oblong spherical, and donut).\n\nOtherwise... This is among the best turn-based 4x games I've ever played... And while I haven't played them all... I have played some.\n\nI'd like to end by responding to a specific comment another reviewer made (cannot recall the name), that I would like to disagree with (not sure why I'm typing this here...): It *is* possible to manage population happiness levels... Indeed, such is critical for mission success. Typically, the techs required to boost happiness are on the left (food and energy) side of the tech tree. The typical specific techs include, but are not necesarily limited to, "Unlimited Supermarkets", "Unlimited Information Highways', "Colonial Rights", and "Permanent Vacation" (they all have a purple tab color). One can also greatly boost local happiness level by removing any negative planetary anomalies that are present on individual planets (example: Heavy Gravity- there are two technologies in the lower portion of the tree for this purpose), and by lowering expansion disagreement level (2-3 techs in the lower tree for this one, as well). The more you do "all of the above", the greater you can elevate the tax rate whilst still keeping everybody either "ecstatic" or "happy"... Which is what you'll need for mission success.","December 15, 2014","true","342.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The AI would "attack" me every turn with them, which was borderline trolling and the kicker is that those ships were "blockading" the solar system which had economic downsides for me but they couldn't actually do any real harm.\n\nI'm still recommending it because it's overall a pretty good game. The GUI for economy is well thought out.\nIt works pretty well in coop, you can do the most important actions for the turn, mark your turn as ready to end and continue to do less urgent actions which will still happen in the same turn if you manage to do them before everyone has passed their turn, or else just happen later. Also saving and loading multiplayer games works well.\n\nJust maybe wait for a sale :P","January 3, 2015","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's incredibly satisfying when you pick the right card and blow your opponent to smithereens. Fleet size matters, but small fleets can beat larger fleets with good strategy, so it's well designed. In addition, the heroes you appoint have specialties and command the fleets, so it's all very satisfying to play fleet tactics.\n\nWhere the game falls behind a bit is in the overland starmap strategy. There are both size limits on fleets and movement/attack limits per turn on fleets, even if they are in the same system as an enemy. Logically, since the turns are a week, your fleet SHOULD be able to attack every enemy fleet in the system it's located in, but somehow it can only attack one, which is incredibly stupid because then the overland strategy becomes a tedious game of hide, seek, and run around repetitively.\n\nThe other way the game falls a bit behind is in fleet vs. planet combat. It's done only passively, and while the mechanics to decide it are sound enough, there's no interaction there, it's entirely automated. I don't understand why we couldn't have gotten an awesome tactical card game for planetary invasions too.\n\nIf you love political intrigue and economics, which I admit I also have a soft spot for, this game is not your thing. It's very polished, but not too deep beyond the fleet battles. It personally didn't work for me, not just because of the lack of depth beyond the combat but because of the strategic flaws. However, if you want a decent space 4x with a great battle system that doesn't take long to get in to, this is your game.","August 16, 2015","false","12.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Lots of lore and accurate descriptions plus many possible improvements starmap side.\n\nI completed one playthrough and a half, but will not play again because of the terrible shortcomings.\nPurchase only if you really like the genre and don't mind a cheating AI even on normal and easy difficulty.","August 26, 2015","false","29.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

Variable alien races? check.  Expansive tech tree? check.  Randomized galaxy to explore, with good variety in system & planet types? check.  Combat is simple, but lets you have enough control?  check.\nMy only complaints are that some of the techs and upgrades seem way more useful than others, and one of the victory types feels a bit too easy to achieve compared to the others.  Also, the combat system can be a bit swingy, and the outcome of an engagement depends on factors that may not be obvious.  Lastly, combat and the other systems aren't explained all that well in-game, so you have to peruse the wiki to get a good idea of what's going on.\nStill, I've sunk many hours into it, and have no problem suggesting it to others.","July 7, 2014","true","261.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And just like both of those games, while there are options there to be peaceful and diplomatic and spiritual....its a lot more fun to burn the world down and rebuild it in your image.\n\nI don't have a God complex at all, nopenopenope.\n\nAnyway, its mostly a GalCivs-style 4X, the resource management is a pretty heavy-handed (although you can put much of that under control of the AI, and the AI is trustworthy most times), and when you build your military units, you have to equip/upgrade templates for them else they're pretty useless even in massive numbers; as you progress in the 4 tech trees you'll unlock new abilities and more efficient ship modules and every so often you'll need to bring your fleets in for a refurb. And then you have fleet combat with formations and tactics to contend with, there is some randomness to how that plays out (its a rock-paper-scissors scenario) but it will rarely make a huge difference in the end.\n\nLike most 4X's there's a LOT to learn, in addition to the fact that there's faction-specific lore and technologies to learn; there is a tutorial-esque thing but after reading a few screens of it you'll want some aspirin, basically you just have to dive into the deep end and drown a couple times before everything snaps into place for you (or at least, that was my experience.)\n\nAlso like many 4X's, there's a mechanic where you can use your gold - called "Dust" in this game, which I kinda wanna mock but whatever - to bypass production queues, basically you buy the ship/building/etc at a high price and get it on the next turn rather than having to depend on your population's laborforce, and any one resource is dependant on the other three: food (population increase speed), industry (production speed), dust (money), and science (research speed).  Once you get to a certain point in the game, you can have money rolling in if you micromanage the hell outta your early star systems, so that mechanic might be OP to some; since I'm all about domination/expansion victories, personally I abuse it every chance I get, and its fun =D If you think that's BS, however, the higher difficulties really don't permit lavish spending, unless the Random Generator God is pleased with you (and he never is is he, ♥♥♥♥ that guy ^^) Also there's at least one faction that outright cannot use dust, so they basically have one of the four resources removed, which fundamentally changes how you have to approach things.\n\nThis was before the Sid Meier's Civ In Space game, if that's what you want you can probably just go that route and be happy, this smells a little more like Galactic Civs, although not quite as hardcore (which for me is a good thing, your mileage may vary).","July 10, 2015","true","65.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're the kind of person who likes the exploitation part of 4X, and if you like automating each of your turns to a science, then this is the game for you. I personally love making research decisions, setting waypoints for fleets, etc. and I can forgive the game's poor combat, but if you're looking for a game to stretch your strategic skills this isn't it.\n\nI'm really enjoying this game. After Civilization V's expansion, Brave New World, Civ V became a bit biased towards smaller empires, so having a game that allows and repays rapid expansion and exploitation is welcome.\n\nDespite the relatively small size of the playable maps, empires and armies can get pretty huge. The U.I. lacks character, but  it's really clean so administrating your empire is very easy. This is also one of the problems, though, as you start to get into the groove of running your empire every turn starts to feel monotonous, only broken up by random events that, more often than not, end up hurting your empire.\n\nBattles are also not very strategic. The combat system is intriguing, but ultimately it just doesn't involve the player enough, and I hope in any future iterations of the game they use EL's battle system. Winning wars ultimately comes down to ship design (which you have to constantly evolve to keep up with your enemies) and outproducing your opponents. It feels really good to have twelve fleets going at once, though, and managing a large navy is also quite fun for me.\n\nGreat game if you like micromanaging your empire, maximizing production, science, and economic output and planning, then this is the game for you. Unfortunately, anyone looking for a strategic challenge should pass.","May 28, 2015","true","29.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have not yet tried it with the expansion.  If I ever get the expansion, I will update my review.\n\nI felt conflicted about whether to recommend this game or not.  In the end, I decided that the pros outweigh the cons.  That being said, it has a lot of missed potential, and I hope they improve on a few things for the sequel.\n\nPros:\n- The game is a lot of fun, especially beginning and mid game.  A lot of thought has been put into certain details, such as the tech tree, which makes it fun to explore all the different techs.\n- You can customize your own race, and choose its advantages and disadvantages.  This, to me, is one of its strongest points.  I had a lot of fun creating my own alien races to play as and play against\n- The game has an AI function that allows you to automate system management.  I didn't discover this feature until my 2nd playthrough, and let me tell you, it sped up the game a ton!  Now, you still need to keep tabs on what it is building and where, as the AI will not always make the choices that best suits your strategy, but for the most part it really speeds up the mid game.\n\nCons:\n- The game as a steep learning curve.  The tutorial is more or less useless.  It took a lot of playing around with settings and features before I was able to figure out the ins and outs of the game.\n- Ship combat is a little boring, albeit fun to watch at least.\n- The End game leaves something to be desired.  Once you get past the mid game stage, the game tends to drag on.  This is especially true if you are trying to achieve different types of victories, such as the science or diplomatic.\n\nIn conclusion, This game is fun, but requires patience towards the end.  I hope that when they do the sequel, they tap into the potential that this game had.\n\n6/10","August 12, 2015","true","35.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Intended to be more of a sandbox start where the stage is set with back-story, races and factions, but it is up to you to define the story after that. While lacking some of the charm and character of a game like Civilization 5, where the characters were very immersive and the feeling of writing history compelled you on. Endless Space, while comparable to Civ 5 and other space strategy games, is not trying to be a copy but a beast of its own. The game also runs fairly well on machines built from crumpets, like mine, 100% 7 year old genuine golden machine right here.\n\nThe games strength lies in the screen you will be spending a lot of time with, getting to know, making tea for and so on; the galaxy view, also FIDS is a guy you will have to get friendly with, get to know FIDS real well – FIDS stands for Food, Industry, Dust and Science; optimizing these will be important. The interface on the default view and the leaves that stemming from the branches connected to the galaxy interface are simple and relatively easy to navigate; the economy is rather solid, with many resources to monopolize and exploit, – my favourites being Bluecap Mold and Hydromiel - with resources set on low it can create some interesting situations. Managing and growing your empire is can be done easily, but to keep an empire at its optimal level some loving care to keep it in check and sound engineering ideas  are required to achieve a lovely, green and flowering empire. You can also zoom in and out of the galaxy view and into systems which you will find at helpful and the planets vivid colours pleasing to the eye.\n\nHero’s can be important to your strategy too due to their boosting abilities and a variety of roles they can fill either in administration or fleet command, however they are not essential pieces to make keep your empire spinning – just be sure to pick them up and assign them to tasks if you can.\n\nExpansion is a very good thing and is a big part of the games early stage. Systems contain planets usually of varying tiers with nice planets being tier one and smelly gas planets + floating rocks being the highest tier, needless to say tier ones are better. You should probably colonise lots of systems as quickly as possible... but not too many at a pace your empire cannot keep up with... that could end very badly and happiness will snowball out of control very quickly; also keep an eye on the happiness of the populous, try to avoid planets with really bad happiness modifiers early on unless you have a good reason to colonise that system – such as a good happiness modifiers outweighing the bad one or a burning desire for that system. Initially colonised systems become outposts and over time will become colonies, colonies are better in many ways, for one they have an influence ring which is good for you but bad for your enemies systems if it swallows it whole; during their outpost state they can still be attacked without war being declared so you might want to defend them from the unforgiving galaxy until they mature. Also be sure to have each system doing something, even if it’s just Industry to Dust conversion, wasted turns don’t come back.\n\nResearch, is a bit like a big expanding circle, you can plough through in one direction if you wanted to but before long you will have to turn back and follow up the other branches for important and relevant technologies; in game terms, N-Way Fusion Plants & Isolation Shields in the Applied Sciences tree is important early on while Applied Casmir Affect in the Exploration & Expansion tree is very good for early expansion, there are techs in the Diplomacy & Trading tree that is important to happiness and keeping yourself protected is always imperative to your survival so the Galactic Warfare tree will be visited regularly.\n\nThe somewhat unusual combat system has a somewhat offhanded approach to it. The cinematic battle sequences while pretty and enjoyable to watch lacks some of the interactivity people are used to, where normally you needed to rely on positioning and particular manoeuvres in battle; however instead you rely more on the way you have set up your fleet beforehand which is assisted by a cards which designate actions your fleet can perform, whether or not a heroic Admiral is in the fleet and fleet targeting options during the battle. These battles can be auto-resolved if you wish; you can also invade systems with a number of methods such as a general siege, bombing or sending in the troops – of course you can turn to place to ashes after if you wanted to. The battles are not grand and truly epic but are enjoyable and perform their role rather well. Ships are arranged into fleets, which can be managed from the fleet tab on the galaxy screen, are custom built from hull designs, while the general blueprints are not yours to play with, the toys you attach to it are. Good ship design is essential to defend yourself from hungry Cravers or invade some helpless Sophons on an isolated system; while some understanding of the combat system and understanding how to achieve your design goal is crucial for success, designing the ships in question is quite easy once you know where to find shipyard is.\n\nAmplitude while being a small - French – studio, have put a lot of love into its first game, they have also allowed the community to get involved in a number of occasions to help make decisions for the future of the game through the Games2Gether system and forums and are updating the game regularly with content and fixes. Visit the Amplitude forums if you have any questions about Endless Space; discuss the game, query problems or related waffles on your mind. You can also check out their other upcoming* games Endless legend – another strategy game - and Dungeons of The Endless – a rouge-like-dungeon-delving game – if they snatch your interest and run of with it. So, lead your empire to victory in the deep darkness of space, through the vibrant jungles, across desolate barren landscapes, scorching hot sand dunes and towering metropolises.

Unfortunately, the smaller details of this game's mechanics are not well-documented; while the mechanics overall are easy to understand, there are many sneaky factors that can cause a large impact on the game. For example, a star system outside your colored influence circles generate only HALF the science and money - but nowhere is this mentioned, save for a small "distance from empire" factor when you examine your science output in detail.\n\nThe military system in Endless Space is often criticized. Indeed, space battles quickly devolve into mashing the auto button over and over, as you watch your indestructible ships blow up the AI's endless stream of useless fodder. Because of the common rebalances and redesigns of ship-building, it is extremely difficult to reason about the effectiveness of ship designs. Additionally, capturing star systems is less than glamorous, with bombardment reduced to watching a colored circle fill up and a turns left icon count down.\n\nDespite its flaws, Endless Space is in the end still a strong 4X game. Strategy in general remains the same no matter what race or victory type you play, but the game mechanics' nuances and relative importance of timing make mastering this strategy a great challenge.","January 6, 2014","true","90.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Most comparable to civilization 5, or other turn based games, Endless Space has you slowly take turns improving your solar systems and taking over the galaxy.  You are given races, which enable the gameplay to change, not to mention the endless customization for creating your own race, and controlling the size of your galaxy.  On top of the 100+ hours you will satisfyingly get, there are also numerous achievements to work for if you want to get all the achievements.  One of the best games I have ever played, Endless Space is a must have for your game library.

I rate it as the best space-themed 4X[en.wikipedia.org] game (of course, it's also among the newest) and second only to Sid Meier's Civilization games for best 4X[en.wikipedia.org] overall.  It would be tempting to call this Civ2 in Space, but that's not quite accurate.  Certainly, if you've played Civilization or any other 4X[en.wikipedia.org] game you'll recognize that the basic ideas and goals are the same - learning the /massive/ tech tree, manipulating heroes, and mastering the nuances of unit behavior will still take some time, however.  The interface is, unfortunately, clunky and hard to read in the same way that the old Civ games were.  The presentation problems are primarily related to the tiny fonts that don't seem to scale with screen resolution and the amazing complexity of the game.  Here, each hero has multiple disciplines with unique talent trees for each.  Deep options for ship customization almost make for a game within itself, as much time can be spent min/max optimizing weight budget by rotating out varying armaments, engines, colonization pods, hulls, and more.  Planetary systems are similarly complex, and require a fair amount of micromanagement for min/max players - it's a lot like the way it was necessary to position each villager for each town in old Civilization games at harder difficulties.  Unfortunately, it's also rather tedious.\n\nIf you're a fan of Civilization and the idea of Civ in space sounds enticing, then this is the game you should be looking at.  It's not perfect and the learning curve is substantial, but there's a lot of promise here.  I'm not sure if there is a follow-up in the works or not, but this is an amazing first effort and I can absolutely see the potential for successive versions to challenge Sid Meier's lordship over the 4X[en.wikipedia.org] genre.","February 25, 2014","true","99.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lazarus_mt/recommended/208140/","lazarus_mt","Lazarus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lazarus_mt/","12 products in account","Firstly, the surface stuff. the graphics and music are pretty good - the sounds are quiet and atmospheric like you would expect for the universe it's based in. The visuals are nice, and the manual battle sequences are pretty while most of your time is really spent in the battle map, where the UI, once you get used to it, works well enough. I find in a lot of these 4X type games, once you have a large amount of planets/cities/systems/whatever, it gets kind of tedious giving them orders every turn, but for the most part, come end game, you're either pumping out units or pushing for production to research or dust bonuses, so it's not that bad.\n\nNow for story.  The factions all have stories and even intro videos that are actually interesting (the first time around). But don't get this game if you expect any kind of campaign because there is none - the story really ends at the beginning of a match. There isn't really much personality in the factions and how they act, it's more to do with some of the diplomatic factors you share with them. What is great though about factions is the multitude of customization traits. Each race has starting research and unique abilities and weakneses, and that you as someone who may want to make your own faction can try to balance yourself as you carve out their identity. Things like modifiers for diplomatic options, population growth, resource management, ship enchancements, etc.\n\nNow the negative - taking a bad path in research can lead you down a disasterous path. There are things that are important to get and things that are only time sinks, and it is hard to know which is which when you're first starting out. The random nature of battles makes it kind of annoying at times - the only real strategy when it comes to battle is fleet composition and using certain modifiers at certain times, like boosts to armor or weapons power, but direct control over things is not something that is possible. The AI is a little dumb as well - early on, placing colonies at choke points is a way to box them in and sometimes they don't really do anything about it. Their minds change constantly about you, and alliances fall apart quickly or pop up out of nowhere because of something as miniscule as the fact that your colonies are neighbours.\n\nBut despite those points, I found the game quite enjoyable. The games take a long time, and there is a good amount of variety in customizing maps, so chances are you will get a fair amount of play time out of it. Basically, the more you play the more you will hone the route through the research tree and balancing all the other factors.\n\nI'd recommend this game for sure, but say that the expansion really is something you should only get if you like the game yourself - the amount of content it adds is decent, but you will not make or break your initial impression by missing out on it (or getting it for that matter).","June 9, 2015","true","174.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Wide gameplay, but shallow depths. You have planets to manage, systems to conquer, fancy space battles you can watch and organise. Lots of things to do.\n\nUntil you get into the game. My first match, normal, random AI, default starting stuff I spent a lot of time clicking the "end turn" button. If you don't get the AI to manage your systems for you, you will get waaaaayyyy too many systems to check up on. The research tree is pretty big, and learning what to research is kinda of difficult starting out.\n\nEssentially, there's too much of an info-dump of things that may or may not matter with the tutorial bits, and I did what I shouldn't and skipped it. Info-dump + not particularly complex gameplay. There's no mega-fleets (yet), or commanding ships like in E.V.E. of "torpedoes on the port ship! Engage beam weapons!". It's just a cutscene where you choose 3 tasks for your ships to do and that's it for ship vs ship stuff.\n\nHave not tried out ship vs planet stuff yet though.\n\n\nWill edit later. Leaning towards the "not recommended", but I don't think I've played the dlcs yet (still in first game, lol). 2-3 hours of my gameplay were spent idling.

Namely:Sins of a solar empire and Space empires gold edition.","June 13, 2014","false","72.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So my experience is extremely limited to say the least.\n\nThe only reason I got into this game is because of my love for the sci-fi. All those ships fighting in space looked very cool.\n\nThis game has a learning curve, and you might need to watch some videos on how to actually play it, what researches to complete and in what order, for example, this chick knows her shít:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcw-IheRx7UqeOZMTU6fdz-gU8APFeDAh\n\nSo after watching her videos I was able to win my first game on normal difficulty (which is definitely not easy).\n\nOnce you learn, it becomes very easy to understand what to do and when. It's just like in RTS games – you build armies and destroy opponent, only with more ways to win and everyone takes turns.\n\nTo sum everything up, it’s a very good entrance to a 4X strategy genre. At this stage, this game is fun, perfectly polished, fast paced for a TBS and relatively easy to understand.

If you don't understand why this is the case, then you don't really understand how to use the diplomacy system. Master it (which is really nothing more than learning a few tricks, albeit ones that many people inexplicably fail to discover) and even the -195 point race achievement becomes effortless, even boring.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesn't get much better even when playing stupidly (meaning not taking full advantage of the diplomacy system). Simplistic, counter-based ship design, similar to GalCiv2 (which suffers from many of the same problems), fails to provide much opportunity for meaningful tinkering, and the system of choosing a few tactics when going into battle is not an adequate substitute for actual tactical combat. I suppose that if you're super-interested in economic optimization, and aren't going to look too hard at the diplomacy system, you might find this game interesting.\n\nOtherwise, you might want to look elsewhere.","October 29, 2015","false","75.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I will assume you know what a 4X space game is about and just list how Endless Space fares in my opinion.\n\nWhat Endless Space does really well:\n- Impressive graphics\n- Keeps micromanagement surprisingly low\n- Balanced tech-tree\n- Even with differences in research levels, battles are still not one-sided\n- The KI opponents are quite capable diplomats. Where I usually NEVER accept an offer from KI-opponents in other games, the "Endless Space" ones managed to "sell" me deals by offering the right incentives.\n\nWhat it does okay (meaning it's nothing special):\n- Several ways to win\n- Different species and the option to create your own\n- The KI opponents are quite good although they do get an unfair ingame advantage. I would prefer to be able to choose their difficulty AND the amount of "advantage" they get seperately.\n- Diplomatic options have to be researched. While it does make for an interesting game mechanic I would still prefer to have all diplomatic options from the start.\n\nWhat is missing:\n- No espionage, sabotage, inciting rebellions etc.\n- There is basically NOTHING besides the respective faction-intro to evoke some atmosphere in the game. Even when you finally win you only get a small picture of your faction and a rather neutral text telling you that you've just achieved economic / military / scientifiy victory.\n\nSummary\nAll in all I would give it 4 out of 5 stars. It's very good and addictive but putting some atmosphere in there (voice-overs, a few animated messages etc.) would go a long way. Having some espionage and full access to diplomatic functions from the start would also help to make it even better.","October 26, 2014","true","107.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Let me explain why.\n\nSure you have fleets in space check. You have planets you can build stuff on check. You can research technologies all check. What they don't tell you is there are plenty of 4x strategy games that accomplish these basics. The question is does this game accomplish it better? My answer is meh..... Yes, meh.......\n\nLet me ellaborate. Many people complain of the card system for fleet battles in this game. By way of explanation before one of the three rounds starts you and the A.I must choose a card that fits your strategy. You have many options even starting off and more when you research them. How do they work in actual application? The difference is negligible really. Yeah the right card choice can make a tie a victory and the wrong card choice can make a tie a loss. What it can't do is make superior vessels lose. While i respect this choice for balance's sake it has one major drawback. Space conflict does not require much thought. Planning yes, thought no. TBH the disaster that was MOO3 is better in that sense but not graphically of course. The space battles do look nice.\n\nMoving on to planets. Like i said yeah you can build on planets. The way they implement planetary research and production meh.... You can not have individual planetary production queues. I'd be fine with that if it were more like Galactic Civ 3 and you have the option of having a spacedock at every planet producing ships slowly or sending industry to one spacedock. This game does not have that option. Don't take me wrong I am not a Galactic Civ fanboy by any means. IMHO they are mediocre as well for one simple fact. The gaming experience does not evolve that much. Yet this game suffers from that sentiment even more.\n\nMoving on to research. Yeah they have research. How do i rate it a tiny bit above meh.... to meeehhhh??.... While on paper the research ideas are good. The way the game implements them is very meh.... This is not the reaserch tree's fault though. It is the planet building and space combat's fault. Those systems make seeing tangible results not so immersive. Which is where Galactic Civ 3 shines and Endless Waste does not. Endless Waste is not very immersive. In Galciv 3 for instance it is surprisingly clear what effect the combat research has in combat. You can watch the missile hit and do damage to another ship. You see the ship catch on fire if it does not have enough Point Defense and the missile is strong enough. In Endless Waste you don't have that. Point defense don't launch lasers or countermeasures etc. Missile impacts don't leave clouds of debris and ships smoking and/or flaming. Making it feel like frankly not much is happening. It becomes quickly boring except through statistics... if you are a statistical person. The same with planetary infrastructure even though TBH the same can be said about that with majority of 4X strategy games including Galactic Civ 3. The major difference is with nothing truly immersive in Endless Waste you don't really feel compelled to keep playing. Your choices simply do not matter except through statistics. So in essence since neither planetray infrastructure or space combat is immersive how can research be immersive? The other two affect the one.\n\nLeaving to one last consideration money. Is Endless Waste worth the money? To that I say depends. Let me elaborate. If you love statistics, if you love space and the concept of technologies, if you love that when on sale this is drastically cheaper than Galactic Civ 3 this is for you. For everyone else at most just like myself it's meh... at best.\n\nIn summary Endless Waste except for the select few is just that an Endless Waste of potential. If they only put in a tiny bit more effort this game would be playable for most of us. Right now not so much. It's too bad because i liked the concept.","December 27, 2015","false","24.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

So the game only pushes you to war between civilizations, making other research abilities a bit pointless. so you go to war but then get a pretty awful combat system...

Ship designs and combat are lacking, and turns take too long.\n--If you're expecting Sid Meier's Civilization: In Space, get this title.  There are more likenesses to Civilization than any other game I can think of.\n\nLong version:\nI put over 20 hours into this game, and played three games.  I picked it up after checking the resoundingly positive reviews, hoping it'd be something it wasn't.\n\nPROS:\n-A well made game.  This is not some Flash or iPhone game that got ported.  A lot of work and love was put into its creation.\n-Diverse techtree and upgrade paths let you pick which way you want to develop.\n-Multiple win conditions, (even though it eventually veers towards enemy battleships coming to take you down when the game tells on you for being close to victory)\n\n\nCONS:\n-Steep learning curve, laden with pages upon pages of text in tutorials that overwhelm the new player with information they are unlikely to remember or make use of when it is explained.\n-Game prone to freezes and crashes.\n-Game ends before you're ready.  "Oh, you captured MOST of the population.  we'll just take it as read that you won.  Good game!  Have a title screen!"\n-Nuances of combat can be incredibly frustrating.  "Enemy fleet occupying your system, and you want to make them run?  Attack!  Oh.  They retreated?  That's cool, too.  ... ... but why are they still in my system? >_>"  This can go on for several turns before you figure out what's causing it, or how to stop it.\n-Combat is too simple, and you don't even get to play it.  You pick three "cards" for three phases of combat, then sit back and watch it play out (Or more realistically, Auto through it).\n-Balance in combat leaves a bit to be desired.  "Pack 9001 beams onto a ship, and use cards that amplify beam efficacy" tends to trump a diversely equipped spaceship.\n-Race picks for custom races are oddly specific, and awkwardly costed.  "The Price of Beauty" does not automatically spark in my brain "Oh, that must mean "increased ship costs", right?  And the 30 point pick (nearly half your base pick points), Tolerant, is a pick designed to allow for quick expansion before necessary colonizing techs have been researched, but the morale drawbacks quickly overpower that bonus.  However, the 10 point cost "Optimistic" gives a system wide morale bonus, which directly translates into more resources, both early and late.","April 23, 2015","false","24.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

This Is a suggestion that you try to find a demo or some way to play the game before you buy it. I have not played this game nearly enough to review it, This could be a really good game, There are certainly solid design ideas and game mechanics but... I'm really doubting that I'll be able to get into it.\n\nAllow me to explain. In a game like civ 5, my experience has been that while there is strategic depth to be had, its not forced on you. I was able to pick up the concepts of civ 5 fairly quick, and I didn't have the feeling that I needed to understand everything to play the game. This game was precisely the opposite.\n\nI was so completely overwhelmed in the tutorial by the sheer number of screens, boxes, information tabs, icons, phases, etc, that I quit the game out of frustration because I felt like I was retaining almost none of the information dumped upon me. Add to that the fact that almost every tab background was the same semi-transparent grey box making them all look fairly similar and the unnessary complication of the  renaming of game concepts like money and resources to things like "dust" and "FIDS", and it's pretty clear to me that there were plenty of things that could have been made so much simpler without any real loss in depth.\n\nTo fans of the game, Please don't misunderstand me. I'm sure its a terrific game. I wanted to enjoy it as much as anyone else, but I have neither an extraordinary amount of patience nor a fantastic memory, and I feel like one of those things is required to enjoy this game.","April 19, 2015","false","0.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","3"

Was winning a game on hard until AI started running fleets into one of my systems. They'd attack and immediately retreat, exausting my fleets moves. Was unable to attack them on the retreat. This meant they could sit siege weapons on the system unharmed; unable to attack them, unable to attack any other fleets.\n\nCynamitics were cool at first. Until you figure out it's the same sequence every time.\n\nShip building is fun in the beginning. But you start to realise how limited your options are. There are only 2 kinds of ships in the end; war ships and siege ships. You can't diversify your war ships because you can't choose who's on the front-line in space. Meaning, the only diversity you'l have in your fleet is between your upgraded units and your older units. Medium range and short range weapons are worthless so load up on medium and short range defense and stack long range attack.\n\nThe game feels a little spread thin. What is there is good but after 10 hours you feel like you've seen it all.\n\nIn summary: Very fun in the beginning but eventually loses it's charm. Good buy on a steam 80% off deal but don't buy at full price.

As with all new strategy titles there is a small learning curve, and depending on what race you play as will affect what playstyle and type of victory you will probably go for. Multiplayer and singleplayer, and to be completely fair I haven't even messed around with any of the features just been playing a couple of the single player games.\nSo if strategy games are your thing, get this.

Late game combat is huge numbers of ships divided into fleets of limited size all attacking each other one by one to see who wins (just like Civ 4).\n\nThat said if you like Civ 4 and don't mind the lategame grind (unless you rush culture etc) and the fact that the combat in this is about as interactive as the combat in Civ 4 (Attack this - oh ♥♥♥♥ you're dead. Lets hope one of the 19 other units just like you eventually wins) then you'll get along well with this.\n\nSo reccomended just be warned. The pretty screenshots are less than 10% of the game. Most of it is admin. Admin with a good soundtrack, interesting lore, nicely balanced but feeling difference races and racial ships etc.","June 25, 2014","true","87.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Though it holds some similarities with Spore and the Harmony faction reminds me of the crystal species from Stargate SG-1. If you have a lot of time on your hands or enjoy games that take a long time then this is the game for you.\n\nA nice turn based strategy game that gives you a 4 branched skill tree, with every species having their own special skills. Maps can be tiny to huge! I love that you can pick  the type of galaxy you play in and being able to make your own faction. Ship building is very complex though you cant actually design a ship but you can add or remove components to change the function of a ship.\n\nSpace battles are, in my opinion, really awesome! At the beginning of the encounter you pick a counter measure for each of the 3 phases and then either click Automatic or Manual. Automatic does a quick battle showing health bars and what not. Manual on the other hand goes through a cinematic of the attacking fleet coming out of warp near the defending fleet, and then the battle begins. Some counter measures will cancel the other fleets out and some will allow both to be used.\n\nDepending on your faction you have to keep your populations happy or they will go on strike. Many factors such as anomolies on planets, overpopulation, and expanding too fast through out the galaxy all play apart in population happiness.  You can terraform planets to your needs and discover ancient technologies made by the mysterious Endless.","June 27, 2014","true","20.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I personally love Civ V but just became bored of it after a while because I felt it was too cluttered and it really annoyed me for some reason. Endless Space has so much to offer but at the same time the UI is one of cleanest I have ever used. It is fairly simple to get into as I felt I knew the mechanics very well after just a few hours of playing the game. Also, the graphics are extraordinary in my opinion. I don't feel like any of the battles could graphically be any more polished (besides some variation in ship positions, which would make them feel less repetitive). Overall I strongly reccommend this game and I think you are a fool to not buy it at its current sale price ($7.49).

It has a unique and simple battle system so anybody new to 4x games will know what to do.\n\nEvery game you start feels different from the last one, even if you keep to the same setup. Also there is no solid learning curve as there are many possibilities and out comes. Even if you do come across a situation that feels familiar the out come and your position with in the game may lead you down a completely different path than the one you were expecting. This makes every game you play highly unpredictable.\nThe game can be quite difficult and frustrating for beginners, even on easy. The level of weapons tech of your enemies very quickly matches yours if you do not invest in your own weapons technologies during a conflict. This makes the game challenging on every level.\nAfter long play the game can get repetitive. Dealing with all your planets on each turn can get complicated and frustrating. You can save on any turn.\n\nThe game graphics are stunning. The level of detail they have put in, on the planets, the galaxy and the battle scenes are amazing. You can tell they have taken there time to get this game looking good.\n\nThe sound effects are not quite in the same power of the graphic. However they are simple and effective for this type of game. The sound track is very good and sets the tone of the game well.\n\nThe controls work very well. You can operate most of the game with just a click of a mouse. You do have the option to name planets and ships which obviously requires a keyboard.\n\nI do recommend this game for the amount of detail they have put in to the graphics, storyline and descriptions of technologies.

If you expect the depth of a Civilisation title you'll better don't get it. But is has some of it within. There is a great tech tree, some neat mechanics and a great Ship Modification System. Playtime of a full set of course depends on how many enemies and which difficulty you choose.\n\nI really, really like to give some big props to the Developers, because it's beautifully designed and nice and clean to play. These things really make me want to check out the Endless Dungeons Title from them.\n\nSo in conclusion; In case you search some turnbased strategy in space and you don't want to get all too deep into the Civilisations thing - get it. The first 30min are preserved to get into the game, but I'm sure almost everyone will actually get into it after these minutes of training. Speaking of training, there is only a textbased Tutorial which covers about 85% of the mechanics basics. But, for me, it was enought to figure out the rest of the gameplay.\n\nWhat is sad, is that the multiplayer (at least the public one) is almost dead.

Those who are not fans of comparatively slow paced strategy games may feel the length of turns at times, but the feeling of reward turn after turn is rewarding. The combat is unique for it's kind, if not intuitive. It can add lengths to turns, but that is it's only detriment. The custom faction bit adds a lot of replayability after you get comfortable with the game, and I have barely touched the online scene. All in all, if you like strategy games, space sims, or any combination of the forementioned games, I HIGHLY reccomend this.

An extensive tech tree and custom ship designs leave lots of room for variety, and as the game progresses these factors force changes in tactics to keep players on their toes. The expansion and colonisation system is remarkably good, and even with dozens of worlds to manage the beautifully simple UI ensures it is never a chore. Combat may not be to the taste of everyone, however. A very hands off affair, the player chooses cards to establish their tactics in a three-turn battle, and then it plays out itself. For those who love real-time battles this could be a turn off, for those of us who prefer combat to be less of a distraction it''s a godsend.

It's belongs in the 8s, not the 7s, IMO.\n\nAs many have said. It's pretty.\n\nSomething not many have said is that the UI is uncharacteristically strong for the genre, which is something I especially appreciate now that I write UI rather than game reviews for a living.\n\nMost importantly, it scratches the MOO itch like nothing else has for me to date . I tried but could never really get into Gal Civ. SoTs was heaps of fun while it lasted but not really a similar enough experience to satisfy the same cravings. More than any other 4X sci-fi game I've played to date, Endless comes closest to the MOO2 experience not because it's trying too hard  as a me-too game, but because deep in the roots of Endless's game design, you can see that its designers really understand a lot of the critical aspects of what made that game fun (and even some of the things it could have done better).\n\nThere's definitely some stuff that I wish was different of course.\n\nFor instance, the best terraforming tech is way too far up the tech tree. By the time you've come close to perfecting all of your worlds, the AI will be threatening to clobber you with one of many non-eXterminating victories if you haven't all but stomped it into near oblivion at that point. Enjoying the role of magitech one-climate-world planetologist as much as I have in many games over the years, it bummed me out a little but I haven't tried fiddling with the settings that slow the game's pace down yet.\n\nTo be fair, however, there's plenty of planet-tinkering to be done and the game takes the stances that there really should be no useless planets. Asteroids bring unique system improvement opportunities. A certain hero gives insanely beefy boosts to gas giants which give the strongest resource boosts per colonist but to a high degree of specialty and with a very low max pop. Barren and volcano worlds suck for the reasons they typically do but can actually boost their specialty resource production higher than more ideal equivalents once a given system can afford the unhappy colonist hit.\n\nFor the most part, upgrades are system-wide (which makes high world count systems extremely desirable since most resource-boosting improvements are per-colonist) but each planet can also have an "exploitation" built for it which essentially gives an added boost in one of the resource types with additional boosts for specific planet types.\n\nResource balancing is pretty unobtrusive. If one of the four resource units isn't in enough supply you'll notice in the form of things not happening as fast as you would like them to rather than disaster. No food means zero pop growth, rather than starvation, for instance. I'm a little dizzy at times so I appreciate this. I also like that the game won't let you end a turn without research selected as there are a ton of topics and research can move pretty fast.\n\nHappiness is the thing you have to really think about or risk being punished for it. Colonists dislike excessive expansion. They can actually get grumpy at you for overpopulation and excessive expansion at the same time (uncanny realism for the human-originating factions, IMO). This effectively eliminates colony-spamming as the one-true-colonizing strategy, making it better to focus not just on quality systems at first but on where you're colonizing them due to the game's zone of influence mechanic, which is basically a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-on/flag-planting mechanic where colonies sprout faction territory zones after (arbitrary perhaps, but it works) 30 turns. Zones grow and push each other and you can't colonize inside another faction's  zone, which forces a lot of interesting strategic decisions and requires thinking about colonization rather than Zerging it.\n\nI actually like the AI for the most part. The only thing I'm still on the fence about is the fact that a faction will sometimes go to war on you because your score is getting too high. I kind of wish I could turn that off because that makes the AI opponents feel more like simulations of not-very-smart human opponents than simulations of other alien factions but that brings me to a point I really love about the AI. I know that the AI declared war on me for that reason because THE GAME TOLD ME. It's possible the AI will go to war on you for stupid reasons, but never for "no reason" as the most helpful review to date reports. The game tells you why the AI did what it did. All you have to do is read the event report and it usually makes sense.\n\nThe other thing that's fun about the AI is that it isn't stingey and it knows when to quit.  When an AI faction declares war on you and you immediately start gobbling up its colonies like popcorn it will offer you several systems to get you to stop in the hastily offered surrender agreement. It's a nice change from those cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to hock their antimissile rockets for your Xentronium armor for the 20th time in a game or having to conquer 3/4 of their entire empire before they'll even consider peace.\n\nIt's still terribly stupid when it comes to evaluating circumstances like the fact that every ship in your considerably smaller armada has 4 layers of kinetic shielding and beam weapons and every ship in its fleets has kinetic weapons and zero beam shielding but I wouldn't have it any other way. Punishing that kind of stupid is fun.\n\nCombat and ship design were satisfying enough for me, but could use more nuance and there's essentially no tactics. There are three weapon types that each work best at a certain range/phase of battle. Each has a counter defense. Weapons and defenses can be added in quantity at their respective hardpoints. There are a variety of support and special modules but most serve to add fixed modifiers to that essential formula (fighters and bombers being an exception). So design is really around offense vs. the defense and what the AI is likely to be fielding (hint: mostly kinetic in the early game).\n\nFights consist of setting targeting priorities and special power cards to play for three phases/ranges of battles that can cancel other player's cards out if they're of the right category and then hitting "manual" to watch the fight play it or "auto" if you feel safe not watching a different algorithm sort the battle out, potentially killing ships that would otherwise be nigh impregnable in a watched battle.\n\nAs I said, satisfying enough and I like the cards better in practice than I did on paper. Hero levelling and tech unlock fairly interesting ones and they won't overturn a major disadvantage. But I prefer gadgets and a wide variety of weaponry with quirks and unique behavior within a given type. There's no clever gyro-destabilizer/tractor beam combos to be had here and absolutely no thought to be put into whether you want the next level of kinetic, beam, or missile weapon because it's just bettter and there's really only one upgrade path for each. I definitely hope we get something more tactical and varied if there's an ES2 as this is one of the few spots I felt the game overstreamlined things.\n\nOne thing that impressed me on the other hand is the way they handled custom factions. ES has MOO's faction detailed individuality cake (granular stuff like research specialties and other races they liked/hated) and eats MOO2's customization too by giving each of the established factions a faction affinity that's a sort of template of specialized abilities, tech tree options and diplomatic dispositions that are decoupled from a fairly detailed point-buy system and whatever appearance you choose.\n\nAny criticism aside, this game is a very solid addition to the genre with a lot of good ideas. It may not have the 1000+ hours longevity like MOO2 has had for me but it might have MOO1's and I fully expect to get a lot of play out of it.","August 3, 2014","true","137.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought this game durring the holidays sales expecting something along the lines of civilization. Which is partialy true. To that I must say, if you long to play civilization play civilization. This game is by no means bad, but when held up against Triple A titles like the Civilization franchise it leaves much to be desired. Every time I play this game I don't last long knowing I could just as easily be playing Civilization V with a few brief mouse clicks.\nThe combat is oddly enjoyable to watch, but more or less comes down to a complicated game of rock paper sissors in which the person with the most units wins (most of the time). Some aspects of the planetary leveling system seem overly complex, and I found little challenge with the games AI.\n\nHowever, something draws me to this game. If you like turn based tactics, and strategy, or world building sims like the Civilization franchise, and if you are a fan of sci fi that longs to spread your cultural ideals... or your love space debries and burning plasma then this game may be for you.\n\nIF your a fan of Sci Fi and are familure to the Empire building genre it's worth a look\nBut if your looking for the next evolution in Empire building strategy, you may want to pass this game over\nAll in all I still recommed this game, it's nothing compared to its Big Brother Civilization, but it has it's own charm and atmosphere which I personaly enjoyed.

If you like CiV, but want a little science fiction in your strat/expansion games this is the perfect little dish.  I find it less complex than Sins of Solar Empire, but it has a lot of repeat value.  I might suggest playing a few games against a single AI until you get the full grasp of the game as the tutorial didn't completely cover everything in my opinion.  Managing fleets isn't as intuitive as I would like but you quickly get the hang of it as you start sending out colony ships.   I like the cinematic styled battles, but I won't lie after a while you tend to just click auto to sum it up quickly and move on, after all you've got solar systems to colonize and no'body got time for that cinematic battle stuff.  The skill trees are nice and branching, but still let you just zero in on what you're looking for and each race sort of has that "instant victory" skill set you can aim for in order to try and lock down the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030374042/recommended/208140/","76561198030374042","commander515","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030374042/","121 products in account","Being a decades-long veteran of space empire-building games, and having followed and supported the development of this game since beta, I can honestly say that I am fairly well-acquainted with the goals and motivations that drove Endless Space to be what it has become. While it definitely follows in the footsteps of many of the games that have preceded it in its genre, the developers at Amplitude have succeeded quite well in creating a unique game with its own vision and theme.\n\nAt a basic level, Endless Space takes inspiration from classic games like Master of Orion, Stars! and Spaceward Ho! The interfaces are clean, simple, and intuitive, controls are easy and responsive to use and useful information that the player requires to make good decisions is presented in a straightforward and organized manner. Easily navigable menus, well-labeled buttons and a handful of sliders ensure that any function or command is no more than two or three clicks away at all times. Empire management, ship design, diplomacy, and research all blend seamlessly together, enabling a player to manage even a fairly large empire relatively quickly, keeping turns short and the game moving at a solid pace.\n\nWhile Endless Space does contain all of the standard space empire-builder conventions, they are generally presented in a very flavorful way. Like Master of Orion and its sequel, Endless Space has a rich and lore-heavy backstory behind it; the difference is that this lore permeates the gameplay itself in a much more extensive way. It also takes a page from the Civ series of games by introducing strategic resources that can provide bonuses to players that control them, as well as limiting the availability of certain technologies by requiring them as prerequisites for ship components and even some facilities. Many planets possess unique features, of which there are many, which will provide specific bonuses (or penalties) depending on the technology the player has at hand.\n\nShip design is easy but broad in scope; there are six different size classes for hulls, each of which is better suited to fulfilling certain roles. Even the largest hulls cannot hope to carry much of everything, forcing you to design specialized vessels and build mixed fleets to deal with specific scenarios. Space combat is a real-time, strategic experience that rewards good planning and recon, rather than reflexes. Much like in GalCiv2, starship weapons and defenses utilize a rock/paper/scissors approach; care must be taken to balance your ships to match an enemy's strengths and exploit their weaknesses. Each weapon type has a specific range where it is the most effective, and specific tactics must be chosen to maximize the effectiveness of weapons fire as well as counter the enemy's plans.\n\nDiplomacy is not given short shrift, either; a detailed counter keeps a record of all the different factors influencing your relationship with the other factions and gives you a comprehensive breakdown of why they like (or hate) you. There are extensive options for signing agreements and making trades, as well as a number of potential relationship states, and access to all of these depends on how many xenocultural techs you have researched as well. (The only weakness in this area is the lack of a detailed espionage system). The tech tree itself is extensive and provides a wealth of options depending on your preferred playstyle, with several of the victory conditions tied directly to tech tree items\n\nThe game has changed considerably in the time since it was first released; the developers have shown great interaction with the community and have responded directly to player feedback in shaping the content provided by each new update. Players who have bought the game and joined the community gained the ability to cast votes for what they prefer to see next; we have seen the inclusion of entire new races, an updated tech tree with more race-specific techs, an overhaul to the ship design system, the addition of strike craft and improved invasion and siege mechanics, and exploration-related random events. Planetary wonders, unique planets, and an array of powerful leaders who can be hired and gain experience levels from governing planets or leading fleets add a deep level of strategy. Add all of this to a wealth of options when setting up a new game, and Endless Space allows for literally 'endless' replayability for hundreds (if not thousands) of hours of deep strategic gameplay.","December 27, 2013","true","336.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you like CiV, but want a little science fiction in your strat/expansion games this is the perfect little dish.  I find it less complex than Sins of Solar Empire, but it has a lot of repeat value.  I might suggest playing a few games against a single AI until you get the full grasp of the game as the tutorial didn't completely cover everything in my opinion.  Managing fleets isn't as intuitive as I would like but you quickly get the hang of it as you start sending out colony ships.   I like the cinematic styled battles, but I won't lie after a while you tend to just click auto to sum it up quickly and move on, after all you've got solar systems to colonize and no'body got time for that cinematic battle stuff.  The skill trees are nice and branching, but still let you just zero in on what you're looking for and each race sort of has that "instant victory" skill set you can aim for in order to try and lock down the game.  I haven't had much time to try Disharmony as I just learned about the DLC.","December 28, 2013","true","17.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Regardless of settings, unless you're a master strategist and/or know strategy games inside out, you just can't beat it. It's really annoying, because i really like what this game offers i.e. good gameplay at the start, nice 3d environment and solar systems, ship design, tech research etc.... but then it spoils it when you're nice little growing solar systems are overrun with enemies every time. Yes i get that it's seemingly a more serious game than most strategy games (which it doesn't really communicate in the listing), but when i pay ~£20 for a game i want to be able to at least use one mode of that normal folk can use.\n\nOther than the difficulty issue, its a really good game.","February 18, 2014","true","18.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
