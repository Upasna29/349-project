If you haven't played motogp for a few years, this one is to get. I don't think I would pay 40 euros for the same engine based game. I would expect AAA optimized graphics, but Compact is really balanced at the price and features. If you like MotoGP, this one is to get.","December 12, 2015","true","2.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","23","25","5","8"

I'm getting canned on 'Very Easy'... I've turned off most of the help, like the guide line and steering assist, but still...In Forza that wouldn't be a problem. I usually find the guide line distracting. MotoGP 15 is a lot of fun. I appreciate the difficulty, I love motorcycle racing, the graphics are good, and I dont have anything to complain about. Especially at $10. If you want a game that's built around letting you win, skip this one. Otherwise gruel on.","December 22, 2015","true","0.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

As for the fact I couldn't make an online username/account (due to not being sent the registration email?!) I refunded and have to give it a negative review. What's the point of online scoreboards if you can't access them...?","January 11","false","0.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheVeganSocialist/recommended/403880/","TheVeganSocialist","The Vegan Socialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheVeganSocialist/","231 products in account","Beware Newbies.\n\nAfter recently getting into racing games and wanting to try out a bike racing game, I picked up MotoGP 15 Compact after reading a review from another user. I was excited to try the game and was looking forward to riding a motorbike for the first time.\n\nThat being said, I have to warn you. This game is not for newbies. It is not an entry into racing games by any means. This game's controls are exceptionally difficult and personally I was not willing to put the effort into learning them.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, sound is on point and everything is top notch but those controls are extremely unforgiving, even with all the assists turn on. I know some of you may simply think I'm a noob, but that's the whole point. From a newbie's prespective I would definitely recommend avoiding this one as it is clearly catered to people who have experience with racing games.\n\nI could barely keep my bike on the road and couldn't get out of last place no matter how hard I tried due to the extremely difficult learning curve. This is not a game for newbies and definitely not for people just starting out with racing games. Unfrortunately I can't really recommend any other alternatives so if you do want to put in the effort to learning the mechanics and controls in this game just understand that it will take a very long time to master.","December 31, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","26","5","19","9","3"

Looks like it runs on a gameboy. Sound hasnt even worked for me so far. Also, where the hell are my kawasakis????!!!!!!
