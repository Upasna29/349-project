They currently have a deal with Sony for a time exclusive DLC featuring an Ant-Man story/characters and Civil War characters, which will release in a few months for all other platforms.\n\nFirst things first, is this better than Lego Marvel Superheroes?\n\nIn my opinion, yes and no.\n\nBased on the roster, I liked Superheroes better because it had all of my favorite characters and the more iconic characters all in one. So don't go into this expecting to see Deadpool, The Fantastic Four, or the X-Men as this game focuses soley on the Avengers MCU and comic universe. If Marvel doesn't own the sole rights to put them in a movie, they won't be in this game. But they still have a great roster of over 190 different characters.\n\nGameplay wise, it is much better. Combat seems more fluid. There are now combat specials where you use your second character to take down enemies. They added super jumps to certain characters. Speedsters are really fun to play as. Quicksilver is earsily one of my favorites to play as with their new mechanics. The voice acting for most of the main cast is ripped straight from the movies to give it an authentic feeling. For the most part, it sounds good, but there are parts where it just doesn't sound right. The graphics actually look much better, in my opinion. All returning characters have been completely revamped with new movesets and animations. Tony Stark and his Iron suits also have a neat animation when switching characters that makes it seem like your inside his helmet, like in the movies. Unlike Marvel Superheroes, there are now several different hub areas you can explore. They include Tony Stark's beach house in Malibu, S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ, South Africa, Hawkeye's farm, Slovenia, Asgard, and the return of Manhattan.\n\nI did run into a few bugs here and there that caused me to restart a level or two, but nothing game breaking. A few freezes and stutters here and there, especially when flying or jumping, but otherwise, smooth 60 FPS on high settings.\n\nI was able to completely beat the game in about 30 hours. That includes collecting all the gold/red bricks, vehicles/characters, Stan's in peril, and minikits.\n\nOverall, it's a great game for any Marvel fan. I grew up playing the Lego series, and I still enjoy them today at 21. If you're a fan of the movies, you'll definitely be a fan of this game, as TT has yet to disappoint. The retail price is $40 at the time of this review, but with all Lego games, they'll likely drop down to $7.50 during a sale within the next year. If you can't wait, I was able to pick it up for about $10 from a third-party key seller website whose logo is a penguin. *hint hint*\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/405310","February 1","true","30.4"," 151 of 160 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","151","160","12","0"

Run around whacking enemies using your super heroes special power, be it Hulk’s strength or Captain America’s shield, you will get to play as your favourite heroes in style here. I am about three levels into the game thus far and have had a good range of different puzzles and action to take part in. Your inner Lego builder will absolutely love smashing all of the scenery and objects to get that magic 100% brick mark on every level too.\n\nI am playing the game on 4k and the game looks exactly the same as the rest of the series. You can drop it down to lower resolutions but you will lose the crispness of the models and textures. As with the rest of the series, all of the animations are absolutely flawless. Unlike the previous Marvel game in the series, Marven Avengers uses original voice acting that is pulled straight from the six films this game is based off. There are also a couple of lines from a few characters that have been specially recorded just for the purpose of this game.\n\nThe story of the game is based off The Avengers, Avengers Age of Ultron, Captain America, Iron Man 3, Thor: Dark World and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Meaning you are going to get an absolutely stunning plot. I am like a little kid again following this story as I haven’t seen a few of the films; I am looking forward to seeing how it all plays out.\n\nDon’t expect to get a massive challenge in this game, dying doesn’t really come with any penalty, and the puzzles can normally be figured out pretty quickly. That doesn’t take away any of the fun though, you will find yourself spending hours just running around in awe at the structures and objects in this game that are made out of Legos!  Level design is always the Lego games stronger points, with sooooo many collectibles, and hundreds of side missions to feast on.\n\nThere is also a lot of replay ability in this game, you will need to go back and replay levels if you want to unlock everything, as some parts of the stage will require a certain hero which you may not have unlocked yet. This is one of my favourite things to do once I finish the main story as you get to replay old content while still being rewarded.\n\nAs said above, I am running on 4k with the texture quality set to high and I am getting a silky smooth 60 fps. I have suffered from one freeze in game play that lasted about five seconds, not sure what will have caused this so I am going to assume it is a one off. The game plays perfectly with a game pad and I would recommend you do to. The ease of a second player dropping in and out of gameplay is again a major strong point making couch co-op relevant.\n\nEven though I am only about an hour and a half into this game, I can easily highly recommend Lego: Marvel Avengers as a brilliant game. I love the Lego series, and this game is going to probably be one of its most popular releases. The game’s retail price on Steam is £24,99, I would say that is a fair price, but you can find it a lot cheaper elsewhere and Lego games do go on sale fairly regularly, so you may want to bear that in mind.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/staticquake/recommended/405310/","staticquake","hawkskye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/staticquake/","124 products in account","Today on I Can't Believe I'm An Adult and Paid $40 For This Game: Lego Marvel's Avengers.\n\nFirst off, it's a Lego game. If you don't like running around, smashing everything in sight, janky controls poorly ported from consoles, and inexplicable chickens, this changes very little in the formula. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it and all that.\n\nSecond, it's improved. (Graphically.) If you played Lego Marvel Superheroes, almost all of the characters that made the jump to this one have been made better in one way or another, even if it's just graphically. Thor, perhaps, was one of the most fun to play with, now that Mjolnir stays electrified and easily deflects projectiles heading your way. They also made up for Hawkeye's relative uselessness in the MCU (I love you, Clint, but it's true) by giving him several more block types to interact with than the previous game. The graphics are actually very nice and I can still run it maxed out on my definitely-not-a-gaming-computer. That's always a nice feeling.\n\nThird: open world. Grand Theft LEGO never fails to amuse me, but I'm easily amused and if you give me the opportunity to have the Hulk steal a car and drive it around New York City until it explodes, I'm going to take it. They took what was already the best part of the previous game and made it even better, IMO, and I've barely had a chance to play it. (UPDATE 2/2: Make sure you check out some of the other hubs besides Manhattan for more content -- also Coulson doesn't bug you about some guy stealing a purse every two minutes, which is nice.)\n\nFour: the heroes. While Spider-Man, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four are notably missing from the roster (blame FOX), this gave Marvel the chance to pull out some of its lesser-known roster of heroes. I'm not sleeping until I unlock Kamala Khan, because I'm just so excited there is a video game with Kamala Khan in it. Also, the Young Avengers will always hold a place in my heart for being the book that got me into comics to begin with, so I'm pretty excited about them, too. (I'm guessing the game will not explain how Scarlet Witch, in her mid-twenties, has teenage twin sons also running around fighting crime?)\n\nThis isn't to say it's not without its flaws, because it has lots of those, too. Maybe I'm romanticising it because of the content that it's based on, maybe I'm biased, maybe I should just sleep and replay it in the morning when I haven't had coffee yet and see how frustrated a children's game can make me.\n\nThere is no original story in this game unless you decide to play out your own in the open world. If you've seen the movies, you've seen the plot for this game. While it draws mostly from the two Avengers movies, there are sequences from many of the solo films as well. On the bright side, the fact that this is a Lego game means no one dies, so Agent Coulson and Quicksilver are fine, on vacation in Tahiti. It's a magical place. They also made the Bruce/Natasha relationship in Age of Ultron make a little bit of sense, which is a miraculous achievement I didn't think was possible. So props there.\n\nBecause the game uses the original audio from the movies, things feel... off. Some lines are delivered too seriously for any Lego game, others are taken out of context to be used as chatter while you play, and it all sounds very quiet at times. For some inexplicable reason, they had a different voice actor record new dialogue for Bucky Barnes in the Captain America: First Avenger level, who sounds more like the original kid Bucky from the 1940s than the soldier portrayed in the movies. ("I'm with you 'til the end of the line!" he says enthusiastically! For some reason I have taken offense to this and I'm not entirely sure why.)\n\nThat being said, Hayley Atwell, Clark Gregg, and Cobie Smulders all recorded additional dialogue for their characters (Agents Carter, Coulson, and Hill respectively), and when delivered well (which it not always is), are amusing and make this game feel like it's supposed to be -- a Lego game in the MCU.\n\nYou're thrown into the game's opening sequence with absolutely no instruction as to how to play. Fortunately, if you've played any Lego game on the PC in the past, absolutely nothing has changed. Unfortunately, if you've played any Lego game on the PC in the past, absolutely nothing has changed. The controls suck. They always will suck. This time, they just suck and you're given very little information on how to use them. There are puzzle sections I spent ten minutes on because things were just not clear.\n\nThere are bugs -- I can't get the Steam Overlay to work, and sometimes the characters just won't do what you want them to (Tony, you're making Clint ashamed by how poorly you're aming your laser beam. Just hit the gold bricks, that's your only job).\n\nSo far, it's a cute game. It's a Lego game. It's a Marvel game. And it's fun. I can't really complain about that. Is it worth $40? Not really, but yet again, it's not money I regret spending (yet).\n\nUPDATE (2/2/2016): I've finished Story Mode, and I have to say, I'm more underwhelmed than I was when I started out. While it's not necessarily enough for me to give it a not recommended rating, I'd definitely say that it's subpar as far as Lego game and pales in comparison next to the previous Marvel game. It's still fun though. Stupidly so. And it's not like people play Lego games for the excellent, original stories. So, yeah. Wait until this one goes on sale. But it's still fun, and it still has Kamala Khan, and that's good enough for me.","January 27","true","33.5"," 87 of 95 people (92%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","92","87","95","36","2"

The only difference is that some of the landmarks like the Baxter Building Daily Bugle and the X-Mansion are gone. But the world is still fun to explore with tons of side missions. They also added random crimes, people will be robbed and cars will be stolen, but that's it. I really wish they expanded this feature, like stopping a large scale bank robbery or a stopping a big fight between the criminals and the cops, the current crimes tend to get old. There are also several other hub worlds, but all the other one's are small. Espicially Washington D.C, I wish instead of having a ton of tiny one's that they would have just put in the city that AAOU takes place in and have be the same size as New York.\n\nNow I'll talk about the characters\n\nSince they're using the MCU for this game we only get characters that appear in the MCU, meaning no X-Men Spider-Man Fantastic Four or Deadpool. Yet this still has more characters than the last game, and a lot of them are just filler, there's a million "Agent" characters and just civilians as characters. But I do like what they did with some of the characters in this game. In Lego Marvel Hulk was just ok, he could run around and punch cars, that was about it. In this game Hulk has an awesome super jump and can climb on buildings, Quicksilver is also fun because he can run up buildings. I would also like to mention that the character creator has improved.\n\nNow I'll talk about the story\n\nI actually really liked the story in Lego Marvel, the voice actors were great and it was funny, Lego Avengers' story is based off of movies from the MCU, while there's nothing wrong with this it's just not as funny as Lego Marvel, don't get me wrong, this game is funny, I actually laughed at several of the jokes, and they also use lines from the movies in different ways, overall the story is great.\n\nOverall I give it a 8/10, a must have for fans of the MCU or Marvel or Lego Games in general","February 16","true","19.8"," 74 of 85 people (87%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","87","74","85","18","6"

One is open PLANET play Earth, plus a piece of the Nine Realms thrown in for fun.\n\nOne is utterly Original Story, with all the Classic Characters LEGO-ified from the Fantastic Four to Deadpool, the other is Carbon-Copy of the Cinematic Universe.\n\nIt Includes as much of the Netflix and ABC shows as possible while neglecting some obvious things from the previous game including the lack of return of even Deadpool Red Bricks, which is super obviously due to this game being prepared before everything was finalized for MARVEL to be allowed to make Deadpool and get Spider-Man into Civil War. Yes, this game is a MARVEL game with no Spider-Man, but with a team of 'Defenders' that includes neither Namor, Hulk, nor Doctor Strange.\n\nDoes that make it bad? NO! This to me makes one game simply Timeless, and one simply a Period Piece. A Historical Artifact. The first game took place in a strange Tesseract-Aether created Alternate Amalgam Universe, the LEGO Universe. This is the reverse-engineer process, A Basic LEGO game, MARVEL-Cinematic Universe-ified.\n\nThere are Three Kinds of People:\n\nThose who love love love what Game 1 is doing and hate what Game 2 is doing;\nThose who love love love what Game 2 is doing to get to the point and didn't stop as much to smell the roses for Game 1 (Game 1 lacked Infinity Stones or Eternity, come on!)\n\nAnd Those who......having seen what Game 1 and Game 2 look like......strongly believe that Game 3, which is so, totally coming, is going to be the all-time-record Best MARVEL game in the History Of Ever.\n\nLEGO MARVEL: Infinity War is going to have Spider-Man. It's going to have Deadpool. It's going to have Thanos and the Infinity Gems. It's going to have at the very least the Cinematic Universe's take on the Cosmic Powers that Be. It's going to not be so gummed up by a zillion X-Men-verse characters, and lack of Magneto is going to be a sad thing, but we will have space for a zillion other characters that we wouldn't have got that have their own charm, and we will have who knows what else. We can even strongly hope that by the time it's time for LEGO MARVEL 3, MARVEL will at least be able to negotiate for the use of Fantastic Four characters for the game, whatever happens film-wise. Which will be great and awesome.\n\nI have had some glitch issues and it took me a while to fix them.\nI wasn't able to get the DLC the same day I got the game, but as soon as I could, I did.\nIt's LEGO. And it's MARVEL.\n\nIf you have played basically any games at all, there is something in this game for you, and while you might be reluctant to pay full price for it, you know you wish you had more money to justify impulse buying it even if you have doubts. Of course you will miss Spider-Man. But you will love flying around the Planet landing on the Hub Worlds.\n\nAs with many games of this nature, the Secrets and Extras are not only harder than you would expect after a slew of easy ones, but sometimes your own controls get in the way and make it seem physically impossible to ever get something.\nBe honest. You knew what you were getting into. You are HOPING for that experience, so you can say, I got THAT character-whose-name-I-don't-know-and-doesn't-appear-in-anything-I've-ever-seen-ever-and-even-my-dad-doesn't-know-this-insane-pointless-obscure-character.\nYou know that character? The one with ZERO good stories about them? Well now they HAVE a Story about them. The Story of YOU getting their Character Token in LEGO MARVEL's Avengers.\n\nCaptain America (Sam Wilson) Falcon can partner with Captain America (Civilian) Steve Rogers who is just in a Jacket and Shield, to explore Washington DC's Mall together, and just running side by side each other gets an Achievement. Know what it's called?\n\nON YOUR LEFT.\n\nYou do realize that right there is worth the price of admission, yes?\nAlso, there's like, a whole game to play, and stuff, besides the zillion ''OMG SQUEEE!" moments like that.\nDoes Arnim Zola (Classic) look stupid and not fit this game at all? Yes, absolutely.\nIs that a problem worth complaining about? Not when finding him is one of the hardest things you'll do. He's not hard to reach, but he's HIDDEN. Really Well. Very Secret. Much Stealth. And his Hideout is one of the best parts of the game.","March 18","true","316.3"," 76 of 96 people (79%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","79","76","96","19","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cloudshiffer/recommended/405310/","cloudshiffer","CloudShiffer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cloudshiffer/","361 products in account","UPDATED: This game is certainly a good sequel to LEGO Marvel Super Heroes. While they are not connected by story, you can clearly see that the Manhattan hub and many characters have been reused. That said, most characters' animations are updated, many new ones are added, the controls feel more fluid (especially air controls, you can now use right stick to change altitude instead of the A and B buttons) and the puzzles and some locations in Manhattan are all-new and all-different (see what I did there?).\nI found the story to be a pretty good recreation of the two Avengers movies and there are also three missions that cover Iron Man 3, Captain America 2 and Thor 2. The plot is pretty much the same, except for some random chickens and funny moments thrown in. Some players find the characters' voices (original audio from the movies) to be offputting, especially when some characters like Pepper Potts (in the Iron Man 3 mission) were recorded by different actors, but I rather liked it. There's also some new audio from Clark Gregg and Hayley Atwell, which is also rather pleasant to hear.\nSpeaking of which, the roster of characters has been expanded. While you don't see Spider-Man, Fantastic Four and X-Men here, they are replaced by the likes of Young Avengers, Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), Agent Carter and many others. And while this is pretty neat, I don't see why there isn't a Jessica Jones Netflix skin or any other Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. except for Coulson in a game centered on MCU.\nManhattan now is not the only free roam location to explore. It is joined by Sokovia, Barton farm, S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Malibu (Stark's penthouse), Washington D.C., South Africa and Asgard. Each of these has a bunch of golden blocks hidden around, some Stan Lee cameos, races and missions. The missions are mostly just an excuse for you to punch some Ultron robots, shoot some targets or press some buttons, but I had fun with them and found some to be interesting.\nI played this game in co-op and I have to say that splitscreen is not always the best option (not that there is an online co-op). Sometimes I couldn't see what I had to do next or which button to press in a quick-time event. When your partner uses the vehicle summoning stations (or whatever they're called) to get something you can't use the character selection screen or talk to characters to start quests. When you start quests if your partner is close enough the dialogue will take up the whole screen, not letting the other person do anything. That is also present when you hunt for golden blocks, the cutscenes will sometimes appear on the second half of the screen. There's also an unbearable Iron Man armor screen, which is always there if you want to choose a different suit or character as Iron Man. It also takes up both halves of the screen and is just plain irritating.\nAnother problem I have to mention is the lack of free PS4-exclusive DLC with additional levels and characters on PC. I pre-ordered the game with a Season Pass and I expect to get the full experience. Instead I got Iron Skull, Scuba and Space Iron Man armours. I don't care about those! Give me Ant-Man!\nOverall, LEGO Marvel's Avengers is really more of the previous game, but upgraded. The new puzzles are just as fun, Kamala Khan is here, the controls and graphics have been updated and I like the overall design of the game more. There are some problems, but they're not gamebreaking, at least for me.\n\n---\n\nGIVE ME MY DLC, SONY!

You’ll be replaying the some events that happened in the cinematic universe, specifically: The Avenger’s, Avenger’s: Age of Ultron, Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But ofcourse, you’ll be doing this the LEGO way. The main story could be finished in around five to seven hours atleast. It still follows the same formula used in any LEGO titles before. You'll be given different simple puzzles to solve and sometimes requires a specific character to do so. Along with those puzzles there would be enemies trying to hinder you from doing your task.\n\nPROS	Huge Selection Of Characters – With over 200 Marvel characters to unlock, through story missions or doing tasks in the open world, I’m sure you’ll never get enough of it. Most hardcore fans would easily recognize most characters, but for those neutral players, this would be a great chance to know the names of some characters.\nVarious Open-World Hubs – You get seven different areas that you can roam, usually after you’ve finish the main storyline. You get the chance to see Manhattan, Asgard, Sokovia, Washington D.C., Barton’s Farm, S.H.I.E.L.D. Base and Malibu. The areas are large enough to serve as your playground and unlock characters or vehicles.\nCombat Animations – Personally, I think this is by far the best animation for combat that LEGO has introduced. Even though the pace was slower, you can certainly see the detail of each attack your character does. And as an addition, there is an action button that when triggered, will execute a nicely animated combo which can also be done together with your partner to deal damage to the enemies around you.\nReplay Value – After finishing the main storyline, I was surprised to load my save game and see that I was still below 30% in completion rate. And that number says a lot.\nSeason Pass – I sincerely recommend that you get the Season Pass as it includes multiple side missions and more characters to choose from which can definitely prolong your gameplay.\nCONS	Terrible Plot – Yes, I’ve made it clear that there isn’t a new storyline, but their method of showcasing different movie events is just awful. Instead of being interesting, this would likely confuse anyone who haven’t watched the movies recently.\nRip Off Dialogues – If you have watched the movies, you’ll notice that the voices used in the main storyline was actually ripped right from it. This results to a poor quality of the overall sounds. And it is just a plain lazy thing to do.\nMini Map – There wasn’t any in the first place. But instead, you get a radar showing dots in different colors that could indicate an unlockable, a Gold LEGO, or a spawn point. And you’ll never know which unlockable it was until you get near it or complete the task.\nCo-Op – It is terrible in some main story missions because the other guy is forced to wait until his partner finish of the remaining enemies. This is the result when you try to make the game as close as possible to the movies. It’s really not that bad, but when you make a comparison the older LEGO titles, it’s hard not to notice.","May 29","true","18.7"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","36","37","0","0"

LEGO Avengers is not only based on "Age of Ultron" (as the cover or even the game's icon will sugest), it covers "The Avengers", "Age of Ultron", "Captain America - The First Avenger", "Captain America - Winter Soldier", "Iron Man 3", and "Thor - The Dark World". The cutscenes recreates the most iconic moments of those movies in LEGO style, and they did a pretty good job with that. Also, the game has audio clips from the movies, that means you can hear Chris Evans, Robert Downing Jr, Chris Hermsworth, etc. This is a great feature for the kids. Gameplay wise, this is the first LEGO game that introduced some new features, like co-op actions, some special finishers, and all the characters actually feel really diferent from each other. Puzzles are the same as always, but at least you have some variation on the fighting parts. Music was taken straight out of the movies, so is great. Unfortunely, the dialogues are very low, and every time your character does an special action, it says some one-liner from the movies, and this gets old...fast. Despite this few things, game is great as all the LEGO ones, and is perfect for kids that only know about the Marvel movies. As always, you have good humor, and a lot of replay value. I still think LEGO Batman 3 is the perfect LEGO game, but this is the best you'll get with Marvel characters. Also, there is future DLC planned to adapt "Ant-Man" and the upcoming "Captain America - Civil War", so there is more content coming. If you are not into Marvel, you might wanna wait some time until a sale, but if you are a Marvel fan, or have kids that most likely love the movies, you should buy this game right now, the effort they put into this game deserves your money.","January 29","true","14.3"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","31","40","5","0"

If you've enjoyed past Lego games, you should at least give this game a look. If you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you should at least give this game a look. If you're both a fan of Lego games and the MCU you are doing yourself a gross disservice if you don't play this game. It's fun, it's funny, and there is soooo much to do. At the time of this review, I've got just under 18 hours played and all I've done is the story mode which covers the movies Avengers 1 & 2, Captain America 2, Iron Man 3, and Thor 2. There are still a ton of vehicles to unlock, a ton of characters to unlock, countless side missions I haven't gotten to yet, and several open world hubs to play in (including a pretty large open world Manhattan).\n\nThe puzzles are simple, but enjoyable. The combat is simple and fun in the typical Lego style, but with character specific grabs and team up moves added in. I'm still discovering new team up moves and new things the characters can do with their powers. Guilty pleasure? Climbing buildings and super jumping around the Manhattan hub as the Hulk.\n\nI never thought my favorite movie game would be a Lego game. I was wrong...and I'm totally OK with that.\n\nUpdate: Just 100%'d the game, took me 45 hours to do everything...and I never do everything. Definitely a solid amount of engaging content.","January 31","true","45.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

This game is pretty much what you'd expect from a "sequal" of sorts. It still has the story missions, freeplay, collectibles, lots of characters and plenty to do. The only major addition I can recongise this time over is a bit more polish and some really nice animations for combat.\n\nThis time the story follows the Avengers as they go through multiple film scenarios such as Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 3, Thor: Dark World and Captain America: Winter Soldier.\n\nThey have added voice clips from the movies which at first is a nice touch, but then you realise how chopped and changed the dialogue is and how bad quality and quiet the clips are. Personally it is starting to annoy me but a decent idea I guess; there are also some good and original Lego moments and humor.\n\nIf you are a Marvel fan, buy it.\nIf you are a Lego video game fan, buy it.\nIf you are on the fence, wait for a good old Lego Steam sale.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 - Usual lego graphics, crisp on higher resolutions but suffer on lower. Regular clipping issues.\nAudio - 5/10 - Usual soundtrack mostly taken from Lego Super Heroes. Horrible movie audio clip quality.\nControls 8/10 - Use a gamepad if you can, works perfectly. I still find the flight mechanics unrefined personally.\nStory 10/10 - If you like the Marvel films or would like a quick run through of some MCU events it is perfect.\n\nOverall: 8/10 - Highly Recommended!\n\nTLDR; Same as Lego Marvel Super Heroes. MCU story. Bad movie audio clips.

DEADPOOL ISN'T IN IT. GET OVER IT. DOWNLOAD ONE OF THE VARIOUS MODS TO GET HIM IN GAME AND MOVE ON. The reasons why. Marvel Studios doesn't have the right to Deadpool and Spider-man's rights were still up in the air at the time of development for this game. Ergo no Deadpool. The End. Get some ice-cream to help get over it. But Spidey's DLC is a thank you to the players of Lego Marvel's Avengers so FREE Spidey DLC. And even though it was free for PlayStation, a couple of bucks for the Civil War pack is absolutely fine\n\nThat said I personally love this game. And how can I not? I stayed up until 2 a.m. New Zealand time playing until i completed at least the first movie. The story is from movies I love. As a comic book nerd I knew already I was going to at least like this game and I can proudly say that I love it. Sure it seems lazy getting clips from the movies but they are not going to hire the movie actors to re-do their lines and lose a lot of their budget. Instead they hire a couple of people to do the voices and get some main stay voice actors like Hayley Atwell (Agent Carter), Clark Gregg (Agent Phil Coulson)(booyah), Cobie Smulders (Maria Hill)(I was shocked by this one), Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno(1970's Hulk. Not Bruce Banner, just Lou and the Hulk) and Ming-Na Wen for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D..\n\nI love how there are characters that nobody really knows and then prompts research behind them, because that's what TT does. They take fairly unknown characters and chucks them into a Lego game. It really helps with the fact that this game is a celebration of The Avengers as a franchise, not just the movies.\n\nGameplay is fun and varied but still has the classic Lego flare to it. Although even though I like enemies who don't go down in one hit it just seems like unless you have super strength your combo is not going to last and that sucks. The new combo moves are cool and all but sometimes they get in the way. So basically get rid of them as soon as you can and don't use the red brick that give you infinite "Avengers Combos" unless you want them to be easily accessible. If you do, by all means, go ahead. They are pretty cool I will admit.\n\nMissions don't feel as short and don't alway end in a boss battle unlike Lego Marvel Superheroes. The Bonus missions based off of Iron Man 3, Thor 2 and Captain America 2 aren't stupidly short and neither is the Captain Marvel DLC level but there is debate about some of the other DLC levels like  the Masters of Evil.\n\nHub worlds are kinda hidden but that doesnt matter they are all fun to be in like I can be Quiksilver and speed around Asgard then take a Hulk Selfie (stupid mechanic) at the throne. I'm there are fun times to be had in the Hubs\n\nI say get it. The DLC is up to you. I personally say get the game if you love Lego, Marvel, The Avengers, speedsters and more stuff that is involved with this game. I'm not going to rate it because I recommend it. Simple as that. Because Dragon Tick\n\nCheck out my DLC reviews for all the DLC including the Season Pass, Spider-man's Homecoming and Captian America: Civil War (Ant-man hopefully sometime in July)","April 6","true","105.7"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","16","22","5","0"

If you're a fan of either Lego games or the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you'll likely enjoy it and should consider picking it up.  If you're like me and are a fan of both, you need it.\n\nFirst off, let's just jump right into what is expected and known about a Lego game.  Game mechanics are still relatively the same, no major leaps forward from Lego Marvel Super Heroes.  You're still going to spend a lot of time punching things , building thing, and solving puzzles.\n\nHowever, there are a few new mechanics that were a small fresh take such as team ups between the characters.  When fighting, if you get close to another character, a button will appear and initiate a combo between the 2 characters.  Because of the vast number of characters, the number of combos are huge!  Not all are amazing, but some were just visiually brilliant and just awesome.\n\nNext graphics,  I'll make this short and sweet.  This is the fisrt lego game that really has stepped up it game visually.  The environments really look polished and have great textures and well done lighting.  Cutscenes run well and are often redone scenes from the movies, done shot for shot beautifully and I really enjoyed them.\n\nLet's talk sound.  The soundtracks from the movies are used here again and work perfectly with the game, no problems there.  However, those voices... Lines have been pulled directly from the movies, which would be nice, except they sound like they've gone through 100 filters of effects for this game to get rid of background noise.  They work pretty well for cutscenes, but during the gameplay they are just gross and don't fit.  I hate dying as hawkeye just cause I dread to hear the gameplay sounds fade out to hear him whisper, "Do you know what it's like to be unmade?"  Ugh... Just gross.\n\nThe Character selection, in my opinion, is still solid.  Its taken a hit since losing all non MCU charcters since Super Heroes (Spiderman, F4, xmen) but very rarely do I actually miss them during gameplay.  The number of characters in Lego Marvel Avengers is still huge and I like learning the new characters and unlocking all of them.\n\nI did have a few glitches happen in my playthrough that halted my progression.  A couple times I had a character land inbetween  boundaries and unable to leave so I had to restart the level.  Another time, a puzzle that required me to jump on buttons in a sequence just didn't register me jumping on the buttons.  I had to restart the game and I got it working.  Nothing gamebreaking, but still irritating.\n\nOverall, I am thouroughly enjoying Lego Marvel Avengers.  It may not be worth $40, but it's easy to find on sale for PC, so get it then.  I'd give it an 8.5/10.\n\nPros:\n-Heroes can team up and make awesomeness happen\n-Well Done Graphics (Improved since Marvel Superheroes)\n-Still many characters to unlock, most fairly unique\n-Nice soundtrack and the lines pulled from the movies sound good during cutscenes\n-Classic lego sense of humor that remains entertaining\n-Open world and unlockables give great replay ability\n-To pick an Ironman suit, you zoom into Tony's HUD and it's freaking awesome.\n\nCons:\n-Lines from the moving sound horrible during gameplay\n-A few glitches\n\n\n\n\n","January 30","true","42.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","8","9","4","0"

The combat animations and really all animations in general are much more fluid and smooth than they were in the previous lego marvel game. Graphics are better with a few new fancy effects. The combat feels as smooth as butter. Overall this seems to be an improvement over Lego Marvel Super Heroes in pretty much every way. Dont listen to most the negative reviews. This is an excellent game and totally worth full price.\n\nFULL IMPRESSION:\nNow that i have had more time to play i have a few more things to say about it. First remember that map from lego marvel super heros for the main hub? Thats gone now. There is no map for ANY of the hub worlds and THAT is a pretty big disappointment for me. I used that map all the time in the previous game and its harder to navigate and find where things are now. Its excusable to not have a map for hte smaller hubs but the largets hub world in the game and you dont have a map to navigate it? like really? You do get a nice rader bubble in the lower left of the screen but it doesnt make up for having a nice map.\n\nThere also seems to be fewer ground vehicles but there seem to be more air vehicles.\n\nThe only bugs ive encountered are small animation glitches so nothing game breaking.\n\nAll in all i still think it was worth the full price but im just disappointed that there is no map when there was one in the previous game.","January 27","true","21.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Instead of just having manhattan as a hub like in superheroes you get a few different ones notably: Asgard, Hawkeye's farm and South Africa\n\n\nI have a few gripes with the game, the main one being taking audio cuts of lines straight from the films, this makes the cutscenes predicatble and limits the humourous scenes that the lego games are known for.

No problems with controls although i think they have patched it since the previous reviews. Picked up this game for around 11 quid with the season pass from a CDkey site so I got a real bargain. Can't complain, the humour, gameplay and character roster is all to make a great experience for all ages.\n\nCons:\nGraphics reset pretty frequently after each startup with is a little annoying\nCut scenes can be a little long at points\nNO ONLINE CO-OP YET :(\nCombo button plays the same animation for each character every time its pressed which is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥\n\n\nWould Reccommend\n8/10 as a Game\n9/10 as a lego game\n\nCan't beat Lego star wars, sorry Marvel","February 8","true","6.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

In fact, once Korvac was unlocked, he became the main character I played as he has the majority of powers needed to unlock most obstacles including gold bricks, electrical grids, vents and bricks requiring telepathy (with the added benefit of flight).\n\nAs for the usual Lego game glitches, my game only crashed to desktop twice and I was only forced to exit a level once after getting trapped and unable to free my character.\n\nSadly, once all the main missions were beaten, all that remained was a TON of yellow brick missions in Manhattan (close to 100) as well as tedious NPC quests which often required no more than flying to one end of the map and back to collect objects. Being a completist, I slogged through, but it was without much enthusiasm. There was clearly not as much effort put into these puzzles as earlier Lego games.\n\nThe racing levels were often frustrating because the controls for flight are not sensitive and very unwieldy (again, not as nearly as polished as Lego Marvel Super Heroes). It was very difficult to control the pitch and I was often forced to backtrack after flying just over or under the target circle.\n\nThere is plenty of fan service and most of the characters that ever came into contact with the Avengers are here... except, of course, for non Marvel Studios characters like the X-Men, Spider-man, Deadpool and the Fantastic Four (and their respective villains).\n\nThe majority of the gameplay vocals are ripped right from the films' soundtracks which is jarring- it is painfully obvious which sound was recorded for the game and which was from the movies, although it was nice to see Clark Gregg recording new VO work for this as Agent Coulson. I don't understand why Tara Strong didn't reprise Squirrel Girl because she did another voice for this game.\n\nBottom line: this is a typical Lego game and worth it for those who enjoy the typical Lego games.\n\nIt's not as good as Lego Marvel Super Heroes, but far superior to the bug-infested Lego Jurassic World.","February 8","true","47.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It has more than 5 hub worlds - after you complete the 15 level story mode. There are accually 17 levels if you include the DLC levels as well. If you have a good computer, then it runs as smooth as butter. Every thing also LOOKS AMAZING. There are a lot more collectables as well. I've played around 36 hours on LEGO Avengers, and I'm only 26% done. There are lots of races, and puzzles, making it very fun, and easily has more than 175 characters, 200 if you include the DLC. The accual levels are very close to the story, and there are also many refrences and both sounds and voices from the MARVEL movies, but you don't need to understand any of the refrences to still have a good time. The cutscences are also some of the best, making it also very good.\n\nI would give it a 9.7/10, missing that 0.3 becuase you need SO MUCH RAM AND SPACE :(\n\nEither way, it is an amazing game, and is definitely worth the $39.00, but I found paying 9.99 for the season pass was better. The season pass adds in 3 or more character packs, and currently 2 extra levels, but there will almost definitely be more.\n\nIt's altogether worth the money, if you've got the money, time, and computer for it.","April 13","true","44.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

It has amazing cutscenes and the graphics are top notch (Set to High and on 4k) and I'm getting a steady 300-400fps.\n\nSure, some locations are recycled (the helicarrier is practically identical to MSH) but that doesn't mean they aren't still interesting to walk around.\n\nMy major issue is that, atleast at the moment, the storyline is very odd. It starts out with Age of Ultron, then Avengers Assemble then to First Avenger etc. I do wish that it went a bit more linear in terms of movie's storyline,\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game purely because it is a mash up of all that I enjoy about the past lego games.\n\n8.5/10","January 26","true","7.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The level design and cutscenes are more detailed than ever before.  The expansive world, which its predecessory LEGO Marvel Superheroes was known for, includes not only an even more detailed NYC with hundreds of new heroes (not even including the DLC pack), but tons of entire other worlds and lands to explore from the Space hud, each with a substantial amount of detail and side missions (which there are a ton of).  If I had to pick on factor that makes Avengers stand out from Super Heroes, it would be the complexity of the storyline and detailed cutscenes.  For Marvel fans, the game will be far more immersive than its predecessor as the ending has meaning (the main storyling follows the First Avengers Movie).  9.4/10 would get every superhero again.","January 28","true","62.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Even though I recommend it I only do so for Marvel fans, if you aren't a big Marvel fan you'll wonder why you didn't just spend less on the movies since this game follows the two Avengers movies and then three other movies (Winter Soldier, Iron Man 3, and Thor 2).\n\nLEGO game wise: no game breaking glitches, the LEGO designs have never been better, my saves didn't get deleted like they have on previous LEGO games, and overall it was much smoother than previous games. The AI is pretty freaking dumb so if you can play co-op, I would suggest that, but then that means dealing with the mediocre split screen. Every level feels way too crowded and over-the-top too, but I guess that fits the comic book style.\n\nMarvel game wise: Probaly won't be a better one besides the other LEGO Marvel.\n\nIn the end, don't pay $40, wait a relatively short time for the price to inevitably drop as they always do on LEGO games then have some fun with the story and the hundreds upon hundreds of collectibles, if you're into that.","January 26","true","6.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awgenough/recommended/405310/","awgenough","AWG Enough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awgenough/","2797 products in account","Obligatory intro: I played all of the licensed LEGO games developed by Traveler's Tales and I more or less enjoyed (and 100%ed) all of them, except for two. I'm not really into Star Wars so those two games just weren't for me. This is just to specify I'm not a noob when it's up to LEGO games and I think I can say I know what I'm talking about.\nThat being said, my humble opinion on LEGO Marvel's Avengers is that it's the worst LEGO games since... well, maybe Batman 2. Why so? Here's a list of reasons, in no particular order:\nVery confusing gameplay, at least during the first hours. You are in a hub then in a level, then a hub again and you can't switch characters and you can't understand why then you complete a level and get back in that hub again and now you can switch characters... why, exactly, is never really explained.\nNo original story. This is not a negative point per se (The Hobbit and LotR don't have an original story and still they're masterpieces of the genre) but you have to work hard on the other elements of the game to bridge the gap. But Traveler's Tales got incredibily lazy since they got taken over by WB so it's all about the bare minimum now.\nATROCIOUS audio. I can't even decide where to start. Lines taken from the movies and just hurriedly pasted into the already abysmal audio track. Sometimes it's actually impossibile to even know what they're saying unless you lower the "effects" and "music" setting to 2 or 3 (out of 10).\nLiterally Who: the roster. Yeah, there are hundreds of characters... but half of them are just different costumes for the same 3 or 4 core Avengers (there are like 20 Captain Americas and 20 Iron suits... those count as 40 characters) and the other half... I never heard of them before (and I don't want to hear about them in the future). Disappointing. Even Indiana Jones 2 had a much more satisfying roster.\nGettin' lazy, devs? In the Control Settings option menu one of the keys is bound to the action "show map". Too bad there is no map to show and pressing that button actually makes you go into space.\nManhattan hub = ♥♥♥♥♥. If you played Marvel Super Heroes back in 2012 and you thought you would get another chance to free roam in that beautiful Manhattan open world... please stop hoping. It used to be a vibrant, eventful, alive open world... now it's just a plain hub, boring and incredibly repetitive. I just realized I could go on forever. I just realized I got greatly disappointed by this game, weeks after finishing it. More than I thought. I just realized I'm tired. Not of the formula, no. I'm tired of seeing great devs turning into lazy corporate shills, because "people play your games anyway,,, why work hard to make them good?"\nWhat a waste.\nWhat a shame.\n5.9/10","March 19","false","45.1"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","52","23","44","10","1"

Get it on sale, and only if you don't have LEGO Marvel Super Heroes already. If you don't like LEGO games, or Marvel stuff, there is nothing here to change your mind. Pass on it if that is the case.]\n\nYou should really know by now if LEGO games are your cup of tea or not. That being said, rather than explain everything about them, I'm gonna focus on what this one does differently than some of the others.\n\nThere is a lot of combat in this game, and as you probably know, combat in LEGO games is awful. Your AI team mates will constantly get in your line of fire, and you will "lock on" to random objects that the game thinks you are trying to punch instead of the bad guys that are in the process of killing you. Luckily, there are still infinite lives and you only lose 1,000 studs upon death.\n\nYou can turn off hints in this game, which is a welcome addition. Still, I wish it do more than that, and stop taking control of the camera to make sure I see exactly what item it wants me to interact with next.\n\nThe Manhattan hub from LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is back as your main hub. There are also a few other tiny hubs with a handful of collectables each. This includes Asgard, Tony's Malibu Home, a Shield Base, and some others. The X-Mansion is mysteriously missing from the Manhattan hub. If you go to where it should be, there's just a boring building.\n\nThe levels all follow the Avengers movies, which isn't really a problem, but I would have liked to have seen a game with its own story like LEGO MSH had.\n\nI know this is branded as an Avenger's game, but the lack of X-Men characters and stuff is really sad. I mean, even Wolverine and Spider-Man were in the Avengers.\n\nOther roster complaints: Nova is the older Nova and not Sam Alexander, the current Nova. Not a big deal, but they have some other current heroes like Squirrel Girl's Unbeatable outfit, Jane Foster as Thor, and Kamala Khan as Ms. Marvel. Speaking of Ms. Marvel, why the hell is Carol Danvers in this game as Ms. Marvel instead of Captain Marvel? Were they just too lazy to make a new skin for her? She's been Captain Marvel for years now in the comics, come on guys.\n\nRemember the black cosmic bricks from LEGO MSH? They're back, and still called cosmic bricks, but I have no idea why. Here's a list of some cosmic characters that cannot interact with cosmic bricks: Nova, Ms. Marvel, Captain freakin' Universe. So who can? Ultron. That's the only person I've found who is able to interact with these "cosmic" bricks. I get they wanted to gate them off until the end of the game, but why not just rename them if only Ultron can use them?\n\nSpeaking of Captain Universe, there is something about the character I really like. So one of the spots you can interact with is an area with hidden bricks. You usually have to play this dumb minigame to detect the bricks, but if you use Captain Universe, because of her cosmic awareness, the bricks just show up. She gets to skip the minigame completely. Nice attention to detail.\n\nThis game has a serious lack of hidden levels. Remember how in LEGO MSH you used gold bricks to build doors to bonus levels? Yeah, that's gone. What are gold bricks for, you ask? Who knows, I can't find any use for them at all. The game does unlock three more levels after you finish most of the story, but these are just other Avengers themed levels, and don't feel like the wacky or pure LEGO bonus levels of the other titles.\n\nWhile it's a shame to see them continue to just scrape by on these cookie cutter mediocre LEGO titles, it's still a decent purchase if you enjoy the series.\n\nThat being said, maybe you should wait for a sale, or pick up LEGO Marvel Super Heroes first.","February 11","true","45.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Relive the events of both Avengers movies, plus some extra levels from almost all movies that led to them, in the classic LEGO way, full of hilarious twists in classic scenes to make them suitable for all ages. But as in all LEGO games (or at least the most recent ones), the fun only starts once you finish the main campaign (which has its flaws with level design, as with any LEGO game). You can free play as any character of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (except the Guardians of the Galaxy, which is a huge disappointment) in several HUBs related to the movies. You have tons of characters to unlock, tons of Stan Lees to save (and when you unlock him, there is a big surprise coming!) and tons of golden bricks to collect. There are also side quests all over these HUBs refering to several instances of the MCU, including Agents of SHIELD, Agent Carter, Daredevil, Jessica Jones and the upcoming Luke Cage and Iron Fist. Whatever the MCU has, this game has, except the Guardians as I previously stated. Also, Spiderman! And it's FREE!\nAlso, I've seen some reviews complaining about the lack of X-Men or Fantastic Four in this game (though Human Torch is present). This is not a game based on the Marvel universe, it's based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As in, the movies and the TV shows broadcasted since 2008. Keep that in mind.\nAll in all, I think this is the best LEGO game I've played, followed very closely by LEGO Batman 3. Take into account that I haven't played LEGO Marvel Superheroes yet, it's on my to do list.\n\n10/10, would save Stan Lee 200 times again.","May 29","true","37.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe this will be better than Batman 3, cuz i hate DC Comics and Marvel is so OP... So i tell ya all folks. Instead of this piece of crap better buy Batman beyond gotham. Or Marvel` s Super heroes. Much more fun. And why i didn`t liked it? It`s really simple.\n- Crappy dialogues (literally cut from the movie, with scissors i bet...) And i mean REAAAALLLY crapy. No emotions. (Black WIdow: - oh look bunch of bad guys. Kick their asses big guy. (and said with voice like reading loud Terms of Use during game install...)) For me, dialouges killed all the fun. Even in LEGO LOTR were much more better!\n- strange fighting system (i mean that combo thingy? C`mon!) So instea of smashing one button you have to watch what is happening and... Oh now i gonna click button2 and... Yep lttle combo. every time this same.\n- Lotta of bugs and...\n- And is too short.\n- Lack of humour. Nick Fury slurping a smoothie is not enough.\n- I never felt the "BIGGER NY!"\n\n+ So now when i want to change a character instead of waitin` till the stud changes we can change it by ourselves. AND when playing with Tony, we can access all ALL suits! This is nice. So double ++\n+ Bout the combo things... Quite nice was though the option of double combo. Like Iron Man shootin` on Caps shield and doin some fricky action.\n\nSo... Guys made a lot of work i bet. Tried to add something new (like in LOTR: Hobbit, Batman...) And some things are goodie, but the overall... I don`t feel it. Don`t like it and, yes. I feel a waste of money. Only hope that LEGO Force Awakens gonna be good... DONT SCREW THIS!\n\n\nPL:\n\nLEGO Marvel Avengersi. Rzuciłem się na tę grę jak Reksio na szynkę. Dosłownie. I żałuję.\nO ile LEGO Super-bohaterowie Marvela to gra spójna, pełna humoru typowego dla gier LEGO, kilku irytujących rozwiązań... I sporej frajdy o tyle jej następczyni jest dużo słabsza.\n- Bardzo słabe dialogi. Gdyby jeszcze to były dialogi wycięte z filmu... Ale brzmią tak jakby cała ekipa (w dodatku składająca się z amatorów) pierwszy raz czytała sobie na głos fragmenty scenariusza! Kompletnie bez polotu i emocji... Dialogi budują nastrój filmu, w grach? Jak najbardziej.\n- Dziwny system walki. O ile w normalnych LEGO maltretuje się pada/ klawiaturę (o potępione dusze!) i nie patrząc rozwala całe tabuny wrogów, o tyle tutaj autorzy postanowili dodać coś od siebie... atak, atak, atak (i miga PRZYCISK 2) klikamy i dostajemy mini-combo. Nudne i długie.\n- Gra na split screen i używanie działek, broni z zoom czy czegokolwiek... Używamy de facto we dwójkę...\n- BRAK poczucia humoru typowego dla LEGO. Nick Fury siorbiący co chwila mrożony jogurt bynajmniej nie jest zabawny (dobra jest. Ale po 15 pojawieniach przestaje być)\n- WIĘKSZY NOWY JORK guzik, albo ja nie odczułem. Dalej te zakichane remonty.\n- Bugi... Kilka uświadczyłem, mało nie rzuciłem padem o ziemię. Ale... Zdarza się.\n- Podział misji... Ech. Ten system podziału powoduje, że ma się poczucie strasznie krótkiego grania.\n\n+ Przewinie się czasami jakiś złodziejaszek na ulicach NY. Można mu spuścić łomot w stylu batmana. "Nie zabijam. Ale trafił na ER i będzie kaleką do końca życia. I odżywia się przez słomkę..."\n+ COMBO podwójne. Tak pojedyncze jest nudne. Podwójne dużo ciekawsze. (hm... combo w kooperacji. Tz iron-man wali promieniem w tarczę Kapitana a promień sie rozszczepia i rozwala z 10 wrogów. Nice.)\n+ Moje ulubione. Otóż... Kiedy w LEGO MSH potrzebowaliśmy wybrać postać, konkretną odsłonę np Iron Mana trzeba było troszkę pcozekać. TROSZKĘ. Tutaj... Przewijamy bumperami.\nI najważniejsze. Tony Stark po przytrzymaniu "przycisk 1" ma dostęp do WSZYSTKICH kostiumów Iron Mana! Co za ulga. (animacja trochę zbugowana, ale co tam.) także za ten sam wynalazek podwójny plus! (aż 3 łącznie?!)\n\nChłopaki zrobili co mogli, wprowadzili kilka nowości. Niektóre do mnie przemawiają inne nie. Ale te dialogi... Panowie, nżyczkami wycinaliście je z filmu?\nOby tylko nie zepsuli LEGO: SW The Force Awakens...","March 26","false","11.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tundrasretreat/recommended/405310/","tundrasretreat","Tundra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tundrasretreat/","486 products in account","TLDR: Audio guy ruins day. Film rips are smelly turds in otherwise clean audio.\n\nI adored the first lego marvel game. It was polished brilliance (if keyboard controls weren't the smoothest, it never interfered enough for me to be annoyed by it). I saw a couple of steam reviews saying 'if you loved the first you'll love this', and grabbed it at a sale price.\n\nI... kinda regret it. I want to love it. I really do. The sheer joy I got out of the first one and the huge numbers of hours I put in getting 100% completion made me sing it's praises but I've struggled to play two hours of this one. I have repeatedly quit over and over because I have become so damn frustrated with it. Let me elaborate, as I know two hours isn't a lot to judge a game by.\n\nFirst off, the little gripes; it's laggier and buggier than it's precedessor. My hardware is fairly low end, but unless I was playing multiplayer on the previous lego marvel, it looked great and ran great. This has low framerate on the /startup/ menu and no matter what settings I tweak it always feels like it's struggling.\n\nCap's shield extinguisher for fires also is ridiculously finicky. Sometimes it'll jump straight to the fire being put out before even pressing (J), other times I have to repeatedly tap between (K) and (J) for it to work. God help you if any enemies are remotely nearby because the (K) prompt for the extended 'fancy' takedowns are so much more intrusive in this game than the last and somehow take up even more of your time as well as having them rammed in your face constantly.\n\nThe game doesn't know what it wants to be. It's too serious for a lego game, yet too silly for anything else and feels like the team were divided as to which direction they wanted to go and instead dragged it kicking and screaming in both directions.\n\nNow, onto my main gripe which is the reason I'm actually reviewing this.\n\nThe audio.\n\nOh GOD the audio.\n\nSome genius thought it would be a brilliant idea to use audio clips ripped (and when I say ripped, I mean they sound /ripped/, background noise and everything) from the films, but record original VA for other stuff. It breaks immersion completely and is horribly jarring as the levels of them are all over the place (if it weren't for the fact I have subtitles on, some of the lines I would have thought were my sound card glitching out) and the reverb doesn't match any of the sounds produced by the environment. It's horrible. It's honest to god horrible.\n\nThis also means that the main characters I loved playing as in the last game (Stark, Widow, Hawkeye etc) say /nothing/ other than the storymode direct-from-reel stuff and the same awfully integrated lines over and over and over and *over*(If I have to hear Cap's fuzzy-♥♥♥ TFA lines again I swear I will go crazy).\n\nAside the ripped audio, the voice acting is generally good, but for some reason they went with old school comic Bucky sound (I half expected him to go 'gee whizz!!") which is, again, really jarring when you've got Sebastian Stan's rugged stubbly appearance strutting around with this schoolboy voice chirping out.\n\nI have never ever /ever/ heard audio in a game so poorly done and the fact it's come from such a prominent studio and one that has been consistently excellent in the past just... really gets my goat.\n\nSo no. No I wouldn't recommend this game unless they patch the god damn audio.","February 25","false","3.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Just go back to them being silent if you can\'t afford actors. The problem with this is that they talk not just in cutscenes but during the game too. You can just here how out-of-place the voice clip is, as well as the low quality. The game is just like any other with nothing new and is disappointing to say the least 5/10(Average) .

Everything about the story campaign is poorly planned, poorly audio mixed, poorly executioned and purely a grind. Constantly stealing your camera to show interminable 'Here's Where You Should Go' cutscenes, dialogue that is brought into extreme relief by the goofy animations (it's UNREAL how bad Loki and Ultron's dialogue is, I'd forgotten that about the movies), AWFUL unskippable battleship-like decoding puzzles among literal dozens of other things make it impossible for me to recommend this game to anyone. You'd be much, much, much better off getting the previous LEGO Marvel game or literally any other LEGO game on the Steam store page.\n\nThe saving grace to this tarnish on Traveller's Tales' record is the open world, unlocked after the story is over. With its original writing and voice acting, which was sorely missed in the story mode, along with the actual pure joy that is super jumping all over town as dozens and dozens of characters that would otherwise not get any representation in a video game, it's almost enough to get you to ignore the overall abysmal faults.\n\nBullet List Time:\n-I loved having all the women characters in the open world, it was great getting to use Sif and Jessica Jones and Hellcat and America Chavez\n-I loved not being hamstrung to using the main Avengers team for the puzzles and challenges, with each having a female counterpart.\n-I loved super-speed. This is a great game to just run around in and stop and do whatever mission or quest is nearby. Having all three speedster characters be able to run up buildings was an obvious, yet genius, move and it always brings a smile to my face.\n-THANOSCOPTER\n-I have a really hard time deciding on the worst chapter in story mode but I gotta tell you, I had zero fun throughout the entirety of the Avengers 2 campaign. All the missions were tedious, the presentation confusing at best, and the way the final level could end without your say-so REALLY made it tough to replay it to 100%.\n\nIn short, don't buy this game. At least not until its $5 on sale like the rest of the catalogue.","February 11","false","41.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

This was released in 2016 and it still has no online multiplayer, only local co-op. People don't but it on steam to sit at home and play with their siblings, they have friends in other countries and time zones and to enjoy a LEGO game is impossible to do together.\n\n#2- Dragged out cutscenes. It may not sound as much but the 15 seconds I spend on watching a car blow up (that has nothing to do with the story line)  just because the animation team wants to show how good they are is  more time than I can tolerate.\n\n#3-  Video settings.  Although they have added more things to adjust it doesn't really make any difference because you have to change it back every third second.\n\n#4- The humour. To escalate from witty gestures and sounds to just sarcastic lines and random chickens (why?!) is such a low drop that really shows that they have lost the magical touch that the LEGO games used to have.\n\n#5- Voices. Or more of the lack of them. Almost the entire game is lines direct from the movies which makes it feel very cheap and lazy. The constant one-liners, which most of the time even isn't from the movie that you are currently playing a level from, is dull and in time, annoying.\n\nAlthough, if you are a huge Marvel fan and enjoy the movies aswell the comics you will have somewhat of a good time, just not as good as it could have been.

This article says it all: rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/01/lego-marvels-avengers-review\n\nBut if you want a sumamry, there you go. And never mind my in-game time, I played with brother on his account.\n\nThe proper cutscenes are turned into dull boring levels which lack content enough for two players to busy with. Straight off in the first level there's a moment when the Iron Man player has to fly around the Hydra outpost for 10 MINUTES with nothing to do, while the Captain America player actually smashes some bricks and completes the objective.\n\nThe proper level scenes are turned into cutscences which are way too much and often. The cutscene humor is down to drawing-a-banana-instead-of-an-arrow and omg-look-it's-a-chicken-how-did-it-get-there level. The gameplay humor... doesn't exist.\n\nThere's one bright moment I can remember in first 3-4 levels: in the fight between Thor and Iron Man as they've first met in the forest, you've gotta build a chainsaw, then charge it and use to cut down a tree on which Thor sits. That's funny. That's silly.\n\nThat's what we love Lego games for - bringing some silliness, some nonsence to a serious, tragic story. This very installation in TT Lego series does not. And it is a huge, huge disappointment. Maybe you should stop and rest for a while, TT. I guess it's time I 100%'ed Lego MARVEL Super Heroes.","February 17","false","0.7"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/405310/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","All Lego games are the same, except for when they’re not. Lego Batman 2, with its open world Gotham City and brilliant videogame interpretation of Superman was far more interesting to play than its 2014 sequel, for example, which mainly focused on some boring Green Lantern space adventures—and I love me some Green Lantern, even after the much-derided 2011 movie. The light puzzles and collectable-heavy platforming remains the same in each Lego game, but for each worthwhile entry, there’s a bunch of duff ones that are worth skipping. Lego Avengers is somehow both at the same time.\n\nAvengers offers a similar deal of stud collecting and switch-hitting, this time based on the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, with some other bits and pieces stuck on. The basic Lego formula by itself is not too bad, but when a lot of attention has been paid to the accompanying fan service or the environments look like they’ve had a ton of work put into them, the Lego games can end up being fantastic fun, both for irritating children and hungover adults. This is TT Games on autopilot, though, and there's not a lot of passion in the results.\n\nSome of the movie fights are turned into QTE sequences that even lazy children will have no trouble with.Some of the movie fights are turned into QTE sequences that even lazy children will have no trouble with.\nI’ve rarely been this bored playing through the story mode of a Lego game. The meat of the content is based on The Avengers, with other levels covering Marvel’s superior phase two films, like Age of Ultron, The Winter Soldier and Iron Man 3, sequels that all benefitted from having the bar significantly raised by Joss Whedon’s 2012 team-up flick. There’s even a (not very good) flashback level based on the first Captain America featuring Cap and Bucky. The level design for the story stuff is just uninspired, though, and the attempt to make the character dialogue feel authentic by using recordings straight from the movies ends up backfiring in an almost Return of Chef-style fashion.\n\nProblem is, they sound like they’ve been grabbed straight off the DVDs using Final Cut Pro, and have been awkwardly cut into the Lego cutscenes, with the series’ arbitrary slapstick bolted on for good measure (Thor ♥♥♥♥♥ a guy with a hammer, but there’s a pig there now, etc). It’s unconvincing and cheapens the game more than if they’d just kept the characters silent, like the Star Wars games did. Worse still is when the game plays quips mid-game, so you have Cap using his ‘if you get killed...walk it off’ line from Age of Ultron but with the movie's background noise seemingly still audible—it sounds like something I knocked together in Garageband with a deadline of about ten minutes.\n\nThere’s not one visually interesting or inventive puzzle in the entire Avengers section of the game, and it falls short of 2013’s colourful, location-filled Lego Marvel Super Heroes. TT Games barely conjures an illusion of this feeling like the films. This is a game for young, noisy children, sure, but even they deserve a little better than this. I yawned my way to the closing credits, which is such a shame when the source material the devs are working with is a bunch of the most fun blockbusters of the last decade.\n\nStill, there’s more to the game than that, if you know where to find it. Exit a couple of menus, and you’ll find the Manhattan open world from Lego Marvel returns with new sidequests to do, as well as a near full-size replica of Asgard, and several other locations linked to the movies. These hubs are pretty much buried by the story mode, but wandering around them (some are better than others) with your changeable roster of characters is way more enjoyable than the main game. It's sandbox-y and less rigidly connected to the movies.\n\nI nerdily flew Captain Universe through Times Square. I had Bruce Banner changing into Hulk and running down Asgard’s rainbow bridge (which, to be fair, may happen in a movie next year). Luke Cage sent me on a sidequest around Manhattan then berated me when I got beat up by Hydra agents (“If I’d wanted to spend the day babysitting I’d have stayed at home. With my actual baby.”) It’s entertaining fan service, as usual, and the characters are wonderfully animated, but the presence of the movie stuff sadly brings nothing to it.\n\nIron Fist, here, being a goof in his awesome costume.Iron Fist, here, being a goof in his awesome costume.\nMissing, presumably due to movie studio politics (or because I couldn't find them on the map), are Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four and X-Men, which were all present in the last game. There’s some neat, nerdy choices to compensate for that like Squirrel Girl or Jessica Jones, but they might only appeal to comic book dweebs like me rather than the children that are supposed to play this stuff. I'm reliably informed that children, when they're not being annoying, love Spider-Man.\n\nCollectively, then, there’s not enough for me to recommend this over Lego Marvel Super Heroes, which is usually $5/£4 in Steam sales and has the edge with level design and fan service. Being a fan of the Marvel movies isn’t enough to justify buying this as well—there's no passion in the translation from screen to game.\n\n52/100\n\nLego Marvel's Avengers\nA half-hearted recreation of some fun movies, with almost nothing to offer over its predecessor.\n\nI fully regret paying full price for the game. If you really want the game after reading my review, then wait for it to go on sale.","February 8","false","72.3"," 14 of 38 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","14","38","0","0"

I don't think this is anything more than DLC that could of been attached to the previous Marvel Lego game. Batman 3 had the Arrow, Man of Steel and Dark Knight DLC and that is what they should of done with this instead of a single full price release.\n\nThe open world is very much identical, theres a lot of level reuse and all characters have been ported over, though if anything they've been made worse. The combat has been tweaked and not for the better, a lot of hit or miss attacks occur and some characters feel too slow during fighting especially Cap who suffers most. The Thor and Loki fight during the first Avengers section is a tough slog, using button mashing that recycles the animation over and over as you mash the buttons on screen, this happens a lot. It's hard to tell during these sequences if it's actually doing anything or it's stuck on loop.\n\nThe inclusion of the one button for mutiple uses is frustrating, if your using an xbox controller 'B' can be used as double team attack, fire extinguishing, targeting and building all at the same time. Leading to some deaths that never should of occured, while you frantically try to get the character to do the right action. Cap's fire extinguishing is much worse than the last game, having now to do a two button weird jump animation to put them out rather than hold a button for Cap to place his shield on the ground.\n\nThe 'B' button finsihing moves are just the end of the combo from the previous game, made as a finishing move. If you played the last game as i have, it doesn't really make any sense as it breaks the flow of the combo and looks janky on animation.\n\nGraphically it's not very different from Lego Batman 3 or its predecessor, not a bad thing because there's not much more you can do to a lego game to make it look great anyways.\n\nAudio dialogue is taken from the films and honestly i wish they hadn't bothered. It sounds out of place and a lot of the times, poor. The dubbing of effects they've tried to use to make it fit in actually make them stand out.\n\nThere was a lot of hints to the MCU and characters straight from the movies in the last Marvel Lego, there really was no real need to base an entire game around these two Avengers movies. Maybe it would of been worth the money if it was MCU based and we got to play levels from all MCU films but that's not the case. This really is high priced DLC, unfortunately falling the wrong side of worth the money.\n\nIf you like Lego games this will keep you entertained, it sucks to be harsh on it but after 4 hours and having 100% the last one, it really doesn't stand up on its own well.","January 31","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It features a massive core hub (Manhattan) and seven smaller hubs for you to explore at your leisure, including the SHIELD Base and the famous realm of Asgard. There are several characters that can be unlocked just by playing the stories (more on those in a minute), and over a hundred more to be found scattered through Free Play levels and the open world.\n\nEach hub has characters unique to that location. For example, a few character tokens you might find in Tony Stark's Malibu penthouse are Iron Monger, Happy Hogan, and (if I remember correctly) the Mark 5 Iron Man suit.\n\nThe gameplay is a vast improvement over LEGO Marvel Super Heroes. The combat feels much better, and the new tag-team attacks are a blast. The combo system takes some getting used to, and the targeting can be a bit funky, but overall combat is very fun. Each 'main' Avenger can team up with another 'main' Avenger to perform unique tag-team moves, and which move you get depends on who initiates the combo.\n\nFor example, let's say you have Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. If you initiate a tag-team with Scarlet Witch as Quicksilver, Quicksilver will run off screen and come back with a bunch of red LEGO blocks. Scarlet Witch then lifts them into the air (as Quicksilver dashes around in excitement) before causing them to erupt in a rain of energy. However, if you intiate a tag-team with Quicksilver as Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver picks her up and spins her around as she fires a beam of energy across a wide area.\n\nFor 'side' characters, the tag-team is the same, with one person grabbing the other's wrists and performing a synchronized air slam. A bit grating after a while, but by no means a detriment to the game.\n\nThe story is split across six (technically seven?) Marvel movies: Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor: Dark World, Captain America: Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Ant-Man (in the upcoming DLC pack, that is).\n\nSome people criticize the lack of an original story and the use of direct voice-acting rips from the films, but I actually rather like both of these. Many favorite lines are repeated, with some clever new dialogue to help fit the scene thrown in. The lack of an original plot doesn't bother me either, as the ones that the game DOES cover are all very well written and fun to play through.\n\nThe game is drop-dead gorgeous. It's a bit heavy on mid-range laptops like mine, which surprised me a bit. However, even at 1280x720 (not my current resolution, mind), the game still looks significantly better than it's predecessor.\n\nHowever, the game is not perfect. It does have a few rough spots, such as the occasional friendly fire. The voice acting does get a bit tired after a while, as does the generic tag-team for other characters. The story is also a bit short, but the Free Roam makes up for that. The side mission 'Into The Aether' is a bit bugged, but that may just be me. Finally, the game is fairly easy.\n\nDespite these very insignificant shortcomings, this game is excellent and definitely worthy of a solid 9/10.\n\nTL;DR: Get this damn game.","January 28","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham it features way more to do and way more to see than ever before. Though it sacrifices that Lego charm we've seen over the years.\n\nOn the surface it has everything you want out of a Lego Game, but it soon reveals it's flaws.\nFor starters the game treats you like an idiot with more cutscenes and camera cuts than any other Lego Game. Visually ripping you from gameplay every minute to camera loom over what you're supposed to do next far too long.\n\nSecond, all the cute Lego gags that poked exceptional fun at the source content is gone. Replaced by cringe-worthy chicken jokes and a way way way waaay overused food gag.\n\nThirdly, the levels are just plain uninteresting. They expand the films by letting you play through things inbetween scenes you never cared about and then draw out scenes you do want to play through then making them quite boring.\n\nThough one thing i'd like to put in it's defense is it seems to have put as much detail into the individual characters as Lego Batman 3. All in all, go for it, it's another notch in the Lego Game belt, but made to a lower standard than some. Hope this helps!","February 8","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think that the new adventures that you don't know what is going to happen are the best.\n\nIn conclusion I think that the game is not totaly boring and there are a lot of fun and cool features, but there is definatly a lot of room for improvement.\n\nI give Lego Marvel's Avengers 7/10 because of the many bugs and pore storyline, but still keeping me mostly entertained.","April 6","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because this is being worked on, added too. Yes it doesn't have the X-Men or the Fantastic Four but it works on the Cinematic Universe. They'res already talk of a Civil War tie in (So it's worth getting the season pass), and while we'll get it after the console, we'll still get some awesome new content. Not to mention an Ant-Man tie in sooner or later.\n\nI think it's a good one as it's being added on, being worked on and hopefully, they will continue to do so.\n\nMy only gripe is that for some reason or other Lego games have started putting in voice snippets into the game, unlike the old Lego Star Wars games where they just did emotions to get the gist across, which I felt worked nicer and was more comedic. Though I suppose this is just to tie in with how things work these days. Though it makes it feel unnatural when they have speech and then cut out some lines simply to use them as revive/death/special move one liners.","April 5","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham it features way more to do and way more to see than ever before. Though it sacrifices that Lego charm we've seen over the years.\n\nOn the surface it has everything you want out of a Lego Game, but it soon reveals it's flaws.\nFor starters the game treats you like an idiot with more cutscenes and camera cuts than any other Lego Game. Visually ripping you from gameplay every minute to camera loom over what you're supposed to do next far too long.\n\nSecond, all the cute Lego gags that poked exceptional fun at the source content is gone. Replaced by cringe-worthy chicken jokes and a way way way waaay overused food gag.\n\nThirdly, the levels are just plain uninteresting. They expand the films by letting you play through things inbetween scenes you never cared about and then draw out scenes you do want to play through then making them quite boring.\n\nThough one thing i'd like to put in it's defense is it seems to have put as much detail into the individual characters as Lego Batman 3. All in all, go for it, it's another notch in the Lego Game belt, but made to a lower standard than some. Hope this helps!","February 8","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many moments that will take up the screen freezing the second player, there are also ways too many cutscenes. I understand the age intended is for children and that some cutscenes are necessary but they got ways out of hand in this one. There is a point where it becomes no longer playing a level, and just watching the camera pan to events that would be visible to the naked eye easily....oh yes that giant explosion is so much clearer now thank you for freezing my character for 40 seconds. I dread going back and playing through levels again. The outside world is bigger than the Marvel Super Heroes, and a bit upgraded, but that's not really my thing. Let's just hope if it keeps up with this every other game thing that the next one being Star Wars Force Awakens should be much better.\n\nBuy it on sale (it will happen in a few months I'm sure)\nBuy it if you are super fanboy/fangirl over the Avenger's movies and need more of that.\nBuy it if you have to.\nBuy it because Squirrel Girl","April 1","true","30.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And damn, the scenes from the movies are done so well in lego form; the camera angles, the animations (again), funny scenes etc (especially the part where iron man, thor and cap fight). For that alone it's a buy worth it. Also, something about each lego level is done and paced really well that it doesn't feel boring as some other lego games make you feel sometimes, it always gets you intrigued and amazed.\nThe combat is done well and is really fluid, unlike the previous superheroes game, there are manual special attacks, and team attacks where the animation also comes into play, and it's darn fine.\n\nIf you're a LEGO fan/Avengers fan, buy it immediately, if not, well, you're never not a fan of either, so yeah.

Because this is being worked on, added too. Yes it doesn't have the X-Men or the Fantastic Four but it works on the Cinematic Universe. They'res already talk of a Civil War tie in (So it's worth getting the season pass), and while we'll get it after the console, we'll still get some awesome new content. Not to mention an Ant-Man tie in sooner or later.\n\nI think it's a good one as it's being added on, being worked on and hopefully, they will continue to do so.\n\nMy only gripe is that for some reason or other Lego games have started putting in voice snippets into the game, unlike the old Lego Star Wars games where they just did emotions to get the gist across, which I felt worked nicer and was more comedic. Though I suppose this is just to tie in with how things work these days. Though it makes it feel unnatural when they have speech and then cut out some lines simply to use them as revive/death/special move one liners.","April 5","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think that the new adventures that you don't know what is going to happen are the best.\n\nIn conclusion I think that the game is not totaly boring and there are a lot of fun and cool features, but there is definatly a lot of room for improvement.\n\nI give Lego Marvel's Avengers 7/10 because of the many bugs and pore storyline, but still keeping me mostly entertained.","April 6","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheClassiestBanana/recommended/405310/","TheClassiestBanana","Exceedingly Thin Cephalopod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheClassiestBanana/","94 products in account","I can't give this game enough thumbs up.\n\nLEGO Marvel's Avengers is the DEFINITIVE Super Hero game by LEGO. It features a massive core hub (Manhattan) and seven smaller hubs for you to explore at your leisure, including the SHIELD Base and the famous realm of Asgard. There are several characters that can be unlocked just by playing the stories (more on those in a minute), and over a hundred more to be found scattered through Free Play levels and the open world.\n\nEach hub has characters unique to that location. For example, a few character tokens you might find in Tony Stark's Malibu penthouse are Iron Monger, Happy Hogan, and (if I remember correctly) the Mark 5 Iron Man suit.\n\nThe gameplay is a vast improvement over LEGO Marvel Super Heroes. The combat feels much better, and the new tag-team attacks are a blast. The combo system takes some getting used to, and the targeting can be a bit funky, but overall combat is very fun. Each 'main' Avenger can team up with another 'main' Avenger to perform unique tag-team moves, and which move you get depends on who initiates the combo.\n\nFor example, let's say you have Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. If you initiate a tag-team with Scarlet Witch as Quicksilver, Quicksilver will run off screen and come back with a bunch of red LEGO blocks. Scarlet Witch then lifts them into the air (as Quicksilver dashes around in excitement) before causing them to erupt in a rain of energy. However, if you intiate a tag-team with Quicksilver as Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver picks her up and spins her around as she fires a beam of energy across a wide area.\n\nFor 'side' characters, the tag-team is the same, with one person grabbing the other's wrists and performing a synchronized air slam. A bit grating after a while, but by no means a detriment to the game.\n\nThe story is split across six (technically seven?) Marvel movies: Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor: Dark World, Captain America: Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Ant-Man (in the upcoming DLC pack, that is).\n\nSome people criticize the lack of an original story and the use of direct voice-acting rips from the films, but I actually rather like both of these. Many favorite lines are repeated, with some clever new dialogue to help fit the scene thrown in. The lack of an original plot doesn't bother me either, as the ones that the game DOES cover are all very well written and fun to play through.\n\nThe game is drop-dead gorgeous. It's a bit heavy on mid-range laptops like mine, which surprised me a bit. However, even at 1280x720 (not my current resolution, mind), the game still looks significantly better than it's predecessor.\n\nHowever, the game is not perfect. It does have a few rough spots, such as the occasional friendly fire. The voice acting does get a bit tired after a while, as does the generic tag-team for other characters. The story is also a bit short, but the Free Roam makes up for that. The side mission 'Into The Aether' is a bit bugged, but that may just be me. Finally, the game is fairly easy.\n\nDespite these very insignificant shortcomings, this game is excellent and definitely worthy of a solid 9/10.\n\nTL;DR: Get this damn game.","January 28","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other than the first Marvel game, this one has no original story, but follows the story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (especially Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron).  They added the "Lego flavor" to the story, meaning there are a lot of random and funny moments in it.\n\nThe game is similar to all other Lego games, you have 15 different levels and need to solve puzzles, with the abilities of differerent characters, to move forward. After you finished the story once you are able to enter the levels in free play.  In addition to that there are a few different hub levels, These are small areas in which you can free roam and have no specific task. You can unlock different characters and vehicles in them aswell.\n\nThe game lists 196 playable characters, but taken into account that most movie characters have no special abilities, there is not as much variety in characters as in the previous game. (Since the game focusses on the cinematic universe, the X-Men, Fantastic Four, Spiderman and all characters related to them are not in the game.)\n\nExpect a few minor bugs, the game was fluent and the gameplay was fun. 8/10\nIf you want a Marvel Lego game, I'd recommend to buy Lego Marvel Super Heroes first. And if you like it and want more, get this one aswell.","February 1","true","38.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the detail in the characters for this and other super hero lego games. Mannhatten is mostly the same, but you can also go to about 8 smaller areas like Tony's house in Malibu and Asgard. You play levels from these movies: Avengers, Avengers Age of Ultron, 1 level with some Captain America, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America Winter Soldier. The 2 Avengers movies have about 6 levels. The other movies have 1 level each and no cutscenes.\nThe Hulk vs Hulkbuster level is just some crappy button mashing, which is the only way you fight Hulk. I enjoyed the Avengers movies levels anyway, and defeating Ultron was pretty cool. Tony Stark has about 15 suits including Hulkbuster. Spiderman, Fantastic 4, Xmen, and Guardians of the Galaxy are not in this game. They are in the Marvel Super Heroes game. Instead you get alot more characters. Theres even a T-rex. Combat is more difficult, and you will often die from getting shot because you cant always defend against multiple enemies from different angles. Doing an instant kill attack gets annoying after a while because it takes about 4 seconds.\nYou collect over 200 gold bricks. The reward for collecting them all is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, tiny stud fountain that is made of regular bricks and not gold ones. Im sick of getting almost nothing for the gold bricks. I hate that. There are no "fun or silly" red bricks. I enjoy having fun making characters tiny or something overpowered, but you just get studs x# or item detector bricks.\n\n\n","April 24","true","56.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's true, not everything is a life-changer, or worth the money, or worth the effort, but some games are. We all love the joy of that truly AAA game that we rush to play at every open chance and that we think about despite ourselves, but games can be taken slowly and pacifically too. This is where I would throw LEGO: Avengers. While not the best LEGO game (LEGO: Star Wars), or the worst (LEGO: Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues), Avengers tries to be what it can with its astonishing limitations. Avengers steps up the fighting mechanic game while kicking down the puzzle solving game. It's....fine, but truth be told, I starting missing the puzzles halfway through. It tries to fight against the "It's just formula!" arguments by sacrificing some of the most enjoyable parts of a LEGO game. I like the expansions, and yeah, I'd say it's worth it, but my recommendation comes with a cautious yes. This is not a game you will likely replay. However, this is not a game you will rage-quit because it's terrible or annoying (LEGO: Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues). In the end, yeah....it's fine.
