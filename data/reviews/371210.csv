The lighting is terrible and hard to see which doesn't make the game tense or scary it just makes it dark.  the graphics are ok they may be better but it is hard to see them because the game is dark.  The first few minutes of this game told me what to expect with the bad controls and the first puzzle didn't work at first until a few minutes passed then finally I got through the doorway, I clipped through myself and had 4 feet at one time climbing down a ladder and then the screen went black when climbing up another ladder.  There is no run at least not yet anyway.  I walked slowly down a hallway until I saw the poorly designed axe murderer and the lights went off and he was gone so I kept walking down the hallway and died.  Time to get a refund!\n\nThis game isn't even in early access and should just be scrapped and the developer flogged for making such a poor excuse for a game.","September 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 116 of 141 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","116","141","9","28"

The story is ok, and the developers obviously cared and worked hard, but bugs and design choices blow it. It's like someone set me a beautiful dinner table - with candles and music - and then served me poop.\n\nWhether you're accidentally walking on water, or crouching to overcome an invisible wall, Gridberd throws so many irritating goofs at you that I can't list them all, so I'll just illustrate with *JOURNAL PAGES*. If you see a journal page in the environment, a visible key-prompt appears ( [F] ) which lets you pick it up and read it. But often, standing in front of the page and looking at it doesn't elicit a prompt. I repeatedly had to scurry about the floor randomly, waggling my head, until a visible key prompt appeared - often at the corner of the screen. But occasionally, it was wasted time because the page turned out to be non-interactive. And once (in the dining room) I was able to read a page by pressing the interact key after completely failing to find any visible prompt.\n\nGridberd is a few months and some tough feedback away from being a solid, very scary game. But once you serve me poop, I'll be eating out, thank you :)","September 7, 2015","false","2.6"," 86 of 100 people (86%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","86","86","100","18","1"

The atmosphere while not original had a very good feel to it albeit I have to wonder why the heck everything seems as moist as an inexplicably horny Sponge Bob.\n\nWhile there aren't a lot of controls, just the simple act of moving feels incredibly awkward and there isn't really all that much to do in the game save for reading a few notes and listening to a few, extremely runny radio recordings. The story feels flimsy and nonexistant - however, on occasion a horror game can get away with such if it makes up in playability. And having said that the only frightening thing in this game are the mountaineous piles of beer cans (we get it, the floaty, glowy eyed muzzle masked bad guy is an alcoholic, thank you) and questionable layout of the Hotel.\n\nFeels like wasted potential :/ it had the strong elements to be good but fails to deliver. It's also agonizingly short and left me with a "...that's all?" vibe. Wouldn't recommend it, unless it gets a proper shine up which probably won't happen.","September 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","40","46","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/371210/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","Gridberd is a first person horror game that lasts roughly about an hour and half. We explore the abandoned Johnson Mansion and figure out the reason for the recent mysterious deaths surrounding the old building.\n\nLet me start off by saying, I will not be mincing my words here.\n\nLet’s start with the story. I will try not to put any spoilers. So the gist is there’s a vengeful ghost, Kary. Filled with rage, he locks up the player character, Sam Rogers, with the intent of killing him. However, before Kary can kill him, the spirit forces Sam to witness some of Kary’s dreaded past and later on, we learn a terrible sin Sam had commited, which plays a part in why Kary’s spirit hasn’t move on.  So instead of killing him quickly, Kary toys with Sam, taunting him with several corpses strewn around in the mansion. Oddly enough, these lifeless bodies bear a striking resemblance to Sam. Spoiler:  I believe Sam is already dead while we’re playing as him and perhaps Sam himself needed some closure because he might have felt guilty for participating in the death of Kary. He might have also had a hand in the death of Kary’s son but I’m not really sure\n\nKary allows Sam to explore the old mansion that once belonged to the specter, giving him a chance to investigate the recent tragic events and search for the truth. Kary narrates the story, with notes and the radio broadcasting the news supplementing the narrative. The storyline is compelling enough but then towards the end, it left a bad taste in my mouth. I just feel as though it is rushed. That’s all.  As a side note, Kary’s voice actor is just trying too hard to sound ominous. It fails and he probably needed tons of throat lozenges after the recording. The other voices are fine actually.\n\nNow let’s move over to the “scare factor” of the game. How much did it scare me? On a scale of 1-10 (1 being, “me looking for something to scare me but couldn’t find it, no matter how hard I tried” and 10 being, “I ♥♥♥♥ my pants, I should’ve worn a diaper”), Gridberd was a 2. The only time I genuinely felt dread was when I saw a couple of spiders and I don’t think those little guys were the main threat. There are jumpscares but they aren't startling. There aren’t too many ambient sounds (it was mostly silent throughout the game) and the music feels out of place sometimes. It’s too epic sounding. Like you’re going on an adventure and it had no place in the setting of the story, in my opinion.\n\nIn the features of Gridberd, it’s written that there are “riddles and puzzles, as well as hidden paths that can reward you in the most diverse ways.” I played through the game twice (I had to play offline because my internet cut off so my playtime is more that what is shown) and found no riddles and barely any puzzles. I also scoured the Johnson mansion for any diverse pathways but I couldn’t find them. Maybe, I’m just blind. May I also add that the walking speed of Sam is atrocious. It’s so bloody slow! I don’t know if it’s like that to build tension but at the times where you have to backtrack, goddamit, my patience meter went off the charts. It made exploring tedious since sprinting isn't available. There is a silver lining to the sluggish walking speed. It made the boss battle hilariously entertaining…that’s all I’m saying.\n\nThe graphics is decent. It’s on the CryEngine. I have no problem with it, in terms of framerate drops, but I’m reading that some people are struggling to maintain their fps. In addition to that, the game is littered with terrible texture glitches, bugs and strange character models. The subtitles are way too fast, with multiple spelling errors and sometimes the characters talk on top of one another. The voice actors have an accent and their English for the most part, is understandable but the subtitles help when they’re pronouncing a word that might sound different than what I’m used to. These might seem minor, but it’s distracting, for me at least. Bugs can be fixed with patches and I’m not expecting a perfect game but I’m simply calling it how I see it.\n\nLastly, with the length of the game (1.5 or less) and its price, coupled with the various problems mentioned previously, I cannot recommend Gridberd just yet. I want to because I can tell the developers worked hard on it. I enjoyed the story but most people probably would not play a game mostly for the story.\n\nThat’s my input of Gridberd. Thanks for reading :)\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n- Compelling story\n- Decent graphics\n\nCons:\n- Buggy, glitchy gameplay\n- Short game (<1.5 hours of gametime)\n- Not as scary as I would like\n- Walking simulator (slow walking speed)\n- Optimization problems (people are reporting of low framerates)\n- Sound problems.\n- Price tag might not be agreeable to some\n\nBy the way, when you have the time, this is my video of me fooling around in Gridberd.\n\nGridberd Video","September 11, 2015","false","2.1"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","37","42","2","1"

As soon as I started I had problems, going through the options and tried to set the graphics quality.  Some of the options had placeholder graphics that said REPLACE ME on it.  Great.  So I started, and I have to say, this game looks amazing.  It's stunning, and offers a great atmosphere.  That's pretty much the only thing I can say that's good about it though.  The characters movement speed is incredibly slow.  Crouching halves this already stupidly slow speed, and since you have to crawl around in air ducts at the speed of a snail, it's incredibly frustrating and boring.  I can see that the devs who made this were going for a PT feel, but the jump scares just feel wrong.  I saw a guy getting dragged off through a gap, then turned around to see an axe murderer with a hockey mask on behind me.  Naturally I sh*t myself, but then he zoomed towards me like Lisa would from PT and dissapeared, leaving me thinking "seriously? wtf?"  It doesn't look like a ghost, why make it act like one?  Carrying on at the snails pace, I ended up having to drop down a shaft into some water.  Which killed me.  I had to reload twice before I landed in the water properly, which of course made the game crash 2 minutes later.\n\nThen I uninstalled and wrote this review.  The game needs a LOT of work, I honestly thought it was early access, and I'm shocked that it's a full release.  NOT worth £7.","November 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The effects, animations, props, models—with a few minor tweeks here and there, are literally just drag-and-drop content from the Editor.\n\nThis is a walking simulator with extremly "meh" voice acting, terrible grammar and horrible story. Optimization is also an issue—my rig can handle Crysis 3 on the highest settings like a dream, but this game chugs at the lowest settings. It doesn't help that the frame rate kept mutating from 40 to 60 every second.\n\nYou'll be able to beat this in about an hour and a half, so if you hurry, you can get a Steam refund after slogging through it (if that's still a thing as of this posting), if you're really curious on how such a "pretty" game can be so boring.\n\nMost—if not all—the positive reviews are either people who haven't played the game, twelve-years-old, friends of the developers, or some freakish combination of the three.","December 12, 2015","false","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
