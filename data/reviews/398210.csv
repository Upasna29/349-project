Someone made yet another cheap, lazy-arsed "horror" game, and is now asking money for it on Steam.  And surprise, surprise!  Some ♥♥♥♥-head wasted $1.79 USD to find out just how bad it was.\n\nSo how bad is it?  Well, actually, I've played worse.  But I've also played much, much, MUCH better.  Let's be specific:  The graphics aren't TOO bad, even if they're extremely repetitive and I couldn't work out how to get them out of windowed mode (lack of an Options screen can do that to ya).  The sound is generally rather good, if you excuse the appalling, got-my-girlfriend-to-do-it (she's studying Drama atm) nature of the voice acting, and the fact that your echoing footsteps sound like a rhino stampeding through a very dry, very narrow and seemingly endless length of sewer piping.  The infrequent jump scares are admittedly effective (lights suddenly exploding, that kinda thing), but any good herein is easily outdone by the fact that you are apparently being pursued by a completely silent and unseen antagonist, whose presence is only confirmed by on-screen statements such as "he is here", and the fact that you die when you run out of battery power and get a suitably explanatory "game over" screen to say that "he" finally caught up with you.  Which happened to me mostly because I spent a while walking around in circles, only to end up back at the door I was looking for a key to, at which time I was informed that "he" had stolen the key and I now had to find SOMETHING ELSE to open said door with!  Gee whiz, thanks for that, glad I wasted all my battery power looking around for a key and ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥-ALL ELSE, because that's what the game had TRAINED me to do up to that point, at the expense of ignoring anything else bar - you guessed it - BATTERIES!!!\n\nOutlast has a lot to answer for.  Not least of all the fact that almost every ♥♥♥♥ing game that attempts to "emulate" it sucks DYING DOG'S TESTACLES.  Here's to the next half-arsed "horror" title (due any day now, methinks).  You'd think I'd learn, but alas, the temptation to be one of the top two or three reviews on an otherwise barren Store page is just too beguiling for me.  Ever notice how these kinds of games get a dozen or so of us early-worm suckers to post reviews on them, then NOBODY EVER BUYS OR REVIEWS THEM EVER AGAIN?!  That's an awful lot of failed aspiring game designers out there, don'tcha think?  There must be a plague of distraught mothers, especially in Europe, who think they're gonna barge in on their teenage sons having a wank, but alas...\n\nOh well, at least the heavy-duty ceiling fan they installed just a month ago didn't go to waste.\n\nVerdict: 3.5/10.","September 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 100 of 117 people (85%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","85","100","117","31","3"

Not to mention the trailer in the store page which is in fact a compilation of Let's Play footage taken from Youtube.\n\nAs I launch the game my greatest fears were confirmed : BlackShadows doesn't have any menu. Instead of opening on the title screen the game throws you directly into gameplay, where the scary part actually ends...\n\nBasically, the game consist of making your way through a dark maze-like environment with your flashlight. Since batteries in indie horror games can't last longer than any generic brand batteries sold at Walmart, you'll have no choice but to pickup new ones every two minutes.\n\nIn addition, the game features only one level and it lasts no longer than 20 minutes. Once you get at the end of the game you will feel no sense of accomplishment since nothing explains what you have actually done to solve the mystery behind the paranormal phenomenon that afflicts the whole humanity.\n\nTo conclude, BlackShadows aka Black Shadows is nothing else but another indie game that tries to cow milk on the success of great horror games such as Amnesia and Outlast (let's not talk about Slender, please). Considering its short lenght the 5$ price tag just feels like a total rip-off. Even though I bought the game while it was on sale I still think it wasn't worth my money.\n\nIf you have 12 minutes, you can watch my whole playthrough below :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwaMvea-zNY\n\nP.S.: Is it just me or the narrator has a French Canadian accent?\n\nRating :\n1.0","September 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","55","61","5","13"

And I do mean 'let' because there's enough of them lying around to power a shuttle launch.\n\nYour average Kindle book requires more interaction than this. There are five doors to open, the keys to which lie varying distances away through linear corridors. There is no threat. There's no menu. There's two scares where a light blows out and a lightning crash illuminates your would-be adversary in a corridor but neither of them affect anything you're doing. Listening to the opening/closing narration takes almost half as long as it does to beat the game.

No subtitles or anything. "Oh well letme press ESC and see if there are any options." Nope...game closes. No interface to change your options.\n\nWhen it comes to the "horror" part, this is a poor, POOR excuse of a horror game. Basically, there is only two jumpscares, one during the story and one when it's game over. The rest of the horror part is just long, dark hallways and text pop-ups of how you're the next victim.\n\nGameplay? Not much of a gameplay. All you do is just look for keys to open vault doors. That's it. Not joking. No interaction with anything else. This game only took me around 15 mins to complete.\n\nThis game is a good example of how NOT to make a horror game.

I'm serious, apart from the cheesy white figure that appears for about a frame there was nothing interesting to take a picture of. Just bland textures in the worlds blandest version of Outlast with bland jump scares if you're lucky because this game seems to think text is scary. I didn't play through the entire game even though I've heard that the game play is only around 20 minutes which is something akin of $0.50 worth of game if that. The thing that did this game in for me the most was the fact that I pressed Esc to pause, seeing as that's something even the most thread bare of games seem to have, only to have the game close on me. When I reopened the game, it seemed to restart the story only it wouldn't let me turn on my flashlight even though I had a full battery.

I discovered that as long as the batteries aren't totally dead, nothing bad will happen. That is until you see ANOTHER BOX.\n\nBox Design\n\nThe box design is amazing. Everywhere you look, there are boxes on shelves. Gosh darn terrifying, I tell ya hwut. If you've ever thought that the perfect game could be made up of corridors, shelves, boxes, and AA batteries, then the perfect game has been made for you.\n\nAhhh! You Scared Me, You Scary Game!\n\nI love how there are screams that let you know when things are scary. If the game didn't have those, it would suffer from a lack of content. However, the screams that you hear let you know exactly when the intended scary stuff happens, otherwise you would be just as confused and aimless as you were prior to the screaming.\n\nThe Soundtrack\n\nThe developer's decision to include the widely-appreciated pop hit 4'33" by composer John Cage shouldn't be seen as anything but incredible genius. The engaging soundtrack of silence absolutely sucks...\n\nWAIT FOR IT\n\n...the player in and sets the perfect tone of suspense and  FEAR for the 25 minutes or so that you'll be playing the game. I should note that the piece is played on repeat, to make sure that you hear it. I just can't get enough of 4'33" - The perfect classical composition.\n\nOverall\n\nWho wouldn't want to play this game? I mean, really, everything I said applies. It's got walking, and a flash light, and batteries, and boxes, and random screaming, and the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I can only hope that the soundtrack is released as a free DLC.\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","January 30","true","0.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","38","5","13","5","0"

I did not sign up for it nor do I play such games at all. I gave it a whirl and it seemed like I was watching Markipler playing on youtube, aka a generic indie horror game. Sadly the only horror was the fact I wasted 15 mins of my life, I felt I would never get it back and I was so scared that any minute as a human being I could die at any moment and frankly in those 15 mins I could of told someone I loved them, gg.","September 21, 2015","true","0.2"," 7 of 36 people (19%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","19","7","36","10","0"

Your only item is a flashlight that you can  use to light up dark places, but it needs batteries to stay alive. Your main objective is collecting keys and opening doors. Game usually takes like 15-20 minutes to finish. This game looks more like a demo, than a real full game.  I can't believe they are actually selling this game for an 2.99 € on steam. Rip-off at it's finest. I didn't get any enjoyment out of this game and trust me, you won't get any enjoyment out of it either. Just stay away from this horrible game !","November 3, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/recommended/398210/","uncageable","Gwidhw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/","679 products in account","Black Shadows sounded like a good idea at the time.\n=======\n\nCONS:\n\n- MONOTONOUS: Find the key, open the door. Pickup batteries to keep the flashlight lit.\n\n- LACK OF STORY: No real story here, but it's telling a narrative about a lady and her recurring nightmares. It's interesting, but... lacking. It gives enough monologue to let you know that something is happening (no spoilers for ideas and interpretations), but not enough to make it feel fleshed out enough. It's just.. lacking.\n\n- LACK OF SCARES: It's not scary :( The only slightly creepy thing was seeing Silver Surfer appear in front of me, slightly perturbed by his own lack of clothing. No offense meant, devs~!\n\n- ENVIRONMENT/TEXTURES: Somebody really likes empty wire-spools, metal shelving, and fire extinguishers. The only interesting thing in the game was the teddy bear, and I couldn't even pick it up! It disappeared :(\n\n- NO REPLAYABILITY: Play it once, beat it, you're done.\n\n- TOO SHORT: It's exceedingly short. I finished it in less than 20 minutes :l\n\n-/+ Voice Acting: It's not bad, but, it's not great. I can tell that it was done by someone who was invested in what they were doing, but, it's a little, well... lacking. I can't think of better words here, but, overall this game just fell short of what I believe they were aiming for. It could have been well refined, tweaked, and expanded to create a more interesting environment and playthrough, but... as with that, the voice acting could have been more intense to suit the mood. I'm including this one under both PROS and CONS, because she didn't do a bad job, but rather, it was just lacking. That's up to the dev to get right (assuming they're not the same person...? I didn't pay attention to the credits... Sorry~!)\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+/- Voice acting: She did a fairly decent job, but... it's just not intense enough, yadda yadda yadda. You've read this already under the CONS section. I've placed it in both, so it neither weighs for nor against it.\n\n+ BUILD-UP: When I say "Build-up", I mean this one point where "you've been seen", and "he's coming for you". It really threw me into a slightly cautious mindset, because I didn't know what the game was going to throw at me. Sadly, it didn't really deliver... but, it did have a surprising "alert" reaction from me, and that is always welcome in games like this. Well done, but, overall, again, it was lacking. The only time you really need to feel uncomfortable is if the flashlight runs out of batteries. Then you start again. ...With all the previous doors you opened up until then still open. And no extra batteries. Oh yeah... Just. Keep. Moving. You'll find more around the corner, as long as you didn't already pick them up.\n\n+ VERY FLUID GAMEPLAY: The smoothness of the gameplay for me was great. I know there wasn't much too it, but it was a plus seeing that it wasn't choppy, bloated, or overly grainy on textures. It looked pretty okay, and ran like butter. Very nice~\n\n\n=======\nDo I recommend?\nNo, I can't.\n\nOverall "BlackShadows" was just... well, there's that word again: "lacking".\n\nIt had an interesting direction, though was very short, and did not deliver on the scares.\nWhen I beat the game, I was a bit confused, hoping that it wasn't the end, so it would have at least one more shot at scaring me, but... it was over.\n\nAnd with that... well, my review is over.\nAnd it's almost time for bed.\n\nLet's hope no Dark Shadows loom over me while I sleep, or I might just end up in a nightmare, like she did.\nThe protagonist, that is. She was in a nightmare. Maybe.\n\n...\n\nShe kept talking about nightmares.\n\n...\n\n*Uninstalled*","September 27, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't very fun.  To be honest the first time round, I didn't even get scared like the game is supposed to make you.  If I were playing some other horror game like, slenderman maybe, there is more sound and I guess depth to the game. It doesn't have enough of what makes a horror game great.  Graphics are ok I guess.  I've only played maybe 20 minutes, but it is very boring.  It doesn't seem like a great horror game.  Very undeveloped.  Maybe give it time for developers or the developer to add more things, but right now, this whole review is bad, and I give the game a 3/10.","December 3, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
