It is simple the game is filled with references to Minecraft, but that’s not the bad part. The bad part is that’s all it is, references there is no substance no engaging story no real narrative or characters you care about.\n\nThe first 30 minutes of the game is a brutal slog of uninspired writing and weak character building, comparatively to other Telltale titles.  The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Tales From The Borderlands, and Game of Thrones are all vastly superior in the quality of characters, writing, and player engagement.\n\nTo expand on characters here is a list...\nThe Pig\nThe Fat Guy\nThe Girl\nThe Cool Girl\nThe Tunnel Snakes\nThe Nice Tunnel Snake\nLee EverettThe characters are bland and are given no real distinct or likable traits, making them unmemorable (see list) and near pointless to the story other than bouncing dialog off of.\n\nI purchased this game assuming that it would have the same quality that Telltale always delivers, but it did not. I have refunded my copy and a copy I gifted to a friend (On his request because its controls were broken). Hopefully this is not a sign that all future Telltale titles will become uninspired cash grabs but only time will tell.","October 13, 2015","false","1.8"," 2,342 of 3,261 people (72%) found this review helpful 309 people found this review funny","72","342","3","309","25"

You wouldn't criticize someone for being positive, so why on someone just because they have a negative opinion?\n\nTL;DL - Minecraft doesn't translate well into a Telltale game, "Telltale goes from HBO to Nickelodeon". Could've been something great but failed at the first hurdle.\n\nThis game isn't Minecraft. Nor is it Telltale. It doesn't feel like it anyway. There were moments when I was playing this and was thinking "This is a Minecraft game." and "This is a Telltale game.", and I just couldn't believe it.\n\nThe game begins by introducing all this new lore into Minecraft, and all this new Characters. It kind of just spits it all out and somehow expects you to take it all in some how. It would have been easier to understand if there was a stronger link between this game and the original Minecraft, but there just isn't. It would've just been as easy as having the pickable characters at the begining of the game being the 2 set characters we already know - Steve and Alex.\n\nWhen playing the game you feel as if you are watching a poor fan animation on youtube - Like someone trying to be like Element Animation but not quite. It falls into the un-canny valley - It's close to being a good looking animation while still looking like Minecraft, but it's just not quite there. It just feels un-natural. Also, the lip syncing in this game (for me) was annoyingly... weird. Rather than smooth mouth movements they used still mouth shapes that just jump to other mouth shapes when a different sound if pronounced. During the whole game I was just staring at their mouths because it just didn't look like they were really speaking at all.\n\nFinally, the game itself is clearly aimed at a younger audience, but Telltale have tried to give it the atmosphere found in their other games. In the Walking Dead you may have to save someone's life, and there is a real sense of threat as you know that if you fail they will die and you'll have to watch them get brutally murdered - Whereas in Minecraft Story Mode if you have to try and save someone you don't get a real sense of threat, you know that they aren't going to kill a character off in a kids game, and if they do it will be off-screen and clean. This means that I don't feel worried when I have to try and save someone as I know that in the end everything will be okay. Another thing I noted was that [Spoiler Alert]  you can try to make Lukas stay or you can let him leave. Now, as I noticed, he isn't actually mean to you at all at any moment in the game. While his gang will repeatedly harrass you, Lukas never actually does anything mean/horrible to you. Because I noticed this I made him stay as he is a good member of the team and he is actually a good guy. However, most people playing this game will be children, and to them they will just see him as just another one of the 'Mean Bullies' and while instantly make him leave. I know this as while I was looking at the stats of how people played the game after I saw that I was part of a small percentage (roughly 18% at the time) that actually made him stay.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend getting this game at the current price. If you do want to play it dispite what I've said then you should wait till it's atleast on sale. It's not the worst thing I've ever played, but Telltale really missed the mark on this one.\n\nEdit/Update:   Thank you everyone for your comments! I'm really sorry but I can't reply to anymore comments people are making. I've got a lot of stuff to do and as much as I'd love to reply to everyone it's starting to become a bit of a chore... x3\nAnyhow, thanks for everyone's comments and thoughts, it's been nice to discuss things in formal manner, and I don't think there was actually anyone who were critising me for being negative - Because that's so annoying >_< Anyways, Thank You everyone and have a great life ;)\n\nAlso! If you want to add me on Steam feel free! I'm always looking out for new friends ;)","October 17, 2015","false","5.1"," 1,533 of 2,209 people (69%) found this review helpful 123 people found this review funny","69","533","2","123","55"

It feels like a cash-in. It feels like Microsoft threw a big beefy contract at Telltales and said “Just do the usual”.\n\nAt first glance it may look like the usual fare: an impressive ensemble cast and a heavy lean on comedy but in actuality they've taken some big names, thrown them into a mixing bowl and hoped for the best.\n\nSome of the Actors are dreadful and either don’t understand voice acting or have had terrible direction. The plot - or as much as I absorbed - isn’t very interesting.\n\nIn a lot of ways it’s similar to existing Telltales games but instead of an engrossing story with memorable characters it’s a waste of effort on the developer's part and a waste of time on the player’s.","October 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 1,498 of 2,323 people (64%) found this review helpful 135 people found this review funny","64","498","2","135","46"

Because minecraft seemed like possible the worst IP to make a story based game around. However, I decided to give it a chance as so far Telltales borderlands which I also thought was a bad IP for telltale so far has been done surprsingly well. However my fears were confirmed this time. This is by far the worst Telltale game made yet and has so far and is bad enough to be a embarissment to their company. This game compared to all the other IPs they have purchesed in the past is the most obvious cash grab and Telltale was unfortnatlly not able to make the IP work with their game play style this time.\n\nThere are many negatives about this game...\n1. It has a very bland and predictable story line and charcters. In other games this would not be that big a deal however since telltale games are entierly story driven this really is a huge deal breaker.\n\n2. You have much less controll over what your charcter does and what they say than other telltale games. You will see obvious traps ahead and want to prevent them but will have no means to do so or wish for your charecter to do or say something different and not have the option to do it much more often than any other telltale game.  I understand that most telltale choices are only giving you a veil of choice however the veil in this game is way to easy to see through.\n\n3. The few big choices the game lets you make that actually make a bit of a difference are much easier and unimportant than the other telltale games. They do not make you have the feeling of regreting your choice as the other IPs have. Nor do they have me think about what choice to make and the possible consquences for at least a good 5 minates like some of the other IPs often do as the choices are not only easier but also seem less important.\n\n4. The game makes occsional minor mistakes in which skin for differnet items you should have forgetting your past choices which if followed you should have a different skin for that item.\n\nCurrnetly I would only recommend this game under 2 conditions.\n\n#1 You are one of the young zeolous minecraft fanatics and love anything that has anything to do with minecraft in which case you already purchased the game anyway so your pretty much only reading negative comments to defend it.\n\n#2 You are like me a telltale junkie and have already purchased all the other telltale games including similar games that are not telltale like life is strange and are desperate as hell waiting for more, have good amount of free time and disposable income. Even if that is the case I would recommend waiting for this to go on sale. I understand the need for telltales games crack but this is some low quality stuff that will barely keep you content.","October 13, 2015","false","22.7"," 755 of 1,175 people (64%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","64","755","1","41","6"

Oh my... well, screw that! My review still stands I will not play the other episodes because they have 0 to do with the main plot of the game that was advertised since day 1, so gg.\n\nThe game is finished! Wait, there is still another episode? And it has (basically) NOTHING to do with the plot in the first 4 episodes? Well then I won't review it. I will be making NO spoilers.\n\nBasically, if this game has taught me anything its that, Telltale will sure pump out episodes of something that they know will make more money then their other games and it shows. When I say pump out I mean in a month or less between episodes, and while that sounds cool it is ultimatley it's biggest flaw. To put it bluntly, this game pisses me off in a way few games can hope to.\n\nThere are some good things\nsome jokes (little that do) hit well and do make me chuckle.\nThe game runs well, it doesn't work well, but it runs well. I never dropped below 60 FPS on my PC which is a lot then what I can say for other games.\nThe final chapter (of the 24total chapters) is really interesting and is probaly the best of some of Telltale's entire library.\nThe introduction to Episode 3 is great, action packed and really fun to watch unfold.\n\nThe absolute biggest fault that Minecraft: Story Mode has is the pacing. It is god awful. Episode 1 is paced well, Episode 2 is 50 minutes of nothing. Episode 3 is better in pacing, but still has serious pacing issues in the 2nd half. Episode 4 finally, starts off way too fast, slows down way too hard, and ends off steadily luckily. Some times it goes absolutly at lightning speed through a story important segment, then focuses on something that has little to do with the main serious plot just to have "Character development" which is basically the 3 bullet points that are repeated over and over again.\n\nThe choices don't matter. There are choices, and while some of them "do change the game" (by that I mean some small dialogue changes and only ONCE does it take you elsewhere, only to end up where both choices meet up) they don't change it enough to really matter, or really care.\n\nThe writing is dreadful.\nJokes, even with the little ones that hit, are bad. Some jokes have great potental, but then they feel that they need to point out EVERY. SINGLE. LITTLE. INSTANCE. OF. THAT. JOKE. Which kills the joke. They also think that they need to tell you when to laugh, when Jesse (Your character) just smirks as if you were laughing, every, time, they, make, a, joke.)\n\nMultiple times, especially in the last episode, there are just constant exposition dumps which are really lazy. Instead of woving in the past of the Order of the Stone well, they instead opt to tell you a story then basically quiz you over it covered up by a "puzzle" which is just a quiz.\n\nThe characters are cookie cut outs; The everyman, smart boy, popular guy with a good heart, the fat guy, they all are here and it really hurts me WANTING to like the characters. They are attempted to be fleshed out, however it is extremley cookie cutter progression that leaves the player bored.\n\nThe plot is ok, but there obveously was either too much or too little so the writing glosses over things that should have been expanded upon, however they never were. The major problem with the plot is even with the glossing over segments, the whole danger of the Wither Storm doesn't feel like Danger. Its like a game shows a monster consistantly and says its doing a lot but you never really see anything first hand. It also doesn't help that the Mineraft world is practically endless, even stated in this game so there is no reason why we shouldn't believe that the Wither Storm isn't going to mess up the world ever after seeing how its done almost nothing visual for us.\n\nGlitches are everywhere\nThe game runs well, however it does look well. There are graphical glitches everyone (character models clipping through themselves, and each other. Some blocks are stuck into each other which has a weird clipping effect. And one character, Ivor's, beard has that same effect (at least for Episodes 1-3) which is distracting and kills the imersion in some cases. you fight a Witch at one point with arrows, and the arrows "stick" to the witch, and I swear I could make a more convincing looking sticking arrow animation in Source Filmmaker in 5 minutes then this multiman team did in 1 month.\n\nMultiple times (especially in Episode 2) characters cut eachother off mid sentence in a very "didn't mean to do that" manner. Which makes it appear as a glitch (if it wasn't trying to be one)\n\nNot Very Kid Friendly\nPeople constantly say that this game is for little kids, so cut it a break. Well no. I will not. This game is rated E10 for ages 10 and older, not only that but they also curse multiple times in this game (I have no problem with this, however a game that is aimed at little kids that curses is not really in parents best interests.) They say "What the hell" 3 times, "Damn" once, "freaking" (bad depending on what you think) multiple times, and they call characters "tools" once. There are probaly other instances but it really isn't great for a game aimed at little kids.\n\nGameplay is really bad (when it tries to be action packed)\nThe "combat" is awful. You are required to fight enemies at least once, what it delves down to is you holding the key to move right and spam clicking your mouse, which could be argued that it was like that in regular Minecraft, however this is a new style of bad combat. You do nothing.\n\nThe Music is mediocre\nSometimes it fits, other times it sounds like it was trying to replicate the Minecraft style of music but missed the biggest point, pianos. You see, Minecraft Story Mode's soundtrack recycles itself to an annoying point throughout the 6 hour campaign. The official Minecraft soundtrack is great (atleast the Volume Alpha and the Nether Tracks from the Volume Beta album) however, it seems that the composers (no beef with them) did not know what made Minecraft's iconic soundtrack iconic and instead went for an attempted replication that makes it sound souless and not in the least bit listenable for anything else then what the listener is fored to.\n\nOverall Minecraft: Story Mode is a cash crab that tries at some points, but fails on most others. From the dull plot, poor writing, not very kid friendly vibe, awful combat, and glitches galore it is clear that Telltale either wanted money quickly, or knew that this was a mistake and rushed out everything as fast as possible. I recomend a pass and don't play this game.\n3.5/10\n\nEpisode 1: 7/10\nEpisode 2: 2.3/10 (No joke)\nEpisode 3: 4.8/10\nEpisode 4: 5.3/10","October 30, 2015","false","6.3"," 581 of 953 people (61%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","61","581","953","58","38"

But I beg to differ, I personally think Minecraft is suitable for all ages. For anyone who wants to have a game where they can explore a world full of mysteries, where they can put their creativity to work.\n\nYou guys have no idea how many messages I got from people saying like "ehhrmageerrdd you're playing Minecraft what are you, 10 years old???" as I was playing this game..\nThe point I'm trying to make is that, people tend to have misconceptions about Minecraft itself just because it's known for having somewhat cancerous fanbase filled with immature kids. It's kind of sad that this is why people aren't interested in it because Minecraft: Story Mode is a fantastic and fresh experience from Telltale Games.\n\nSo many people were sh*tting on this game before the first episode had even launched just for the sake of it being a Minecraft game. And you know what? I thank those people for giving me the wrong idea of this game, because of that my expections were low and oh man was I blown away with what I got.\n\nI'm very biased when it comes to Telltale Games but don't worry, I'm not going to try and say this game was flawless.\nI think I've been rambling long enough now, time to actually review the bloody game.\n\n---SKIP TO HERE IF YOU CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO READ THROUGH MY JIBBERING NONSENSE---\nPROS:- Voice-acting\n- Action sequences\n- Atmospheric Soundtrack\n- Choices do actually MATTER\n- It stays true to the Minecraft world\n- Characters are all very likeable in my opinion\n- Animations have improved and look lot smoother than in previous Telltale titles\n- Opening credit scenes are very well done and highly entertaining for each episode\n- Emotionally very touching even if it is lot more toned down from the previous Telltale titles like "The Walking Dead"\n\nNEUTRAL:- Not as many puzzles as you might expect\n- Ambiance constantly switching from funny to depressing\n- The game's filled with clichés and so are the characters. But you know what, it actually isn't that bad.\n( The characters are all unique compared to each other and likeable in their own ways. )\n\nCONS:- Quite a lot of bugs ( especially in Episode 2 which was honestly borderline unplayable. )\n- Some actions of the main / side characters feel very off and it feels like they've become completely different characters\n- Episode 2 was extremely short and honestly a total mess when it came to the dialogue and overall script\n- Dialogue is bit awkward and cringey at some points\n- Certain scenes felt very rushed but this is honestly with every narrative Telltale game I've played\n- Many people have lost their save files including myself but this is not necessarily to blame the game itself for it\n\nOverall it's the most light hearted Telltale title there is, with some depressing moments but mostly it's just your stereotypical comedy slash adventure tale about a group of friends trying to save the world,\nset in the world of Minecraft of course.\n\nHonestly, if you've already played Minecraft and you know there's nothing appealing for you about it, you might want to skip this one. This also applies if you absolutely cannot stand clichés,\ngeneric characters or generic storylines for that matter.\n\nThe story isn't among its strongest features but the characters, the dialogue, the overall gameplay are.\n\nI really enjoyed it. I'm very easy to please though, all I need is that the game touches me emotionally and manages to make me actually care for the characters and about what happens to them. I've never cried for a pig before.\n\nIt was a thrilling ride, throughout the game I smiled, I laughed,\nI shed some tears and I was angry.\nThis is exactly what I want from a videogame.

I mean, I like Minecraft I suppose. But I'm not a hardcore fanboy. I am however a huge fanboy for Telltale games. However this game feels way off the beaten path from Telltale's engaging style, and feels more like playing through a Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nI would caution the seasoned Telltale player that if you're looking for a deep, engaging story, that pulls at your heart and makes you deal with some serious tragedy and strife, that this is not at all your game.\n\nHowever if you're a fan of Minecraft and want a more casual, lighthearted story, this might be for you. But just from what I've dealved into thus far, I don't think it's for me.\n\nI'll play through the entire thing as it comes out because I owe the game that, but this isn't quite what I expected from Telltale. Not that I'm sure what I expected.. I guess I just didn't think Telltale would ever put their name on something like this.. It's so far from everything they've ever done.\n\nI hate to use the term but, I think this is what selling out looks like.","October 13, 2015","false","4.4"," 275 of 474 people (58%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","58","275","474","11","2"

First of all, I haven't played episode four. Not gonna play it anyway, so I don't care anymore. At first I was hopeful about this game. I knew it wouldn't have the dark tone of the other telltale games but still I looked forward to it, and just now, I realize I was wrong. I won't even bother to mention the language problems with it. If you're not an english speaker, don't even bother to get this game. If you choose another language that's not english, the game will choose another language which is not the one you chose.\n\nNow that I got that off my chest, I'll say my real problem with this game. I don't care about any of the characters, the only character that grew into me sightly is Ivor and he's not even that of a major character. All of them are plain and stereothyped in my opinion, and you know what? maybe I'm wrong, but that's what I feel. Why am I supposed to care about all these people?\n\nThe story is just... nothing. It's cliche, I can't tell how many times I've seen a story like this in movies, books and other games. I know this game is supposed to be for all ages, so the story can't be dark, but I don't ask for a dark story, I ask for an interesting one.  Don't get me wrong, a story can contain cliches, but it also needs original stuff to make it something different, and this is what Minecraft: SM doesn't have. It gives nothing new to the industry nor the players.\n\nChoices may matter a bit, yeah, but at what cost? If the story is bad, I don't care if the choices matter or not. I'm dissappointed, and I was wrong when I was hopeful about this game. I mean no offense to the people who liked it, but I didn't. It doesn't have a good story, it doesn't have interesting characters, the graphics are bad, the gameplay is non existant. And yes, I know Telltale games have non existant gameplay, but at the same time, those telltale games at least have an interesting story, so the lack of gameplay isn't noticeable. In MCSM it is noticeable because the story is awful. If it doesn't have a good story, at least it should have something else to like.

What it does do, is tells a story about friends who take it upon themselves to save Minecraftia (or whatever.) About 70% of the game is cutscenes with choices. Like a movie!

You can see that the universe is implemented very well into the game. There are a few knicks here and there the game was overall pretty much like Minecraft.\n\nThe style/system the game was developed on is a pretty common system that you can find on many games. Walk around and click what you'd like to interact with. I'm not very familiar with Telltale games but I am familiar with quite a few general titles.\n\nThe storyline at some points were predictable but overall has a nice plot and I can't wait to see the next episodes. I can already see many people foreshadowing different episodes and stuff.\n\nThe Bad\nThis game became very over-hyped with all its advertisements. It did look like an exciting game with a different style to it, but the game was almost too basic. It might just be me, but I felt that this Episode was absolutely short. Like I said, I'm not too familiar with Telltale games so whether or not they keep their games this short, it is not really worth the $22.50-$25.\n\nThough the story was quite interesting and the choices you can make help develop the game, the playtime is rather short. Most of the story is watching the story and making choices. There isn't much walking around or fighting mobs.\n\nAt some points in the story, it seemed almost predictable. I understand the game audience may not be people 18 and older, but if you're gonna play any game the excitement draws from the astonishment.\n\nConclusion\nThis game was indeed fun and does have a very interesting story. Sadly, the game was very short and did not have much play time. I completed this game in a few hours. It could have been faster but you can't skip the cutscenes.\n\nOverall, this game is fun. BUT I do not believe it is worth the money. Telltale seemed to have created this because Minecraft is such a popular title and they saw the potential cash grab.\n\nNevertheless, if you would like to play this game, be my guest. It was fun and interesting and well worth the few hours I spent on it. But if you have been contemplating on the price of this game with its worth, I would suggest not. $25 is not worth it.","October 14, 2015","false","3.9"," 223 of 393 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","223","393","6","5"

It follows the traditional Telltale recipe of an interactive movie, but feels a little bit forced.\n\nPROS\nIt's a Minecraft game\nGreat soundtrack\nDevs that seem to have a decent sense of humor\nCONS\nIt doesn't really feel like a Minecraft game. For one thing, it does that 90's adventure game thing where the environments are one fixed screen that your character has to move around in, which really doesn't lend itself to the sandbox atmosphere of Minecraft.\nQuick time events. Everything you do that doesn't involve moving the mouse is a quick time event. They really could have been more creative.\nUGH THE CAMERA (See bullet point number 1)\nThe puzzles are to easy and too few. In the first episode, for example, there are only TWO PUZZLES. One of the puzzles, you just have to talk to someone, and the other is so easy to figure out that I accidentally solved it while trying to figure out what the puzzle even was.\nThey try (unsuccessfully) to work crafting into the game. The interface is clunky (right clicking, dragging, and all of that smooth Minecraft stuff won't work) and you can only make very limited things at very specific times. In fact, crafting is only used three times in the first episode, and it's only when it's necessary to move the story forward.\nShallow characters. The biggest thing about a story-based game is the character development, which simply does not exist in this game. The only interesting character in the entire game is Reuben the Pig. All of the other characters are simply archetypes and nothing else.\nFive minutes of credits at the end.\nThe opening credits don't start until the end of Chapter 1.\nThe story doesn't make sense. SPOILER: Ivor has the same goal as you -- stopping the Wtiherstorm and saving the world. But the whole time, he is trying to stop you as well, something that makes no sense whatsoever.\nAnd on top of all that, it doesn't even have trading cards.","October 19, 2015","false","1.9"," 312 of 560 people (56%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","56","312","560","30","3"

Interaction is minimal, I would hardly even call it a game. There's no skill involved, other than pressing arrow keys at correct times when it flashes on your screen. Most of the choices for the player come in the form of dialogue options, but none seem to have much of an impact on the game. The only significant story impacting choice I've found is choosing which hero to rescue at the end of Chapter 1.

This game could have been one of the greatest creations in computing history, what with two of the most popular gaming names behind it. It failed. Unlike in Telltale's Game of Thrones, where I can never wait for the next chapter and play it all the way through the day it comes out, and unlike in Minecraft, where there's always something else to do even in Vanilla, this game has neither aspect. Although it does have an interesting storyline for a non-storyline-based game, the characters are rather cliche and boring, it's extremely child-friendly with none of the tension or emotions of Telltale's previous successes and they have ruined the greates (in my opinion) enemy a sandbox game has ever seen (More later).\n\nI'll start on the animation. Although this game is based off of something with no communication or cutscene programming whatsoever, this game is probably better off to keep it that way. The animations seem too cartoony for a supposedly dramatic storyline and it ruins the atmosphere. The mouths ingame are too simplistic and are more like something you would find in a very old, very amateur, Windows '95 era game with only different mouth shapes for each sound.\n\nSecondly, the characters. [Spoiler Alert] You have the cliche main character=leader, brutish-looking guy is intimidating but a bit dim and actually soft on the inside, the girl is intelligent and usually/always knows the best thing to do (even if everyone ignores her), the badass side character who comes in to save the day and becomes a main character, and the bully who learns his lesson and makes friends with the main character. This makes them very predictable and extremely boring.\n\nThirdly, the villain/enemy/boss, whatever you want to call it. [Spoiler Alert] The Wither is supposed to be an extremely powerful, 3-headed, flying creature, which I grant, it is. It does NOT, however, consume anything to evolve and grow. The Wither Telltale have given us here, to put simply, looks ridiculous. Just the look of it ruins the whole idea of it in actual Minecraft. It looks silly, and overdone, and nothing like the Wither at all. It does not have tentacles that reach out and grab people and blocks, it is supposed to throw a toxic-like ball at the people of Minecraftia with the destruction of blocks being collateral damage. This monstrosity (the bad context) is an insult to the Wither I, and maybe we, have come to know and fear.\n\nAll in all, this game had huge potential and I was extremely excited to see what they would do, and hugely disappointed. The game is the worst it could have been, with all the negative aspects of each Telltale and Minecraft, not the greatness within each. I shall complete it, but only because I don't like leaving anything unfinished, even this, and, as said, the storyline is, albeit only just, decent.\n\n\nThanks for reading.

This is a whole different kind of game.\nBut is it bad?\n\nShort answer: No, definitely not.\n\nYou might not be familiar with TellTale games. If that's the case, then allow me to briefly explain what you can expect here. Like the name suggests, this game tells a tale. It is as if you're watching a movie, but with you as the main character. You're watching, meaning for the majority of the time, you're sitting back and watching the story unfold. But at the same time, you're the main character. That means you'll be able to talk for the main character, and sometimes play short scenes with him. But that's it. Now if this is your first TellTale game, then this might sound weird, and not very fun.\n\nAlright, if you're familiar with TellTale, then start reading here, because this is where the 'tale' part comes in. In the beginning of the review I told you it's not like Minecraft. Or at least, it doesn't deliver an experience you might expect from a Minecraft game. Like I said, there's no building. No surviving. No exploring... But there's a tale. As this game's title suggests, it's a 'Story Mode'. A tale in the Minecraft universe. And believe me when I say, the tale is great. Sure, it's not for everyone, but as someone who has played lots of Minecraft in the past, I can say it really fits in the game's universe, and the story itself is also really well made. I'm being careful not to spoil anything here though, so I'll have to stop there.\n\nIf you need a more detailed review on the story itself, then check out other reviews on this game. My goal was to "warn" you that this game might not be what you think it is.","October 13, 2015","true","10.0"," 565 of 1,049 people (54%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","54","565","1","38","27"

The reason I say that is because I am not a massive Minecraft enthusiast nor am I someone that dislikes the game. I'm just an individual who loves playing games and reviewing them, if the games good i'll like it but if it is not I won't. Therefore my stance is completely unbiased going into this game. This is also my first experience with TellTale which is rather new for me. I will update my post when every new episode comes out.\n\nEPISODE 1:\nThe game surprised me with its focus that was primarily on voice actors and cutscenes, Both of which were absolutely outstanding. The voice acting cast for this game was talented and the effort put into every line of dialogue was full of impact. Cut scenes were graphically impressive and held a consistent frame rate, I found the lack of gameplay to be surprising though. The gameplay was most comparable to The Order:1886, sometimes it only took for you to walk from one end of a hall way to another to finish your section and then proceed to watch another 5-10 minutes of cutscenes.\n\nThe game is mostly a point and click adventure with a bit of walking, making choices and clicking on things is all you do for the most part. The choice making is very much like Until Dawn in that what you say will effect the people around you and what you do will possibly change the whole scenario for the worse. This was incredibly effective and one of the first games ive ever played where I felt my choices actually mattered compared to games like Life Is Strange or Until Dawn where sometimes you would tell the charector to do one thing and then they'd end up doing the other anyway.\n\nOverall as a game that played out as more of a rather interactive movie rather than a video game it was quite good. If you just want to sit back and enjoy yourself this is worth your money BUT I must address the one major con to the game that goes out of it's way to beat you over the head which was the button mashing (quick time events). The placing for quick time events were frequent but incredibly awkward which sometimes lead you to cheap deaths.\n\nInstead of hitting, collecting and creating houses and forts to live in you just bashed the "Q" button and watched the players do it themselves which was a real head scratcher concidering the franchise. I almost feel that the term "Minecraft: Story Mode" was not appropriate for this game, just because it would have been better off as a spin off game (and gotten way much less hate)\n\nConclusion: Effective choices, Fun and graphically impressive cutscenes, a compelling story, AMAZING voice actors but absolutely awful choices were made in regards to quick time events and taking the core element of the original games gameplay entirely out of this experience.\n\nEpisode 2:\n\nI've been reluctant to continue doing these reviews because an obnoxious young minority who haven't even played the game have been very persistant in knocking down anything good said about this title because it is seemingly different to what they expected. I am doing them though so people don't get misinformed.\n\nThis episode homed right in on character development and also introduced a few new notable plot points but overall didnt progress the story as much as it could've. Once again the game runs beautifully and the voice acting is outstanding. This game reeled in some of the best voice actors in the industry and the pay off was brilliant. Props going mostly to the voice of Petra. Petra has one of the most unique and well fitted voices I've seen in a long time.\n\nBesides the again suprisingly thorough choices and consequences aswell as bright, impressive visuals, this episode didn''t have as much to offer. Combat and interaction with the WASD keys were less frequent and there was alot of watching going on. This would have been more okay if the episode wasn't so alarmingly and quickly cut off (it was very short).\n\nThe times that you were constructing or in combat were really fun and I had a blast going through quick time events or hitting enemies when the time came around, but the game did a good job of leaving you wanting more.\n\nOverall: This episode wasn't great but it certaintly wasn't bad. A short and quick run through some fresh ideas aswell as running/playing smoothly in the process.\n\nEpisode 3:\nWow, the devs certainly listened to the only lukewarm reviews for the second episode. The sophomore ep was not bad but it was a little short and the interact ability was way less frequent than in the previous episode. This episode is by far the best out of the three, being the most juicy, most exiting, most interactable and most enticing of all.\n\nThe pacing and story was executed far better than the previous 2 episodes and most episodes from any episodic game. Being longer than the second episode and just the right size, Episode 3 was capable of establishing a GREAT opening sequence, character development (LOTS OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT :D), a solid climax, an unexpected plot twist and a satisfying yet nail biting ending. It ends on a cliffhanger .\n\nEvery already introduced character had their chance at one point or another to teach you as a player a large amount about them. Their intentions, the way they think and what there is to know about them. The game left more scenarios where you could just talk to the characters not for plot progession but just for a little more insight on the individual. This made the game feel far more real and made you want to do something to help these people because you care about them. The dialogue was written exceptionally well ( more so than previous episodes ) having the characters react the way an actual person would given the situation.\n\nThe gameplay was great also, the actual gameplay has been the only seriously problematic weak link of the "Minecraft: Story Mode". Luckily, this issue has been fixed with this episode was exiting to play more so than a lot of other games I have even played this year. Using the mechanics they have established since episode 1 and using them in such an effective manner you may even want to play this episode twice in one sitting.\n\nThe story was INCREDIBLE. What they have created within this Minecraft world and what they have implemented that was already existing from the Minecraft world is mind boggling. The plot went upwards 150% in this episodes and you feel like you got every cent of your moneys worth for 5 episodes in this 1 episode alone. The only irritating part about the story is that they spent a little too long focusing on the Enderman and that broke the pacing/exitment a little as it wasn't very interesting. Oh, and again I will stress HOW AWESOME THE VOICE ACTING IS OMAGERSH IT IS AWESOME.\n\nOverall: If you were on the fence about buying this game THIS should completely intrigue you into getting it. This was amazing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode 4:\n(To be released)\n\nEpisode 5:\n(To be released)","October 15, 2015","true","5.5"," 366 of 683 people (54%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","54","366","683","45","20"

Barring the fact that I had a blue-screen mid stream (Crashes happen, although while streaming they are very painful).\n\n** Issue #1 ** Significantly too short.  I finished the episode in 1:30.  That includes the time it took me to crash, restart, load up my stream, and resume playing and replay through from my last auto-save...  If the remaining episodes will be included free as part of the $22 I spent on this, then it may be worth the price, but having to wait to play a game in full when I was under the impression that it was a full game, not an "early release"...\n\n** Issue #2 **  Not NEARLY enough time to make choices.  I sometimes clicked at the last second and it didn't register, or spent 2 seconds looking at chat to look back and realize I missed a decision point.  I guess the game is so short I can do it over...\n\n** Issue #3 ** Besides dialogue, there was no other choice.  In fact, the "challenges" were button-mashing (PRESS Q A BUNCH OF TIMES REALLY FAST) or the occasional "DDR-Lite" where you have to press A, S, D, or W to avoid an attack.  At best it was an interactive cut-scene where I occasionally did button mashing.  Far cry from being able to freely build whatever I want in minecraft...\n\n** Issue #4 ** I mis-clicked on character creation.  I couldn't go back, I couldn't undo, I was stuck with the character I selected.  I even tried the "go back a menu" and it wouldn't let me go back.  SO, when picking a character MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE ONE YOU WANT.\n\n** What I actually Liked ** I didn't hate the experience, just had lots of issues.  The story was "OK" although the story tries to carve you out as a weak and uncool kid, which makes all the "I'm awesome and kickass" dialogue options seem extremely out of place (even though I chose them, because I'm awesome and kickass).  I DID want to continue playing.  When the credits rolled I was left with two feelings: "HOLY CRAP IT'S OVER, WTF, THIS WAS JUST BARELY AN HOUR" and "WHY IS THE NEXT EPISODE HERE"  But for $22 I could have bought an entire TV season of Doctor Who and had 12+ hours of entertainment, whereas I got 1 1/2 hours of entertainment here and a sore finger (from mashing the Q button, BTW - Telltale, you owe me a new Q button).\n\nOverall - I'd say DO NOT BUY until all the episodes are out.  Unless you like playing the same game over and over and over, because thats the only way you'll get value out of this.","October 14, 2015","false","2.3"," 156 of 289 people (54%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","54","156","289","11","4"

And this is the first time I've met with a Telltale product. I did not know what to expect but I could see good potential in the concept. Unfortunately it became a terrible disappointment pretty much from the first minute.\n\nThe plots are stupid, the conversations are boring. Overall the complexity of the story can make anyone above the age of 10 do self-harm after a couple of minutes. The whole flow of the game (interactive movie?) is painfully slow.\n\nOn the rare occasions when your character gets some freedom to act and not just talk crap you realise that the controls are horrible and the world is very linear. Otherwise it's just all talking and selecting your response in a timely manner. The later kills whatever immersion you may (not) have as you need to focus on picking your answer before the time is up, while the others are still talking. Speaking of which, dialog choices detemine the storyline and add dynamism to the gameplay. I can see how that could work, pity I can't force myself to replay the choices just to get a slightly different dumb version of the dialogs.\n\nNot sure what's the intention with this product. It's not a good game as there's pretty much nothing to do in it. Action scenes require the pressing/smashing of one of the 5 control keys within given time. Not that too much action would be required, it's more about not missing those random moments - which again breaks immersion. Fights look awkward and unrealistic even in the standards of Minecraft.\n\nIt's not a good movie cause the lack of real plots and twists, at least ones that would get the attention of a 5th-grader or higher. Dialogs are poor and cheesy and everything's happening very slow. Could be al-right for kids, but the age range who could enjoy it the most may require parental guidance during some scenes.\n\nIt does not have stunning visuals... hey, it's Minecraft at its basics after all. And it does not have stunning acting either...\n\nOverall it's some good money wasted with regrets in hindsight.","October 13, 2015","false","3.1"," 165 of 307 people (54%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","54","165","307","10","0"

I need to wind down. Minecraft: Story Mode was the perfect game to fill this niche. Conjuring a story for a game that is known for not having one can be a tall order, but with the framework that was given. Telltale really pulled out the begining of what seems to be a very charming narrative. I know guys don't crucify me, charming is a buzzword used often. But this game is it CHARMING, in all caps!\n\nPros: -Visuals are great, makes Mincraft feel soulful.\n-Some of the best voice acting you will come across in a game. Paton Oswalts performance as Jesse is special.\n-CHARMING(IKR) Narrative\n-End choice will greatly affect episode 2's direction.\n-Crafting things you are not supposed to make.\n-Rueben is my best friend.\n\nCons:-Puzzles are non-exsistent.\n\nClosing Statements:\nMinecraft: Story Mode is not a perfect game nor is it flawed. For what it tries to do it does it well. A nice blend of family friendly humor with all of the Telltale decision making. With a Disney esque coming of age story also at play. As it stands, considering how these episodic games can change, I highly recommend this game to everyone who is looking for a heart warming tale of friendship and growing up while maintaining the Telltale spirit.\n\n★░░░░░░░░░░░████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░███░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░██░░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░██░░░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░██░░░███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░░██░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░███████░░░░░░░██░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░█████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░███░██░░░░░░★ ★░░░██░░░░░████░░░░░░░░░░██████░░░░░★ ★░░░██░░████░░███░░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░██░░░░░░░░███░░░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░░██████████░███░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░░██░░░░░░░░████░░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░░███████████░░██░░░░░░░░░░██░░░░★ ★░░░░░░██░░░░░░░████░░░░░██████░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░██████████░██░░░░███░██░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░██░░░░░████░███░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░█████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░★ ★░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░★","December 3, 2015","true","4.9"," 253 of 474 people (53%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","53","253","474","63","21"

More often than not, you'll find yourself faced with quicktime events that offer little to no consequences for failure, dialogue options which offer no impact on the game itself, and, sometimes, choices which at the time seem like they'll influence the game reasonably only to find out the option you didn't choose gets resolved some way or another outside of your experience.\n\nYet all of this could be acceptable as a part of a game that at least offers an interesting story as the concept of Telltale Games is to have to experience a story which you can hopefully be at least mildly invested in. This fails in a herculean fashion. Characters are presented as important and deep when in reality, they are injected suddenly and unemotionally into the story while the plot itself is generic and often lazily progressed. This means that whenever you're faced with Telltale's trademark "important decision" moments, you really don't have much to go off of emotionally making the choice meaningless and easy.\n\nEven as a children's game, this fails across the board for ham-fisted attempts at sudden and awkward humour, lack of any interesting story or character development, and an overall absence of the emotional investment present in...some...of Telltale's other games, for even games for children can still retain objective elements of entertainment. Believe me, you can find somewhere else to put your money into.","December 8, 2015","false","5.6"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","24","41","0","0"

With its unique storyline and damn good graphics, it's sure to entertain you... for a week. Being a Telltale Games point-and-click style of gameplay only takes you a certain length because there's only 5 or more chapters. It's true that every story has to end, but being a numero uno popularo on the App Store always has a lot of players asking for more. Mojang and Telltale should really think of adding more episodes after the additional three, otherwise that'll suck, and they should probably stop thinking of charging more for every 3 new episodes. Seriously, that kinda sounds like they're ripping people off, because they sell the first five episodes for around 15 bucks and the next three for around 12?!?!Anyways, it's still a good game.","May 9","true","7.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","4"

The reason I have a slight disliking for this game is because it doesn't truly represent Minecraft. Although it contains some staples of Minecraft such as mobs, landscape, and the nether/end, the story doesn't truly relate to Minecraft. When I think of a Minecraft story mode, I'd immediately think of an explanation to the actual game, not some random plot associated to the game for no reason. I'd have much more respect for this game if it wasn't tied to Minecraft since I did enjoy the story itself and the characters. As for the gameplay, the controls and camera angles weren't the best as they were very clunky and stiff. Sometimes there isn't enough time to read the options of what you can say in response to characters when they are talking either. Plus, there were many noticeable glitches throughout the game. Overall, the game itself was fine but I can't say it's a good game since it is supposed to resemble Minecraft but does an extremely poor job doing so. This game seems like Telltale's way of advertising their story by using a popular name such as Minecraft to market their game and trick people to buying what they would think is an add-on to Minecraft. If you're looking for a fun little game to play on a boring day, this game is for you. If you're a Minecraft fan, I don't recommend you play this game since it's not what it is claiming to be.","February 20","false","6.9"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","2"

That's not really a problem though, since I guess that kind of story is expected out of a Minecraft game since it's kind of marketed towards kids these days. What is a problem though is the way the story is set up. Now I'm going to spoiler it up because people get salty about these things or whatever, but it doesn't really anything from the story -  Basically you have 4 episodes of the main story and then you have the 5th which is obviously a part of a different story which were announced to be episodes 6-8 on the release of said 5th episode.. Basically they sold an incomplete product as you would expect to get the full game experience WHEN YOU PAID THE FULL PRICE OF THE GAME. Also the story is very inconsistent. Like the guy you are supposed to hate suddenly becoming your best friend for no apparent reason inconsistent.\n\nOther than that everything's as you would expect from a telltale game - essentially a FMV (movie) style game with QTEs thrown in where the story is effectively defined by your choices. Sadly in this one your choices don't really culminate much in anything, as no matter what you choose the outcome will be the same (with very minor differences that don't really matter at all). If previous Telltale games culminated with your choices playing a part in the ending, in this one the choices just kinda happens and no long matter 5-10 minutes after the choice's been made (I suppose sometimes some insignificant dialogue changes in the next episode or something).\n\nAnd when playing do disable telltale's cloud saving. It has a tendency of losing save data and then syncing your old saves from before-previous session over your saves causing lost progress.","May 6","false","14.2"," 34 of 63 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","34","63","4","0"

This is my first interest in a game from this studio and I'm thuroughly un-impressed over all. This is honestly the first game I have ever found so terrible that I have asked for a refund on. The story is incredibly corny and you can play though it in just over an hour. At the current price, it is completely un-acceptable. The game looked beautiful but that does not make up for a 20.00+ price tag on a game that can be completed in under 2 hours and no side stuff to do to allow you to even extend this game. Do not get this game unless you want to watch a childrens movie and only progress by pushing buttons every once in a while. Esentially, its a game that forces you to pay attention to continue.

When you tell a story in a game your game can become linear, a way to counteract this is to add things along your journey such as secrets and minigames which make the game more enjoyable. Telltale completly left out everything non-linear and because of this I rate this game:\n\n3/5 for story\n0/5 for gameplay\n1/5 for graphics\n\nDon't get me wrong the idea is good, many games have succeeded using movie aspects to build a great game but the execution of actual gameplay must be present, and Telltale games failed to provide even a sliver of imersion into the game.","October 14, 2015","false","1.7"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","22","41","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greenpebble/recommended/376870/","greenpebble","TILEY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greenpebble/","77 products in account","NB: This review is for episodes 1-5, as currently episodes 6-8 have been announced as purchasable DLC #ElectronicArts\n\nMinecraft Story Mode is TellTale's latest episodic adventure in which we play as a young aspiring hero named Jesse, accompanied by a group of friends, who's mission is to reunite the long-lost Order of the Stone to help save the World. Without spoiling anything or revealing too much, the adventure takes them to various wonderous and dangerous places in order to find the lost members of the Order and defeat an evil entity. This is concluded by the end of episode 4 which felt short lived, and episode 5 is the first chapter of a new adventure for our heroes which will be continued in the DLC (sneaky plans TellTale). I was extremely excited for this game as I am a huge TellTale and Minecraft fan, but sadly I was left dissapointed. While the story was fairly well written the subtitles were not, there were even stages where the subtitles said something completely out of context while the characters were speaking. There are also some story blunders, the worst being when a character who had repeatedly caused trouble for the group returns in secret to speak to Jesse, once accepted by Jesse he is brought to the group but they all seem to have forgotten what he has done and accept him without questions or an apology. The story falters at other stages too especially in the choices: there was always a choice A and a choice B but then also a choice C which was practically choice A and B combined, and the obvious best choice. This is just plain lazy and not what should be expected and accpeted from TellTale. Their games are supposed to make me value my choices and think clearly before I decide, Minecraft Story Mode failed at this.\n\nPros:\n- It's Minecraft, I'm a nerd\n- There are various customisation options throughtout the game making you feel more involved\n- The lanscapes and buildings are beautifully done (in Minecraft standards obviously)\n- Endings are somehwhat suspensful\n- Episode 5 did have some redeeming features\n- I was kind of sad at certain stages, TellTale usually leaves me in a state of depression though (therefore also a Con)\n\nCons:\n- Music becomes repetitive and annoying\n- Graphical glitches that are easy to notice and fix\n- Subtitle inconsistency\n- Story blunders in relation to characters\n- Choices have a minimum impact\n- Low standard compared to previous TellTale titles\n- Some sections of dialogue and story felt utterly meaningless\n- Episode 5 was the intro to the DLC. This means that Minecraft Story mode was technically only 4 episodes long and episode 5 was just there to get us to buy the DLC\n\nGameplay - 6/10\nImmersion - 6/10\nGraphics - 6/10\n\nOverall rating - 6/10\n\nP.S. The reason this review is negative is because it does not live up to the usual quality of a TellTale game. I was highly dissapointed in it as it felt like nothing more than a rushed source of income paid out from Microsoft. Perhaps they will fix their mistakes in the DLC. Buy it if you want to but be warned if you are expecting a TellTale game, it's not.","April 3","false","10.8"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","5"

I absolutely loved this game. It was my first telltale game ever, and I was quite a fan of minecraft.

Technically there could have been 20% more story, but now we got a lure/bait to buy the dlc.\nI explained my feelings in regards to this sudden move in a video on my channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Snwb_EQrpwM\n\nI bought the game, expecting a full story that would last 5 episodes. Not a story that might have been cut by 20%, only to make place for a DLC bait set-up. Sure... episode 6 seems like a good start to a new chapter of the story, but I didnt pay for it. All my feelings are explained in the video. Everyone is free to agree or disagree with it, and that is fine, but I absolutely feel, that with the arrival of the adventure pass, I was scammed.\n\nFor that reason... I would NOT recommend this game.\n\nIf something changes, maybe a refund worth of at least 1 episode for those who bought the game before this dlc (episode number 5) plus a change to the store page to indicate the story is only 4 episodes long... I might change my stance. But until that happens... NOT RECOMMENDED.","June 6","false","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is hard to come by a negative review which is not based on how "the plot is stupid and has barely anything to do with MC." Seriouslly? I agree that the plot is random, but what else could TellTale do? Minecraft is not a story game! There is no plot in minecraft other than survival (which would make a bad Story Mode) or random building in creative. If Minecraft Story Mode was actually base entirely on the gameplay of Minecraft? That would be boring, would not Tell a Tale at the most part, and geniunly could be done better in the ACTUAL GAME.\n\nAnother "problem" is the mechanics of the game. I have no comment. Honestly, the mechanics of this game compared to minecraft? I'll make a table.\n\nBlockMC SMMinecraftSlimeRepeating JumpLimited JumpingPistonExtends FarExtends 1B.\nYep, I don't think they are realistic either. So what! The main reason I recommend this game because I don't think of the plot, mechanics, and options, but rather the gameplay and how fun it is.

This is not true; the base game contains two finished story arcs, and opens the Minecraft universe up for future self-contained story arcs through purchasable DLC.\n\nWhilst the base game in my opinion, in places, is not as good as other games that use the Telltale Tool (game engine), overall it is stellar.

How could you use such a sneaky business tactic on your dedicated fans? I will support Telltale games no matter what but i will not support them using this kind of cheap "leech off of fans" tactic that they're using right now, especially if theyre planning on using it for they're upcoming games.

Wolf umong us was better made then this (played the android version)\n\nIf you are new to minecraft then it might even be fun but not for long. The story itself starts off weak.\nAlso for some reason the mouse does not always work then using keyboard to move the char. Just locks for a second (usualy when you need to react fast to point and click.\n\nUpdate:After finishing the game twice there was almost no change to the outcome with the choices i made. I am however hoping that the choices you make will effect the outcome further in the game (episode 3  and up).\nI realy liked wolf umong us and how the choices you took realy effect the game but with this game it looks like the devs have focused on younger people and they dont want to traumatize kids. Like if the butcher would have turned Reuben in to bacon if you would have not done anything ? or the creepers on the bridge would have blown you up if you attacked ? Get eaten by the ender monster if you tried to stay ? etc etc.\n\nI realy hope that the next episode turn the game around or at least the story mode will be a story mode and not a linear one with no consequences to bad choices you make.\nUntil then my opinion on the game will stay as it is.","October 13, 2015","false","12.1"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","25","49","0","0"

The end result is just awkward. You have a hard time taking the story seriously because you don't feel the tension while surrounded by the fun environment. At the same time you can't get into the the light-hearted parts (like the want for adventure, or the little silly bits) because the story is always trying to inject drama (fighting between teammates, and the fact that hundreds of "people" are dying). There are many other problems too, like the quick time events, the controls, and the flat characters.\n\nIf you were hoping this game was going to give you some awesome lore to go with an awesome game like minecraft well don't get your hopes up.

Now, here is my review.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe game is based off the overwhelmingly popular sandbox game Minecraft created by Mojang in 2009, but I think you've guessed that by now! Minecraft has no pre-made story (you make your own) apart from travelling through a mystical portal to enter a spit of sand in space called the End. Inhabiting the End is a huge Ender Dragon that you have to kill to reach the credits scene. Telltale managed to take the story of this dragon and create a story that spanned over 4 episodes.\n\nMany many years ago, a legendary group called The Order of the Stone journeyed across the Overworld, embarking on amazing quests. The Order was made up of Gabriel the Warrior, Ellegaard the Engineer, Magnus the Rogue and Soren the Architect and the leader. In their final and most famous quest, they ventured into the End and slayed the Ender Dragon. History turned to legend, legend turned to myth, and the members of the Order disappeared into the shadows.\n\nBut one stayed in the spotlight - Gabriel the Warrior. Now, you (Jesse, either male or female) and your friends Axel and Olivia, along with your pet pig Reuben, are off to visit Endercon, where Gabriel is said to be the special guest.\n\nHowever, disaster strikes, and you and your companions must reunite the Order so that they can save the world by destroying the terrifying Wither Storm that threatens their very exsistence...\n\nThe Wither Storm story is set in 4 episodes:\n\nEpisode 1: The Order of the Stone\nEpisode 2: Assembly Required\nEpisode 3: The Last Place You Look\nEpisode 4: A Block and a Hard Place\n\nIn Episode 5, the story stands completely alone, as a sort of demo episode for the Adventure Pass, the DLC that includes Episodes 6-8. It's the same size as the other episodes, but it does feel a little weird because it's seperate from the other arc. In Episode 5: Order Up, the group travels to a strange new land via a magic portal. Order Up is the start of the new story arc (Episodes 5-8). Lots of people seem to be angry about the new DLC, saying that they believed they were buying a full season, not half. They have their season, but from my view Story Mode will never have a Season 2, because it will just keep expanding with new DLC episodes (a new story arc for every addon). If anyone post Episode 8 wants a review of the DLC (which I've already bought) I will be putting that in a seperate review on the store page for the Adventure Pass.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay is like the many other Telltale games. You'll be choosing from four dialog options, and you'll have a short amount of time to choose how you react. Story Mode is a Point and Click game, where you'll have to solve puzzles. There's also a ton of Quick Time Events, and the decisions that you'll make will affect the story. Some decisions are small, and affect the next chapter, or the rest of the episode, but some span across whole episodes (one choice in Episode 1 creates a determinant character for Episode 2 and 3).\n\nREPLAYABLITY\n\nThe choices you'll make will open up at least 2 different playthroughs, and if you want to choose every dialog option you'll have to do 4 playthroughs. To do Episode 5 in each suit of armour you would need to do 10 playthroughs. It would also take 6 playthroughs to play as all the different versions of Jesse, as there are three male (white skinned, olive skinned, dark skinned) and three female (white skinned, olive skinned, dark skinned). I am about 3/4 through my second playthrough of Story Mode Episodes 1-5 with olive skinned male Jesse and in my next playthrough I'll be playing as the dark skinned female Jesse so I can see how the voice actor for Female Jesse plays the character.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are the same as Minecraft, but they are more 3-D. They ran alright on max settings on my ancient computer, apart from in some action sequences. On a good computer, there should be absolutely no worries about lag.\n\nOTHER\n\nI think the PEGI 12 rating for Story Mode is a bit much. It says a few mild swears like c**p, but that is pretty much it. I let my two cousins (they are 7 and 9) play this on my computer where they decided what to say/do as a team. They'd heard it all before, and I'm sure that people about 8+ would be fine to play this.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThis game is very fun, with some good acting, and the episodes are quite long. I think it's a good game to give younger kids a taste of 'Choice Matter' gameplay, as I haven't heard of many games like that for kids. They are missing out! It's still good for people that like Telltale or Minecraft too. If you like either Telltale or Minecraft, give this a try!\n\n1) Essential Purchase\n2)Recommended Purchase 3)Recommended during a sale\n4)Not recommended unless heavily discounted\n5)Not recommended even for hardcore Steam gamers","June 2","true","17.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Absolutely fantastic, but it needed character development. The farthest I could tell is that the extras, such as your friends, were lightly characterized and did not play a big part in the story. Secondly, the "they will remember that" is not specific. How are kids supposed to understand if "they will remember that" is a good thing or a bad thing. Make it more specific, for example: "They will remember how horribly you treated them." I think that it is  not worth it for $24.99 if you only get one chapter right now. Buy it once more chapters are released.  As I am a redstoner in Minecraft, I really wanted to do the second chapter and see all of the cool machines I know TTG would make, but I was disappointed when it was just the first chapter.","October 23, 2015","false","4.3"," 70 of 141 people (50%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","50","70","141","10","8"

Not just because it was Minecraft, but because it was going to have a huge audience. Yes, I am a Minecraft player, and yes, there are a few bits of it that bug me when it comes to the Minecraft content, but that's not why I gave it a thumbs down.\n\nI understand first episodes are going to be slow, and work as essentially the tutorial. However, as of this moment it feels like I'm watching a Slamacow animation and not actually playing a game. It feels like a storybook, not a game. Now I haven't played their other Walking Dead game (not my cup of tea, i'll stick to the comics), so maybe this is their style, However the way it was presented in multiple articles on multiple websites was a bit misleading.\n\nTo be honest, I expected a sort of... Life Is Strange feel. Open areas that you can explore with a few little secrets that can be tracked or just be there for fun. Instead it's a webcomic that we're making the speech options for the characters.\n\nIf the coming episodes change this (as I stated prior, maybe this is just the "tutorial" episode to get the plot rolling and you get a hang of the controls), then I'll definitely modify the review to fit it. If not, then my point stands.","October 24, 2015","false","87.1"," 60 of 121 people (50%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","50","60","121","10","2"

It's the moderate/good experience it is either because Telltale tried to add a few good elements but didn't bother to refine them, or because they limitted it with the intent of not overwhelming younger players.\n\nHonestly, you know how Minecraft is about making up your own stories, (almost) failing, and trying to get better at it? That's what this feels like, and so the unimpressiveness is nice because of its familiarity. However, with all the potential Minecraft itself has, it deserves an actually mindblowing, highly interactive, rich and deep experience (which you definitely don't find in this story mode). Hopefully, that too will come along one day.\n\nPros\n+ Lots of Minecraft lore and some humerous critiquing of it\n+ Some interesting builds to explore\n+ Branching story to make your decisions as the player count\n+ You get to choose how to respond to the more unusual of developments\n+ Feels like the Minecraft adventures you might go on with your friends (without the unnecessary delays obviously)\n+ Adequate/good voice acting\n+ Explores various emotional situations although without much depth\n\nCons\n- No open-world stuff; just Interactive cutscenes or small maps to roam around in. Big disappointment.\n- Characters aren't that deep.\n- The lip-syncing - or whatever you might call it - gets annoying.\n- The plot, although not so predictable and free of many loose ends, doesn't get quite thick.\n\n\nVerdict: Give this game a chance, especially if you like Minecraft, but don't expect too much from it.","January 6","true","8.4"," 24 of 49 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","24","49","0","3"

It's not a sequel or even a sandbox. What is has to do with minecraft is its universe and its story telling ability.\n\nI don't know if you are a guy whos strictly done survival, creative, minigames or adventure maps but this game is sort of like an adventure map, maybe with a little less interaction than a sandbox game offers, however, it focuses a lot more on the story. The most interaction takes place in driving the story. Based on the difference in choices, some one else could be playing maybe an entirely different game XD\n\nIf you do get the game, don't expect a mindblowing story with some crazy heavy morals to learn at the end or something. It isn't terrible but i mean, like animated movies you'd go to see in a theatre, everyone should be able to enjoy it, including young children.\n\nSo basically, if your interested in a interactive movie type game taking place in the world of minecraft, i suppose it's worth a shot.\n\nI've never played a telltale game or any game like this before. I just knew it was minecraft. I tried it and i'm pretty satisfied with what the game has shown me so far.","October 27, 2015","true","19.9"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082694519/recommended/376870/","76561198082694519","Bulborb","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082694519/","35 products in account","Minecraft is a game about creativity. Most people who have played this game aren't familiar with Telltale, as they are more known for making mature games. Most people who see this game would think "OOOH! MINECRAFT 2!", but no. This game has almost no relation to the original Minecraft.\n\nIn this game, you play as a character named Jesse, who you can customize (Skin colour, gender). You interact with the environment to collect items, talk to NPCs, and solve puzzles. There are even elements from the original Minecraft, such as crafting and combat. The game follows Telltale's episodic formula, including quick-time events.\n\nMinecraft: Story Mode is a fantastic mixture of a game as creative as Minecraft and Telltale's episodic narritive format. The truth is, the game is not for everyone, if they were expecting the game to be like Minecraft. But if I could recommend any game for people to at least TRY, it's this one. So go ahead, give it a try. I'm sure you'll love it.\n\nI will be reviewing each episode individually. I will try to avoid spoilers, so read on if you want to learn more about the game.\n\nEpisode 1: The Order Of The Stone\nRelease Date: October 13, 2015\n\nMinecraft: Story Mode's debut episode is a joy to play. I remember first picking it up and having the time of my life. This episode is easily the tamest in the series, before the following episodes pick up the intensity. The first episode serves as more of a prologue to the series than anything else, and it truly does not disappoint. The episode is about Jesse and his friends going to EnderCon, an anual event about all things Minecraft, to meet Gabriel the Warrior, one of the four members of the Order Of The Stone. The Order once slew an Ender Dragon, becoming heroes and legends. However, when Jesse and his friends arrive at Endercon, they realize something bigger is going on, and terror and chaos is unleashed, and Jesse and his friends must seek out the Order of the Stone to save the world.\nThe episode is rather charming in terms of its gameplay. I remember finding the humor in the game very entertaining. One part in particular has you crafting a stone sword, but you can be a rebel and instead craft a level, leading your friend to tease you for being a noob. My favourite chapter has to be the EnderCon chapter, because it ramps up the suspense slowly, but builds up the excitement as well.\nAll in all, I'd say Episode 1: The Order Of The Stone was my second favourite. Not just because of the originality and the story or even the characters, but because of just how much it makes me want to replay it, to live through those moments I love. For the first episode, it does a pretty great job of getting me hooked.\n\nEpisode 2: Assembly Required\nRelease Date: October 27, 2015\n\nIt is generally considered that Assembly Required is the weakest episode in the series. It certainly has a good plot line, but the fact that the episode clocks in at only about an hour in legnth is not very impressive. This does not stop my from enjoying the episode, though.\nI wouldn't dare spoil this for you, but the choice that you made at the end of episode one completely affects the story of episode two. You see, Assembly Required branches off into two different stories: one where you go to Boom Town, which is a city full of griefers, and the other where you go to Redstonia, which is a town filled with Redstone Engineers. At the 30-minute mark, though, the two different paths converge and from there the story continues normally. I thought that this was a rather clever idea, and I must say I enjoyed all of the litlle nods to things like griefing and redstoning.\nAssembly Required is short, yet fun. I still believe it is the weakest in the series, but I still enjoy it a lot.\n\nEpisode 3: The Last Place You Look\nRelease Date: November 24, 2015\n\nAt the episode that I consider the climax, things start to become a bit more emotional, intense, and even a bit disturbing in some cases. Episode 3 revovles around Jesse and his friends having to find the last remaining member of the Order of the Stone, who is currently living in the End. If people thought that the first 2 episodes didn't have a good story, I guarantee that you will think that story gets better.\nWhen I said that it starts to get a bit disturbing, I was mostly talking about the Endermen that live in the End. While in regular Minecraft, these creatures are simply there to steal blocks and stand around, Story Mode really made me feel uncomfortable around these guys. There are moments where Endermen loom right in your face. There are moments where an Enderman jumpscares you. Sometimes, Endermen make unsettling sounds and movements. If a younger child is playing Episode 3, they might want to be accompanied by a parent. I can't guarantee that people will NOT find it too scary, but I do think that Episode 3 is the perfect turning point in the series.\n\nEpisode 4: A Block And A Hard Place\nRelease Date: December 22, 2015\n\nWell, well, well. Here we are. Episode 4. I remember back to the advertisment for this episode, where it exclaimed very sharply, "Are YOU ready to take down the Storm?"  Episode 4 is an emotional joyride, and is easily the best in the series so far.\nWhat makes Episode 4 so good, you ask? Well, for starters, it features a lot of character development. Our characters face hopelessness. As Jesse, it is your job to help your friends, and to lead the group. There were many moments where I felt like I WAS Jesse, because the game does that so well. The episode also has a lot of intensity and twists. The first time I played this episode, I had chills almost the whole way through.\nI wouldn't dare spoil the plot, but I will tell you that it revolves around Jesse and his friends going to the Far Lands (Which is a glitch that used to be in Minecraft, being the "edge" of the world) in order to find something that would be their last hope to saving the world. Not only is it intense, but it is very sad. This episode may leave many people crying. I won't tell you why, but just be prepared for it.\nSo, to sum things up, Episode 4 is really good. Not only is it my favourite episode, but I think that it is one of the best things TellTale has ever made. Holding no regrets there.\n\nEpisode 5: Order Up!\nRelease Date: March 29, 2016\n\nThis episode took them a very long time to make, and with good reason. For the most part, they kept the plot, setting and everything about the episode a secret. In fact, the teaser image for the episode used to just be a sign that read "The Next Episode". Now, we finally got to play it, and it surpassed my expectations so much. The episode really does the whole "Minecraft" thing very well.\nSet months after the end of episode 4, Jesse and his friends have become idolized across the land. The episode throws you right in. In fact, it doesn't even give you a recap! It just starts you off with an action packed adventure. I don't consider this to be episode 5 of Season 1, but instead episode 1 of Season 2. It reminds me a lot of the debut episode of the series, where it just left me wondering what would happen. And in terms of plot, this one is probably the best.\nSomething else that is pretty good to notice is that this one is much more interactive than the others. Instead of having a lot of automated things happen on screen, it makes you do a lot more. Telltale games are known for being much more narrative-driven, but I feel that this episode has just enough gameplay that it made me feel incredibly satisfied. For example, there is a segment where you have to make a decision that will take you through two different paths, similar to episode 2, but each path has different styles of interaction. All in all, I think it was a beautiful episode, and I highly recommend it. This concludes my review of Minecraft: Story Mode. I hope it was helpful for you!","November 26, 2015","true","66.1"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","1"

What it is is a game set in a Minecraft world which is like a game version of a Minecraft Novel version of one of those books where you get to decide what happens in the story by answering multiple choice questions. They don't always give you much time to answer and there is some button mashing involved but it is a lot of fun. It isn't some complex story like Agatha Christie novels. Its just a simple but fun story based on episode 1. The episodic nature of the delivery is a bit of a pain but its still fun & I am glad a bought it.

However I was shocked at how awesome this game was. Coming from a minecraft player since about 2011, It's been my favorite game of all time. Early 2015 when I heard there was going to be another minecraft game, being made by Telltale. I was skeptical, but optimistic. Minecraft is such a huge game with a story that could go in an infiniate number of ways becauase it has no story. After the first Minecon trailer, I was still feeling the same thoughts on the game. But then the trailer for the first episode release, And that's when I wanted the game more than anything. It looked like it's own seperate entity but not in a bad way. This week I finally got to play it. Finally after 4 years of playing the game, I got a story to be the compainion to my favorite game. Initially, my thoughts we're scattered. I was a bit overwhelmed by the stories fast actions. When I finished the first episode. I thought I'd give it an 8/10. However, since then I've went back and played the game. And I was able to play different routes in the game and I was able to let the story sink in more. This is where the game really shines. I think the game could have more gameplay segments. Because there was rarley a time I got to control Jesse for more than 2 minutes. But that's what future episodes are for.\n\nI also expirienced many bugs in the game, however I'm playing on a mac and the playthroughs of people I saw on the internet had none of the bugs I expirience. Nothing game breaking though.\n\nOverall I give Minecraft Story Mode Episode 1 a score of 9/10. - Diffinately worth being In the same universe as my favorite game of all time.","October 19, 2015","true","49.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

This time around though I had to request a refund. The game is simply targeted at a much younger audience. Wait! - don't roll your eyes yet reader, it was obvious since the announcement of Story Mode that TellTale would have to change their usual formula and address the millions (billions?) of kids playing Minecraft. Regardless, I expected a game which all ages could enjoy, something along the lines of 'The Lego Movie'. Story Mode however felt like a saturday morning cartoon. Not a bad one I guess, it probably takes a lot of craft to make something enjoyable to kids. The difference is one is aimed 'solely' at kids whilst the other is not. The developers have no obligation to make a game for me, but considering TellTales 'ouvre' some consumer advice is warranted.\n\nGranted, I played this game for less than an hour, so perhaps Story Mode turns around, but this is my general critique.\n\nEverything in this game is very overt, leaving little room for subtlety. This is exceptionally jarring in the characterizations. You notice it in the voice acting almost immedately. The second one of your sullen companions opens his mouth you know exactely which thrope he falls into (big, heart of gold, shy, etc). Incidentely, I stopped playing at the part where your group has to get past a big bouncer who is inexplicately afraid of chickens. This is shown by him cowering in front of a chicken exclaiming his particular phobia all the whilst the camera pans and shows a towering chicken contraption a meter away in the background (Puzzle time!). Not claiming the Tales of the Borderlands was subtle, but that scene was just inane. I can go one listing all the one-dimensional characters but you can watch the trailer and pretty much figure it out from there.\n\nNow, normally you'd think there would be some humor thrown in to please the more adult adience. That didn't happen. There were plenty of opportunities to lampshade certain aspects of Minecraft. The remaining humor is very safe and kids friendly (e.g. a big person gets stuck in a fence for a bit).\n\nThis wouldn't all be bad if at least the plot went in interesting places. This could still very well be the case, but judging from what I've seen I am not willing to bet 22.99 on it. All the high notes are being foreshadowed pretty heavily.\n\nReturning to the first paragraph, I am not claiming this is a bad game, just not one fans of TellTale can blindlessly purchase. If you must, please keep tabs on the clock so you don't forfeit the chance to refund this.","October 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

It's not as dark and stressful as a normal Telltale game. Definitely more lighthearted, mostly because it's a Minecraft deal, thus is "Supposed" to appeal to the younger crowds.

I can tell that telltale has placed a lot of effort into just like it has with other games. but people "expecting" minecraft story mode to be like a DLC or addon or that the gameplay isn't like what telltale usually makes their game like  and just because of that ,they think it's boring, but ITS NOT, and im surprised even telltale had bothered to make a story out of it. Its hard to make a story out of a game that ALMOST HAD NONE. SO please even though episode 1 might not live up to some of your standards, IT DOSEN'T SUCK, give them time. And also props to them for coming up with a different way to interact instead, they worked hard. Thanks for reading:D\n\nSecond Thing: If you're unsure about this game or how it works, please go and watch some videos about it, the mechanics are different from minecraft ,being a telltale game and all, and it's really heavily story-based it has more dialouge chosing options that effects your relationships and etc. and the gameplay is more about crafting and exploring but hey at least your choices matter right :)\n\nAnd Lastly: EPISODES 2-5 WILL COME OUT IN TIME SO Stop Your Whinning","October 14, 2015","true","16.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The plot isn't ambitious and combat is boring as hell.\n\nBut if you're a Minecraft fan, you'll find yourself an experience crafted with surprising amount of care and love put into it.\nIt is very obvious that the creators of the game spend a lot of time playing it and put effort into understanding it's culture.\nIt's not just obvious jokes like punching wood with your fists. The game will very often nod to less recognizable but still strong and influential concepts you may know from playing survival for a long time.\n\n\nOn a Minecon 2015 panel, Telltale writes claimed while playing you'll meet various types of Minecraft players. It might seem like they're talking about the very obvious stereotypes of Griefer, Builder, Redstoner, Fighter who are the important characters to the story, but if you spend some time exploring the world, you actually find much more diverse\npeople whose interests you might even identify with!\n\n-GAMEPLAY-\n\nWhile the choices in the game don't matter to the main plot at all like in all Telltale games,  this game makes them feel more like actual gameplay.\nYou will find yourself juggling friendships, saving the world and trying not to offend your little piglet.  The game is aware you know exactly how the story is going to end, but lets you choose who you'll take to that happy end. It will test your trust in your friends, the feeling of responsibility vs how much you care about showing someone you appreciate them.\n\nThis is where the game exels at and as long as you are able to enjoy the characters it throws at you, you'll be in for a fun ride.\n\n\nAll in all, this game is a pure fan service story about adventuring with your friends. It does well what it sets out to do, but seems to be fit for a niche demographic.  If you never played Minecraft, don't touch it. If you've been in the community for at least a year, you'll have plenty of fun with it.\n\n\n\n\n","December 12, 2015","true","20.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

And after the first couple of minutes, I really came to love this title.\n\nEvery decision you have to make has a time limit, and you have to weigh it all, because there's always that chance that the decision you're making is truly important.  Some of the decisions must be made in the middle of an action sequence, and I think that's where this game shines: a reflexive action can have consequences, and I'm not used to seeing that play out in games at all.\n\nThe game does a great job of balancing when you can control your character, as well as when quick time events, or other segments when you have very little time to perform an action, pop up.  This meant that I was always engaged in what was going on, and the timed nature of certain elements makes sure the game keeps flowing; if you're one of those people who is used to battling out the consequences of a single action (like me when I'm playing Tactics Ogre) before making a decision, this game forces you to go against that mindset, and keeps you on your toes.\n\nI have to say, the way that the game's areas are planned out is really clever; there's always a general pathway that you take, but it keeps things moving instead of bottlenecking the pace, and really drives the narrative.  The only hiccup I found involved a sequence where you had to pull some levers, and the clicks didn't always select the lever I was clicking on.  Other than this one flaw, I can't think of anything I don't like about the game.\n\nThe first episode delivered a lot of satisfying content, and I was hopelessly attached to the main character's trusty pig companion.  It's elements like the pig, the camaraderie between the main group, and just the general way the characters in the world acted that brought me back to those older movies that made me feel great when I was a kid.  It has that charm, but it's all delivered in a way that both adults and younger audiences alike can thoroughly enjoy.\n\nI haven't played a game this heartwarming or exciting in a long time, and I really can't wait to see what the future has to offer.  If you decide to buy this, I hope you find as much enjoyment out of it as I did.","October 16, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You're not actually building anything, not like in Minecraft: you're listening to a story, and you can wander around a bit and have conversations and they "will remember this" exactly like The Walking Dead or whatever. Just set in Minecraft.\n\nA lot of people seem bothered by this. I guess expectations were not managed. But it's a good story, mostly well-told. But I got it for my kid, and she loved it. She loves Minecraft, and has never played a TTG game before. It brought a new flavor to her favorite damn game and it was hugely fun for her. TTG has an 8 year old fan. And I guess that means I got what I expected out of it.\n\nTwo downers come to mind though. One, said 8 year old was busy getting engrossed in the story and wasn't looking for those quick time events. Really, those damn things should be banned. Two, sitting across the room listening in while working on some office email crap, some of the dialogue seemed really damn dumb. Axel's character in particular had crap writing, but a few of the others were grating as well.\n\nStill, it was as good as expected it to be and it proved great fun for its intended audience.

You have to make decisions that will decide your fate in the end game. This game may get emotional because (spoiler alert) Petra may die. This game will keep you on edge and it has humor even adults would enjoy. Minecraft Story Mode: Episode 1 was and intro to the plot, Witherstorm is about to eradicate all humanity, start to know the characters in the story, and have lots of quick time events. Minecraft Story Mode: Episode 2 focused on finding either 2 members of the Order of the Stone. You either go to Redstonia or Boomtown which each have distinctive features that stick out. You end up at the base of the missing member known as Soren, but an evil member (Ivor) is on his way there. You get there to find out Petra is sick with the Wither. You find Ivor and have a battle with him, you lose and he escapes.\n\nSo far this story has some holes, but hopefully it will be filled in the next episode.\n9/10\nP.S. Rueben is the best character in the entire game","November 3, 2015","true","11.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I see many articles saying how "good" this game is, the truth of it all is that it is not all those things. Telltale made a big mistake doing this based on a game that is literally boring as sh*t (I played it for 5 years, I always felt bored playing). I swear if Telltale do a second series for THIS?! They would have lost their f*cking mind. The characters in this game are so boring that it feels like the writers gave up on the script entirely and made on at last minute. The only decent character is Jesse' Pig Rueben, and guess what? They kill him off in episode 4, spoilers I know, but to be honest this game is god damn awful so it's not even worth playing until the end.\n\nAshurii's Rating: 2/5, in other words 4/10\n\nDo not buy this game, you'll be wasting money like I did","January 15","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was epxecting this to be an actual story mode to minecraft, not a linear scripted indigo prophecy type game with minecraft graphics.  I really was hoping to learn how to better use recipes while building structures to solve puzzles and fight different creatures with normal minecraft controls.  I only finished episode 1, but based on other reviews it doesn't seem to change.  The story is boring, the game stutters frequently, and the controls (when you are actually controlling the characer which is 3% of the time) are clunky and basically are just using wasd from an odd angle, or point and clicking.  Very dissapointed here, this game could have been so much more.  Would love to see an actual minecraft story mode where you started out with basic recipes and built up from there.

It is probably more of a children's game than a dark, gritty tale of darkness and grittiness, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's a bland, overly-heartwarming pile of cute little bunny rabbits and the Power of Friendship. There are dark moments, even the deaths of a major character or two, as well as a couple of jokes only older players are likely to understand.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, more like an interactive film than most games. I should point out that it's not at all like playing Minecraft. You can't freely place and break blocks, nor do much in the way of actual mining and crafting. Occasional quick-time events keep the player on their toes; these are pretty challenging, but you can generally try again if you fail something important.\n\nThe game has plenty of feminism, too; competent women who wear sensible clothes and take an active role in fighting the antagonists are everywhere. Gameplay is completely unaffected by the player character's sex and skin colour.\n\nThat's not to say the game is without flaws. Gameplay sometimes consists of a long string of cutscenes, which, if you prefer a fast-paced action game, will likely bore you to tears. The choices you make don't have that big an effect on how the story pans out; there is definitely some effect, but however you play the game, the same overarching events are guaranteed to happen. Also, way the characters are animated can be a little uncanny.\n\nAll in all, Minecraft: Story Mode is a pretty good story game. It's not necessarily a brilliant, challenging action-adventure game, nor is it Telltale Games' finest work, nor is it like playing a Minecraft adventure map. Still, if you like the lore of Minecraft and have a decent sense of humour, you'll probably enjoy it.","February 22","true","15.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It does a great job of making the player feel like they're dealing with a truly daunting and unknown menace. Telltale's game engine has clearly taken on significant improvements from previous games. No glitches or bugs to be seen, and most of the bad reviews are comments on the release strategy, which is not what the steam review system is for. As a further comment on the release strategy, Telltale wanted to do a 8-episode story, since most of their games are 5 episodes, had they released them all at once the price wouldve been 40$ which people would've complained about just as much. At least this way people get to make the decision themselves.\n\nThe game is far from incomplete without the DLC, the story through the first episodes is perfectly resolved without it.","May 28","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Maybe 4 minutes of that was actual gameplay? MAYBE?\n\nMostly, it's a movie plus dialog choices (which happen too fast, you don't have much time to consider), with occasional breaks for "adventuring" (a half minute of find-the-thing), and very occasional crafting. Basically, it's all cutscenes, with a tiny amount of incredibly unsatisfying "gameplay" that presents zero challenge. (Keep in mind I only played an hour... but would you really keep playing in the hopes that it "gets better"?) Thank goodness for Steam's refund policies.\n\nEven a "movie" would be fine, if it had an interesting plot and script. I mean, voice acting by Patton Oswalt, Brian Posehn and Paul Reubens? These are some of my favorites! But they couldn't save it.\n\nBuy this for your kids if they're fanatical about Minecraft, would love a poorly scripted movie with occasional unexpected/unannounced button presses strewn throughout, and you've got the money to throw at that. Otherwise, definitely stay away. A story-driven Minecraft experience sounds great, I hope someone makes one someday.","January 25","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To be honest I don't think I can even stand to write a full review.\n\nWhat it is:\nIt's a cute Minecraft-themed cinematic quicktime event game (series?).\n\nWho it is for:\nI would say the target audience is teenagers, people who can't get enough Minecraft, and people who enjoy episodic content.\n\nWhat I liked:\nIt's cute. Some of the story was entertaining. Some of the characters were engaging sometimes. Some of the scenery was nice. I enjoyed Professor Farnsworth's narration.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nOh boy. This game has sort of an identity crisis. It (and consequently you) doesn't know whether it's a point-and-click, sit-and-watch, or hunt-and-peck adventure. It tries to be all three, but as a result I often found myself taken off-guard, completely unawares and barely able to accurately respond to whatever nonsense was being thrown at me.\n\nThe game expects you to be engaged and ready without a moments notice, yet will go for long stretches of automated sequences with no input from the player. In a normal game where there is a clear distinction between action and automation that's great, but in this game it kind of blows.\n\nThe dialogue was not all that interesting, although the plot had promise. It's a shame because sooooo much of this game is just inane conversation.\n\nI'm just glad it's over.","February 13","false","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It might just seem like a simple building contest, but there's just much more to that. A sinister plot, devised by a former member of the Order of the Stone, was initially designed for vengeance and revenge. However, something goes horribly wrong. Eventually, you find yourself to be of more importance than you think you'd be in a game taking place in a Minecraft world. You, playing as the male or female protagonist Jesse, go on an epic adventure to places people wouldn't dare to go to. Experiencing both hardships and tender moments, you are left to make the tough decisions for your group and ultimately decide how the story will go. Despite the circumstances however, your group still finds a way to crack crude jokes and stay optimistic. Will you put the health of others before your own, or will you take everything for yourself? The choice is yours.\n\n10/10 I cried to Minecraft\n\nstill waiting for ep. 5 telltale games pls","December 24, 2015","true","12.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I LOVE THIS GAME! To start off,I am a massive Minecraft fan,but,the game has kinda died off in my oinion. The game was alot better with Mojang in charge. However,Minecraft Story Mode actually brings back the old Minecraft. Not too old,there were still beacons,but I mean without the sheep meat and no bunnies with a thirst for killing players all around (COUNT BUNNICULA MUAHAHAHA). But,this game completely changed how I look at Minecraft. Minecraft has gone without an actual story for many years,not knowing the true purpose of the Enderdragon,but the story is now just being made so it's fresh off the bat. Basicly,you are a male or female townsperson named Jesse. You and your friends enter a building competition when an accident happens that stirs the whole story into motion,slowly at first,but it becomes a red hot burning cart ride (Thumbs up if you get the reference) extremely quickly. But the origin of the game shows us that the players in the actual Minecraft game could be members of the Order of the Stone,as the main villian that you have to beat to roll the credits is the Enderdragon. Minecraft Story Mode takes place years after the Enderdragons defeat,instead with a new original boss,The Wither Storm. Not only is this boss terrifying,it can suck you up,eat you,kill you,poision you,use you to become bigger,and shine a purple spotlight on you to float you(wasn't my idea). Every small choice you make could effect the story's ending dramaticly. The game is by TellTaleGames so,what else would you expect? After all,the story is alot more epic and fast paced in some of the fight scenes. Also,one more thing before I give the rating,THE F*CKING SOUNDTRACK! I can listen to it for hours without getting bored! It's something that makes every location in the game feel right,and it builds up the idea that you are doing whatever an adventurer would do these days,except for are someone who feel into the story by accident. The fighting music is amazing too,when you fight zombies and creepers and what else my be creeping out there,the music starts playing and it is good. Not as much so as Final Fantasy XIII,but still good. My rating? 10 out of 10.","October 30, 2015","true","28.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I started with episode one, I knew that i would enjoy the time I spent playing this game. From the well written script and nicely spoken lines by each of the characters, to even the gameplay. The simplistic TellTalle formula has yet again shown that it works and works well. Some may complain that you can't control what happens in the game, but that's the point, it's a story. It's not all about the gameplay, it's about engaging in the narrative that TellTale time and time again has shown what amazing things can come out of a story.\n\nNow let's take a more in-depth analysis of the game. At the beginning, I was a little unsure of how I would feel about the characters, but i did my best to pay attention and take the time to listen to each person that was in my group. I would also select the options that I thought I would be most likely to preform in that situation. By doing that, it made me care about what was going on between the different characters that I interacted with.\n\nAnother upside to the game is the combat and quick-time events. Through most of these instances, I was on edge. I wanted to succed in the task at hand because I wanted to continue my epic quest in the world of Minecraft with these friends that I have gained (I know they're basically just pieces of dialogue strung together but I tried to be in perspective of the main character).\n\nThe next thing up is the original Minecraft game. For Story Mode, it would be beneficial to you if you have played the original game and possibly have been part of the ever-expanding community to understand fully what you are doing. There are also references to famous "events" in the original that I would chuckle at because I fully understood what was going on. BUT even if you didn't play the original, then the game still made sure you were able to progress. Crafting, for instance, i blew past the crafting bits because I knew the recipies, but for those who didn't know, they added a recipie list to help you out.\n\nDownsides. Okay, i know that some parts of the dialouge, like in every TellTale game, gets messed up and is strung together wrong and I found myself asking "what? that didn't make sense?" but there were only two or three instances of this. Some audio errors occured where characters were silent, and drop in framerate from time to time. Though, I find this completely forgiveable. Many people do say that the story is boring and they don't care what happens to the characters, but this is completely subjective. The only way to know fully is to play for yourself.\n\nFinal thoughts. A game that is priced at the same as the other episodic TellTale games, but is not as long timewise. It only took me a little less than 7 hours to beat the first four episodes and i've logged more than 10 on both Walking Dead games. This didn't bother me in the slightest, it's just something good to know going into this game. I had a very enjoyable time playing this and am looking forward to episode five.\n\nAlso, I don't usually cry at video games but for some reason, the final scene with Reuben really got to me. Who knew a pig could bring out so many emotions.\n\nI give Minecraft: Story Mode a 8.5/10","December 26, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It might just seem like a simple building contest, but there's just much more to that. A sinister plot, devised by a former member of the Order of the Stone, was initially designed for vengeance and revenge. However, something goes horribly wrong. Eventually, you find yourself to be of more importance than you think you'd be in a game taking place in a Minecraft world. You, playing as the male or female protagonist Jesse, go on an epic adventure to places people wouldn't dare to go to. Experiencing both hardships and tender moments, you are left to make the tough decisions for your group and ultimately decide how the story will go. Despite the circumstances however, your group still finds a way to crack crude jokes and stay optimistic. Will you put the health of others before your own, or will you take everything for yourself?

I play Minecraft to roleplay and make my own story. I know, shocking, right? There are plenty of others who do as well.

I LOVE THIS GAME! To start off,I am a massive Minecraft fan,but,the game has kinda died off in my oinion. The game was alot better with Mojang in charge. However,Minecraft Story Mode actually brings back the old Minecraft. Not too old,there were still beacons,but I mean without the sheep meat and no bunnies with a thirst for killing players all around (COUNT BUNNICULA MUAHAHAHA). But,this game completely changed how I look at Minecraft. Minecraft has gone without an actual story for many years,not knowing the true purpose of the Enderdragon,but the story is now just being made so it's fresh off the bat. Basicly,you are a male or female townsperson named Jesse. You and your friends enter a building competition when an accident happens that stirs the whole story into motion,slowly at first,but it becomes a red hot burning cart ride (Thumbs up if you get the reference) extremely quickly. But the origin of the game shows us that the players in the actual Minecraft game could be members of the Order of the Stone,as the main villian that you have to beat to roll the credits is the Enderdragon. Minecraft Story Mode takes place years after the Enderdragons defeat,instead with a new original boss,The Wither Storm. Not only is this boss terrifying,it can suck you up,eat you,kill you,poision you,use you to become bigger,and shine a purple spotlight on you to float you(wasn't my idea). Every small choice you make could effect the story's ending dramaticly. The game is by TellTaleGames so,what else would you expect? After all,the story is alot more epic and fast paced in some of the fight scenes. Also,one more thing before I give the rating,THE F*CKING SOUNDTRACK! I can listen to it for hours without getting bored! It's something that makes every location in the game feel right,and it builds up the idea that you are doing whatever an adventurer would do these days,except for are someone who feel into the story by accident. The fighting music is amazing too,when you fight zombies and creepers and what else my be creeping out there,the music starts playing and it is good. Not as much so as Final Fantasy XIII,but still good. My rating? 10 out of 10.","October 30, 2015","true","28.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jingxd/recommended/376870/","jingxd","sea_turdle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jingxd/","260 products in account","Legitimately surprised at how disappointing this game was given the hype for the rest of Telltale's games. Gameplay is filled with quicktime events and basic movement and adds nothing to the story. Scenes where you walk around and talk to people are artificially bound by invisible walls that take away the suspension of disbelief, and the repetitive dialogue usually doesn't even add much to the characters. It's as though all of these "gameplay" elements (if you could call it that) were added to actively work against your experience of the story.\n\nThat would all be bearable if the story were compelling. You barely get attached to any of the characters, and the only one you might care for easily ends up not even being a big part of the story, which comes to an abrupt conclusion. It being a game "for kids" doesn't make up for the thin storyline and boring characters, there are plenty of kids programming that do an excellent job in their storytelling.\n\nOh, and I'm sorry, but I just can't stand Patton Oswalt's voice (the main male character).","February 8","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think the idea of giving responses in a kind of realtime manner could be a great concept and add depth to an adventure game (Which I do like in general) so on the surface I think Telltale has a neat idea.   However I think they chose the wrong game to use it on.  Minecraft is a game enjoyed by kids as young as 3 years old.  My daughter (5) loves the Fredy Fish games but they don't require any reading.  I though a nice adventure game about one of her favorite subjects that has conversation choices would help encourgae reading.  At 5 she is an advanced reader but not fast enough to try words she has not seen and try and get the meaning of the sentance before the timer ran out.   I'll may try again in another 3-5 years when she has the skills to read fast enough to enjoy the game.  Until then I don't much care for it and it frustrates my daughter so I don't recomend this game.","May 20","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you dont have the game a tell tale game Has chapters in the story 5 in this game and 1 has been released the tutorial and first entry now we have to wait FOR EVER for another release. I have plated for 1 1/2 hours already , Slowely playing the first chapter . You tell me you want to wait 3-4 months for another 1 1/2 hours. And then 1-2 months for another and another and one more chapters LMFAO . DONT RELEASE THE GAME IN COMPLETE.\n\nTHIS ISNT EVEN MENTIONING HOW POORLY CREATED IT WAS. The Dialouge and Animations were offpoint , Im not a critic or a big complainer but some dialouge was way off my expectation and my expectation isnt high especially going into a minecraft graphics game. The whole first chapter is just people moaning about how they don't like this person. They also barely know Petra at the beginning now they are acting like she is there child or something . One of the worst thing is how annoying this game can be the whole thing is cutseen which is fine so i just lay back listening and then you give me a supprise random click button. The voice acting is pretty poor on the 3 main charactors aswell. Most tell tale games have a skip cutseen button , because this game has so many pointless cutseens and stupidity for example standing and talking infront of the wither. Just let us skip a couple cut seens oh wait i forgot u try use as much time as you can so then you can make the game look longer than the horrid work you did.\n\nI rate 3-4/10 because the next episode is going to take that long.\nI'm refunding until i get a full release .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GalacticPotatoes/recommended/376870/","GalacticPotatoes","Galactic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GalacticPotatoes/","125 products in account","I was very disappointed in Minecraft: Story Mode. I was having trouble finding gameplay footage of it, and I later found out why that was. When I first started the game up, I connected my PS4 controller to it. I tried to play it but found out it was improperly mapped. The game thought Square was X and X was Circle, and it didn't recognize right on the D-Pad. I checked my settings in Big Picture and everything was correct. This is a problem on any game, but an even bigger one because of how this game is structured. I just used the mouse from that point on. The game is very slow, in fact most of it is made up of cutscenes. The only actual gameplay is walking around and clicking on stuff, with occasional conversations with characters where you can choose what you say to them, which is supposed to change the story arc. Also, the only "skill" you actually need is to spam click the mouse when fighting mobs, or some Quicktime Events, which (at least from the ones I've seen), if you don't press them in time, nothing happens. Got a refund after an hour. In summary, this game is pretty much "Beyond: Two Souls", Minecraft edition.","October 17, 2015","false","1.2"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

Let's not even touch the fact that there is only one episode out currently that you can play. Is that supost to represent chapters in a book?

Keep hate away and think.\nAlright, let's begin.\n\nEven there's much hate about Minecraft and it's Fans, Minecraft is a good game to play, nothing is all about you. If people like, let them, i'm not the OMGF MINECRAFT Fan, but i had my good times with it, today it's not that cool as before becase time passes. I respect the game, some fans indeed are too exaggerated. You need to calm down and think by yourself, and not by the people who play it.\n\nNow by THIS game: Minecraft Story Mode.\n\nFirst of all if you don't know, the game has 5 Episodes, this is Episode 1, the others are not out yet. A LOT of Telltale games has this (Except like Poker Night and so on). But one thing, you need to PAY for EVERY Episode or buy the Season Pass, which is all the episodes together for a better price. I don't like this, not just for Minecraft Story Mode, but for all games, you pay 1 time, DONE! When the next Episode comes, the game just get updated. Unfortunately it's not like that,\nyou pay a lot to play just a fragment of the history.\n\nBUT\n\nThe Game. The game itself it's NICE, but, why is it like THIS? I have the answer, even it ISN'T Minecraft, it keeps the elements of the game, adapting some things to make the game even better, Crafting is there, Traps is there, Redstone is there and so on. Now, why this? Minecraft it's a SIMPLE game, this is the ELEMENT they keep, SIMPLICITY, keeping the this element from the original game made it unique, not a Minecraft Clone or anything like that.\n\nThe graphics.\n\nIt's Minecraft, i know, but what i said, elements. It's the original game looking with shaders, worked shadows, sun and so on.\n\nGameplay.\n\nA Telltale game, what can i say about it, it's point and click with some scene actions and combat, not that hard stuff, but you gotta be watchful to don't miss it. Now something i noticed, i don't know if i didn't missed enought times, but you don't get too punished by missing the actions, like, you just recover yourself instantly, it's not compromising, they should do something about it. The combat is fine, there aren't a lot, yes, but is Episode 1, so yeah.\n\nThe History.\n\nThis part is where people want to be the best atleast, as a Telltale game, history is one of the BEST elements. As a Telltale game, and a Minecraft based game, the history is good. It's simple, you can understand, it's not complicated, IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO KEEP PLAYING, >> TELLTALE GAME << You have to know what are you playing. Simplicity = Original element.\n\nBugs?\n\nYes, BUT NOT A BIG DEAL, it's with the subtitles, sometimes someone talk something, and then the subtitles is other thing, again, not a big deal. Other thing, scene changes, sometimes they're strange with black screens, not a big deal too. Not more bugs than this, this will not make your experience be DESTROYED. Sometimes bugs can occur, don't be surprise if it occurs, it's a GAME, it's rare but has a chance.\n\nWell, i think it's it!\nA score? Well\n\n8.8/10\n\nDo i recommend it? YES. BUT PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, read about Telltale games, THIS IS NOT MINECRAFT, it's a SPINN OFF GAME. You're not free to live in this game. You have choices, you choose one and ♥♥♥♥ happens","October 20, 2015","true","6.8"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","10","22","3","1"

It isn't as hands on compared to the sandbox game but don't let that put you off it, as it repays you in the fantastic story that will brainwash you into wanting to repeatedly play the first chapter over and over taking different decisions. You the player controls what goes on in the game and the choices you select will determine what happens next. The only down side to the game has actually nothing to do with the in game experience  but how the story is diced up into chapters and one has to wait 5-8 weeks to continue!!! Plus there are 6 chapters to buy so you are looking to complete the game next year due to the marketing process, so don't let the price for the base game manipulate you into thinking it's a great buy! DLC will be mandatory if wanting to complete it.

With the introducement to the main characters Jesse, Axel Olivia and Lucas. This sets off as the three friends attempting to build a fireworks stand at a builders tournament and a introduction to the 'Order Of The Stone' in which the victor gets to meet Gabriel the warrior one of the members of the Order. After all of this crap happens you lose your pig and gotta find him meeting Petra the female feminist empowering character. You and her out to sell a wither skull she has found to the main antagonist Ivory or as I call him 'The Shady Guy'. After the interview with Gabriel, Ivory builds a Wither in which the flask inorder to control is stolen from your good buddy Axel and the witherstorm gones ape S**t and starts consuming endercon completey. After a chain of events in which you can save Petra or Galbriel you enter the nether after this you find yourself at the Order's temple you have to finish puzzles in order to use the amulet Galbriel gave you, oh ye he gives you this magical amulet to track the order. You have to choose to go with Olivia to find Ellegard or with Axel to find Magnus. A great fun episode.\n\nEpisode 2 6/10\n-----------\nIn this episode you have to choices I went with Olivia so I will tell the story of Ellegard you find her in her city redstonia in which you have to do some redstone crap and get into her thinking block there you must help her build a command block before the witherstorm comes and flips s**t up yet again. After you return you find Galbriel just chillin in the temple with Lucas. Also Axel went to find the other dude. After this you find the tracker to my boy Soren and attempt to track his footsteps at his temple, The two Order members you picked up get hella mad at each other and leave after you run into Ivory in which you find out he was a former Order member, you engage him in battle until he uses some elixir and runs away trapping you and your buddies in a library. This was an ok episode probs oh though I still reckon it was the worst out of the four.\n\nEpisode 3 7.5/10\n-----------\nIn this episode you attempt to find Soren yet again losing the amulet while diging out of the temple finding a mob grinder leads you to the End. In there you find a whole wool world Sorens built and a bunch of enderman he is attempting to make them build. After putting the enderman suit on you try to find him, after finding him he punches you and takes you inside his house. There the enderman siege it and you and your buddies must escape. After coming back to surface you make the Super TNT Crap and Magnus and Ellegard are back together fighting the Witherstorm. There you build the bomb and blow the thing up leading to the death of either Ellegard or Magnus. Getting surviors you see that the command block is not damaged and it starts sucking everything up again yet this time there is 3 of them. Finding either Petra or Galbriel you run away into the next episode. This was a good episode exploring some unique themes of the power of being alone for a long period of time.\n\nEpisode 4 8/10\n-----------\nIn this episode you run away from the Witherstorm once again and retreat to a crib in the mountains there you find out that Petra has forgotten everything and doesn't remember you. In which you try to figure out stuff about the Witherstorm. Ivory comes along and Soren gets hell mad that the bomb didn't work but Ivory figures out to destroy it using a Enchanted sword in which you and some of your buddies have to use the horses to go the 'Far Lands.' when finally getting there you complete this maze in which it leads you to Ivorys lab there you find out the truth of the Order of the stone and craft the weapon strong enough to destroy the command block in the Witherstorm. After leaving you finally engage the Witherstorm in combat and destroy the command block but not without pay your poor pig Reuben dies. After Galbriel reveals you and your friends are the new 'Order of the stone.' In the end you can tell to reveal the truth about the order or "Let the people dream." This episode was sick finally ending the Witherstorm and knowing that nobodies can truly become Legendary.\n\nOverall Minecraft story-mode is really fun game with unique character creation semi-predicatable and for a so called 'kids game' actually pretty dark with touching moments and moments of sorrow and lack of salvation, though the game was pretty quick only took me 7 hours to finish it's still a really funny sick game defiantly  worth buying.\n7.5/10 (LETS SAY 1-4 IS SEASON 1 REGARDLESS AS IT ALL LINKS TOGETHER.)\nSEASON 2\n---- (Will review when all episodes come out.)==","December 28, 2015","true","9.4"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","9","20","2","3"

I was a little skeptical due to the lack of a story behind Minecraft, but it left Telltale with a blank canvas with which to create a masterpiece. Sadly I feel they've taken the easy option and crafted a dull story, forgettable characters, inconsequential player choices and dialogue that might amount to one weak smile per episode. I expect the game to sell well and may even be their biggest selling game to date due to the IP; and that worries me because I don't want to see Telltale leave behind a formula that I enjoy in favor of bigger profits.\n\nThis is not a game for grown-ups like The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us or Game of Thrones. There isn't an adult storyline, nor are there enough subtle nods to grown-ups for it to be enjoyed, ala Disney. I would struggle to even recommend it to anyone with kids, Minecraft lovers or not because it's just not very entertaining.","November 21, 2015","false","3.2"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

Yes you get to make your own choices, but the timer on the choice menu needs to go away. Let me think about my choices more. Also, give me some warning that I have to hit buttons during action sequences. It just pops up out of nowhere without any warning and I end up missing them about 60% of the time.\n\nWas it enjoyable to watch? Yes. I'm engaged in the storyline, but it was far too short of an episode for the price of $25 USD. I would at most have paid $10 but even that is a bit overpriced.\n\nWould I recommend this 'game'? Yes, but wait until it goes on sale, for it's just not worth it right now. So, no I guess.","October 14, 2015","false","3.3"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

Most of the exposition is handled in this episode; the cast is displayed as well as the main conflict. Episode 1 also introduces us to mechanics that will likely show up a lot more later on as well as a few very simple puzzles to ease us into the experience. That said there is not too much excitement in the episode other than how freaking cool it is that Minecraft fans finally get a peice of work with the minecraft theme that is very high quality.

Yes, the characters aren't fully fleshed out yet, maybe the plot isn't so good, but its the biggest series Telltale has taken on so far.

DONT BUY IT. Most Of Telltales Games Are About The Story, And Not The Gameplay, Sure The Animation And Lipsinc Is A Bit Off, But That Doesnt Matter. They Add Some Quick Time Events To Keep On Your Toes, And Like Other Games Telltale Has Come Out WIth,(Such As "The Walking Dead Game"). Desision Making Also Takes A Part In This Game. Everyone...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/recommended/376870/","lufiales","✪ konbleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lufiales/","355 products in account","***WARNING*** This may be a long review. It is needed to make all the points clear.\nIf you don't want to read it all, or already know how the main Telltale's games are, you can jump to the 4th point.\n\n1. What is this game about?This game raised a lot of questions. Two of them are: "What is it about?", and "Is it like “the original” Minecraft?"\n\n- 1.1. What is it about?This game is about a group of friends which started by participating in a build competition. And after that competition, the whole mess started because of a bad deal. And I’m not spoiling any more of the game. See some walkthroughs on YouTube if you want to know its story without buying it.\n\n- 1.2. Is it like “the original” Minecraft?The short answer is: No it isn’t. You won’t have a “large” world to explore or build whatever you want when you want and where you want. This only has Minecraft environment, ambience and esthetics.\n\n2. Then, what type/kind of game is this?The answers for this is kinda long but simple.\nThis is like any other Telltale's game which tries to tell a story. It’s all about people’s tastes though. Not everyone likes this type of games.\nIf you played “The Game of Thrones” or “The Walking Dead” or “Tales from the Borderlands” (all by Telltale games) you already know what to expect from this game in terms of mechanics and such things. If you never played any of their games read this next explanation: this game is like an interactive movie.\nImagine watching a movie where you can control the main character, choosing what he says at some moments and control his decisions in important moments. And those decisions will have impact in future episodes. Speaking in episodes, this game will have 8 (the inicial 5 and 3 more later) and you can finish each one in 2 to 4 hours.\nAnd now you ask: Episodes? The answer is: yes. This type of games is released in parts, called episodes. Each episode is released at a date chosen by Telltale and comes to your game in the form of updates without the need of paying anything more. When you buy a Telltale game you already pay for the whole game.\nSo, answering to a question raised by a lot of people, if someone says that you will have to pay for each episode, “he’s lying with how many teeth he has in his mouth” (that's a Portuguese expression).\nIf you still have doubts about what can you do on this game, just watch some short gameplays on YouTube.\n\n3. Why should you buy this?Let me talk a little about the reviews on Steam. I always laugh my f****** a** off when I read negative reviews with less than 1 hour of gameplay (that's just the time for opening the game and change the settings) and call it a "cash grab". And this game has lots of negative reviews like that. (now they can ask for a refund, btw)\nThe second most important reason for all negative reviews in this game's page is: bugs. Every game has bugs now, but this game has some too: bugs with animations, bugs with the subtitles (the character says one thing, and in the subtitle says something similar and way longer with more things sometimes). Those were the bugs I’ve found in my gameplay time.\nBut people can’t stand bugs, but they still play DayZ or Ubisoft games (*cough* Assassin’s Creed *cough*). ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nMoving on, the main reason for all the negative reviews here is: people were expecting something like a mod for Minecraft, with quests, story and all that fun stuff. It happens that this is just a regular Telltale's game (I already explained what these games are in the previous question). So if you, like those people, are expecting a new Minecraft you shouldn’t buy this.\n\nIn this game you only follow the story and interact with the other characters, picking some dialogues, making important decisions that will have impact in future episodes (or in the same where they were made), some QTEs (Quick Time Events) where you need to press a sequence of keys to do a pre-determined action (normally Up, Down, Left, Right, Q and E), biuld some pre-determined stuff (like, bow, sword... just small things), and it’s all. It sounds almost like nothing but you can still have a lot of fun. This game has drama, action and comedy. But don’t expect all that in “too high” levels. Keep in mind that, differently from the other Telltale games, the main target for this game is a younger audience (just like Minecraft is intended for kids only but a lot of “grownups” play it too).\n\nSo, I’ve played this game exhaustively (look at my total gameplay time), finishing the already released episodes like 5 or 6 times or more, testing almost all the differente chices and decisions, and had a lot of fun (the third episode was the best, in my opinion, even with the cut off dialog bug). This depends more on people’s tastes than on random negative reviews here on steam.\nSo, if you like Minecraft esthetics or ambience and like the style of Telltale games that I mentioned before in this review, go ahead and don’t be afraid to buy this.\nI will change my rating after the last episode I played (4th episode). This game is getting better quality episode after episode. And when I saw the ending I just became proud because telltale have done it again. My rating now is an 7/10.\n\nEpisode 5 won’t be the last you see of Jessie and the gang. There will be three extra episodes.\nBy what I read, all three of these episodes will be add-ons to the season, so you'll need to own at least the first episode in order to purchase and play these three chapters.\n\n4. Pro tipI will end my review with a tip you should all follow when you have doubts on buying a game or not. Since a lot of reviews here on Steam, essentially negatives, are only trolling or made by haters (and the same people give “thumb downs” to the other positive and really helpful reviews on purpose, like they did to mine, again) you don’t need to waste hours reading a lot of reviews here.\nYes, read only some of them, and then just watch some YouTube gameplays of the game you want to buy. That will help to end your doubts about a lot of games much faster and giving you the right decision.","October 30, 2015","true","41.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I remember watching Youtubers play The Wolf Among Us, and it was a cool game, never bought it though. This is the first Tell Tale Games game I have played and I love the first episode. So stoked for the second one. Everything about this game is amazing. Firstly the graphics are not an issue, really captured the blocky pixelated Minecraft feel. The storyline is awesome and hilarious in many ways.

This is a spoiler-free review.\n\nFirst and formost, lets speak about if it's necessary to play Minecraft to play this game. The short answer is no, you do not require any experience whatsoever with Minecraft to play this game. In the few crafting parts, there is an option to the bottom right that shows you the recipe you must use to aquire the item you're attempting to obtain. Although it does feel as if we are playing in the Minecraft universe, this is something I thought was very important to point out.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nThe Story follows a character named Jesse. At the beginning of the game, it offers you six options, in which you get to pick from three skins for each gender. Although I cannot say much about the story itself without spoiling how the plot unravels, the game follows Jesse (you) and a couple of side characters, each joining you according to your decisions. The game centers around these decisions. What made the story fascinating to me was mostly the characters, for they were the ones who made this game truly enjoyable. Often I'd find myself thinking I was watching a movie, and laughing or chuckling at these characters as they have a funny script, and amazing personalities.\n\nFor the characters, and how the story is unraveled to us slowly, I'll give this a fine 9/10. The story could've been better, but the characters are the ones who truly made rise to this.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\n\nMinecraft: Story Mode's gameplay is very similar to The Walking Dead season 1 and season 2 from Telltale games aswell. You have very simple controls, the typical W, A, S, D. to move, L-SHIFT to sprint, Q, and E on some occasions and in the fighting scenes you must use the Left Mouse click and Right Mouse click.\n\nThe most important factor of this whole gameplay is the decision making. If you are here for fighting scenes or even COD graphics, this is most certainly not the game for you. The game is what I could easily say 93% of the game is you in a cutscene, making choices as other characters speak to you. What I found very handy is that while making these choices, you are allowed to press Space Bar, to pause the game and think in case you are a slow reader.\n\nThere are some rare occasions in which you will be forced to fight mobs. In which you use W and S to move forward and back. Left-Mouse click to swing/shoot and Right-Mouse click to switch weapons. The A and D only play part in changing targets. This at first seemed pretty hard for me, but I got the hang of it quickly.\n\nEach episode from the game is pretty long, but the game itself will save automatically in between cutscenes or when you're changed to free movement. There is an in the main menu in which you can search for, which is the "rewind".. This will allow you to jump back in time to one of the 6 most important points of the chapter in case you feel you did something wrong. Feel free to leave the game whenever you want, for the save system happens rather frequently.\n\nThe gameplay deserves a 10/10, for this is an easy system to learn and really enjoyable too for the right public.\n\nGRAPHICS/MUSIC\n\nAt first I was gonna say the graphics on this game are not impressive, as it is already expected the game will give you blocky characters, blocky landscapes. I soon changed my mind once I saw how proper the animations were on every character, and the moment I had forgotten I was playing Minecraft: Story Mode but instead felt like I was playing the original Minecraft because the mobs look identical. I thought this was something I should highlight, considering it has great animation on their faces, since they make expressions and movements. I wouldn't have expected any more, but I sure expected a lot less. I found myself wondering if I could build these places, and also looking at the game as if it were a movie, because its animations surpassed all my expectations.\n\nGraphics deserve a 10/10 for surpassing my expectations.\n\nMusic on this game is rather repetitive. During cutscenes I'd find myself humming to the song because it was the same one. Although I never minded the music, I found that some people would find this annoying. It does not use any music by Mojang as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI never was a fan of music, but I liked this particular theme so I'll give it an 8/10.\n\nOVERALL\n\nThis is the TL;DR section. Although I'd reccomend you read the entire thing, I understand it's too long for most.\n\nThe gameplay on this game was amazing, it had surprisingly funny and enjoyable characters I soon found myself fond of. I found myself making decisions trying to keep everyone calm and at a neutral level so I could keep them all. This game has successfully made it to my top 10 games of 2015, just because I thought it was hillarious and kept me hooked for an entire day, which is a rather hard task. The graphics far surpassed my low expectations as animations showed me how wrong I was to expect small from this game and the controls are very easy to get a hold of if you've never played a Telltale Game before. I'd highly reccomend this game because I adore it the more I think of it.\n\n9/10. The reason it does not deserve a 10/10 is because of it's replay value. I got this game on a discount, but I'd pay full for it if I had to. Loved it.","January 4","true","8.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I like how the game has choices to make and is in the world of minecraft. But the only thing i dont like is that the episodes are short episode 2 is shorter than episode 1 and i would like for new episodes to be longer. but besides that i think its a very good game and all the minecraft noobs should buy this game.\n","October 30, 2015","true","18.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mimodx2/recommended/376870/","mimodx2","MimoDX2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mimodx2/","8 products in account","EPISODE 1 - The Order of the Stone\n\nThat game impressed me a lot, i didn't watch too much of gameplays that were made for this game because i didn't wanted too much spoilers, but what i saw in gameplays aren't even the half compared to what i played. Dude, this was amazing, some choices were really tough, i've never experienced that thougness when i was playing Jurassic Park: The Game. Now i can't wait for the next episode, i'll update this review when i get to play the next episode. Telltale, good job with this game, you guys have done this game really well! Keep up with the good work! :)\n\n\nEPISODE 2 - Assembly Required\n\nSo, i was really excited to see what was going to happen on Ep. 2, so i was seeing the Telltale's forums so i could see news about that game. And for everyone's surprise: What was going to be released in 24th November suddenly got released in 27 (28 for me) October, just  two weeks after the first episode. About the episode: It started really exciting, i saw things that Telltale has decided to improve, for example, we could ask 3 questions for some people, something that was added to JP:TG and BTTF:TG. I saw result of choices i've made on the first episode, i thought that trying to save Petra or Gabriel would give us the same result: Petra escaped,Gabriel didn't, because Ivor said that saw the "girl" running the opposite direction. But i did some search and realized that this was just something that Telltale didn't care too much. Unfornately, the episode finished on the part were we got trapped. Well, now i'm looking foward for the next episode that will come... THIS YEAR? This will end soon then... When Episode 3 come out, i'm going to update this review. Once again, Sweet job Telltale! :)\n\n\nEPISODE 3 - The Last Place You Look\n\nOnce again Telltale made a nice episode, and even better because it's longer. It had way more action than Episode 2 did, and i love action in games! The choices weren't tough, except for the last one, but man... That ending, i must say, i'm in shock. Ellegard died because i didn't know that picking her armour would kill her. Ellegard was one of my favorite Order of the Stone member. I'll miss her. And something that i knew that would happen has happened, everyone who was sucked by the Wither Storm survived, even Gabriel, wich for some reason has lost his mind. And the Episode 4 preview was so tragic, but i'm still curious to see what happens there. Once again, Amazing job Telltale. :)","October 14, 2015","true","49.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
