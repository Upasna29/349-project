Extremely tactical, some reflexes required, very skill based, some RPG elements and a massive multiplayer meta-campaign. It was way ahead of its time. I feel it would've shined if it was released these days. I wish more people will get it so there'd be someone to play against!","December 22, 2013","true","7.1"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

If you can get some friends together, there's nothing finer than this. The skill ceiling is extremely high, and the variation of crafts and loadouts adds to the depth.\n\nIt's a real shame this game didn't take off. Glad I got to be there in the beginning when there was an active community. Some of my greatest gaming memories. Huge shame this didn't take off.","February 18, 2014","true","0.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Multiple players on the same team are able to have different vehicles. Each vehicle has a moving/shooting/guarding sort of system. You can upgrade these systems accordingly right at the beginning or throughout the game. Careful though, when you do die you do have to upgrade your system again. Right click enables the aim, left click shoots, and space engages the weapon/defense at your will. You can move as you shoot, however moving is done in increments and there is a "slow refill gas" gauge indicating after moving that a certain amount of time is needed to recover and move again. Shooting is made easier by pressing the number 1 to scroll quicker through the weapons.\n\nIf this game is on sale BUY IT! This is a game I'd hate to see be called a graveyard as it isn't because there is a lot here.\n\nPM me if you have this game and want to play! (Also join the group)!\n\nRating : 7.5/10\n\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	B-	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots :\nEngaging an opponent while upgrading capabilities\n\nEngaging in movement. The bar on the right (yellow/orange to red) indicates how much fuel I have for a movement. It re-supplies itself\n\nThere is a healthy choice of maps as well as vessels/ships to choose from","November 25, 2014","true","7.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

It has a tutorial which you can play in offline mode or you can join players online.\n\nSupport 10/10\nThis game is still actively supported by the developer.  I got a response in a very short time on their discussion forums.\n\nGraphics 8/10\n\nGraphics are unique and interesting.\n\nSounds and Music 9/10\n\nSounds and graphics are near perfect for its genre.\n\nGameplay 9/10\n\nGameplay is awesome.  Always something interesting and it is enough that you will be enjoying it for months to come.\n\nFun 9/10\n\nHave a lot of spare time because it is fun and somewhat addicting.\n\n\nPrice:  I have over 750 hours online with this game so I have to say that the price is definintely good for the amount of fun that you will be getting out of the game.\n\nBugs and Execution:  Occassionally server connection time outs but the game it self has no bugs and runs flawlessly on  XP , and windows 7. (I have not tested it on windows  8 or 8.1)\n\nOverall : This game is awesome and worth the price.  Take the tutorial and practice a little in offline mode before jumping into action with real players.","February 5, 2015","true","256.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

If you buy it, coerce your friends to do the same. Honestly, most of the negative reviews are about how there aren't really players at all times - it's kinda unfair against the game.\n\nBY THE WAY: If you are reading this, there is a chance that I'm still giving out free copies of this game. Check on the forums (discussion board) for the thread with the details.","October 13, 2014","true","0.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theshere/recommended/2720/","theshere","-⑨- Nuclear Raven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theshere/","191 products in account","This is literally the saddest story in my steam library. This awesome game went from hundreds of people playing it during the open beta - every server full, every new server instantly filling - to dead in months. Why? Price. Hyperbol was $20 for most of its lifespan, and while it's still not technically dead, it's still also not $5. This game would have been a tremendous success had it come out as a F2P game (something Steam didn't support back in 2007) but instead the developers were stubborn and steadfast in killing their own game.\n\nThere is literally no reason for this to be more than $5 right now. I say that as someone who waited for the pre-purchase to end in 2007 so that I could pay the full price for the game. It was worth $20 then, but now? Well, there's not a single active game to be found, unless you like playing with half-baked AI. Should this ever go on sale for less than $2, I'm buying it for 20 people on my friends list. Take that as you will.","January 9, 2012","true","1.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I've written in the forums and the dev has replied very fast, for a game with pretty much 8 years on it's back that's really something special.\n\nWhat about the lack of human players? To be honest, there are a bunch of active players, so it's just about getting on at the same time as those. Just post or look on the forums, add the right persons and you're set to have some fun with human players. Not right any second you'd like to but it's really not that much of an issue. And then there is the hyper hour every saturday, during which the game is freely playable with the demo, and apparently at that time there are a lot more players.\n\nThe gameplay itself is really smooth and nice. Very often I have the feeling that certain things in games work wrong or weird, or that this and that is just not really my fault. In TSHB? If I die it's either because I'm facing too many enemies at once or because I make mistakes, it's as simple as that. There are no lethal glitches or the likes and the physics system is very straightforward, reliable and understandable.\n\nThe tutorials are also made with great care, they're short, fun, and teach you most though not quite everything you should know. Bonus points for having voices in the tutorials which aren't annoying one bit.\n\nI can recommend getting this game, even if it is 8 years old. I got it vastly reduced myself, and to be honest I wouldn't pay the full price because it'd be more money than I can comfortably spend right now, but the game is worth it.","March 30, 2015","true","38.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This was fantastic and original game. The array of weapons had unique advantages and disadvantages. Many weapons interacted with many others, allowing you to shoot at enemies in crazy ways. I remember bouncing a hyperbol off of a repulsor with a left spin, and it deflected outwards and around a wall, hitting an enemy.\n\nIt's a shame it's over.","January 17, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have tried time and time again to get people to pick this game back up.

There's no real single player content here, and the AI is pretty bad. It's sad, because it's a very original game, well made, has a great soundtrack, and the online play was perfect. Think tanks in space, on a huge air hockey table. That might get you halfway to a proper idea of what the game is about. If you could get some friends to play with you online or over LAN, you'll have fun. Otherwise, unfortunately, pass.","August 26, 2014","false","0.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"
