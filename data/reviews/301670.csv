Don't know why ppl blame it so much for being hard, it's almost like Atlantis series, the puzzles aren't that impossible (I'm patience to take an hour to solve something that takes 30 secs, hate walkthroughs) though I had to look for a hint to only one or two puzzles. The timed actions aren't hard either.\n\nPeople that complain about this game never played Myst, Lucas Arts series and other old adventure games. The story of this one is great, the only part I didn't like so much was the end, I thought it would have something more.\nAnyway if you're not a point & click fan don't buy this, but if you are and want some good dialogs, puzzles and story this game is for you.","August 10, 2014","true","11.0"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","31","35","0","0"

The game tells the story of Spendius, an actual historical figure, who rises from slavery to become a great commander of mercenary forces in the Mercenary War that further devastated Carthage after its defeat in the First Punic War. The art design is very creative but a little repetitive as is the sound design. Overall, the game has not aged too badly in the sound and graphics departments. The puzzles range from trivial to challenging and to be successful the player should make sure to take notes and look out for small details. Negatives include random crashing and the short duration of the game (I completed it in one long sitting).\n\nIt's easily worth $5 if you're a fan of old school adventure games.","June 3, 2014","true","3.7"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

Now before I start I want to get the negatives out of the way before I say anything good about it. The interface is god awful/annoying, the story is kinda linear but follows the original novel pretty well without being boring, the puzzles are easy except for a few hard ones (Perfect game for the new adventurer), the music is decent but it's inaccurate whenever the game plays it & depending on how good you are with puzzles (There's mini games like War Chess but that doesn't last too long) the game will last around 7 hours.\n\nNow with that out of the way I'll start by saying for a 12 year old game it's got a weird & gorgeous art style it's just a unique piece of animation done well, the voice acting is very good, the humans look like aliens & demons, the atmosphere has that science fiction (Or Fantasy I dont know what Cryo was targeting) heavy metal type style you would see on music albums like Mastodan or GWAR for example & overall I would just wait for the game to go on sale since the game was only an average experience.\n\nBonus: The original story is on Good Reads if you want to check it out http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221597.Salammb_\n\nBonus 2: Another influence for this game is Phillippe Druillet (the website is in french) http://www.druillet.com/","January 12, 2015","true","7.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","2"

A world that was both surreal and yet simple, never edging over to high-fantasy.\n\nMechanics are as you'd expect from some of the later Myst and Journeyman Project games, with it being singular images with 360 view.  The puzzles are never obfuscated or nonsensical, and a good handful require some strong thought to solve.\n\nDownside to the game is it's rather short (took me about five hours), and is relatively straight-forward for this type of game.  At five dollars, though, I'd say the price is right if you have an itch for this genre that needs scratching.","October 31, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I did not know what to expect. This game seems to follow a pseudo-historical timeline, meaning it takes place in a fantasy/historical setting. The graphics are great. This game comes from a time when developers were learning various tricks to make games look amazing with little processing power. Think back to the early ps1 days when they used 3d polygonal characters with pre-rendered backgrounds (Resident Evil, Final Fantasy 7 thru 9). This allowed developers to make games with graphics way more detailed than what would be possible with real-time 3d rendering. Then, even later, developers improved upon that with making these pre-rendered backgrounds more lively like a cinematic video. This game is very much a point and click adventure with 360 degree living/moving pre-rendered backgrounds. For example, you can look every which way. You can see soldiers moving, animals moving, and things happening all around you (quite beautifully, too). When you talk to a person, it moves to a much closer view of the person speaking to you in the similar form of the cinematic vidoes of the past (about xbox360 graphics). The impressive thing about this is, is that this is a game that can run on a 400mhz processor and 128 mb ram.\n\nThis game should take most players about 7-10 hours to complete. Below are pro's and con's:\n\n--PROS--\n+You can get this game cheaply in game bundles on various game bundle websites. (I've seen it twice so far)\n+The game has very low minimum system requirements.\n+The graphics are quite good.\n+ The voice acting is pretty good for the most part, with few moments of exceptions.\n+The story looks to be interesting.\n+The game has pretty high production values.\n+The setting is a fantasy/historical setting, which is pretty creative.\n+There are some pretty creative puzzles that will make you think.\n\n--CONS--\n-The game seems to be a bit dark on it's storyline and setting (some people may like this)\n-Pretty much all of the characters are selfish, greedy people. Even the protagonist, Spendius, seems to have few redeeming qualities.\n-The game graphics and style is dated (but it has aged fairly well, IMO)\n-There are a few puzzles where the solutions are simply too obscure. For example, in one puzzle, the player would need to know that apparently Carthaginian writing is from right to left, from bottom to top, and that the grid without numbers has an opposite order of how numbers appear on a phone (1-3, 4-6, 7-9, etc.). There are one or two other similar puzzles. I would recommend consulting an online walkthrough if you spend more than 30 minutes on any puzzle.\n-There seem to be a few bugs or compatability problems (I am using win 8). When I changed the resolution, things got really messed up and I had to verify the installation to replace a file. Another time, the game crashed. The biggest error I saw (and others have experienced it as well) is one where after you acquire a animal to ride, you have a map where you can choose where you want to go. After choosing the location, the game simply stops. After an internet search, I found a post on the steam community board where one person mentioned a workaround. If you encounter this bug, press f5 repeatedly, and you will see the cursor slowly move towards the destination. If you have a laptop, you may need to press shift and f5 or another similar button combination. Very strange, but it worked.\n\n--SUMMARY--\nAll in all, the game seems pretty interesting. The asking price ($4.99) is not bad, but I would recommend picking it while on sale or in part of a bundle.","March 26, 2015","true","11.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/benwaa/recommended/301670/","benwaa","BenWah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/benwaa/","673 products in account","The story is "heroic", with one improbable success and escape after another, in a dramatic comic book style.\nThat's ok, it's a valid style of adventure and story.\n\nThe story is slightly sophisticated, describing difficulties in negotiations to bring factions together for a common goal.\n\nIt is a full length game and story.\n\nThe inability to easily see which direction one can move is a critical downfall of the game, detracting so much from gameplay that I regret having played.\n\nFiguring out which exits are possible is a methodical process of scanning each direction with the mouse.\nIt is very easy to overlook a possible exit and get stuck only for this reason.\nMuch time is wasted backtracking and double checking scans for possible exits.\nThe map is of no help at all in this regard.\n\nThe other downfall of the game is grossly unintuitive puzzles, that make little sense even in retrospect after consulting the walkthrough.\n\nEven worse, some of the most difficult puzzles are timed events, where one must make a series of correct decisions in rapid succession to succeed.  An absolute clickfest requiring many maddening repeats, even if one stares at the walkthrough knowing what to do.\nIf I was chained to the computer for 24 hours I would have NEVER gotten past some puzzles without the walkthrough.  That's terrible.\n\nSome of the story and art is interesting, but from a gameplay and puzzle perspective I cannot recommend this game.\nI regret having purchased and played it.","June 3, 2014","false","7.3"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","25","48","0","3"
