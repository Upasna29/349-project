The ability to customize your mech with different weapons and even change the color scheme is also a nice feature to have even though I have not unlocked any new stuff they do give you a couple things to start with.\n\nI will say that the only negative I can think of at the moment would be that the zero gravity missions have a very wonky feel to them as I have a hard time aiming and not spinning but this is most likely due to me not having enough practice with the controls.\n\nSo if you are a fan of old retro side scrolling mech games I think this game will fit the bill as I have not seen anything like this since the old SNES days.","May 1, 2014","true","1.8"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","45","47","0","0"

By the time I finally found a configuration that worked for me and had sufficient time to get used to it... the game was over; just when I thought it was gaining steam. If the game was much longer or had more content, then the fumbly controls would be a non-issue. But as it stands, the control_weirdness:gameplay ratio is not worth it.\n\nAnother issue are the unskippable cutscenes & dialog. The game isn't long enough to really warrant the mostly-mediocre story shoehorned into it, and does nothing but add frustration if you have to replay a part over and over. And since Gunhound is a Japanese game, it's more-so unforgiving than it is difficult, so you will find yourself restarting quite a bit in order to experiment and learn patterns. There's also a Mission mode that completely skips cutscenes & dialog, but nobody is going to use that mode on their first run.\n\nThe tutorial trials are also not very useful nor fun. They suffer from unskippable dialog, and they themselves are unforgiving, mostly-nullifying the entire point of them. If you want to learn the controls, my advice is to just walk around for a bit in the first tutorial and mess-around until you're comfortable - then go and play the campaign. Oh, and map Sprint to right-bumper if you're using a 360 controller.\n\nThe normal price is $17 CDN. That is way, way too much for what you may get out of it, and I feel like I didn't get my money's worth for $3.\n\nWith all that, I had a good time with Gunhound, and am glad I played it - but it's not something I can really recommend for the reasons above.","December 2, 2014","false","4.2"," 57 of 79 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","57","79","0","0"

Put some time into the Playism version and this seems like a great Assault Suit style game so far. It's great-looking, certainly a far cry from GIGANTIC ARMY, and probably in the same ballpark as Leynos 2. Very satisfying and hefty mech controls with awesome Valken-style dashing and landing. All signs point to this game being best played without using any continues, and it seems fairly challenging to do that.

It's very much like an hybrid between the Assault Suit games and Wolf Fang (a.k.a. "Rohga: Armor Force" outside of Japan, an arcade game by Data East, check it out.) It's basically a run-and-gun mixed with a shooter in which you destroy as much stuff as you can and as fast as possible in a mech loaded with powerful weaponry. Just rush missions and destroy tons of baddies, it's as simple as this.\n\nMusic is scored by Hyakutaro Tsukimo famous for his works on the last games of the Thunder Force series by Tecnosoft, and the art is very 90's-like with gorgeous details.The character design is decent in my opinion, and the japanese voice acting is spot-on. However, being a straight port of the PSP version, it doesn't have high-def graphics or audio, which I can totally live with. The controls are top notch too, but hard to apprehend, you definitely need a joystick for this one.\n\nOverall this game screams quality, which is amazing considering it started as a mere doujin. If you're a shooter/STG fan, enjoy mechs and big splosions with fierce head-banging music and lots of pew pew, or just kawaii uguu animay, this game is for you.","July 1, 2014","true","34.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It took me a bit to the more realistic feel of the Gunhound but once you get the hang of it it's enjoyable. There is 5 missions and to unlock all the weapons you have to basically grind points on the 5 missions that are available. The problem with the controls inherently are the fact they are very deliberate, if you try to play it like Mega Man or Metal Slug you will get shot down easily. It doesn't help that the game is kind of trial and error as there are many cases in the game where your hound won't be able to react fast enough to what happens because of it's very deliberate movement. You can purge your armor to increase your speed but it makes you brittle, that's the pay off. There is an odd popping noise in the sound as well, however the game has some good Japanese Voice acting which I think explains the price. That said the songs in the game are very damn good. I got it for 3 dollars on a sale and I got my money's worth however I can't recommend it at its 15 dollar normal price on Steam.\n\nThen there is all the little things. There is no graphic options for one, outside of 60FPS control really. Fullscreen is enabled by the old standby, Alt + Enter just in case you didn't know that. Then there is the fact that you have to mash through cutscenes that you can't skip. If you keep dying it gets really old.\n\nThe game is not horrible, or bad or broken (at least not for me, I see people are having launch and controller issues on the forums.), but there is a combination of things that kind of hinder it. Get on sale in my opinion, at about 7 USD or less.

If you don't like BOTH of those things, you'll probably find pretty much nothing to enjoy in this game.\n\nThis game's weaknesses are easier to describe than its strengths. Its graphics are dated, having been made for the PSP years ago. It's a very transparently low-budget game (with remarkable ugly menus). It's an extremely barebones port with almost no PC-specific features or enhancements. It's singleplayer-only with limited replay value (achieve high scores to unlock extra weapons). It's also short, at about 3 hours from start to finish.\n\nLastly, the controls can be a pain, literally. The game's more difficult fights can require you to juggle between pressing, holding, and possibly double-tapping upwards of 6 different buttons on a controller as you dodge enemy projectiles, fire multiple weapons, jump, dash, and block. Sometimes you even have to do this in zero-gravity where you hold a button to toggle your directional controls between lateral motion (movement) and angular rotation (aiming). I typically couldn't play for more than about an hour at a time before stopping because my hands were aching so much from the finger acrobatics.\n\nIn spite of all of that, I found the game had old-fashioned charm and was quite satisfying to overcome as a challenge. Like any good Japanese action game, you can feel your mastery of the game steadily increase as you play it. Persistence, pattern recognition, and plenty of patience are required to succeed. I approached this obscure little game with no, or maybe even negative, expectations, so I am surprised and satisfied at having ultimately enjoyed it modestly.","May 29, 2014","true","3.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've yet to complete it from beginning to end using one continue, but I've beaten the final boss using keybard controls and the only thing I had a bit of trouble with was locking on to a direction and using secondary fire at the same time; even that, though, becomes easy once you've practiced enough.\n\nGunhound is a sidescroller with actual physics, and you're controlling a mech that's meant to feel heavy. That's it; that's what the "irredeemable horribleness" of the controls boils down to. As soon as you realize that you're not supposed to play this as if it were Mario or Megaman, it stops being an issue.\n\nPresentation's not amazing, but totally fine. The music's fitting enough and the graphics get the job done. Most of the mechs are made of smaller sprites put together and spun around in a Mode 7-esque way, which can be an issue and feel unnaturally robotic in games featuring organic characters but is totally fine in a mecha-piloting game.\n\nThe silly anime story didn't amuse me as much as the one in Astebreed, but it's certainly easier to keep track of what's being said during gameplay given you can actually stop in your tracks in this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pendragon99/recommended/273240/","pendragon99","Pendymion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pendragon99/","140 products in account","It's a nice throwback to older mech games, much like Gigantic Army. Has a lot of positives, though they are tempered by the negatives. I'll explain below.\n\n-For those of you who want to use a controller, you'll need to set it up in options first, but otherwise it works just fine with most controllers. I personally use a dualshock3 with a USB attachment.\n-Gameplay is responsive, difficulty is decent but not overbearing (I recommend the simulator since you'll need the training beforehand). Please keep in mind that if you're a real go-getter and you don't take things slowly, you'll find yourself beating this game in a matter of hours.\n-The story is not that good, it's not bad, but let me save you some time and recommend skipping them wherever possible. I forget if there even is a button to skip them.\n-graphically it's very nice. Spritework is almost top notch, and you won't get that taste of "8 bit retro hipster" in your mouth. However it's a little confusing sometimes since the sprites can often leave you dazed and they'll group together, but in most of the missions you can tell what you're firing at and what's firing at you.\n-the OST is okay, nothing to speak home about\n\nOkay, so I have to be blatantly honest here. There is one huge negative.\n\n-the mech customization is actually pretty bad. Without spoiling the game, the unlock system requires blatant ingame grinding, and since the game is so short, you'll just be grinding one mission over and over again to rack up the points. To put it in perspective, the very most points you can get in a mission is 500k, and you need at least 3 million to unlock your first weapon. To get everything, you need 100 million. It's a very awkward design flaw.

You can customize your mech with a variety of different close and long range weapons. The gameplay is very similar to the SNES classic "Metal Warriors".\n\nAs for the negatives, you are limited to the Gunhound mech, unlike other games where you can choose from different types. The controls are quite challenging to master (especially for the zero gravity areas). The game is also quite short, which can be irritating to some after they finally get used to the controls.\n\nOverall, I recommend the game for those who are looking for a fun, retro-style mech game.","May 11","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unclelyall/recommended/273240/","unclelyall","Uncle Lyall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unclelyall/","208 products in account","This game no doubt has the potential to be something worth playing, but sadly it has numerous minor faults that stack up to make a wholly dissatisfying and frustrating experience. These are some of the problems I have faced with this game.\nThe mech you have to pilot is, for the most part, clunky, which results in a game that is no longer challenging but simply frustrating. The enemies will often bombard you with bullets, sometimes filling the screen, which would be a fun a challenge if your mech could actually move fast enough to avoid them. The maneuverability of your mobile suit leaves a lot to be desired and the awkward controls wouldn't be such an issue if the enemies and obstacles were carefully planned around these deficiencies. Unfortunately, they are not, which resulted in me dying countless times. If it's not the speed that's the problem, sometimes it's not visually obvious whether or not something on screen will actually damage you. Sometimes the smoke from explosions (mostly cause by your own bullets) obscures the stuff that will actually kill you, giving you no time to respond when it becomes visible. Other times the "bullets" themselves aren't distinct enough to provide a visual cue that they need to be avoided. Sometimes it's both, and more often than not there's so much happening on screen that it's a headache to even process it all. This wouldn't be such a problem if you could move fast enough to deal with it.\nWhile the mech's movement is painfully slow in the standard levels, at the other end of the spectrum are the zero-g levels, which are frustrating because there is simply too much movement. Every time you move your mech it starts to spin, which can be overcome by holding the "fixed angle button", which locks where you're facing at that given moment. This is fine when you only have to shoot things coming from the right, as you can just jam the button down and move freely while shooting in a single direction. If you have to shoot up or down then it quickly becomes a mess because simply trying to get yourself to face the right way is counter-intuitive, and if the level happens to automatically scroll (as some of them do) chances are you'll be crushed by a wall before you manage to correct your position. If the enemies don't kill you, chances are the level will.\nIn most run and gun games, the screen either scrolls automatically or moves with the player. In Gunhound, facing the other way causes the visual area to shift, which sounds useful in theory but proves annoying in practice when merely trying to run backwards to avoid enemy fire causes you to lose sight of the very thing you're trying to keep tabs on.\nSomething as simple as jumping isn't as straightforward as it should be, either. You have booster packs which have a delayed start, which makes it pointlessly difficult to time your jumps in order dodge the incoming barrage of bullets, lasers and missiles the game frequently throws at you. Sometimes the bullets are so big or so frequent, jumping them is pointless because the limited boost capabilities mean you just fall back into the line of fire. The developers have probably attempted to add an element of realism by making the Gunhound have to work against gravity so much, but it just adds to the frustration of gaming experience.\nIt's also possible to glide along the floor using the booster, but if you jump to avoid an obstacle, when you land the shock absorbers kick in which momentarily delays your movement, which completely throws off the timing of any subsequent jumps and therefore ruins the fluidity of motion that boosting ought to give you. Furthermore, the apparent weight of the mech and the slow boosting makes the flying levels hell on earth. Holding the boosters (eventually) shoots you to the top of the screen, while letting go of the boosters for more than a split-second will cause you to plummet to your death as you fall faster than the boosters can fully activate.\nI'm all for games that require good reflexes to win, but, for me at least, the timing required for some parts of the game is beyond what is physically possible. For example, airborne enemies will swoop in, fire a missile and leave the screen before you even have time to react and shoot them down. Generally, there's a disconnect between what is needed to win and what you are given. The game demands speed as the various enemies and obstacles require nimble movement to be overcome, but what you're given simply doesn't meet that requirement.\nI love run and gun games like Metal Slug and I love mecha, but this game falls short in so many ways.\nGet it in the sale if you're really curious but for the most part you're not really missing out.","May 29, 2015","false","6.3"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

I'm only on the 2nd mission at the moment (and having difficulty getting thru the Simulations, which I'm currently attempting) -- and it took me MANY tries to get thru the first mission... but like any good platformer, keeping at it pays off and the game keeps you thinking "just one more try".\n\nReally, Gunhound is like an awesome 16-bit era mech game... with modern design sensibilities.  You can attempt the missions individually, with the game saving in between.  There are Steam achievements (based on score) and trading cards.   And the control scheme is fully customizable for keyboard or gamepad -- and, for me, this is a game that BEGS to be played with a nice gamepad.\n\nThe only negatives I can think of at all really translate into positives for a lot of people.  The first is the difficulty, as I mentioned.  Part of this is because certain enemies and obstacles are very difficult to deal with, due to the difficulties of piloting a mech.  Also, aiming takes a bit of time to get used to, and getting the hang of the boosters.  But the control scheme really does make it seem like you're controlling a heavy mech -- and ditching your armor makes it MUCH more nimble.  In case anyone's wondering, the controls are NOT in the least unresponsive... just heavy.  The difficulty of the levels themselves is likely a positive for many people, and there IS an "Easy Mode" that you can turn on if desired.  Other than that, some people may be turned off by the fact that there's no English full-audio.  Even with all in-game text and subtitles in English, the audio tracks are in Japanese.  Personally, I don't mind this one bit and many people would probably see it as a positive -- being able to hear the original (high production value) voice-overs rather than some (potentially crappy) dub.  Lastly, and the only aspect of the game thus far that I can say is truly a net negative, is the fact that you can't skip thru the introductions / voice-over segments.  While the story is one of the high-points of the game, sometimes the levels will take a lot of dying and trying again... so it sometimes gets tedious hearing the same thing over and over without any ability to skip it.  This is the ONE change I'd like to see made in a patch -- but that's it.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of 16-bit games from the golden days of 2D action, fans of mechs, fans of anime, and anyone who enjoys a challenge!  And, this game is quite likely worth the full asking price... but the Holiday Sale price is absolutely nuts!!  This game is DEFINITELY worth a lot more than $2.99!","December 26, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You pilot a Gunhound, a large mech with lots of guns and missiles and stuff. Imagine if Contra and Galaga had a baby, and you've got a pretty good idea of what Gunhound EX is like.\n\nWith a game like this, I don't really care much about the story. Other reviews say it has a pretty good one, but honestly I wasn't paying enough attention to know. With this kind of game, it's all about using your mech to blow stuff up, and Gunhound EX does that pretty well.\n\nThe problem is the controls. Gunhound EX is a direct port of the PSP game, and as such, it assumes you're using the PSP controls. I had to just mash buttons on my keyboard before I finally found out that "A" is the Z key, and I'm still not entirely sure what the other buttons are. I got sick of using the keyboard, and just plugged in an XBox controller.\n\nThis game doesn't have controller support, so I had to go into the options menu (which is hard enough, since the default controls are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥) and re-bind the keys to my controller. Once I finally figured all that out, I was actually able to play the game.\n\nThe game itself is quite a bit of fun. It's very reminiscent of the old NES games I played as a kid, and anyone who follows my reviews will know that I'm a sucker for a 2D side-scroller. Gunhound EX hits all the high points, with colorful graphics, countless enemies, frustrating boss fights, and even a countdown on the "Replay" screen similar to old NES games like Contra.\n\nThe graphics are mediocre at best. It looks like an exact port from a PSP, made for a PSP-sized screen. And that's exactly what it is. But when playing on a computer, the graphics look somewhat hazy. Not exactly blurry, just undefined. It's like when you take a low-resolution picture and blow it up 20x, which is not a good look for a bullet hell game.\n\nOnce you get the controls figured out, it's still a pretty difficult control scheme compared to the NES glory days. There are buttons for shoot, punch, jump and dash, plus a button to make your mech drop some armor in exchange for increased mobility, and another button to aim your missiles. Combining dash and jump, all while shooting your enemies, requires multi-tasking skills and a lot of timing which only comes by trial and error. The mech is heavy, as a giant metal exoskeleton should be, so the reaction time of your mech is very slow and sometimes you'll end up relying on your armor to save you rather than your finesse as a gamer.\n\nAll told, Gunhound EX is a decent game, but nothing super special. The controls nearly killed it for me, and the only reason I kept playing it after that first frustrating hour was because I wanted to actually play the game so I could review it. After that frustrating hour of figuring out the controls, though, I actually started enjoying the game. If you want a game with controls that actually make sense, or if you don't like old-looking games with pixelated graphics, then I suggest you pass on this one. But if you enjoy the nostalgia of a game that feels like something from a bygone "Golden Era," then try Gunhound EX. But do yourself a favor, and use a controller instead of a keyboard.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

While it's not as good as those classics it's a really fun game despite being really short and, unless you're really into mastering these types of games, not very replayable. According to Steam it took me less than three hours to beat the game and I don't see myself playing it again, there's unlockable weapons you can earn that might change the way you play, but it wasn't enough for me to want to keep playing over and over. That being said if you're into this genre you're probably expecting a compact experience that packs a lot of action into a small package and doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nThe biggest issue is that the levels are pretty simple and don't force you to play the game well. You have three different weapons and a melee and in theory you should be using the right weapon at the right time I just inched my way through the level using the lock-on missiles for everything. Yeah if you're perfecting the game for highscores moving fast and attacking well will be important, but I don't see most people getting that into it. A few sections force you to be quick and precise, but not nearly enough. Fortunately this game shines in the boss battles where you're forced to gracefully pilot your mech and use the correct weapon. They're all over the top and challenging and they force you to up your game. The controls are kind of clunky, but in a good intentional way. It make you feel like you're piloting a big, bulky mech and it gives you the tools to be graceful despite the limitation. I also like the health system where, once your health is low you can eject your armor to gain another health bar and you'll be quicker without the weight but can take less hits.\n\nAlso of note is that this game has too much dialogue. It's okay when it's happening in the background while you're playing, but it's frustrating when the game stops to play through a dialogue sequence, especially if it's one you'll have to go through again if you die. This was really frustrating with the final boss as you'll have button mash though his monologue every time you retry it. I felt more engaged in a game like Gunstar Heroes where the marginal story is told through short goofy in-game animations that only take a few seconds to play out.\n\nGiven how short it is it's hard to recommend it at full price, but if you can grab it on sale it's a few hours of solid old-school action.","May 20, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
