It's pretty short, and should give you a good idea whether or not you'll actually enjoy this game.\n\nYou'll probably notice that there was no sort of interactivity involved in playing Juniper's Knot, aside from clicking to progress to the next line of text. This is more or less how Dysfunctional Systems plays, except this game actually has moments where you get to choose from a short list of options what you (Winter) should do. However, there aren't many times you actually get to do this, and it is actually possible to play through the entire story by only making a single decision. All of the choice moments in the game are placed together around half-way through the game, and they only lead to two endings. The ending you get is determined entirely by whether or not you can convince your mentor (Cyrus) to listen to what you have to say, and not do what he initially decides he should do in order to solve the problem he's given. I wouldn't consider either ending to be a "good ending", but I suppose that's why this is only the first episode in the series.\n\nAs for how the game looks and sounds, the artstyle is similar to Juniper's Knot's, and you can listen to the ost on YouTube, so you can decide for yourself if you like those parts before you buy the game. If you really like the sountrack, you can find all 18 tracks in both flac and mp3 format in the game's files.\n\nThis game is short. I'm not a fast reader, but I played through this the first time in only about two and a half hours, then about another hour to get the second ending. You can get more playtime by going through all the routes for the achievements for a little extra replayability, but there's a guide on the game's community hub that'll tell you exactly what routes you need to go through to unlock all the achievements.\n\nAfter a successful Kickstarter campaign, episode 2 of Dysfunctional Systems is planned to be released by September later this year, and episode 3 by March 2015. Until these episodes are finished and released to the public, the story in this game is incomplete. If you're looking for a complete story, then you should at least wait until the next two episodes come out.\n\nEDIT: Yeah, Dysfunctional Systems is dead. Basically, a bunch of stuff happened [dischan.co] that caused the devs to stop working on episodes 2 and 3. The prequel will be released, but other than that, it's not certain if we will ever see more from this series. Because of this, if you're going to buy this game, know that you probably will never be able to get the full story that was planned out for this game, and what is available isn't all that much.","January 5, 2014","true","8.3"," 222 of 233 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","222","233","0","13"

Its story is incomplete and will probably never be completed. In the end by paying $5 for this you'll have 1.5 hours of prologue that is, in itself, not nearly enough to leave you satisfied.\n\nUpdate: As of July 14th, 2015 Dischan Media has officially shut down. Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos will not be reinvigorated.\n\nGame review:\n\nDysfunctional Systems is a visual novel about, as the title inclines, the managing of chaos. The premise of dysfunctional systems revolves around an organisation in some technological utopia that sends meddlers to other worlds to solve their problems and reclaim order. It's an interesting concept, but it's not too different from what we've seen before. That said, it doesn't mean dysfunctional systems has no potential, in fact it has loads of potential. Too bad none of that really matters.\n\nThe story is basically an introduction to the universe and it's characters. We get to see the main characters do their jobs as meddlers in a world that is having diplomatic problems. Things escalate, I won't spoil anything, I'll just say that: it's way too short to develop anything outside of a prologue to the other episodes. Yes, there is a story in it, no you're probably not going to cry over it. It isn't insanely good and it isn't bad. At best this will leave you wanting more, where the problem of an abandoned project reels in again.\n\nEven if an incomplete story wouldn't bother you, this first episode leaves too much to be desired and too many questions to be asked. The game is way too short to accomplish any real world building, something that is so important when your game is literally about travelling and meddling in the affairs of other worlds.\n\nThe characters, focusing on the two main ones, consist of your basic grumpy teacher and stubborn student. That's not to say the characters aren't enjoyable or not well written, they share some funny and touching moments. It's just that the game is simply way too short to develop any character properly. Thus we are left with... again, nothing special.\n\nThen there are the choices, which are very important to get right when you make something in this medium. It is unfortunately something dysfunctional functions had a serious lack of. The entire game basically has 1 choice. 1 choice in the entire thing. After this one choice dysfunctional systems might (depending on what you choose) present you 2-or so more rather confusing choices. Too bad none of these matter. At all. The only difference is that you'll be getting a different achievement.\n\nSomething I can praise dysfunctional systems about is it's amazing art and music.\nThe art, although perhaps a bit repetitive at times, looks amazing, there isn't a whole lot of animation but that's alright, in the end I wasn't expecting there to be any. The UI is really good, everything fits together nicely and I actually enjoyed reading the few codex entries there were, as bland as they may be. As for the music, it was very nicely done. You won't have the same track looping every other sequence or anything like that here. Good stuff, Ill probably end up listening to it more in the future.\n\nThe real reason you shouldn't buy this:\n\nAfter all that I do feel the need to honestly say that Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is not a bad visual novel at all, at least, as a prologue. Sure, it doesn't hit all the good spots and the lack of choices is pretty disappointing. But that doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. It does it's job as a prologue - it gets you excited for more whilst giving a basic introduction of the universe.\n\nThe real reason you shouldn't buy this is because the developer abandoned the two sequels that were originally planned. Reason? Financial problems and a lack of motivation. The development team did a poor job of financing the funds received from the kickstarter campaign. People have lost a lot of their trust for the developers, and righteously so, it was one big mistake after another for the dev team and the death of Dysfunctional Systems as a result of that. It's a real shame, I would have liked to see more from this.\n\nSo, in the end Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos gives us a 1.5 hour prologue of a story that will probably never be made. Whether you are willing to spend $5 on that is your choice, but I personally wouldn't recommend it.","January 12, 2015","false","4.3"," 234 of 249 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","234","249","5","6"

It is important to know that this genre is less gameplay, and more of a narrative through combining visual design and audio work. The few gameplay options are that of "dialogue choices", which you might be more familiar with in case of Mass Effect, choose-your-own-adventure kind of novels, or point-and-click adventure games. Each episode will present dialogue choices that'll affect the story outcome for future episodes.\n\nThe game takes places in a utopian world, where you play as Winter Harrison, a young 14 year old girl who is pursueing the career of a mediator. But what is a mediator? A mediator takes the job of travelling to chaotic worlds and attempts to restore order by finding the root of the cause and remedy it through various methods. The first chapter follows Winter's second meditation, where she shadows an experienced mediator, Cyrus Addington, who will mentor her through the process of solving a poverty stricken country known as Brighton.\n\nThe game features beautiful artwork, an amazing soundtrack, and interesting writing style that can't help but draw me in. My only complaint is that it is unfortunately short, but being only $5 is more than worth the price (since it comes with an amazing soundtrack, did I mention its really good?) and definitely a cheap investment for a new interactive experience.\n\nIf you have any confusion or are sitting on the fence of investing the money to playing this game, I recommend trying out Juniper's Knot, its a free game that Dischan made that'll introduce you to either visual novels or their style of production a little bit better.","October 10, 2013","true","3.8"," 160 of 173 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","160","173","0","0"

It's been a long time since a VN I've played had a story that was so engaging and held my interest so much.

But like others, I can't, in good conscience, recommend anyone purchase this game.\n\nYou see, after finishing this first episode, I raced to the forums to see when I could expect the next installment to show up.  Alas, I found the message, dated over a month ago, stating that Dysfunctional Systems was no more and that future episodes would most likely not see the light of day.  I still hold a small hope for that one miracle to happen though.\n\nSo, while you may feel free to ignore my (and others') non-recommendation and purchase this game, you will still be receiving an excellent piece of writing and an excellent game in general.

Even fans of the genre can admit that some of them are boring and disinteresting. That said, Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is one of the best visual novels I have “played” to date. Instead of relying on cartoon drawings of “waifus” in underwear to keep your interest, it actually has a very interesting and well-told story. (But don't worry, there are still some cartoon drawings of "waifus" in underwear). The artwork is high quality and the soundtrack is one my personal favorites in the realm of video games. In fact, it’s one of my favorite music albums in general, but I also like that genre of music a lot. Anyway, if you like a good sci-fi tale, and enjoy visual novels with real substance, this is one you probably want to consider trying.\n\nUnfortunately, the game was intended to be episodic and it does end on a cliffhanger; and at this time it seems unlikely the development team is going to be able to produce more installments. Such is life. There is still a very interesting and self-contained story within the game that I think most sci-fi fans will find interesting. You can just ignore the epilogue and still enjoy the primary narrative. If you think you would like this game, but only don’t want to try it because of the open ending, then that is your choice. But I think you will be missing out.\n\nThe universe created and the primary storyline are both products of premiere sci-fi writing. I was enthralled the entire time. The soundtrack is comprised of amazing songs, and each one perfectly captures the emotion of the game at the time it is played. The art style is mostly traditional and nothing overtly special, but it also is pleasantly not overloaded with stereotypical anime cringe and unnecessary sexuality. It is a nice, well-produced visual novel that can be taken seriously.\n\nDysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos isn’t for everyone, but I think it will appeal to fans of good sci-fi and fans of the standard visual novel paradigm. Yes, it is unfortunate that we (probably) won’t get any more installments set in this universe, but this visual novel is still very highly enjoyable. Some things will be left unanswered, but that happens all the time in storytelling.\n\nAnd, honestly, if you can find it for a good price, I would recommend it for the soundtrack alone. I know music tastes are highly subjective, but damn do I love these tunes.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","January 3","true","3.6"," 79 of 87 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","79","87","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/248800/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The sad irony of Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos, is it comes so very close to standing alone but in a last minute effort, fully commits to setting up more episodes we’re all but certain never to see.\n\nLet’s back up for a moment though. Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel following Winter and Cyrus, who play the part of mediators: peace keepers of sorts to the different distant worlds surrounding their own. It’s their job to step in when things become too extreme, and ensure a world doesn’t destroy itself in acts of war.\n\nLearning to Manage Chaos then, is Winter training to learn how exactly someone is capable of keeping a world in check, especially in times of extreme turmoil. If anything though, this is more the story of Winter growing as a person than a mediator, her naivety and innocence being tested as she’s thrown into situations where there is no right decision and not everyone is going to come out alive.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for authors to craft ignorant protagonists or side characters so as to have an easy stepping off point for relaying important details to the reader, which characters should likely already know, but Dysfunctional System manages to very rarely fall into that trap of artificial stupidity. Winter feels authentic in her cluelessness about the larger world, being only fourteen but having her heart in the right place. Her actions and ways of thinking are often flawed, but her internal indecision and discomfort of wrestling between what she believes is right and what she’s being told is logical feel very relatable and sincere. She’s been living a life in a pristine society, where the concept of war is difficult to even imagine, so being flung into a far less peaceful and sustainable world comes at more than a small shock.\n\nCyrus, her mentor, is the counterpoint to Winter’s pleas for peaceful discussion and her fear at wandering into a world she doesn’t understand. He’s calculating and experienced, but also cold and seemingly worn down by the things he’s had to do for the sake of keeping worlds alive. His discussions with Winter are often full of frustration, but the glimpses of understanding that poke through give him the feeling of more than just an old, mean-spirited teacher. He’s smart and recognizes that Winter isn’t prepared for the role of a mediator, but he wants to ensure she gains the experience needed, which even if uncomfortable isn’t anything like what she’ll eventually have to face.\n\nMost of Learning to Manage Chaos takes place between only these two characters, and the back and forth between them is surprisingly compelling. Their dialogues can get heated, but developer Dischan Media does a fantastic job leveraging this between brief moments of humor (such as Winter trying her first bear) to create a very personal, relatable feeling to every interaction. The core plot holds no great weight in all of this, being a tool to spark conversation but without much depth in and of itself, but it’s a short outing that manages a great amount of character development before then closing in a scene that while not perfectly finite, feels complete.\n\nBut then the screen comes back and here is where Dysfunctional Systems unfortunately suffers as at the time the first episode was being developed it was still believed future episodes were on the way. The fact is that development has been put on perpetual hiatus, dying after internal troubles caused the project to fall through and any hope of seeing the series completed along with it. This wouldn’t factor in nearly as heavily to Learning to Manage Chaos if it wasn’t for the extended epilogue that comes after the credits. It’s a series of exchanges which don’t exactly propel the plot forward, but leave it in an awkward state of uncompleted development. It disrupts the finality the episode originally ends with, and itself feels rather unpolished, with an abundance of useless dialogue and very limited artwork (most of the epilogue takes place in a sort of text only terminal)\n\nSo there’s the clincher. Dysfunctional Systems is an engaging visual novel, with a wonderful art style and a brilliant score, but it’s a story you have to commit at the start to being left hanging with. It’s hard for me to say then if I recommend giving it a chance. I’m caught between my enjoyment of what it is, and disappointment at what it will never become. It’s a weird place to find a game, and it’s not a judgement call I’d be able to make for anyone else.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 18, 2015","true","6.5"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","46","50","0","0"

Sound effects are well used too overall really a good job of fitting into the Visual Novel's environment.\n\nReasons for a neutral standDysfunctional Systems Episode 1: Learning to Manage Chaos is in an episodic format providing episode by episode is satisfying, while still leaving you wanting more.

A visual novel being sold on Steam does raise some eyebrows, but nonetheless I decided to give it a go, and I was pleasantly surprised after reading the disappointing World End Economica a while back.\n\nAlthough Dysfunctional Systems is an original English language (OEL) visual novel, which is generally a good indicator of poor quality, my past experience with another OEL VN (Katawa Shoujo) was actually rather good, so I wasn't deterred from the beginning. Overall, the visual novel was quite good, all things considered, but we can take a bit of a deeper look into things.\n\nFirst thing's first: the writing. I can't vouch for the story being fresh and original, but it was well executed regardless. The characters' personalities were generally consistent and the story developed in a logical order. However, the visual novel was painstakingly short. I felt like I was just thrown into the middle of things, and even though the story wasn't too complex to figure out what was going on, a longer introduction would've been welcomed with open arms. There's also the issue of how easy it is to get to the bad end. After several playthroughs of making and recording different decisions, in desperate search of the good end, I was sorely disappointed to find that there was none. As it stands, the story is good, but much too short for my liking, and a lot more content is due. The ratio of number of choices to length of story was horribly skewed in the wrong direction, but I can respect the amount of tedious coding it would've taken to link everything together the way it was done.\n\nTechnically, the English was rather good. It was by no means perfect, but it made good use of stylistic devices and all of the other things English professors like to rant on about for an easy-to-read experience. There were a few mistakes that the more pedantic of us (such as myself) may wince at, and the word choice was often pretentious, to say the least, but otherwise, Dysfunctional Systems was well written. If anything, it was better than the disgrace World End Economica was, which I can only imagine was a machine translation done by an IBM 5200.\n\nOn to the art and sound - long story short, they were also quite good. While the drawing didn't exactly fit the conventional visual novel clique, there was something about the brushed watercolour style art that appealed to me. All the ren'py animations (yeah, I actually bothered to look through the game files to confirm it was a ren'py game) were used well and surprisingly weren't skimped on - this kind of production quality I can appreciate. I'm not much of an audiophile, but I can also vouch for the soundtrack being great on its own. In the game, it can be a bit overpowering at times, but the volume controls presumably exist solely for that purpose. If only they had some voice acting to go with it - in Japanese, of course, since I'm a filthy weeaboo and English sucks - but alas, one can only dream.\n\nIt might seem like I'm bashing the game pretty harshly here - and that's probably true - but I actually did enjoy the game. Although it was extremely short (short enough for me to get 100% completion after only 3 hours), and there were the other issues I'd mentioned previously, it was an interesting story and fun to read. Even though I'm bringing it up again - the sheer lack of content was detrimental to the score I gave - we mustn't forget to interpret the ten point scale correctly. 5/10 is perfectly average, and not garbage by any means. Going from there, 6/10 isn't a bad score, despite what IGN and whatnot want you to believe - but that's a story for another time. I know episodes 2 and 3 of this series are due to come soon, though, so hopefully they can make up for where this episode fell short and salvage the trilogy as a whole.","September 14, 2014","true","3.8"," 52 of 69 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","52","69","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuatari/recommended/248800/","Fuatari","「Ｂｏｋｕ♥」","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuatari/","552 products in account","Dysfunctional Systems is a visual novel that attempts to portray the idea of a utopian society using their advanced magic dimension-tripping technology and superior history and intellect to help guide other planets in subtle ways -- managing their "chaos". However, Episode 1 presents itself as more of a teaser than an actual iteration in a series due to its short length (two hours is more than enough time to rinse this out), lack of choices and minimal explanation of who or what is really happening in the utopian society.\n\nGiven that the start of the game (and store page) makes a point to mention how "Your choices affect the story" theres a distinct lack of any choices to be made. Which is doubly odd as the game takes care to give you a codex with which to keep you up to speed with the world and current trends or plot devices. This may be a personal qualm but I expected it to come in to some use when it came to "managing the chaos" of the world, such as reading it granting an insight into how to take action, but instead the sole decision you get to make in this title has but four resolutions resulting in two endings that you make through a series of choices that are mostly red herrings. This makes the codex feel rather unwarranted as everyone always explains themselves in enough detail such that reading it is a waste of effort.\n\nThe writing itself feels quite contrived: characters and, in this episode, countries presented are almost painting-by-numbers in their given role. I mean, who hasnt heard the one about the gruff, old mentor with a plucky, slightly rebellious voice-of-reason apprentice. Or the one about the two large nations stuck in a [cold] war over a third, smaller independence.\n\nThat being said, credit where credit is due, the game does look lovely. The UI is clean and distinct, backgrounds are nicely detailed and the character portraits display many emotions in a variety of poses. Most of all it feels consistent -- portraits dont just sit on top of the background but instead fit in, general colours and tone do well to make this.\n\nI can only really hope that future episodes really expand on what I would only really call an extended teaser here.","September 1, 2014","false","2.7"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","37","46","0","0"

However, I cannot in good conscience recommend this for many people. Let me explain.\n\nFirstly, what I did like about Dysfunctional Systems. While very short, the story is extremely compelling in terms of the writing, and especially the premise, which is very unique and one of my favorite aspects. The interface is very slick and polished, and the art and character design is fantastic. I absolubtely loved my short romp through the world(s) of Dysfunctional Systems, and I sincerely wish I could spend more time in that world.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to why I ultimately cannot recommend Dysfunctional Systems despite its fantastic setting, storywriting, and art direction. Dysfunctional Systems was originally created with the intent of being a 3 episode series, which was funded through kickstarter. However, Dischan, the creators of Dysfunctional Systems have confirmed the cancellation of the release of the next installment of Dysfunctional Systems, and have put the entire series on indefinite hiatus, and most likely permanent cancellation.\n\nI cannot recommend Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos because the entire VN was clearly centered around the notion that it fit into a greater story, and the endings of Learning to Manage Chaos are clearly structered around this assumption. While Learning to Manage Chaos is a great story for what it is, it does not work very well as a standalone story.\n\nIf you are willing to play what was suppossed to be the opening for a greater story, then go ahead and get Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos. If you feel like you will be dissapointed by the notion the story is incomplete, then please avoid this title.\n\nIt's a pity really because I really did like the premise and setting of Dysfunctional Systems.","January 17, 2015","false","2.8"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","0"

It is a visual novel, essentially a choose-your-own-adventure game on your computer. It has plenty of good points: the art is good, the premise is interesting, the setting is introduced nicely, and I found the characters entertaining. The problem with Dysfunctional Systems is that it does not have many interaction points, at least not in the path that I took. Along the path that I selected, I was able to branch the story only twice. I can understand that as the first episode in what seems to be a planned series Dysfunctional Systems wants to keep its possible end states manageable, but the game would have been vastly improved by adding a few more interaction points, even if they did not actually impact the story.\n\nAs it stands, Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos would probably have been better served by being a graphic novel than a game. If the premise interests you, then by all means buy it. It is an interesting story, but its gameplay value, at least at this point, is limited.","November 28, 2013","false","1.6"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","28","36","0","0"

It's a wonderfully well written and incredibly interesting story about a young girl named Winter who is studying to become a "mediator", a dimension hopping negotiator who seeks to help solve the chaotic problems that exist across the multiverse. However, on her second mediation, things take an intriguing turn, and it's up to the player to see how the story plays out, making choices along the way that will supposedly influence further events in the series, similar to Telltale's Walking Dead games.\n\nThis is a story from the guys who made Juniper's Knot, another fantastic (and free, so you should play it) visual novel. The writing is top notch, the story is well crafted and takes a few unexpected turns, and in general is quite the joy to experience.

But I'm gonna try.\n\nLearning to Manage Chaos is Part 1 of the Dysfunctional Systems visual novel series. It follows the story of Winter Harrison, a student at some kind of... orginization? It's never too clear. Regardless, you follow the story of Winter and help to make choices that lead to multiple endings, each with varying differences.\n\nThe story is amazing. It takes place during a futuristic, post-apocalypse setting, where technology to travel between planets in an instant is available. The characters are all unique and very engaging, making you take sides very often in the story. (Go, Winter!~) For someone like me who likes to escape reality (assignments most of all) it is amazing. It constantly keeps you on your toes, and for the amount of value the story offers, the price is soooo worth it.\n\nThe artwork is goregeous. An almost rustic, stylized and crisp style brings alive, simple yet powerful character designs and image stills for the story events. If you're someone like me who loves a good browse through artwork, the images are available after a certain point.\n\nFinally, the music. What's better than a soundtrack that caresses your ears like a silk glove on your bare bre- arms. I mean arms. What can be better than that?

This Visual Novel just made it on my top favorite list, tied up with my pavlove: Corpse Party. This just might be the most political, phylosofic, and sweetest experience that i had this week. After telling you that you should totally buy this game and all the episodes as they come by, let's get to the review:\n\nGraphics and General Design: Pretty beautiful to look at. Everything's detailed and the drawing is just too good to look at. All the scenes are perfectly shown and make you feel completely immersed on the story. Seriously, this is indie and we're talking about some high quality visuals here. Take Dangan Ronpa for instance, it has a visual that assembles a lot of it (When you aren't on the 3D parts, obviously enough). All characters looks charismatic enough to make me instant fall in love with then, and getting a good look at the extras, i can tell that they really put an effort to make the best presentation possible in this first episode.\n\nGameplay: It's a Visual Novel, you will read and read A LOT. But that's okay, because that's what this genre is. I like medias that can make me read something that don't hurt my eyes so much like a book and has some kind of interaction of the player. The interaciton on the first episode consists of opening your codex (I'm serious) and choosing. That's the big card in the game. I loved every pathway that i did (You can see that i have already unlocked every achievement for this game) and i have two profiles for the next episodes: The one that i called "good choises" and the one "♥♥♥♥ choises". As i do with multiple endings/pathways games (Take The Walking Dead for instance). Like every other good game that follow this pattern, the game makes choosing hard and, even if you think your choise was right, you will think twice and realize it just wasn't. It was "a little shitier" than the other ones (Again, like the walking dead). Since this game talks a lot about polict and ethics, it is a pretty interesting system to say the least. "Reading and doing multiple pathways, only to be tired enough to sleep" doesn't exists here. The game has two kinds of saves: One that you can always acess, either you quit the game or not, and works like a normal one and quicksaves, that works for saving time when doing other pathways. Also, the game has a skip mode, it will skip all the text that has already been presented to the player, so you will never read the same thing twice.  Which is kinda cool. If a kind of system like this could've existed on Corpse Party series, i wouldn't have waster +50 hours of my life to get all the endings for both games (I know, right. I suck :P).\n\nSoundtrack: Holy mackina, my ears are so pleased. The opening song is awesome, the game song is awesome, the ambient sound is awesome...But i kinda missed voice acting. I know it isn't much common in Visual Novels to use it, but at least they could do some especific (And important) lines to make us even more attached to the characters, like in the other Visual Novels that i have already mentioned.\n\nStory: Oh boy. I don't know how i tell the story of this game without spoiling it, so here you go: Discover for yourself. It's really thrilling, it has heavy amounts of extra information that you can always see in your codex and one of the most beautiful written dialogues that i've ever seen. All characters feel human and you can easily understand they personality as soon as you come in the game. The plot consists of travelling through multiple worlds/dimensions and dealing with chaos, trying to solve this alternate beings problems. But these aren't just ordinary problems (They exist, as mentioned in the game), they involve a lot of thinking and toughs that will make the player guessing and giving his own opinion about what's happening (Even though the game can't hear you xD). It's really explorable and has a good universe to develop the plot and such. Also, characters presented at the end of the game already make me feels that episode 2 is going to be epic.\n\nThis first episode might be short in your first playthrough, but you can explore many things. Multiple endings, many information and such a work of new scenes and drawings makes replayability a possible thing and it's sure as hell worth it. Also: This game has the best anime opening that i've seen this year. Period. Buy this NOW. (Especially because it's -80%, it's SO worth it!).

It almost feels like 3 different games. The Beginning: Some weird, dry, long drawn out conversation between two people about mundane stuff. The Middle: A political intrigue thriller about trying to stop a war. The End: Some fan servicey cliche Anime dorm stuff.\n\nYou can probably tell I think the middle was the strongest part. At the same time even there it falls short for me because the choices ultimately don't make a difference and the same thing happens no matter what you do.\n\nI think this visual novel works best when it focuses on plot, but they've sandwiched that in between character stuff which for me just really wasn't that interesting. I foundthe main character annoying and the way you're dropped into the story without really having it explained what the deal is was odd. They're talking how strange and alien the people on that world were but from most people's point of view playing this I'd venture that the main characters are much more alien.\n\nThough I did like the plot when Dysfunctional Systems actually gets around to it, I've played other Visual Novels where I was more connected to the characters and felt more invested due to more and more meaningful choices.\n\nThe Jisei / Kansei / Yousei trilogy for example (which was also in the Groupees Build a Doujin Bundle) I found much more interactive and engaging.\n\nIf you have Dysfunctional Systems from the Groupees bundle then by all means grab the Steam key but I don't think it's worth bumping to the top your play list.

While that may seem confusing at first the concept I have never seen done before with the information in the game being well flushed out and researched. The story consumed me, and I felt for the main character as she tried to resolve the problems she was having with the way her teacher went about and did things. I felt for her as she tried to face her problems. A very well thought-out and written game. Much better than anything anime is putting out these days!\n\nThe art is well done. It has a more handmade feel about it looking more paint like than anything. Art is a taste which I can not decide for you so the final descision about it will ulitimently have to be made by you, I am sorry you have to do so much work.\n\nThe next game in the series has been cancled and I am not sure if the company will continue it. A very sad thought for me considering how much I loved the story in this game, but if you are looking for a short game to pass the time and love rich story that is very unique buy this game and do not look back!\n\nHoped this helped!","June 24, 2015","true","3.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefoolorpheus/recommended/248800/","thefoolorpheus","FoolishOrpheus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefoolorpheus/","84 products in account","TL;DR: Too short for $5, buy on sale or wait for the other episodes and buy them together. Not interesting, tends to get boring. Lack of a sense of urgency, time literally flies by without you noticing. Main character is boring, has what feels like an entire section set up for characterization and does nothing with it. Seemingly lesbian character outed for no particular reason and also has an achievement seemingly based on the fact that she is lesbian for no particular reason. Not a branching story, incredibly streamline with only one real choice in the whole game.\n\nI like Dischan's other visual novel and I wanted this because I thought it would be similar. While that game wasn't branching, it was somewhat thought provoking (even if it's an overused idea that they went with as far as the moral quandry in that game) but for a free game it was really good. With money behind them, I thought they'd make something interesting. Sure enough, they came up with an interesting idea for a new game.\n\nThen promptly went nowhere with it.\n\nThis game is unbelievably short-- I beat it twice and spent three hours trying to get all of the achievements, which I haven't completed at the time of this recommendation-- and it's not even interesting the entire way through. You could potentially divide the story into three parts (though really it's just two if you consider the first and second part the same thing): The Prologue, the Supposed Interesting Part, and the Lesbian(?) Dormitory.\n\nIn the Prologue, there's a very shoehorned in "characterization" of the main character, which is fine but not very well done. But you don't make any choices here. You're meant to use this time to learn about the main character Winter, but she's just so boring and straightlaced and you don't even know why she adheres to the rules so much. She has flashes of her past, which I think was a device to make her interesting, but those are quickly forgotten or pushed to the wayside. She doesn't say anything interesting and mostly whines for the entire introduction. Since the player knows her thoughts, it's made worse by the attempts to make the user "bond" with her. It doesn't work because there's nothing to bond with. She's just some rule-follower who seems upset to be...not following rules. Her mentor is clearly her opposite, but nothing interesting happens with him in the beginning.\n\nThe Supposed Interesting Part is, by naming convention alone, supposed to be interesting. It starts out interestingly enough, but then immediately falls off. You're given a time limit, which is a great way to put pressure on the player. What are you doing? Trying to prevent a giant loss that has a lot of political backing to it. Also interesting. There seem to be tons of different ways to proceed too, which is why it's a shame this game lets you pick between a whopping two different things. And both of them are watered down into very simplistic, almost meaningless drivel. The main character talks alot about death, but there's no weight to it. Nothing makes you feel urgent or makes you want to help the maincharacter. In fact, there's a sense of urgency to the whole game that isn't done well-- you don't know how much time has passed or is passing, and you're not doing anything but blindly following this mentor character who isn't explaining his motivations. You only have one story branching choice and the character will moan and whine unless you pick the one she's been leaning towards the whole time. It would be interesting if her choice actually affected anything, but it doesn't. You don't learn much new information no matter which you pick. The idea that you have four hours to save the world, which essentially is the entire midgame, is rendered almost useless by the watered down argument of morals that follows your choice, and then immediately afterwards, everything comes to a climax. Compartively, a game like 999 makes 9 hours feel like an eternity in the game and out of the game. This game's rush to get to the climax makes it more chore-like than game-like.\n\nIn the final stretch, the game goes into a fantasy mode I don't quite understand. The main character spends her time either sulking or trying to be funny with her roommate, who makes very many lesbian references but doesn't follow through (you even get an achievement called Undertones for no real reason after the lesbian-esque speaking) and while there's nothing wrong with gay characters and they don't need to have a reason to be gay or anything like that... what is the point of highlighting it so much? It ruins the end of the game because now whenever this new character comes up, she'll just be "the lesbian roommate" instead of "the roommate". Plus there's not much explaination on this other Earth, so they say a lot of things with no real explaination and people stop by and say things that make sense but it'd be nice to have more information. What's a Northwesterner? I guess they come from the Northwest. That's about all you get from the game. You have no real notion of space or time, everything's so divorced from the player that it makes the game boring.\n\nTo sum up: This game is not worth buying alone and definitely not for $5. If you didn't get it on sale, wait for it to go on sale, or buy it in a bundle when the other episodes come out. Don't buy this thinking it'll be a huge, twisting, moral quandry inducing story-- it's nothing of the sort. It's run of the mill and ordinary.","March 16, 2014","false","3.6"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

But what i will say though is that it gave me a pretty good idea of how visual novels work and makes me want to play other ones in the future. So that is a good sign. However, i felt that the storytelling was a bit amateurish and disjointed at times. and that the pacing varied between being either too slow or too fast. But the story and subject matter was compelling enough for me to stick with it until the end.\n\nSpeaking of the ending, it leaves many questions unanswered and isn't very satisfying, this is because there will be future episodes to tie it all together. But i am a bit vary, seeing as the sequel has been delayed and even abandoned by the developers until they made a kickstarter. And in my mind, kickstarter often means trouble, there are few things that have come out of kickstarter and been exactly as good as promised. I've been disappointed, ripped off, and lied to thanks to the "early access/kickstarter culture" and i've learnt the hard way that you should never ever buy works-in-progress or pre-order things if you don't have a damn good reason to do so.\n\nBut in the end, i think i would recommend this visual novel. Because it seems to be the best one available on steam currently. And because it combines cute and lighthearted themes with dark and philosophical ones.

But judging EP1 on its own - it definitely gets passing marks from me.\n\nRight from the start we're thrown into story which quickly unveils it's details and draws the reader in. Our main character is 14 years old girl learning to manage chaos as title states, which in practice tuns out to be solving of worldly problems of various kinds to manage order in the worlds. Yes, 'world' in plural because the story involves travel between distant worlds in the universe. Sounds awesome, no? Episode 1 tells story about one such trip to a world on a verge of conflict and will test our girl in her ability to help resolve the issue at hand.\n\nWhat's the most important for me in giving this VN a positive review is that the episode have a conclusions. Not a definitive one, but it doesn't end in steep cliffhanger without resolving any part of given story. Which lets episode 1 stand firm as a standalone work. Although of course there is a lot of things that could be continued, explained, extended into the next episodes.","November 15, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Despite its short lenght, it was a struggle to complete – but in order to at least give this game a chance, I felt I had to.\n\nThe good:\nVisually, I would say that Dysfunctional Systems Episode 1 is pretty gorgeous overall. The details are beautiful, and if anything, there are too many poses and expressions (because they ultimately appear on only one side of the screen). I also applaud for the layout, which (unlike in many other games) looks well designed and appealing to the eye. Nothing bad to say about the music, either: it is enjoyable enough and far better than what I had expected for a game of this lenght and kind. In addition, the inclusion of the soundtrack so that it's possible to listen to the tracks separately grants an extra plus. Another comes simply from the fact that it is cheap.\n\nThe bad:\nAs one could expect from a VN, writing makes or breaks it, and it unfortunately broke it for me. My first ending lifted up the (otherwise miserable) experience into something near-decent, but the dragged out nonsensial epilogue successfully drowned whatever good was left. There is also little to say about gameplay in this game, as there only was one point where you are allowed to make choices – but I never minded the lack of interactivity so much as how the game felt so shamelessly pieced together and none of the pieces truly fit. I don't buy the reason that it is the first in the series; it just wasn't good enough for a release. It tries to be serious but never gets past awkward in any of the areas it tries to explore. Instead we get a stupifying amount of details that don't matter, and characters so blank and plain that they wouldn't talk unless the creators had forced them to.\n\nAlthough not explicitly included in gameplay, I must mention that some of the fanart pictures (presented along with in-game art) in the "extras" section, are of questionable nature. Fanart is nice and all but I do prefer it as an entity of its own, separate from the game. For the creators to associate themselves with this material and comments kind of begs a question of how seriously this game ought to be taken in the first place.","March 29, 2014","false","3.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

You try to affect the game with your decissions, the newes fad in this category are "Visual Novels" - some of them are quite blatantly Dating Sims. Luckily this game doesn't fall into this category of "Visual Novel" or "Romantic Readalong". It has a dystopian backdrop, and some, well you can say demands. During the past months I developed a healthy - avoidance syndrome - towards this relatively new genre of games, but since so many of them landed now in my backlist, I'll play them. Some of them are good and interesting, the most are not. This game is no exception to the later group.\n\nSecond, the game was praised for the different and variable outcomes of the game. Ok, there are some choices, but the choices are leading to the same end result (not the epilogue - that isn't even a funny little thing with the room-mate, dear developers). I played it several times only to gain the achievements - but alone on the end result of this first part, I wouldn't buy the second part. You are very limited in the choices, and the outcome is with just little variations the same.\n\nTo a fan of this genre it might be a godsend, to all others it can become a burden and bore to play, it's winded up in it's own verbosity, it lacks a lot of humor (naivity of the protagonist isn't really funny) and the really good artworks are like a dull firework in a even duller story.\n\nI'd vote for more ingenuity.\n\nPostscriptum after some months: Yes, some people didn't found this review helpful - I can tell you why, because no one remembers nowadays the really good start of interactive novels. Read some Steve Jackson and Ian Livingston. Take up some dice and play Wizard of Firetop Mountain, Forest of Doom and others - and learn that there were good one, and bad ones - learn the difference why FF and Lone Wolf, maybe even Grailquest were good and while some of the "CYOA" and "Give yourself Goosebumps" Stuff alongside with "Endless Quest" from TSR were bad.\n\nA cheesy story won't get better by fancy graphics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferizo/recommended/248800/","ferizo","ASH+Ketchum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferizo/","1490 products in account","It's a visual novel, through and through. Though some people may argue that visual novels aren't games because they don't contain actual gameplay, it's certainly not a bad thing to have them around as people such as myself certainly enjoy them. Besides, if you choose to get this game you should be well aware of what it entails. That said, I'll try to briefly highlight the pros and cons without spoiling the story.\n\nIf you're expecting a story which is tailored to the choices you make as you try to alter the outcome of your journey, then it might disappoint you when I say there isn't much of that to be found (yet). Sure you will get a chance to choose on how the story continues but that opportunity will occur once and can only go in either of two directions. Both having a different kind of ending but aside from the words you choose to get there are pretty much identical. Now I included the word "yet" in brackets because this is just the first episode out of a three in total.. and from the looks of it, episode two seems like a more branched out story.\n\nBeing a visual novel, that's about the only possible con I can think of because the story in itself is really intriguing and takes place in a quite captivating era. Everything else from sound to music and artwork is well done and really sets the mood for the events that are to come. Even the characters look very promising with their different personalities. It's a great and elaborate premise to what just may turn out to become a marvelous series.\n\nLike almost every other visual novel, the game features a quick load & save system allowing you to save your progress before you make a choice and go back if you're not pleased with it's outcome. This is partially in vain because you can just use the regular save and load system at any given time during the story or choices. It only saves a bit of time and perhaps a save slot. Also, with only one set of choices and two outcomes, one may question the use of choosing a different road other than fully exploring the available dialogues. In the end it does ask if you want to save your profile, which basically means your choices may affect what is to come in the next episode.. but other than having two profiles for both endings, I wouldn't expect any major changes.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a great prelude to what promises to be a great series albeit a bit short in length. It is in no way to be considered a full story in and all by itself.. whether that's worth the price comes down to how much you're willing to pay for an opening introduction. My opinion: other than fancying a well-told story; if it develops a bit more and becomes more subject to the player's choices.. I'd say it's definitely worth it.","May 4, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

She finds herself in Sule, a world entering into conflict that she and her mentor, Cyrus, must help resolve.\n\nIf you're new to graphic novel games, the pacing is slow and story-driven.  As these games go, Dysfunctional Systems' episode 1 is a short, simple introduction to the story that, though somewhat involving in its events, leaves the player left short-changed on any real development of character or story.\n\nEven so, if you have the money to spare on something you know is incomplete, this game is a small treat that can, in some ways, make up for its brevity.\n\nReplayability/Sequels\nWhile this episode has a promising start to something that could be interesting, it seems unclear whether or not there will be additional episodes following this one.\n\nGeneral Accessibility\nAccessibility Options\nOptions can be accessed before the game begins, allowing you control of game settings.  Music and sound volume are controlled separately and can be muted altogether.\n\nThe game plays out over text boxes.  Text speed, textbox opacity and color, and the ability to skip text are all available options, giving gamers control over the pace of the game.\n\nSubtitles & Captions\nDysfunctional Systems is captioned completely from beginning to end and the story plays out in text, which does not advance until the gamer decides to do so.\n\nCaptions include the speaker's name and quotes for directly spoken text.  Narrated text is provided without quotes and a name, so I assume it's the main character (Winter) thinking or addressing the gamer directly.\n\nThe game's captions are very true to spoken word, so any deaf/hoh who do not frequently use English to communicate may find it tedious at times.\n\nChatting/Communicating\nDysfunctional Systems is a single player game; no communication/chatting options available.\n\n---\nVisit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf","January 25, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like a more relaxed experience, then certainly look into this genre more, but otherwise gamers with trigger fingers will find nothing for them here.\n\nThe story itself is well-written and I feel the universe created by Dischan can be expanded upon in a variety of ways for future installments. The music is great, and I was pleased to discover the soundtrack is included with the game in its directory.\n\nLength is a real problem though - the episode is only an hour long, and I feel it could have been expanded upon exponentially. More than half of the characters are introduced in the epilogue.\n\nThe achievement system in the game is also significantly flawed. Like most visual novels, you can make choices along the way to alter the story. The catch is, this only occurs at one point during the game. Most of the achievements are gained at this point by selecting different combinations of responses within five minutes of each other. Therefore, it is easy to collect most of the achievements in only thirty minutes by saving right before this point. These are not the most straightforward, and you'll either need a guide or a lot of repitition - not what I think an achievement system should be. The rest are collected by completing the game's two major endings, which are both only a half an hour after the decision point. I got a 100% in this game in a mere two hours.\n\nI also found out that Episode 2 won't be coming anytime soon. First, Dischan said they were in trouble, then they ran a Kickstarter, which succeeded! Yay! But then it didn't work out and they've been (partially) refunding people, saying that the series will not continue after all. Boo! With that in mind, I can't really say I recommend this unless you're a fan of the genre.","January 11, 2014","false","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It’s very short, and in essence only an introductory episode of a longer tale.  Yet it’s one of the better but less known visual novels currently on Steam.\n\nNow, to answer the question whether this vn worth $5 it’s asking… Maybe, maybe not.  I got it half price ($2.5) as it is on sale now.  Consider other ways I could have spent $2.5 to $5, I’d say it’s definitely worthwhile to give this vn a try.  The art style is excellent, and is quite more creative and cinematic than some budget vn where majority of the scenes are just a background image and two character sprites.  Music is atmospheric; it doesn’t stand in the way though does its job well to enhance the mood at key moments.\n\nMany may be concerned about reading only a starting excerpt of a story where the rest of chapters are confirmed canceled.  I had similar issues when I learned about the fate of the studio and this franchise… but don’t let that discourage you.  The current “episode” mostly is self-contained.  While it definitely points to continuation, I think the central plot is independent and doesn’t prevent readers to enjoy it just by itself.\n\nThat being said, the only complain I really have is about the structure of this vn.  For this episode, there are at least two distinct endings (one is arguably a “better” ending than the other).  There is no way in the game to actually check how many endings there are and if they’ve been reached.  It is also not clear which of these two endings are “true” ending, and how they matter to the rest of the tale… mainly, I presume, due to unfortunate fact of the franchise’s cancellation.\n\nFinal verdict: Add this game to your watchlist and buy it when it’s on any kind of discount.  Even though there is no sequel episodes, the story of Learning to Manage Chaos is quite entertaining, and along with the good art and bgm, it’s a 2-hour experience worth having.","November 28, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The protagonist, Winter, is one of such individuals - a mediator - who tries to keep a world in proper order. As with most visual novels, you direct Winter to decide on different choices presented throughout the game, ultimately deciding the story's ending.\n\nThe story itself is a quick one, and I do wish it was a bit longer (a playthrough can be done within an hour or so, if you read through it quickly), though it's a bit understandable since this is the first episode in the series - there're a couple more episodes after this one, and I believe there's a prequel in the works as well (you can check out their website to find out more about them). Given the short story, there weren't really a lot of choices. I liked the plot and I'm quite eager to know how it turns out.\n\nThe artwork and soundtrack are pretty good too - the visuals are drawn beautifully, and the soundtrack complements the various events in the game. Kudos for including the soundtrack along with the game and not as a separate purchase (I have it on my playlist to listen to on the go, loved the title theme song). It'd be a nice touch to have some character voices though, which should make it even more engaging.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good title - it has an good and interesting storyline, but is rather short that it's like a teaser for the succeeding episodes. A bit pricey for the length of the story, though the inclusion of the soundtrack more or less offsets this point. Everything else is pretty good - 3.5 out of 5 stars for me.\n\nPostscript: Considering the story and all(and the fact that it has some kind of an anime opening sequence!), they should try producing an animation for this one after all the episodes have been released. It certainly has potential in my opinion - hope you can make it happen Dischan! =)","December 27, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Overall you have very little dialogue options to choose from and there are two different endings, depending on how one argument plays out.\nThe story is well written and interesting.

Now, before giving you my honest opinion, I do want to point out that I'm not that big of a fan of Visual Novels and I don't consider the genre to be game-like  at all. However I did stumble across few other novels in the past like: Bionic Heart and Katawa Shoujo (both are great reading/watching material) so I have the basic idea of what to expect of a creation of an art like this.\nI have to say this novel is one of a kind. Where in Bionic Heart and Katawa Shoujo my curiosity was sparked by intresting characters and by deeply emotional dialogs and decisions this one fascinates me by it's intelligent plot and setting. Don't get me wrong, the art and the writting are both wonderfully done, but when the story of  an animated novel partially involves political dilemmas with scientific theories and forces it's heroes to solve problems BEYOND global scale - now that's something you can't forget easily. Unfortunatly, as many of you already know this piece of genre fiction is short as hell, but the idea of multiple playthroughs will be tempting once you've finished it.\nWith that said I think that Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a must buy for every Visual Novel enthusiast considering it's low price and the top-notch soundtrack that comes along. And I still highly recommend it to everybody who's up for some casual reading from time to time.\nI'm realy looking forward to the second chapter of Dysfunctional Systems, if it's ever going to happen.","January 21, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's a visual novel and you will be expected to read a lot as the narrative will be presented in such form for the majority of time you spend on this game.\n\nAs the first visual novel I ever played, there was something that got me attached to this game. It might have been the beatiful soundtrack (that you receive for free as well), the eyecandy smooth stylization or the intelligent dialogue. You won't really handle everything thats thrown onto you at first, but you can always pause the game, re-read the log or do some research in the Codex. The story is intense and the fact that it is (sadly) very short, strenghtens the impression. Albeit heavily advertised, the decision making had not such a major impact as I came to expect, but you certainly felt relevant in that world. My biggest complaint has to be how the story has been cut out seemingly mid-air. I know, Dischan was working on a budget, but that doesn't justify the heavily inconclusive ending. I know that the series is episodic, but the ending was so sudden and the plotline so thin, I couln't help but desire more. And I hope I will get more.\nFor merely 5 bucks, you get an unique experience hard to summarise in a few paragraphs. A story line making you feel the burden of responsibility. A immersive soundtrack that easily justifies its spot on your playlist. And last but not least, the gratitude of a small game company, that offered me subjects to think about.\n\nIf you'd like to further support the small and humble dev team, you can do so on Kickstarter, but please be advised the video contains Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos Episode 1 SPOILERS.\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dischan/dysfunctional-systems/","March 21, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I recently completed this game and unlocked every achievement for it aswell so believe that I have fully experienced what this game has to offer. Anyways, this game might seem like your typical anime romance visual novel that so many of us have experienced but the moment you start the story you realise it's nothing of the sort. It is a rather short game(good thing it's only $4.99) but it delivers one of the best stories I have ever experienced in gaming. You will go through a range of emotions when playing this game, but not from silly romance or some teenage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but rather from the conflicts of genocide and nuclear war. The game boasts that is like a "choose your own adventure book" but it does have as many choices as they do. Although there is about 500 different sets of choices you can make they really only funnel into a couple outcomes. The soundtrack that this game offers is very enjoyable and it comes free with the purchase. The art style is nice to look at and I feel it meshed perfectly with the overall plot. In conclusion:\nGameplay-9/10 (too few outcomes)\nArt style-10/10\nRealism-10/10\nSoundtrack-8-10\n\nShould you buy it?\nConsidering the price and the experience this game offers you would be foolish to not give this one a go!\n","January 4, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

That should allow your character 'personal touch' growth.\nAll that sounds awesome, but there is a little throwback, because the game is only ~3 hours long of gameplay (even if you replay it with different decision making it won't get much longer, because you already know most of the dialogue) and the game only marks the starting point into the world.\n\nHopefully the next episodes of this game will be a bit longer, because the time you have with this game is really worth the price, but more is always better.","December 5, 2013","true","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Though short this game will be released episodically, and choices made will be reflected in later episodes. I am a fan of visual novels myself and this visual novel is incredibly thought provoking. (For those that do not know a visual novel is an entirely story driven "game", where the only gameplay is the decisions you make at key points in the story. Some visual novels have winding paths with multiple endings each that play on every single choice you make, which makes you feel like you are controlling the direction of the story.) This visual novel plays on the theme of morality, what is right and what is wrong, and gets you thinking about your position in all of it. When you're thrust into such a situation what will you do, how will you react. It plays on your emotions and uses them to form the path that you are making for yourself. This is one reason I love visual novels because even if you play through it only once, and don't want to witness alternate choices, you still get the story because YOU shaped it with all of the choices YOU made. All in all with the great soundtrack and interesting story, if you like heavily or entirely driven stories in games, this is a must buy ESPECIALLY if it's on sale.","January 6, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Pure. Entertainment.\n\nAs of now I could think of no drawbacks or negative sides to this game, it does what it aims to do very very well and my only complaint is the lack of content, as different splits in the story branch will eventually lead to the same areas and enviroments.\n\nDefinitely worth giving a shot although you're not likely to be replaying this many times, should you chose to go that route though, the differences in outcomes are very impressive and serious, a change in the tree will have very little to no similarities with the other branches (maybe a line of dialogue or two).\n\nFor it's current price (I got it for 4.99) more than worth it.","January 19, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although short, this game was very immersive and felt quite polished for an episodic work.\n\nThe story lasted only about an hour and a half on fast text speed (it would take a bit longer if you read at a slower pace), but it was a compelling and interesting idea about a futuristic society. What really caught me was the parallels between this game and Steins;Gate about the idea of time and space.\n\nThe music was composed impeccably and every use of each song fit well with the events of the story. It's a great soundtrack to listen to as a standalone as well, and it is provided free, absolutely free, with the game in the game folder. Big props to CombatPlayer for their quality work.\n\nThe artwork had a lot of detail and depicted each scene exquisitely, which really helped with putting yourself into the setting of the story. It also looks very cleanly and neatly done, with a nice mix of colors to please the eyes. Some quality VNs don't have the most impressive of artwork; however, this one won't let you down.\n\nCharacter development, although it throws you in somewhat quickly, is done rather well. You will get to know mainly three characters with the focus being on two of the tree - Winter and Cyrus. This episode follows them through a good 90% of the game, with Waverly (Winter's roommate) being introduced near the end, where episode 2 is supposed to begin. However, you get a good sense of Waverly at this point before episode 2. Other characters get introduced, but they only appear with very minor roles and nearly no detail about them - yet.\n\nI'd love to see the next episode of this series be released, and it was definitely worth the few bucks spent to enjoy the few hours of story and many hours of OST listening.","February 9, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And what a good choice that was. I found the story very compelling and the music is phenomenal (After hearing the soundtrack I found the music alone to be worth the price of the VN).\n\nThe game does restrict viewer choice, so don't expect to be making a lot of descisions. However, the few choices it does force you to make are very well thought out and genuinely difficult to make in a great way that gets you thinking. They also appear to be adding a lot more choice in the future episodes (currently on kickstarter till march 24th of 2014, so go back it if you have the disposable income as it is deserving of the support).\n\nThe only major complaint is that the game is relatively short (roughly 2-3 hours long depending on how fast you go through things) and the ending isn't fully complete (the ending is not bad but it was still designed to be continued), however with the recent addition of the future episodes being added to kickstarter it seems that the story will get the continuation it deserved.\n\nIf you aren't sure or are fairly new to visual novels I'd recommend checking out the developers free VN from their website (the VN is called Juniper's Knot) which should help you find out if the writing is something you like.\n\nOverall a great buy for the price if you're looking for a good story with good art and music supporting it.

And while the entire story, if I'd played out my first set of choices without any rethinking at all would have been short, it was definitely interesting to go back and see all of the consequeces for alternate paths, and look at the other courses that were available. The characters, though only allowing for a small amount of exposition in the space given, seemed very fully developed, and were consistent to their apparent personalities, without any seemingly random mood swings with no explanation.\n\nThe plotline and setting itself were both very interesting, but there is definitely room to grow. For the amount of information that is presented, it could easily be expanded upon, even if only through secondary, non-essential entries in the game's codex, or information accessible through the main menu, but what is shown through the story is very entertaining. A powerful climax of the story, and... realistic, if not entirely satisfying ending following, result in a story that definitely makes me want to read further.","February 27, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now, before giving you my honest opinion, I do want to point out that I'm not that big of a fan of Visual Novels and I don't consider the genre to be game-like  at all. However I did stumble across few other novels in the past like: Bionic Heart and Katawa Shoujo (both are great reading/watching material) so I have the basic idea of what to expect of a creation of an art like this.\nI have to say this novel is one of a kind. Where in Bionic Heart and Katawa Shoujo my curiosity was sparked by intresting characters and by deeply emotional dialogs and decisions this one fascinates me by it's intelligent plot and setting. Don't get me wrong, the art and the writting are both wonderfully done, but when the story of  an animated novel partially involves political dilemmas with scientific theories and forces it's heroes to solve problems BEYOND global scale - now that's something you can't forget easily. Unfortunatly, as many of you already know this piece of genre fiction is short as hell, but the idea of multiple playthroughs will be tempting once you've finished it.\nWith that said I think that Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a must buy for every Visual Novel enthusiast considering it's low price and the top-notch soundtrack that comes along. And I still highly recommend it to everybody who's up for some casual reading from time to time.\nI'm realy looking forward to the second chapter of Dysfunctional Systems, if it's ever going to happen.","January 21, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If you want to play the game but don't have the money, you can get it there.\n\nOh Dysfunctional Systems. I love it so. I'm kind of surprised I find myself writing a review for a VN, but this isn't your usual Ecchi bait ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that comes with friends who idle in it for 1000+ Hours YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. But I feel it deserves this in light of recent events, so lets get down to it.\n\nDysfunctional Systems: Learning to manage chaos (Or DysSys) is a Visual novel that focuses around a young Heroine named Winter Harrison, a "Mediator" in training. Mediators are effectively humans from an advanced world of technology, who utilize a codex bracelet and other variety of technology to cross into alternate worlds and dimensions. The goal of this? To act as a mediator. Their job is to find the main problem that causes the realm issue, and fix it. In any real means. In a way they are playing god, without really playing god.\n\nLtMC is effectively a prologue, and a bit EP 1 as well. In this you are currently in an otherwise dystopian modern-esque world with your mentor that you're shadowing named Cyrus. Who, for lack of a better word; is a bit of an ♥♥♥. Also a bit brash, and doesn't really have a moral standing at all. This naturally causes him to conflict a few times in the prologue with Winter - There is even a series of achievements you unlock depending on the outcome of a multi-choice argument.\n\nOne way or another, things go wrong and Winter pays the price. I can't really say more as is; cause I care too much to mention spoilers. But here is one I will mention.\n\nThe game's funding is out the window.\n\nDysSys was planned to have an Episode 0 - acting as a sort of prologue to the start of the whole plot and its own prologue to explain winter - as well as an EP 2 or 3, but a game selling at $5 each doesn't exactly go over well. They had a kickstarter, it got overfunded; we were all happy to receive. Unfortunately, improper management of money on Dischan's part sort of caused the project to fall onto it's face. This doesn't mean the game isn't gonna get its sequels, but it means its gonna be done on Voluntary time. Expect a few months, maybe late 2015 at this rate. Dischan has closed it's doors, so all production has ceased.\n\nDoes that mean you should buy the game? Sure. Why not? If you have $5 to spend and there isn't anything else you could possibly spend it on, then go for it. If it's on sale though, I'd say shoot for it period. It has good art, good characters, fun dialogue, and the music is phenominal.\n\nI was never good with rating numbers, so I'll just leave it at the fact is: I liked it. That's really all I have to say on it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SY2UdX9eKk","January 13, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Returning to this page, it's evident to me that Dischan Media put more effort into their Teaser video than the actual video game.\n\nThe artwork, while very good - is far too sparse to express the story in any meaningful way.\nTake-away: Draw some more damn pictures and use them to express your story. What you've done is not good enough.\n\nThe soundtrack, is excellent - but there are not enough sound effects to express the story either. Fix it.\nTake-away: Not everything is about music.\n\nThe story is great - but the writing is too lavish and the visual presentation is sub-par.\nTake-away: If you want to write a novel, write a damn novel. This is a different visual medium for delivery and it has different rules! You should colour your text to express different characters. You should use unique typefaces to express the difference between character thoughts and dialog IF NECESSARY. Dialogue should ALWAYS be a priority and it should always be straight to the point.\n\nThe game is terrible.\nThis is not a game. There was one single decision tree point with a handful of questions merely seconds apart. I don't know what you were thinking. You need to space this out throughout the game, peaks and troughs - study Mass Effect and The Walking Dead. Test this on people and beware of decision fatigue vs. reading fatigue.

The early part drags on unnecessarily, the setting isn't very well established, and when things finally start to escalate the episode suddenly ends. And even then, the events that follow the big "climax" don't seem to convey any kind of drama or consequence, but instead try to be humorous, for whatever reason. As if different parts of the story were written by different people. Not to mention, some parts of the game feature some disturbing and really forced "fanservice" that is really out of place.\n\nStill, I can't say I disliked the game. The art style and the music are definitely its strong point. And once things started to escalate I was intrigued and enjoyed the plot and its characters, and I'd like to know how things go from there. If the developers can focus more on the world, work on the pacing, and tone down with the fanservice in the second episode, then I think I'll give it a go. As it is though, it's "only" an unfinished visual-novel with no actual gameplay to speak of.","February 23, 2014","false","3.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I went into it knowing the series had been cancelled after being drawn in by the amazing soundtrack, and in that I wasn't disappointed.

Instead of the clear-cut lines and cel-shading that I normally see, the sprites and the background are in a nicely arranged watercolor.  I'm reminded of Little Witch's art style.  You also have some thoughtful animations like the walking scene.\n\n- Fun interactions - remember the screenshot where Winter is punching the guy?  You get more than that right up to the climax of this episode.\n\n- Intriguing setting - Think of Sliders, but with a different mission.  Now they have to mediate the conflicts, and there isn't one way to do it.  And fantasy is just as possible as sci-fi.  And, the first episode has a surprising climax that I had suspected but did not completely realize.\n\n- Immersive soundtrack - the song playing on the title screen has already pulled my attention.

This visual novel is awesome.\nOther reviews have already mentioned the nice art and the exceptional music, but to me the most interesting aspect was the way it made me think about the issues at hand.\nDS:LTMC will interest you if you're into moral choices (and dilemmas), problem-solving and/or a heated discussion. Although there aren't many dialog options, the words, art and music work together to create a thrilling scenario that had me sitting in front of my computer pondering each option carefully for sometimes up to half an hour.\nThe characters are very believably written, meaning you can relate to most of them. Though that doesn't necessarily mean that you'll like them. In addition to that, the VN gives you some minute background information on its inhabitants and inner workings that introduces what could become an amazingly detailed story world. There are lots of hints that leave me hoping they will be explored in the episodes to come.\nAnd aside from the intellectual points of interest and the detail of the story world, the emotional impact this VN has had on me was one of the greatest among everything I have bought on Steam so far.\n\nI heartily recommend buying this. Five bucks is somewhat steep for the amount of time you'll spend with it (up to 3 hours max for the first playthrough), but the sheer quality of this production damn well justifies the price.\n\nAlso, their Kickstarter was a success, so Dischan will release the remaining two chapters as well!

For this type of visual novel, if it doesn't have a good and interesting story; it is vital that they have at least something that can make us like the game, i.e., likeable characters, nice artwork, or even just decent voice acting.   Unfortunately, it has none of that.  Everything seems so dull, and the game doesn't even have dubbed voices.\n\nEven with just a handful of characters in this story, I find none of them likeable.  Basically we have this clueless protégé and a cynical mentor.  The mentor seems to have a dark past, but lack of proper character development for us to really empathize with him.\n\nThis game does give the player choices at different point in the game, so you can get somewhat different endings; that's probably the only good thing about this game.  But to get to those turning point choices, you'd have to do a lot of saving and reloading.  And you probably have to start from the start at least once, and choose skipping text till the point they have those choices.   I just wish they would somehow categorize the whole game chapter by chapter where you can load at certain chapter from the start.\n\nIt seems a bit unfair to not recommend a game that is supposedly an episodic game.  But the game just did not have a good start, and I just don't see how much better it can get.","January 5, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Something that not a lot of people like. Only very few non-Japan enthusiasts or non-otakus will take a look into the genre. That's why it needs to be a good one.\n\nDeveloped by Dischan Media. This is one of the only few Visual Novels in Steam, and it's good at what it does, especially considering it's Western-made. It has a good soundtrack, excellent story, and a very familiar art style for me.\n\nWith the familiar art style being said, the game has a similar art style to Juniper's Knot. Another Visual Novel I downloaded on the iOS and eventually Windows, which is about a Demon Girl(IIRC) and a Young Boy. It is highly praised in the iOS for it's plot, and to my surprise, Dysfunctional Systems is also developed by the same people who made Juniper's Knot. Unlike Juniper's Knot, which is mostly just a Visual Novel at itself, this game has some interactivity, with some sorts of political and moral decisions, which are dialogue choices.\n\nI would recommend this to people who has some experience to Visual Novels, as it has a lot of reading involved and some various decision makings.\n\nWith this, I look forward more from the game, and cannot wait for Episode 2 of this.","January 14, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A lot of the gameplay centers on the dialogue options as these also contribute to the endings you get. Note, the closest thing to a "bad ending" in the game is one that basically limits your dialogue options immensely. So, if you get that ending, don't let the lack of options give you a bad impression of the game. The stroy itself is great. Dialogue is great. The art looks really nice. It is short, but it is meant to be played over and over again, so it works out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wintermoot/recommended/248800/","wintermoot","Wintermoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wintermoot/","159 products in account","Title: Dysfunctional Systems | Episode 1: Learning to Manage Chaos\nDeveloper: Dischan Media[dischan.org]\n\nAn Introduction\nDysfunctional Systems is a (planned) series of interactive visual novels, where decisions in previous novels are planned to reflect in future episodes. The episode, and perhaps the series from what I've read, focus on the character of Winter, a sort of student or trainee paired with a mentor to learn how to do their job, which is...manage chaos and bring forth stability. Cryptic, I know, but considering how the episode plays out even explaining the basic premise of the plot could be considered giving spoilers, which I shall not do. :P Episode 1, which is what I'm reviewing here, was released last year, while Episode 2 is in the process of being developed after a successful Kickstarter campaign raised $67,000. As with most visual novels, there is very little opportunity for user input in this "game", so it lives and dies by the setting, plot, story, as well as the art and music to a lesser extent.\n\nPretty Things: Art and Music\nSpeaking of the art, it's obvious that a lot of time and effort went into it...yes, they're static graphics that change as the scenes or situation changes, but there are a number of scenes drawn for any particular part of the game. For example, one may have one of the characters looking a different way or with a different emotion on their face, so they can change the scene graphic when something particular is said to show the character responding to it. Also a neat little thing I noticed is that there is a particular scene where our character is walking and the camera moves with it to simulate movement...buildings move in and out of range, which I thought was a nice little touch. The music was overall pleasant and seemed appropriate to the situations and settings that arise in the game, but weren't horribly memorable.\n\nNot like they had Morrowind's budget for music though, I'm sure. :P\n\nThe Meat and Potatoes of Visual Novels, the Story:\nAs for the story, I like the premise a lot...without saying what it is, it makes for a lot of potential variety in the game as other episodes are made, and I thought the characters were well-written as well, with unique personalities. My problem here is that much of the game comes off as feeling static, like it's a teaser or tutorial level instead of a paid game. It's not the lack of interactivity that bothers me, it's the lack of variety. Most of the game is spent having discussions between the same two characters, and there's precious little breaking all that dialogue up. It also made the story feel like it was proceeding slowly, even when urgent events were building up...a very odd feeling in those instances.\n\nAlso, I know this was an introductory episode and they wanted to focus on the two main characters, but it's disappointing that there wasn't much interaction with the actual game world, especially given the game's main premise of dealing with worlds and systems. I think two birds could have been killed with one stone by having more scenes that focused on the world they were in, such as the bar scene where Winter meets David and a game event happens. To me that was a standout part of the game that temporarily broke the monotony. Another standout part of the game was during the epilogues, because the character interaction between Winter and her roommate was just so damn good, and it was nice to get a taste of Winter's life and the people she's around. In fact, I wish the game had started out this way...I think being able to be introduced to Winter and her friends before the events of the story start would have been a nice touch, too.\n\nI want to stress, it's not that I found the story bad...quite the contrary, I thought it was quite good. It just would have been even better with more variety of things interlaced within it. There's only so much you can do in a visual novel that mostly involves the same two people talking with each other. :P\n\nOverall, I suppose I find the implementation lacking, but the concept promising. From what I've read, the developer is improving on many of the issues I'm pointing out here for Episode 2, and it already sounds like it's going to host a much more vibrant world than this episode did.\n\nIn Summary\nMy recommendation? If you like visual novels, go ahead and get it! $5 isn't a lot of money, it's hardly a bad game, and I have enough faith that Episode 2 is going to be so great you're going to be glad you already know the basic premise of the series. Otherwise, wait for Episode 2 to come out...Episode 1 at least is definitely not for people who don't like the genre, so it may be worthwhile to see exactly what Episode 2 has to offer before putting down money.\n\nIf I were to give a rating, it'd be 6/10, a rating that I'm almost certain will go up when Episode 2 comes out, which I am looking forward to. :)","July 4, 2014","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay itself, as a visual novel, didn't feel all too engaging.\nIt felt more like the game was a narrative tool rather than a interactive environment, I feel it could do more if it gave players more choices and freedom, allowing more immersion.\nIt felt more like a story and less like an interactive experience, even just adding options for 'how' characters interacts with small or trivial things would of added more activity and involvement for the player.\nI look forward to future episode regardless, as the art style was well composed.

The opening scene is beautiful. In fact so well done I had a hard time believing this was a indie title. The art ingame is also very fitting with highly detailed semi-grim themes. The story and the art complement eachother and together with the music leaves any fan of VNs at the edge of their seat in some cases and reaching for tissues in others. The only problem that it has is its length. It is only about 2-3 hours that is required to complete one playthough.

I orignally bought this game as a gift for a friend for Christmas and stuck it on my wishlist because I can play visual novels on my PC and not much else. My friend Chris gave me a copy for my birthday a few days ago.\n\nImmediately into the game I was sucked in. I related to the main character, Winter, in ways that I wasn't expecting. Meanwhile the world that is built around her and Cyrus is captivating. The concept of mediating is beautiful. I felt like I could really submerge myself into the gameplay and enjoy this for hours. I became emotionally attached.\n\nAnd not too long after, my first playthrough was over. The episode felt short to me (I had taken the quickest end by accident). So I played it again. And again. And again. I unlocked all achievements. I want more.\n\nI came to find out that Dysfunctional Systems was originally a flop on Steam, but now Dischan has the second and third episodes are being funded through Kickstarter. After checking the Kickstarter, I found out that for March 10-March 17th the game is only 99 cents.\n\nI urge every single one of my friends to play this VN. It is an action-based, decision-making VN with great characters and fantastic dialogue and a BRILLIANT concept. If you enjoy it PLEASE help fund the Kickstarter - they need roughly 15k CAD (roughly 13.5k USD) in 11 days to fund the rest of the trilogy.\n\nThe Kickstarter can be found here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dischan/dysfunctional-systems","March 12, 2014","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you're here, you probably know about VNs and you should skip this paragraph. However, for those who haven't experienced them before, VNs are best described as a mixture of novels, comics/manga, anime and artwork all in one. VNs are essentially what you get when you remove virtually everything and focus a "game" on one aspect and one aspect only: story (with artwork and music enhancing the experience), in hopes that it will carry the entire product. Needless to say, what you get out the end is usually a story that is very good, with brilliant artwork and excellent music. VNs often feature several choices that offer alternative dialogue and different endings.\n\nNow that that's said, let's take a look at Dysfunction Systems: Episode 1. Episode 1 is only about 2 hours long, and the other two episodes are having their funds raised on Kickstarter. Don't let that put you off, however, as Episode 1 is still a full experience in its own right. DS is a VN, so of course the main thing is story, right? On this aspect, DS passes with flying colours. The setting is immediately interesting and the two main characters are defined and interact quite well. For obvious reasons, unlike most VNs (which often feature a long, comedic "common route" before a tear-inducing "true route"), DS gets to the point quickly and effectively. The length of this VN doesn't allow for much "fluff", and indeed the plot progresses quite smoothly, quickly leading to the climax and an "epilogue" of sorts which serves to lead into the future episodes. More specifically, the plot follows Winter Harrison, a mediator-in-training, and her mentor Cyrus Addington. The job of mediators is to travel (warp?) to a world and attempt to resolve any tensions they may have, be they environmental or political. Clearly, these "mediations" are dealing with fragile situations, and sometimes the best course of action isn't obvious. Mediators have to use their best judgment, which may or may not go according to plan.\n\nNow, onto the music and artwork. I don't need to say much, as both are brilliant. The menu music, in particular, is possibly the best piece of menu- actually, scratch that- background music I've ever heard. Take a listen to "Terminus" on their Kickstarter page: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dischan/dysfunctional-systems\nYou won't even want to start the game because this is playing in the menu. Characters and backdrops have a very interesting soft, hand-drawn look to them, which is quite rare in VNs. The menu style and overall aesthetic of the game also looks very nice, with a touch of minimalism which makes the sci-fi feel that much better.\n\nA short paragraph to those who are VN veterans, and want to see how this game lines up with others in its category: DS is a bit like Planetarian mixed with Steins;Gate. Here you won't find the same level of despair as Muv-luv, the world-shattering secrets of Little Busters, or the epicness of Fate. But for something able to be completed in 2 hours, it is definitely a memorable story, and without the need to go through hours and hours or what may be a mundane common route.\n\nSo, to sum it all up, Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is a short game with no gameplay. But what it lacks in action and shooting, it makes up for many times over with its story, music and artwork. Give it a try for a few dollars; you won't be disappointed, VN player or otherwise.","March 17, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raidou-or-raido/recommended/248800/","raidou-or-raido","More like Rai-don't!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raidou-or-raido/","161 products in account","Well, I've had some time to digest what happened in this game. I did both Cyrus' and Winter's conclusions, so I feel qualified to talk about this instead of saying something stupid like "hurr Winter is my waifu" or whatever passes for humor. Since I'll be talking about how the plot progresses, there's going to be spoilers. Though if you're seriously reading the reviews for a VN where the writing's the most important part, then the tl;dr for you is that it's a good story for what's basically the set-up to something larger.\n\nThe writing is good for this type of story where there's shifting between worlds as they are. Winter and Cyrus are clearly human but they come from a world much more different than our own. For instance, their form of government suggests that a group of people are in control of their entire world and what they do. Waverly's references to "foreign" literature (as in, from other worlds), as well as their accents, suggests that their standards of writing and academics, among other things, are something completely different than what we are used to. Their level of technology is also beyond that of our own, what with the instant-teleportation devices, access to a virtually limitless inventory, and drugs that can completely flush out radiation sickness within a day. It's a world close enough to ours so that we can relate to it but far enough thanks to the way the characters act about various things.\n\nWinter is believable as a teenager: She objects to alcohol, she knows when something is completely out of her depth (be it because she wasn't properly paying attention or because she simply wasn't taught about it), and she possesses the ability to rebel against authority to a point. Her life circumstances are also something some readers may be familiar with w/r/t her parents and how they had an impact on her life (her reaction to the suggestion to drinking due to the suggestion that her mother is an alcoholic and her tendency to avoid really vulgar language thanks to her father).\n\nCyrus is a bit of a punk, even though his intentions are good: He's the one who comes up with the plan to kill the president and the one who pushes Winter into situations under the pretenses of preparing her for this line of work (such as pushing her to drink). He also is patient, but persistant, to a fault, and he'll even concede on his viewpoint provided that the alternative can achieve a better result. After all, the point of what he and his comrades are doing as mediators is to maintain a level of order in worlds that, without their intervention, would fall apart. However, according to what Winter has found out from her classmates, and what Winter will find out should she not stop him, Cyrus is rather cold and merciless and willing to do anything up to and including murder people in order to achieve the best possible result.\n\nWhich brings up the paths of the game. The end result is the same, which is that the world the two were trying to save ultimately dies thanks to circumstances neither could possibly predict. If Cyrus' plan is carried out (that is, kill the president), the president leaves behind a dying message and informs everyone that the nuclear bomb has already launched at their enemy and to prepare for war. This is pointless on his part as the bomb causes a reaction that ends up burning the atmosphere and killing everyone. Winter feels extreme guilt at being unable to stop Cyrus and prevent him so that they could try finding another way. Cyrus is now in trouble for his rash actions, which makes his current reputation among his peers even worse.\n\nIf Winter's plan is carried out instead (don't kill the president but suggest to simply detonate the bomb away from the mainland as a showing of power or even come up with a new plan entirely), the end result is that, thanks to the fact they haven't done the proper testing, the atmosphere ends up burned again and everyone dies. (As an aside, that's the reason for both outcomes: Lack of testing due to not wanting to blow their cover.) The two try to teleport to the president's office before the bomb is launched to stop him, but he's already gone and the bomb has already detonated. The shockwave destroys a large window and Cyrus has to shield Winter in order to protect her from the falling glass. Now instead of feeling guilt for not stopping Cyrus from committing murder, Winter feels guilt for having indirectly doomed an entire world.\n\nThe epilogue also changes depending on whose plan went through. If Cyrus' plan was the one, he lands in serious trouble with his peers, Winter ends up hating him, and Waverly (Winter's roommate) has to deal with a classmate who wants to see her as well as her former mentor with a collegue, and even Cyrus himself. She is also not as close with attending Winter's illness as she is if Winter's plan was the one. Speaking of that plan, the other changes are a more vulgar classmate wanting to see her, the fact that Cyrus got wounded (broken glass is not something to screw around with), and the potential consequence of Winter's actions affecting her future as a mediator.\n\nThe other parts of this visual novel (the art and music) are pretty good. The music gives off a sci-fi feel, with the proper songs playing during the proper parts (tense music for tense scenes, for example). The art makes the faces and poses expressive, which is important for conveying the moods that the script is claiming at that time. As they are, they compliment the game nicely.\n\nAll in all, the game's good and I recommend playing both main sides of the story to experience it as it should be.","March 17, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For the second part, I would recommend that the game makers include the intro sequence at the beginning instead of in the extras or at the credits. I also would recommend adding an interesting plot point to the beginning instead having a picture of a boring news anchor talking drab about the kind of logistics we wouldn't really care about in the first place if it were on an actual news channel.

The different decisions make one want to go through at least two playthroughs, if not more for the sake of achievements. As a lover of story heavy games, this was right up my alley. enough exposition and background to get a feel for what's in store, without grinding anything down into one's head over and over again. It's an excellent first chapter to what will hopefully be an excellent series. I very much look forward to the next one.","January 14, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A great storytelling coupled with great music. Definitely should do some research on the game before you buy it but you will not regret it if it seems interesting to you.

I played through it twice, just so i could see both endings. Although it seems short, i believe i spent more than 3 hours on it. If I haven't lready spent that long, I'll probably spend the rest of what's left just looking through the art and listening to the jukebox of in-game music. I'll probably even play through it two or three more times just to explore other options! Love it!

I played through it twice, and found that both choices changed the story significantly, however. Although  do be warned, the game is pretty short. I played through it twice in one sitting. Although it's worth the price, especially the sale price.

Do you love visual novels? Do you just generaly like this style of art and story telling? You do? That's fantastic! You don't? That's a shame, but still look into this. Dysfuntional Systems is a fantastic visual novel set in a science fictional world. I don't want to say to much more then what is stated in the description so not to spoil it, but if you like anything stated above, then you'll definetly like Dysfunctional Systems. It is a short about 2 hour story; (I guess dependent on if your a fast reader or not.) with some pretty crazy choices. And a great soundtrack. Still not sold? Try Juniper's Knot it is free and also fantastic. If you love that one then you will love this one. And hey it's a cheap game of only $4, I'm positive you will get some sort of entertainment out of it for that price. Now sadly it is only the first episode, they were going to make more, (hopefully one day they will.) but apparently it didn't sell to well. (Blasphemy!!) If you even think that possibly you might like it and buy it and support Dischan. And if it turns out you love it and want to see more then spread the word, and if you already love it spread the word! Dysfunctional Systems needs its other episodes.

"If the main character doesn't care, how can we?"\n\n2)The game is very short, and basically lasts 2 to 3 hours: after that you can do the endings, but they won't take so much time to unlock. The real issue here actually is that it ends pretty suddenly and, really, I don't feel satisfied: nothing has really happened at all and I'm actually curious on what's next, because all of the matter of this first episode is already "forgotten" later on. In short, a better ending would have been much more better (and luckily, our choices will matter on next episodes).\n\n3) Some more choices.....yeah...that single choice wasn't what I was expecting for, considering the game tells you "your choices will affect the story of the game". I guess, until next episodes, we won't know how our decision affected the story.\n\nShort Version\n\nDo I suggest it? Yeah, if you like VN style games I highly reccommend it, especially in hopes to get the next episode someday: good VN are always welcome and I can't deny that I'm curious myself of what's going to happen next, since the story is set basically on a sort of suspension, making us wonder what's going to happen next, and perhaps we get some proper backstory and character development.\n\nSkip it if you don't care of reading.","January 7, 2014","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The storyline is paced badly, and there is never a proper sense of characterization developed through the text. Ellipses are overused for dramatic pause. Winter's narrative monologues are tediously long, and the profanity is gratuitious while failing to generate dramatic tension.\n\nAfter the decision point leading to a drastic scene shift and the introduction of additional characters, the creative team behind this game decides to lose their minds. Characters such as Henry Pen are text only. A massive wall of text is a placeholder for character interaction. The shallow script essentially craters, lost in marooned plot devices like hints of a lesbian romance which inexplicably awards an achievement.\n\nThere is minimal backstory to speak of. The Codex, an interesting plot device, is grossly underutilized. The origins of Winter's homeworld and how they developed Mediators are neglected. Some brilliant, evocative art direction could have filled in, but what we get are anime watercolors and bad writing that demands mashing the space bar to banish from screen.\n\nVisual Novels require superlative scriptwriting and engrossing characterization. This game provides neither, unless the tastes of the reader are just as shallow as the gameplay and satisfaction comes easy. Future episodes in this series are not worth consideration, the dismal writing and the plot structure would require vast improvement beyond the hack writing in place.\n\nHowever, the soundtrack is lovely as background music, which is why I have so many hours logged.\n\nざけんな、バカにするのも程々にしろっ。This is not representative of what VNs are capable of being, and under the lovely facade it is shallow with no substance.

It's still an excellent experience, however, and is worth it's small price.\n\nStoryI notice people complain both about the length of the story and the small number of choices. However, the story is rather deep with a good sense of innocence that really drives the character development. Equally so, the choices carry with them some fairly large ramifications. For example, the first choice is "Follow Cyrus" and "Rebel"; both choice trees may lead to the same ending story-wise, but both of them lead to very different outcomes emotionally for the PC: Cyrus blew up the soalr system (and I let him) vs. I blew up the solar system.\nYes, the story may be rather short, but I still feel it has a good amount of content; considering it's only $4.99, you can't really turn it down.\nThere are many a debate in the discussions area for this game, about world economics, strife, turmoil, and the other various topics this game gives you thought to. If anything, if you're the debating type, you could get a lot of brain candy out of playing this and mulling it over with others.\nObviously, the length and the content are the main factors to gripe about, but like I said, it's worth it taking the price into consideration. Another reason you might not want the game is the fact that though the choice trees give a different emotional outcome, the story is largely "on-rails" and the physical, general outcome of the story is the same no matter what choices you choose. Of course, this allows the story to follow the path the developers want and to allow them to craft a truly excellent story, but veteran VN players may find issue in this.\nAs an up-side to the short length of the story, each choice tree provides almost completely different dialogue than their comparatives, filled with witty, humorous writing. It'll be the same general story no matter what you choose, but you'll get a totally different emotional side of it. I think this really helps define the characters, as well, giving much more depth in the span of time the game allows.\n\nArtThe art is really quite excellent. I love the sharp facial features and the muted colors. However, the "painted" style of the background is somewhat iffy at times; it isn't to my tastes. It would look much nicer if it was a bit sharper to match the foreground, though it does allow the characters a better contrast to their surroundings, causing you to focus on them and their expressions more.\nIt would have been neat if the 3D designs featured in the AV sequence were extended and put to use as background material or similar.\nThe UI is gloriously developed and a joy to both look at and navigate. All of it animates smoothly and completely and fits the psuedo-futuristic feel of the game. It's a little visually busy, but I like that.\n\nCharactersThe characters all feel like they have established roles, identities, and personalities, but the story is too short to really get to know them as much as I'm sure the average VN player would like. If you're the kind of person to play VNs for the character development, Dysfunctional Systems is rather good at that in the small time it plays for.\n\nSoundsThere are a lot of different sounds in Dysfunctional Systems, all of them atmospheric, quality, and unique. They put a lot of work into the sound design of the game. I will most certainly be putting the complete FLAC OST, which is included with the game files for free, into my music library. If anything, get it for the kickass music. It's incredibly high fidelity and plays like a professionally released album.\n\nConclusionI would recommend this to any VN player that doesn't mind a shorter experience. Despite its length, the story is hard-hitting and is both relevant to the issues of today's world and challenging to the mind.\nUnfortunately, the developers went essentially bankrupt and have shelved any and all future projects indefinitely, so we won't be able to see any more of this universe for a while, if ever. It's a shame, really. You can check our their blog to see what happened and to browse their other works (including more awesome music).","May 10, 2014","true","7.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Your character is a mediator in training (shadowing a mentor). Mediators travel to "chaotic worlds" and attempt to fix problems. I really like the premise, but the game only focuses on one world's situation, and is fairly short at about 3 hours. The backdrops and character animations/expressions are fairly basic and there isn't a lot of variety, but the game is still pleasing to look at.\n\nThe first third of the game is fairly long and sets up the story and characters. There are no choices to be made during this time, so you really just watch it play out. The second third of the game is where all of the dialogue branches are made, but they really only unlock variations of dialogue. The last choice you make during that section determines which ending you get. The last third of the game is much like the first, just seeing it play out.\n\nAside from the lack of impactful choices, my only other gripe is that much of the dialogue is simply bickering back and forth. Some of the choices seem slightly out of character, but they offer the sense of you being able to change someone else's mind via dialogue in order to open up a different viewpoint.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game but would have liked it to be much longer, with more characters and more impactful choices. This is supposed to only be "Episode 1" and is priced appropriately for its length; however, the developers are unable to make a sequel unless they find funding via their Kickstarter (Found here https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dischan/dysfunctional-systems )\n\nI'd love to see a sequel that expands upon what they've created here, as it has a lot of potential to fully explore the plot and characters in much more detail.","February 23, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Be weary that it's kind of short though. Being that I'm somewhat of a slow reader, this took me around 2 - 3 hours to complete. So, your mileage may vary.

And if there is going to be so little interactivity, the story should at least move along a little quicker!  If you like visual novels, I wouldn't recommend this one, even for $5.  Go find something else, or read a graphic novel or a regular novel.","February 23, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

I still encourage you to check the kickstarter page, maybe you like the new art better.\n\nUPDATE 2:\nThe new concept art is getting a lot better, So I backed it in kickstarter, That was my only problem with this game, but now that it is not the case, I have to change my review and recommend the game, So what are you waiting for? it is just 1 dolar and it is great, Also you should back the Kickstarter project to get the game finished.","February 19, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","6"

Her name is Winter, but I call her Little ♥♥♥♥. What an idiot she is, and an inconsistent, infuriating character. She's supposedly an avid reader but couldn't be bothered to read about the world she'd be observing, and her disinterest is not from depression or apathy or culture shock. And she cannot analyze the world around her when she’s there. The capitol is a derelict wreck, but she can't even look around her and say, "Gee. This is a dump. How ♥♥♥♥ed is the government, economy, or deaths-to-births ratio?" She doesn’t even understand how serious a declaration of nuclear is in a world that until then had none! All she does is scream about how she isn’t prepared for observing or participating in a warring world, that murder for the greater good is wrong.\n\nWinter, you Little ♥♥♥♥. Your inability to even discuss the situation and the history concerning it makes you unfit for this assignment. Or any assignment. Go back to kiddie school and see a counselor.\n\nAt one point I invoked Nostalgia Critic and started arguing with the game, begging often to "let me guide the naive fool," and "please, I read the files one these nations. Let me control their destiny." Instead I chose to have her follow her let’s-assassinate-the-president-to-minimize-damage mentor. And whine, and be petty, and sulk, and try to sabotage the assassination. And nearly admits in a crowed of stunned nationals that they were the murderers. I... I just kept saying "No." Then I started yelling it.\n\nSupposedly "Part 2" will require more than one impotent decision from me, but based on my button-mashing experience of the first part I might just quit. Most of the dialogue is just filler that doesn’t inform me of diddly-squat. The emotions I experienced from the game were anger, frustration, indignation and most of all, BOREDOM. I was intellectually insulted by this “story”. Winter is a child whom I cannot empathize with. I am an adult. I want more stimulation than reading a tantrum and the indecisiveness of a writer whose work I wouldn’t even comment on if I found it on Fanfiction.net or Archive of Our Own or Tumblr. It’s a poorly-written trainwreck, and currently I’m hoping that Little ♥♥♥♥ dies of trauma from radiation exposure and the guilt from the death of that world.\n","December 12, 2013","false","1.9"," 8 of 28 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","8","28","0","1"

Dysfunctional systems blends politics and sci-fi elements to create a very interesting world (or worlds) which is genuinely intriguing to read about. There is a good deal of world building through not only the dialogue but also the Codex which acts as a portable encyclopedia with information on the world. Learning to Manage Chaos does a good job of exploring philosophies such as Utilitarianism and their effects, both posotive and negative. Despite having very few choices to does a great job of adding weight and immersion to the story through the writing. The biggest flaw of Learning to Manage Chaos is undoubtedly the length which clocks in at less than 2 hours. There are reasons to play through such as the getting all the achievements and different dialogue but even with this you won't be spending any more than a few hours on Learning to Manage Chaos.\n\nThe majority of Learning to Manage Chaos has you playing as Winter Harrison. Although Winter is naive she has a strong sense of justice and is pretty cute. On the other side of the spectrum Cyrus Addington, her mentor, is a more mature and experienced Mediator whose opinions often clash with Winter's. The interactions' between both characters are at times funny and cute and at others' thought provoking as much of the subject matter is war and nuclear weapons. The characters add a lot of substance to the game and make the tense moments of the story more gripping. There are few other characters introduced that I won't go into because they only play a small part in episode 1 but they are all fairly likeable so far.\n\nOne of the games strongest points is it's visuals and music. The character designs are very well drawn and nice to look at and the backgrounds are some of the best I've seen in this genre. They are all very detailed and unique. The music is very atmosphere as it contains some great Ambient and Electronica tracks which heavily lend to the dystopian-esque atmosphere that the VN is going for. All of which can be accessed from the main menu.\n\nWhile the length of Learning to Manage Chaos and the miniscule amount of choices hinder the overall quality of the game, Episode 1 of Dysfunction Systems has a great story, characters, visuals, and soundtrack. Although this is only a review of the first episode and shouldn't be applied to later episodes in the series.","December 10, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is possible to go through the entire game and only make one choice. (One branch from that first choice has other choices to be made.) Even still, the game doesn't allow the player much freedom. What it has, though, is really good writing. The characters and setting are very interesting and the dialogue is great.\n\nIt's the first chapter in an episodic series and the developers have promised that there will be more branching later, with decisions made in this first chapter affecting later episodes. It seems they were trying to keep the scope of the whole series under control going into the future by limiting options now. Given how it ends, I'm really looking forward to seeing where future episodes go.","November 14, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is influenced by the choices you make, but for the most part it is a story being told to you.

My only qualm with the game is that for its quality, it lacks quantity. If you have not played a visual novel before, I suggest waiting for a sale if you are that curious. The makers of this game actually have a short VN for free on their website, one that helped seal the deal for me on this purchase. All in all, a good game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/recommended/248800/","ghiz876","Gumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/","33 products in account","I'd like to recommend this game, I truly would but I cannot do so in good faith. There are a few very key flaws with this game that prevent me from being able to recommend it. I don't regret the purchase and I did enjoy it, for as short as it was but I imagine a lot of people could easily be put off by the experience. In fact I'm probably being very lenient on it myself.\n\nDysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is the first in a series. The following installments have yet to be released but will be longer and also must be purchased individually. It is a visual novel that relies heavily on immersing players with story and characters, with the only gameplay being making choices throughout the story to change how things go. But here comes the biggest issue. Throughout the course of the game, I made one choice. Literally one. In other words, this was a short story, not a game. I cannot call something that had such bare minimum interaction a game. The game itself also only lasted around two hours. The length wouldn't be a big issue, since it is cheap and I got it on sale, but the fact there's only one choice throughout is a damn joke.\n\nHowever, the appeal in a game like this is that you can go down other paths, see what happens if you choose another option, right? And I'm sure if I picked the other option, I'd have at least one more choice to make, based on what I've seen. I don't know for sure though, since I haven't been able to replay this game. Attempting to reopen the game gets me an error message, one which haunts me no matter how many times I reinstall, verify game cache or restart my computer. The game doesn't even work properly.\n\nThe third key issue is one that's going to bring down the wrath of men's right's activists everywhere on me. The extras in this game include artwork. Some of this artwork is fanmade and portrays the (underage) female characters of the game in risque positions. This automatically makes the creator's respect for his characters come across as shallow, as he willingly keeps extras that objectify and sexually exploit his characters in the game. Apparently this is because of a dislike for retroactive censoring. I think a bigger issue is the ominous aura that now surrounds this game and its characters, that no matter how well developed or interesting they may be, ultimately they will be used for shameless fanservice.\n\nI want to end this review with some positives. While it was short, it was still a great story. It centers around two main characters, Winter Harrison and Cyrus Addington. Both these characters are not only entertaining but very interesting, with unique backgrounds and moral beliefs. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't give away the most interesting aspects. I do hope both characters reappear through the series and that both characters are treated with respect. There was some soapboxing from one character in terms of moral values that irritated me but hopefully that was the character talking and not the game trying to force its ethical views.\n\nThe art and music are also fantastic. I do want to stress that this is a great visual novel, just not really a game. More than anything, it's the fact that it's not opening for me any more that'd most keep me from recommending it. Otherwise, if you're okay with getting a good story in place of a game, go for it.","December 18, 2014","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coppermantis/recommended/248800/","Coppermantis","Klemens von Metternich [Copper]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coppermantis/","88 products in account","This is a short (A little over an hour for one run, though you might do more than that to follow alternate paths) but high quality visual novel. If you like VNs, then this is definitely worth looking into. Keep in mind that, if you are expecting lots of dialogue options or more traditional "gameplay," then you won't get that here. The story is largely linear with one really major choice followed by some shorter dialogue that you can select. If you want to get a good idea of how DysSys will play out, check out Dischan's other work, Juniper's Knot. It's short and, most importantly, free, so you can get a good idea of how Dischan does things. Though it has absolutely 0 player involvement, unlike DysSys. JK is a great story worth looking at for its own merit, honestly, so even if you don't want to buy DS then still consider JK if you like visual novels.\n\nSo, if you mostly want to invest in a brief but engaging story, then DysSys is pretty great. The characters are well-written with good dialogue and the worlds are pretty immersive, though we don't get to explore them in great detail in Episode 1. Episode 2 is reportedly going to be much longer, clocking in at rougly 12 (!) hours according to the developers, if memory serves. Accordingly, it will also involve more choices and more exploration of the intriguing world introduced in Ep1. Of course, that's all yet to be seen.\n\nFinal conclusion: Won't appeal to anyone expecting much player agency or a "real" game in the traditional sense, but definitely worth it if you want a great story. I certainly enjoyed my time with it, no matter how brief.\n\nI'm also going to add that, if there's one thing that Dischan has down to a T, it's music. The soundtracks to both this and Juniper's Knot are phenomenal.  Do yourself a favor and listen for a few.","July 10, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you judge it under the umbrella of games it doesn't fair well but under the latter it is a very high quality piece of work. It is an enjoyable read from start to finish, this is the first episode in the series and introduces the characters and the concept of the world. I will say that it does start slowly for the first 10 minutes of dialogue and environmental setup, but as it progresses you will get entralled in the world they have created. It discusses some difficult issues of morality and without going into spoilers has school/adventure elements. It has   a relatively good soundtrack, clean interface and offers a few dialogue options (although very minor and few and far between). On the downside it has no voiceacting (but decent sound effects, just shocking no VA given how polished everything else is), and it is quite short, capable of completing within about 1.5-2h. Lastly its second episode is on hault for whatever reason and although at the time of writing this it is underway, the story leaves you desperately wanting to know more.

The story is hard to grasp at first, without prior knowledge, but you do eventually slide into it, and its a tough ride to be sure.\n\nThe artwork and presentation is very standard of a visual novel, in that it looks gorgeous and sounds great, and the character's text is very fluent and well edited. You essentially follow the character Winter around, (its extremely linear, as with all visual novels) and experience the story via text and choice making. Your choices can lead in various directions, allowing you to see different outcomes (make sure to save  haha); which reinforces the whole theme of the story, which revolves around managing Chaos on remote worlds.\n\nI greatly enjoyed this experience, and will definitely be buying the second episode when it releases so as to learn even more.\n\nBloody beautiful.","October 2, 2013","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It is likely that Dischan will not be releasing future episodes for it. Please be cautious while buying, as you are getting a short VN that sets itself up as a prequel and you won't be getting a conclusion.

This almost makes your choice seem pointless, if this visual novel was going to be the only one from this series. However, with the way it sets itself up with the end, as well as the recent confirmation of more episodes, the story will continue and so one way to think of this is the beginning act of the story, and thus everything would not have reached the climax yet.

Even the UI is presented in a rather appealing manner, though not quite as unique as, say, the console in Analogue: A Hate Story. The interesting thing that separates art for this VN with others is the painterly style, and it actually blends in well with the background and makes the characters feel very much a part of the world they are in. Writing is also very good, with a lot of good focus on characterization and growth, however the dialogue can feel stilted from Winter. There was also a lack of world building for their world, for the most part, and something I hope will be explored in the future (it would also explain why Winter's dialogue feels a little forced). While not impacting the core of the game, I also felt the fanservice-y pictures of the underage characters really off putting, and I'd rather there be more varied art to unlock since it's feels really exploitive having those pieces take up 50% of the unlockables.\n\nDefinitely recommended if it's on sale at all. If you're going to buy it full price, be mindful of the length and endings. The art and music (soundtrack included) does make it a great visual novel to play through, though, and gives us a good idea of what to expect in the future quality-wise.","December 23, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/recommended/248800/","ghiz876","Gumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/","33 products in account","I'd like to recommend this game, I truly would but I cannot do so in good faith. There are a few very key flaws with this game that prevent me from being able to recommend it. I don't regret the purchase and I did enjoy it, for as short as it was but I imagine a lot of people could easily be put off by the experience. In fact I'm probably being very lenient on it myself.\n\nDysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is the first in a series. The following installments have yet to be released but will be longer and also must be purchased individually. It is a visual novel that relies heavily on immersing players with story and characters, with the only gameplay being making choices throughout the story to change how things go. But here comes the biggest issue. Throughout the course of the game, I made one choice. Literally one. In other words, this was a short story, not a game. I cannot call something that had such bare minimum interaction a game. The game itself also only lasted around two hours. The length wouldn't be a big issue, since it is cheap and I got it on sale, but the fact there's only one choice throughout is a damn joke.\n\nHowever, the appeal in a game like this is that you can go down other paths, see what happens if you choose another option, right? And I'm sure if I picked the other option, I'd have at least one more choice to make, based on what I've seen. I don't know for sure though, since I haven't been able to replay this game. Attempting to reopen the game gets me an error message, one which haunts me no matter how many times I reinstall, verify game cache or restart my computer. The game doesn't even work properly.\n\nThe third key issue is one that's going to bring down the wrath of men's right's activists everywhere on me. The extras in this game include artwork. Some of this artwork is fanmade and portrays the (underage) female characters of the game in risque positions. This automatically makes the creator's respect for his characters come across as shallow, as he willingly keeps extras that objectify and sexually exploit his characters in the game. Apparently this is because of a dislike for retroactive censoring. I think a bigger issue is the ominous aura that now surrounds this game and its characters, that no matter how well developed or interesting they may be, ultimately they will be used for shameless fanservice.\n\nI want to end this review with some positives. While it was short, it was still a great story. It centers around two main characters, Winter Harrison and Cyrus Addington. Both these characters are not only entertaining but very interesting, with unique backgrounds and moral beliefs. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't give away the most interesting aspects. I do hope both characters reappear through the series and that both characters are treated with respect. There was some soapboxing from one character in terms of moral values that irritated me but hopefully that was the character talking and not the game trying to force its ethical views.\n\nThe art and music are also fantastic. I do want to stress that this is a great visual novel, just not really a game. More than anything, it's the fact that it's not opening for me any more that'd most keep me from recommending it. Otherwise, if you're okay with getting a good story in place of a game, go for it.","December 18, 2014","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find the premise interesting but the cast doesn't leave me with a fantastic impression.  A gruff teacher with a questionable morality being paired up with an inexperienced, younger person who questions said morality? That's nothing new. Granted the VN was far too short to really expand on these characters beyond these archetypes, I question if they will in future episodes.\n\nI feel like the premise leads itself to a lot of potential for good stories, but I feel like how effective this will be is dependant on how much your choices matter. I'm not asking to be bombarded with a bunch of trivial, pointless decisions such as "will you drink the beer or not?" But I'd like to have it so that my choices don't lead to the same result. The fact that the nuke destroyed the entire world was.... a real big copout. I think your choice to either launch the nuke or not should be reflected on what happens to the nation and your ability to discern what you think is right on the people based on the codex information{which is admittedly interesting to read} would add a lot to the story I feel.\n\nTo its credit, the art and music are pretty good. The use of facial expressions is well implemented and the images don't feel like they're static portraits. I don't think the music is particularly memorable, but it works well given its usage.\n\nI personally felt unimpressed by this game's story. While I see it for its potential, I don't think the writer has the right idea on how to use it based on my 3 hours spent on this. They have to make some pretty big improvememnts to the overall storytelling and structure of decision making to really leave an impression on me.","December 13, 2014","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/recommended/248800/","ghiz876","Gumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/","33 products in account","I'd like to recommend this game, I truly would but I cannot do so in good faith. There are a few very key flaws with this game that prevent me from being able to recommend it. I don't regret the purchase and I did enjoy it, for as short as it was but I imagine a lot of people could easily be put off by the experience. In fact I'm probably being very lenient on it myself.\n\nDysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos is the first in a series. The following installments have yet to be released but will be longer and also must be purchased individually. It is a visual novel that relies heavily on immersing players with story and characters, with the only gameplay being making choices throughout the story to change how things go. But here comes the biggest issue. Throughout the course of the game, I made one choice. Literally one. In other words, this was a short story, not a game. I cannot call something that had such bare minimum interaction a game. The game itself also only lasted around two hours. The length wouldn't be a big issue, since it is cheap and I got it on sale, but the fact there's only one choice throughout is a damn joke.\n\nHowever, the appeal in a game like this is that you can go down other paths, see what happens if you choose another option, right? And I'm sure if I picked the other option, I'd have at least one more choice to make, based on what I've seen. I don't know for sure though, since I haven't been able to replay this game. Attempting to reopen the game gets me an error message, one which haunts me no matter how many times I reinstall, verify game cache or restart my computer. The game doesn't even work properly.\n\nThe third key issue is one that's going to bring down the wrath of men's right's activists everywhere on me. The extras in this game include artwork. Some of this artwork is fanmade and portrays the (underage) female characters of the game in risque positions. This automatically makes the creator's respect for his characters come across as shallow, as he willingly keeps extras that objectify and sexually exploit his characters in the game. Apparently this is because of a dislike for retroactive censoring. I think a bigger issue is the ominous aura that now surrounds this game and its characters, that no matter how well developed or interesting they may be, ultimately they will be used for shameless fanservice.\n\nI want to end this review with some positives. While it was short, it was still a great story. It centers around two main characters, Winter Harrison and Cyrus Addington. Both these characters are not only entertaining but very interesting, with unique backgrounds and moral beliefs. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't give away the most interesting aspects. I do hope both characters reappear through the series and that both characters are treated with respect. There was some soapboxing from one character in terms of moral values that irritated me but hopefully that was the character talking and not the game trying to force its ethical views.\n\nThe art and music are also fantastic. I do want to stress that this is a great visual novel, just not really a game. More than anything, it's the fact that it's not opening for me any more that'd most keep me from recommending it. Otherwise, if you're okay with getting a good story in place of a game, go for it.","December 18, 2014","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sad truth is, there was no form of planning or meetings being held consistently. The studio filed bankruptcy some time after this title was released. The management was abyssmal, to say the least...\n\n\nOnto the game, it has a very good soundtrack, one I still enjoy hearing to this day, the art style is nice to look at even if bleak at times for dramatic effect (well used and impactful I might add) and the dialogue is quite mature, despite being very one sided for a pretty good chunk of it, it doesn't feel draggingly long like in other games and is actually well written enough if you are into untraditional VNs. The included encyclopedia like feature is however not useful for most of the story aside from it's introduction. It is wasted effort and could have been made much more relevant if they bothered with it a little more than to just add an entry every now and then for plot purposes, which is to it's detriment. The amount of work put into the encyclopedic portion of the game is respectable but ultimately laughable if you take out the important bits that relates to the plot which, again, were used to introduce the player to its function/presence.\n\n"Should you play this game in my opinion?" is the last question left to be answered; as of right now, no.\nThe end is a cliff hanger into the next volume that will never come. If, by some miracle, this gets a reboot/revival by the original creator and owner of the copyright and is actively working on developing the sequel, then I will revise my judgement of this first game and give it a recommendation, but unless things start moving again for the development of just chapter 2, stay away from this and save some money for an actually finished game.","May 30","false","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
