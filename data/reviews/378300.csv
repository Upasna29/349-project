So start downloading while you read this.\n\nPros:The art: love it. Everything is completely unique and author has done best to evade any overdone things. The details are clearly worked on, but do not give the "overly pulished round corner" feeling that the latest games of this genre do.\n\nThe Reality: nothing like it before. No fantasy, no sci-fi, nothing like that. It is all new and interesting. The best I could describe it is a world where metal and minerals substitute flesh, but can be harmed and is maintained by paper? Does that make sense? The whole game is on a big living, sailing mechanical horse. There is one particular character I am even looking forward to seeing in next chapters, even though he is not a main one.\n\nLanguage: While all the text on the screen and all the jokes are in English, developer decided on using a complete gibberish language on audio. For you it will sound exactly like that one language you have heard once but can't really recall. That is the one that is used. This gives the game an even more alien feel and completely saves you from any bad voice acting (if there was one). I would suggest playing this game just for a few minutes to hear it, even if you are not interested in anything else.\n\nThe price: While I admit that the price is the reason I even played this, I really do have to put this as the lowest priority. I'd buy it.\n\nCons:\nLenght: It is kind of short. Of course, this is just chapter one, but the shortness is stressed by the story. You get a lot of various items, only to be used as "throwaway", so to say. It introduces about 7 new items, all to be used in a single place. This gives the feeling of a lot of things happening while actually it is already at the end.\n\nAnimation: Considering the amount of graphics done and the details on them, it is understandable that animating things is not an easy task. Sure, there are cutscenes, but those are done differently I guess. So whenever there will be a change in the scene, it will be offscreen.\n\nDialogues: It does bug me a little that dialogues sometimes do not advance. You do some things and those are not noticed by the people around. Even when they should be. It happens once or twice, but some places would be perfect to have another line about it. Maybe this is not a con, just an opportunity missed.\n\n\nOverall: 8/10. Download it just to see the art and hear the language. Comeon, doesn't cost you anything and would probably have already downloaded while you were reading this.","July 2, 2015","true","1.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

It's so good it should have a price to it, but it's free. Why.\n-Dark humor mixed with childish humor. The entire game is a spin around the idea that we need to have a ''second name'' in the world. See, back in the day before WW1 or 2, that used to be a thing. John the Smith, John the Shepperd and John the Pervert were three different men. Albeit John might have just been a blacksmith who liked butt♥♥♥♥ing sheep while wearing plate mail armor...the reason you needed a second name was to identify WHO you are and what you do.\n-The graphical style seems rather terrifying at first look, but once you get past the first screen that you are given, you start seeing things from a different angle.\nCon's:\n-If you get stuck somewhere you have to resort to the good old rub everything to everything until something happens.\n-If you are still stuck afterwards, think about something illogical and silly yet logical in the same time. The only time I got stuck was when... yeah won't spoil what's the answer but I NEED to leave a hint here because the answer was alien as all hell. TUBA. MUSIC. GOT IT? TOUCH IT.\n-It's not done yet. I want more, what can I say?\n\nI went in with doubts and low expectations and I came out with a grin as wide as my ears, wearing a suit made out of metal that is indestructible unless hit by a rock.","June 12, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","7","8","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kickbubblegum/recommended/378300/","kickbubblegum","kick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kickbubblegum/","1009 products in account","Lovingly crafted, freakishly surreal, beautifully drawn and wittily written, the Knobbly Crook's brief first chapter promises to lift point-and-click adventures to new heights while at the same time holding on to the classic item-based puzzles of the genre. And all for free.\n\nDespite its surreal approach and the implied violence of its plot, this is the kind of the game that leaves me with the kind of warm feeling I get when I watch a Wallace and Gromit animation. It even has cute (although potentially lethal) tribble-like creatures by the boatload.\n\nWhen I say surreal, I'm not just saying there are some funny colours in a few places and some “kooky” characters who say some slightly silly things.\n\nI'm saying this is a full-on sick, warped, renaissance-era fantasy version of our world where exploring means diving into the acid-filled bowels of the giant, flying flesh-and-wood horse upon which you are travelling, where the horse-ship's captain lives in a dark hole and literally has a sextant for a head and a hammer for an arm. Where a beefy animal handler (actually, living rock handler) wears oven mitts, has a colander for a helmet, is armed with kitchen spatulas and yet still manages to look tough. And that's leaving out the weirdest things, the ones I don't even know how to describe.\n\nWhen it comes to the plot, the best summary I can come up with is that once-peaceful paper farmer O'Sirus is given a mysterious quest by ... someone, to do ... something, for ... some reason. That's seriously about as clear as it gets, but that doesn't matter. It's the charm of setting out on an adventure and meeting a huge range of funny, friendly, cute or hostile characters that makes this game fun. You won't ever forget the people you meet on this journey, all distinct and memorable, from pocket sized Pokémon-types to room-filling hulks.\n\nSo it's high on intrigue factor. You will not have seen characters like this before unless you've smoked a lot of things you shouldn't, or you've played a lot of Zeno Clash. However, it's all too often that adventure games, especially those retro projects made with Adventure Game Studio (AGS), can't live up to the quality of their ideas with their production quality.\n\nBut Knobbly Crook's writer, artist, designer and voice actor, Ubisoft's Ethan Petty, doesn't do things half-a s s e d. (Well, other than the huge horse's a s s in the game, which he built with enough spare room to fit a bar into.) This is the kind of game you get from someone who's worked on Assassin's Creed, Watch_Dogs and Rainbow Six, now working on their passion project. That experience pays off in this little indie title that hits big with brilliant design on several counts.\n\nVisually, we have the best-looking game I have ever seen made with AGS, with incredibly intricate mouse-drawn HD graphics that are part Mayan sculpture, part steampunk and part science textbook. You'll want to spend ages exploring every inch of each screen, not just to hunt for interactive objects as is the old-school adventure way, but to hunt for meaning in the assorted symbolism and just to appreciate the sinister beauty of it all. With the animation, we have nice multi-layered animated characters and occasional brief, endearingly weird close-up cutscenes at key points. The only things I felt were lacking were a couple more cutscenes showing the consequences of the player's actions as we were promised earlier in the chapter, possibly with a cowering captain in tow, but I'm sure that would have been lot of work for a joke lasting a few seconds.\n\nWith the sound, we have the fully-voiced, or I should say, fully-growled, dialogue that's a demonic-sounding version of English matching the deranged and murderous characters perfectly, with an amusingly contrasting jolly folk guitar soundtrack by Pitx.\n\nWith the writing, we have this intriguing parallel world with a completely different way of life, physical laws, and morality and yet that echos our world in interesting little ways that amuse and confuse in equal measure, keeping us on our toes in a really engaging way.\n\nThe adventure gameplay itself is the one area where the game doesn't try to break any moulds. You get the quests, hunt the items, mix them up in your inventory, and bring them back to advance the story. It's a pity that such a forward-looking game still has separate Walk, Look, Use, Take and Talk actions that need to be switched between by mashing your right click button, when left click and right click should do for such simple puzzles. Also, at a couple of points in the game, it's necessary to complete an action that isn't quite logically connected to the current goals in order to progress. Of course, as Petty has stated, this is a nostalgia project, so these gripes are partly a design choice and are pretty much standard for retro adventure games. I just don't feel that they add anything entertaining. The fact that this and a couple of absent cutscenes are the only significant criticisms I can make says a lot about the quality of the finished product.\n\nIf you're a point-and-click adventure game fan who remembers not just the puzzle mechanics of the 90's golden age, but also their offbeat black humour, this is the game you've been waiting for.\n\nExcelling in design in multiple areas, notably the visuals and original story, and completely free, a gamer of any persuasion would be crazy not to download The Knobbly Crook, to take in the unique style of it all and especially to see what happens when someone finally makes the kind of game that inspired them as a kid.","October 19, 2015","true","3.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/josephlithius/recommended/378300/","josephlithius","Joseph Lithius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/josephlithius/","134 products in account","06/24/2015 Edit: Review updated slightly for v1.1!\n\nShort Review\nIf you like The Secret of Monkey Island, this game is sure to please at a price that can't be beat!    Even if you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before, this can still be quiet interesting from a few different angles.  The art is beautiful, the puzzles are interesting, and the music is just plain groovy.  It's definitely worth a shot, especially considering the price (or lack there-of)!  Just be warned... it can get gross and it will get weird at times!  But such is the world of the Knobbly Crook!\n\nLong Review\nSo... After watching this game develop from it's pre-alpha stage, arrive on Steam Greenlight, and find a place in the Steam library of games, I finally decided to play around with Gnarled Scar Manipulation's little tale of a simple Knobbcrookian paper farmer.  Man, this game is gorgeous.  However, I have some issues... and I don't mean with the Goblin Legal System.\n\nI had a hard time figuring out how to get this game to run in a window.  It turns out that you need to run the extra EXE file in the game's directory, "WinSetup.exe", to get the game into a window, among other things you might want (such as disabling the Knobbcrookian speech or changing rendering engines).  Not a real big problem if you just want to play the game, of course... but for some folks who like to multi-task, it might be an annoyance.\nOnce I got into the game, I was quickly disappointed by the fact that there are (currently) not hotkeys for switching the functions of the cursor, like in some older point-and-click adventure games.  The right mouse button and the drop-down menu on the score bar work just as well, but some Number Key quick-buttons would be kind of cool.\nI was also a bit disappointed by the fact there's no way to adjust the sound settings in-game.  A lot of older point-and-clicks have that option and I know Adventure Game Studios is capable of that, so why no option?\n(Note: v1.1 adds hotkeys for the various cursor functions and in-game sound settings!  Thanks, EJP!)\nI also noticed the game seems to hang a little bit between screen transitions.  I'm guessing it's to do with the massive amounts of graphics being loaded and unloaded at one time and the massive 1024 x 768 screen resolution of the game (and some of its graphics).  Not sure what could be done about this, but again, it's a bit trivial since the game only hangs for a second at-most.\nSimilarly, some areas of the game seem to run slower than others.  Again, not sure what could be done or what's even causing it, aside from the fact that the "slow" screens scroll while others don't.\n\nMoving away from the engine itself, I was kind of disappointed by how short this chapter of the game was.  Even though I got stuck a couple times by some puzzles, it didn't take me a whole lot of time to complete the chapter.  However, this game seems to be about the same length as any other modern-day, episodic point-and-click adventure game, so you're probably right on the money there.\nI was also a little disappointed by the lack of funny responses I'd get from things immediately following the introduction segment.  While a lot of things still had funny, or at least unique responses, it didn't seem like there were quite as many as there could have been -- particularly when it came to attempting to use inventory items in ways you're not intended to.  I think there's potential for some really hilarious quips from O' Sirus with some of those items, depending on how they're used!\n\nNow, I've said a lot of negative things about this game... so I think it's about time I said a few nice things as well!\n\nThe classic Sierra-style point-and-click interface really can't be beat.  It's clean and clear, even providing on-hover text hints if the icons confuse you (such as the Take and Use icons being a little too similar...)  The little dot on the cursor itself can be a bit irritating to get used to, but there's not a whole lot in the game that requires one-pixel precision clicking, so it's not too much of an ordeal.\n(v1.1 Edit: The Take and Use icons have been made more clear and room exits have on-hover hints now, for those rooms where the exit isn't entirely clear -- a very nice touch for folks like me who were sometimes left scratching their heads!)\nThe storyline of the chapter is told in flashback format and I say it works pretty well!  We get to not only see how O'Sirus ended up the way he is, but actually live the tale through an epic journey of humble beginnings.\nPlayer interaction is pretty good in this game.  Most everything you would expect to be able to interact with, you can!  As I said earlier, there's some pretty great interactions between O'Sirus and both NPCs and the environment!  Repeatedly pestering a certain NPC even gets you some nice, self-referential humor, though I think it may be lost on the younger crowd...  The overall humor in the game has just the right mix of slapstick, suggestive, and gross-out humor, never leaning too heavily toward one thing or another while keeping the laughs coming at a pretty good pace!\nThe sound effects are very fitting for where they occur and the music is pretty groovy.  Country-style music may not be for everyone, but it works pretty well here, in my opinion; it doesn't distract from the environments, but kind of adds a sort of mellowness to the strange places the player sees.  If anything, it's kind of calming, considering the environments...\nAnd speaking of environments, they're kind of a strange mix of the surreal and the normal...  One minute, you're in an ordinary building... the next, you're inside a giant animal's stomach!  Thus is the Knobbcrookian culture, I suppose... gross, but not too horrifying.\n\nNow, let's talk about the puzzles for a minute...  If you're familiar with the crazy combinations of things that Sierra (Space Quest) and LucasArts (Monkey Island) games had you do, you'll feel right at home here!  If not?  Well... I hope you're willing to think outside the box when trying to progress.  The game does give you some amount of hints as to what you can or could be doing at any given time, but like the games of the past... you really need to pay attention.  You may well only get a hint one time, leaving you to fend for yourself if you weren't!  Still, this a game that wants to be fun more than frustrating, and I'd say it succeeds at that quite well!\n\nAll and all, I would have gladly paid the usual price of $4.99 for something like this.  However, that price tag of zero dollars certainly opens this up for folks who want to try something different, but don't want to pay for something they're not sure they'll like.  This is definitely not a game for the impatient, but if you're willing to give your brain a little workout, this is a rewarding experience that leaves you wanting more.  And I, for one, am looking forward to the next chapter of the game!","June 21, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Its simplistic mechanics do nothing to detract from the games overall aesthetic, and its challenging puzzles were obscure enough for me to spend quite some time mulling them over, though I didn't stoop low enough as to delve into the developer's included walkthrough. Perhaps the hardest part of the game, outside of the obvious conundrums, were the lack of instruction regarding the various interaction options that the player is allowed. But outside of that, the first installment of the Knobbly Crook is a glorious gem of a game with an art style reminiscient of surreal Lovecraftian Literature, which I enjoy greatly.

It took awhile and a little help from a YouTube Walkthru to get all the puzzles cpmpleted, but it was worth it.  The graphics are really well done, but the storyline and knowing what to do when can be a bit frustrating, but I guess that's what this type of adventure offers.\n\nThis game is not a big, fancy, beautifully rendered game like most are used to nowadays.  It's a fairly simple point-and-click type where you must find the answers to just how to get certain items to the correct person(s) and to do what's needed to complete this chapter of the game.\n\nThis is chapter #1.

No coherent intro or context whatsoever. You don't even know who you are, what you're doing and are supposed to do, and what's going on. The story just starts with you in front of some weird machine and creature. You progress via trial and error.\nNo goals nor purpose. As the chapter proceeds, you get no closer to knowing what's going on, or what you're even supposed to do. All you encounter are weird creatures and things. There are no known objectives. You would think that as you advance, things would start becoming clearer... They don't.\nActive areas are not indicated. I normally wouldn't have a problem with this, but given that you do not know what your goals are, and the world is a fantasy one with weird- and nonsensical-looking objects, how are you supposed to know what you can interact with and what you can't?! And randomly clicking to find out what's active or not is not my idea of productive gameplay.\nArt style is tiring on the eyes. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if active objects were marked and you knew what you could click on and what you can't. Unfortunately, as I've mentioned above, since active objects are not indicated, you have to click around on anything and everything, and that means examining each scene carefully and in detail. The garishness of the artwork really gets to you after some time.\nWhat's right?    It's free. So go ahead and try it for yourself if you are so inclined; there's nothing to lose here except time and bandwidth.\nUnique art style. Outside of this game, I'd love the artwork, but not here, due to the reasons mentioned above under "What's wrong?"\nHigh production values. There's very decent voice acting, though characters all speak gibberish - apparently some in-game lingo. (There's text so you can decipher what they're saying.) The interface, sound, music, etc all speak of high quality.\nIn a nutshell...If they fixed the intro/context and interactive objects issue, I would definitely give this another go.","January 16","false","0.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

After watching the walkthrough video I realized that you have to use your items (in this case one particular item) in a pre-detirmined orded (the item had two purposes, if you use it for the "second" purpose before you use it for the "first" it will disapear thus disabling you to move on), and if you don't stick to that order, you can't finish the game and it was the second last thing I had to do to finish it.
