"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/305920/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","When you start Another Perspective one thing immediately becomes clear. And that’s how much it looks like Braid, another puzzle platformer from a couple of years ago (which, to this day, is still mighty brilliant). Not only that, but you also have to use clones. So in a way it’s also very similar to The Swapper. Again, another amazing game. The puzzles, however, are what make it different and unique from these other games and overall they're pretty good.\n\nAnd wow, this game made my brain hurt sometimes, and I mean that in the most positive sense possible. Some of the puzzles are pretty hard and require patience and dedication. Once you ‘see’ the solution it’s actually very obvious, like most of the puzzles out there. Now, not all of the puzzles were difficult. It varies greatly in its difficulty. That’s also partly because of its narration, which basically consist of text lines shown during the levels that try to explain the ‘story’, or the general idea behind it. At first I thought it was shallow but the further I got the deeper the narration became and by the end I was truly intrigued by the lesson it tried to ‘teach’ me.\n\nAs I said, the graphics are reminiscent to those of Braid, so it has a style that looks like everything’s made with watercolor paint. It looks pretty, but it’s also very dark at the same time. The lighting is done very well, and gives the game a bit more style. It would’ve been nice if it used some variety in its backgrounds instead of just showing black but I can’t argue with the developer here as it’s an artistic choice.\nThere’s only music; there is no voice acting here. The game doesn’t need any and the music is relaxing and fits the genre. It doesn’t want to push you forward but wants to let you play at your own leisure, which is absolutely a good thing. Especially if you want/need to think things through.\nThere were some typos in some of the narrated lines. I don’t think these were intentional and I suppose they could be fixed with a patch. It didn’t break the game or anything, but it did pull me out of the experience, even if it was for just a little bit. A minor problem, in any case.\n\nAnother Perspective isn’t a very long game, depending of course on how good you are at solving puzzles. It will take roughly between 30 minutes and 2 hours to complete the story. After that you can start the Mystery mode which gives you even more puzzles and apparently a different, real ending, so I guess there must be even more to the story than I originally thought. I have to be honest and say that I haven’t completed the Mystery mode (yet) but I think it’s safe to say that you can add 30-60 minutes to the total playtime, maybe even more.\n\nWell, well, well, time to wrap things up:\nIf you enjoyed Braid and The Swapper you really shouldn’t have to think twice. It might not have the same narration or complex puzzles as those games have but it still manages to stand on its own two feet. And even if you haven’t played those games – or as long as you enjoy puzzle games in general - this is absolutely a fine experience to begin with.\n\n[Rating: 76/100]","August 4, 2014","true","2.0"," 67 of 74 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","67","74","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/recommended/305920/","ericjdouglas","koala fish mutant bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/","561 products in account","Decent little puzzler/platformer that borrows heavily from two indie darlings, Braid and The Swapper, and features not so much a story as a stream-of-consciousness exploration of self in a "conversation" between the player and the creator of the game. It's a bit challenging towards the end (I had to resort to watching a Youtube walkthrough for one of the puzzles) but for the most part not the kind of thing that'll make you want to tear your hair out.\n\nIt's enjoyable enough, though quite short. My playtime shows about 4½ hours because I goofed off a bit, but you could easily complete it in 2 hours I imagine. There is an extra game mode called "Mystery" that I haven't tried yet but which has bonus levels that are supposedly trickier than the story levels, and there is an achievement for a speed run of the main story mode, so there is a bit of replay value.\n\nIf I had a gripe with the game it would be that the story is rather meandering and slightly plagued with filler-itis, and while it tries to be thought-provoking and deep, it unfortunately reminds me of something you might see posted on /r/woahdude or /r/showerthoughts. It does, for me, bring to mind the concepts and ideas in the play Six Characters in Search of an Author[en.wikipedia.org], and it's not something you often think about while playing a game, so it's an interesting thought experiment all the same. Still, I would've liked it better if the writer had kept the tone a little less informal, and perhaps broke the fourth wall a little less obviously. But these are just personal peeves, and you may not care so much.\n\nBottom line: short, sweet, a bit of a head-scratcher but not a scalp-bleeder, an interesting enough little diversion.","August 31, 2014","true","4.5"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","2"

Only the intriguing part is this parallax view that is the gameplay, where you view an object from two - or a multitude - of different perspectives and the object, in this case the level, changes its appearance. The gameplay itself is reminiscent of how some of the levels of The Swapper plays out, in the interplay of the “clones” or in this case just arbitrary copies or resized models of the same Braid look-alike character that we, the player, are in control of.\n\nYou get the feeling of Another Perspective's metanarrative quite early on in the game. Where the narrator seems aware that this game is, in fact, a game. The player is set out to find the objet petit a or the “unattainable object of desire.” The same object that later turns out to be something completely different.\n\nWe have many metanarrative games these days, games that poke fun at the derived nature of most game genres. It happens so often that these metanarrative games become this type of derived, iterative, easy way out for delevopers that lack “real” creativity in their storytelling. I struggle to figure out if this game is one of those games, or not. To break the parallax here I would say it's somewhere inbetween. It, almost, seems like the metanarrative in Another Perspective manifested itself qua lack of ideas. But in that process, what actually manifested itself turned out to be rather enjoyable, albeit mildly mawkish, but to be honest I've never felt as appreciated for playing a game, so I'm okay with the overly sentimental parts of this game. I was smiling during some portions of the game, due to its narrative, or to this self-aware developer/player interaction commenter guy.\n\nAnd on the subject of derivation, this game borrows its tone heavily from Braid. Not the melodies themselves, but the undertone, the brooding, surreal hum of the strings that plays throughout the game reminds me of the same undertone in Braids OST. The character animation is also something that, along with games like The Bridge, seems to be a not as iconic ersatz of the character in Braid. But that's something ubiquitous in the indie-2D-platformer-scene.\n\nThe general artstyle is rather simplistic, almost minimalistic, not to the level of Thomas Was Alone, but still very simple. This gives the player all their time to focus on the puzzles themselves. And in a metanarrative, the gameplay surely suffers(?), as in the case of Spec Ops: The Line and The Stanley Parable? Not in this case. The puzzles in Another Perspective range from simplistic, puzzles that are there to make the player happy (KEYS!!!), and mind-bogglingly complex puzzles that turns into a gradual understanding of the complete picture. As in The Swapper, and as mentioned before, the copies' interactions is what the majority of the puzzles are based upon, but in a deeper sense than what The Swapper provides, since in that game these are only one of multiple different ways these clones interact and solve puzzles. Here the focus is on different types of perspective and the interplay between these perspectives and entities. The way you had to think between different screens and positions really made the game's more complex puzzles very satisfying to figure out. And despite the narrative being self-obsessed it managed to, rather creatively, explain the games mechanics to you.\n\nThe narrative, narrator, commentator, the supposed player thoughts, does at one point in the game break down, due to the meaningless of it all, and pleads the game to stop, the player to stop, just for this madness to end. At this point I wondered if this was supposed to mirror the player's thought on a game where there is no discernible goal, or meaning. What that did instead was to bring down my overall thoughts on the narrative, the text on the screen, the conversations, that even though it's a short game, it starts repeating itself in a slightly annoying fashion. But at just that point of annoyance, it switches things up and the end draws closer, relieving not the player of meaninglessness, but the narratives' inertia.\n\nAnother Perspective is a short, cheap game, and it's worth your time. It's clever at points, in both level design and narrative, and even though there is no real outstanding visual or auditory style to the game, it has enough style, to not make it completely bland. As mentioned before, I've never felt so appreciated for playing a game. And just for that, I feel this game is worth something. Its humility despite its skeptical narration is admirable, and the final moments of the game are fairly cute and lovable, depending on how cynical and bitter you feel that day. I would give this a shot if I were you.","August 9, 2014","true","0.9"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","0"

Wait, isn't this the case with gaming in general? Maybe, but very few games are actually aware of it. This game is and the fact that its developers built it around these design philosophies already makes it a very clever little game.\n\nBut what makes it truly shine is the fact that it is another fine game that turns gameplay into a very appropriately creative way to convey meaning. And what it conveys is a very well staged metaphor for conversation, for dialogue. Remember how you always take turns in conversation and its dialogical nature means that there are always at least two sides to it? And that means that there's always another pespective involved. And, as the developers so keenly put it: "To change perspective is to change reality!"\n\nAlso, remember how in conversation you often take leaps of faith throwing in an argument that you don't exactly know where it'll land, but it kinda fits together with what was said before or may prove a standing ground for something to be said later? This little game managed to turn this into gameplay and it's obvious they put a lot of thought and talent into this because they also built the little "story" it tells around it. It's not uncommon for 2D puzzle games to turn a gameplay mechanic into a narrative technique (although, as seen in Braid or The Swapper that usually requires a lot of art work and concept design to fill the gap between the two), but here this is done so effortlessly and with so few resources that it's obvious the developers really mastered this art to perfection. And it's not a small feat to turn a minimalistic 2D game into a Socratic experience. I loved it to bits. Buy it if you love puzzles and the very intriguing ways gaming is learning to become a creative medium these days.","August 19, 2014","true","8.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

"Exactly." would be my reply, but the game tells it in quite an intriguing way,  a way I personally didn't see coming. It takes, the whole there's someone else who sais and thinks diffirent thing, what you've seen in the trailers and takes it few steps further. This, in turn, gives the story a little more weight to it, and, in my books, makes it a little bit better. The game really tries to make you think, but after a while it will be a little more brunt with its message, and you will notice that. That's quite the shame though, because at one point it really was making me ponder and this just made me lose the immersion it created.\nNow for the mechanics and design.\nLets start with the art design:\nThe art design is pretty good. The levels look boring, just brown and grey brown. The character though, that's what I really liked. The drawing style was just a breath a fresh air for me, since I've gotten used to the standard triple A level of charachter creation.\nNext up, the mechanics:\nThe mechanics are fine, great even. Mechanics are introduced and reused. The mechanics are varied and work as they should. And there's one more thing, a very big and important thing. Gameplay work together with the "story". Seriously, this game does things better than most triple A's out there.\nAnd lastly, design:\nThe levels are good enough. For me at least. I haven't got that much experience with puzzle platformers so I was surprised at the difficulty of this game. Other won't have this problem, because they have superbrains or something. The difficulty ramps up to almost at the end, but it never overstays it welcom by presenting levels that look very much alike over and over again. It is really short because of this, which is a shame, but I can't hate it for that little flaw.\nIn conclusion. Some people might like it for the message, some for the mechanics and some for the challenge. In my opinion is the design not something which will hold it up, but it did help me in the decision making.\n\nI hope you do buy this lovely little game and have fun.","September 29, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Going through the game you play as a little adorable guy who has no idea whats going on, much like the main character we we're also confused. He doesn't know where he's at, or why he's there. You must complete each puzzle to continue his train of thought. Interesting game to play if your looking for a mellow hour to chill. The music is slow and warming, art style is simple and very likeable. Controls are easy to get use to.\n\nMost of the puzzle are pretty easy, there were a few that drove me NUTS! We had to look up how to do one certain puzzle. Puzzle games usually frustrate me and I end up yelling on the screen. A+ on accomplishing that.\n\nWe have a gameplay video on youtube if anyone is interested in the game or need help solving a few puzzles!\n\nWe reccomend this game :)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/26ov-XoZJA8","September 18, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The goal is to use each version of yourself in tandem to piece together the greater puzzle.\n\nThe game has a short, but lovey soundtrack, pleasant graphics, simple gameplay, and what I consider to be a rather unique plot, and of course above all, fun to solve puzzles. As a fan of the Portal series I was able to enjoy this game quite thoroughly.\n\nHowever there are some downsides, the game is incredibly short and will probably take you about an hour to run through, two if you want to discover the “true” ending. There is even an achievement for making it through all the rooms in 12 minutes which should give you a good idea of how short this game is. I also experienced a slightly annoying graphics glitch where parts of the screen would flash in red, but it was not enough to stop me enjoying the game, though I would not recommend buying it at its full price, perhaps grab it on a special or in a bundle as I did.","October 1, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The narrative is "deep" ah, trying-too-hard-to-be-original, cliched without specifically being a cliche. It's an attempt (and a failed one, in my opinion) to be cute, artsy, and original. If you're really into cheesy narratives or are really really pressed to find a quick little puzzle game, try and pick it up when it's less than $1.

From the wavy hair of their similarly drawn lead character, to the general look and feel of the experience, and the fact they both inhabit the same genre allegations of plagiarism wouldn't be entirely off base. Setting that aside, the biggest thing keeping them both distinctly separated is that Another Perspective is little more than a poor imitation of Braid and so many puzzle platformers; like an off brand toy you buy because it's cheap, only to see it fall apart a day later from the shoddy craftsmanship.\n\nIt's a shame because the basic idea behind Another Perspective sounds really cool in theory. Essentially there are two (sometime more) copies of yourself, but only one can ever interact with the world at any given time. The others remain frozen in space, becoming makeshift platforms as you switch between them rapidly to get around the alternating level designs to grab all the keys and make it through the door. And, that's basically it.\n\nMy biggest issue with Another Perspective is it takes this one idea and tries to build an entire game around it. Before I'd even gotten halfway through the hour or so long story, I was already tired of constantly repeating the same tedious puzzles which seemed to be repeating themselves with but minor alterations, wishing that I'd come to the point where they would evolve and show the potential of the neat switching mechanic. But that moment never came, and I was left with an unsatisfactory ending that almost seemed to demean itself for the repetitiveness of its design, and the lack of any real point to its narrative which might as well not exist, being entirely comprised of random observations and overblown hogwash.\n\nThere were basically two possibilities for how I thought Another Perspective could turn out, the first that it would surprise me despite its nearly stolen art style with clever use of its mechanics and inventive puzzle designs, and the second being covered in the paragraphs above. It's a hollow experience and a miss opportunity, devoid of anything remotely impressive or memorable for me to latch onto. Near the end of the game my character began to question if there was any point to all of this, if it was ever going to amount to anything, which I can answer easily with a disheartening "no".","August 20, 2014","false","1.4"," 18 of 40 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","18","40","0","4"

It was enjoyable, thought provoking and challanging.\nThe graphics are nice, and the mechanics aren't difficult, which makes this game very nice, for the fact: you only need to think about the puzzles. Not, "Oh, how am I going to get over there without sticking to the wall?" Or, "The jumping only works every fifth time I press it." The mechanics are smooth and allow for nice gameplay, with only about four main controls. This was a nice little game to knock out in an afternoon when I didn't have anything else to do. The cost is a little much, but other than that, great game!\n\nIn conclusion:\nGameplay: Nice\nGraphics: Neat\nMechanics: Great\nPuzzles: Difficult\nTime: Roughly 1 hour if you speed run it. 2 If you stop to enjoy it.\nOverall rating: 8/10\nPROS: Great game, nice gameplay.\nCONS: Short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/305920/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Another generic puzzle game. This one you constantly have to flip through copies of yourself to solve same looking rooms and the same few ideas repeatedly in more convoluted puzzles. Instead of multiple options each puzzle has 1 single way to solve it, and it usually involves about 15 steps that you have to figure out perfectly. If you mess up almost every level you have to restart from scratch, meaning its all trial and error. Not really much of a story besides a few lines of subtitles that pretend to be smarter than they are. You start with 1 copy of yourself but then more get added, making puzzles longer and more frustrating. Also each flip has a few different changes  and remembering what is with whom, especially when all 3 copies look the same is annoying. Not much here. 4/10.","November 25, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only thing I REALLY dislike about it is the speedrunning achievement. That achievement is not very easily done without hours upon hours of trials and it frankly ruins the feel of the game. If you just want a fun game to play and don't care for achievements, this is great. If you care about achievements, this will very likely make you very angry. It is not the same game after learning about this achievement. I love the message and the feel of it though.","November 25, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
