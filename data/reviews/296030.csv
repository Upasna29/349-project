And this game has lots of stealth elements. But in a very unique way. First of all, you play one of the most interesting characters imaginable. Then the story is dark, nothing is like it seems at first. The setting is fantastic. I don't want to spoiler so that's about it. I just want to say, I've bought several games in the last time that I found more than disappointing. This little gem here is different. I've only just played somewhat over one hour, but already I have the feeling that I've become addicted in a certain way. I want to know where this game is going; I want so see if my decisions affect the outcome, if I gather enough informations etc.\nJust buy it, if the trailer seems like it could give you something.","January 20","true","5.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It’s meaning is relatively simple and cleverly ties into the game’s story. Qasir al-Wasat means the palace in the middle and that is precisely the game’s setting.The game’s Steam description, below, does a very good job in explaining the game. So rather than focusing on that I’ll jump immediately into my opinion on the actual game play. I’m not generally a huge fan of games where you’re dead in one hit and have to start over from a checkpoint but I was definitely a fan of this game. The setting is brilliant and the narrative that begins with the introduction really suckered me in. I genuinely felt as though I was experiencing Syrian culture. In a world where many people are far too easy to dismiss the culture because of world events its a real treat to see something that is so easy to immerse yourself in. It’s content is something that even those who hold ill-formed prejudices should be able to gain enjoyment from.\n\nI’m a huge fan of how the stealth mechanic works. It also happens to be the most important mechanic in the game – present in almost everything that you do. If you move into lit areas enemies will see you therefore you need to be careful where you are at all times. But that is only the first layer of the mechanic. Arguably the most important part, certainly the most compelling from my perspective, is if you kill an enemy and get blood splatter on you you’ll become visible to enemies even when you’re out of the light. There are pools of water spread throughout each map that allow you to cleanse yourself of the blood and to return to a fresh status. These are well placed throughout the game with most or at least many serving as a checkpoint (I didn’t die everywhere so I’m not one hundred percent certain).\n\nThe puzzles, of which I would consider most games of being, are fantastic and helps make the action-adventure a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There are a number of ways to move throughout the majority of the areas of the game and each will result in making the next part of the game either easier or more difficult. It’s a game where you can choose to attack and kill everything in your path or try to play as sneakily and stealthily as possible. Some rooms will require you to kill your enemies where as others can be conquered without getting blood on your hands, literally.\n\nI really do not have much to criticize. The only thing would be considered trivial. I believe that you’re thrown in at the deep end and not quite in the best way possible. I died a few times in the very first room. It took me a couple of minutes to work out exactly what I had to do and then I was set. The game is difficult, intentionally so, and you will die often. A few of the hits do feel as though you’ve been cheated but they’re easy to overcome and it’s not really a big factor in the game. Otherwise it’s a truly wonderful experience and one of the best that I’ve had this year.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone. I think there’s something here for all gamers and there truly is no content here that anyone could consider insulting. A truly great game.\n\n\nFor our Steam group go here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified\nFor our Steam Curation go here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified#curation","February 7","true","9.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melusca/recommended/296030/","Melusca","Melusca","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melusca/","300 products in account","Very unique game. Though at its core, it's a simple stealth game with occasional puzzles, its unusual setting (I wish there were more games taking inspiration from Islamic myths, it would be a welcome change from common high fantasy tropes), excellent atmosphere, and the way its mechanics reward different ways to play truly make it shine.\n\n+ Great visuals, taking their inspiration from Persian art. The lighting was also very well-done. Play this at night with dim lighting, it's even better.\n+ Amazing sound design. From your character's footsteps to the patrolling guards' distinctive skipping, as well as ambiant sounds here and there, or the characters' "voices", everything is near perfect.\n+ Simple but effective mechanics. You can go full stealth, massacre everything in your way (making further stealth attempts harder, but exploration easier), and use traps against the enemies (though they usually work better against you).\n+ Two endings. You can get the first one in a couple of hours, but you will likely miss half the content of the game by doing so.\n\n- A few repeated puzzles, particularly the "rotating wheels". Some of them are a bit unclear as well.\n- Later parts of the game focus less on stealth and more on traps and teleporters, so it's sometimes hard to know what to do next.\n\n8/10 Definitely get this if you're into stealth games, Islamic culture, or both.","May 5","true","7.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The stealth and puzzle game play is solid, but that's not the sell here. It is the rest of it. Set in 12th century Syria, utilizing Islamic mythology and synthesizing it with Crowleyesque fantasy, and looking like a cross between Persian/Mughal miniature art and The Legend of Zelda, this game is a unique aesthetique experience.","January 21","true","8.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

How can I be saying this at only .7 hours into the game? Well, that's because it takes much less time than that to notice how unusual the gameplay, aesthetics, sounds, and seemingly every other aspect of the game is. The atmosphere is not one I've felt in any other game. It's spookier than Silent Hill, but at the same, encompassing in such a way you feel compelled to continue within it. It's very mysterious.\n\nThe gameplay is immense. The controls and mechanics are unorthodox, you sneak around and solve puzzles, and can kill people to different results which can impact your game in varying ways. The screenshots for the game don't make it out to be an open world, GTA V near-realism experience, and yet, after killing two people in this game, I already felt something in my stomach sink a little. The way this game is designed, you're left feeling an emotional shift for every action you take - something that you don't find in very many games today.\n\nI normally have a passionate hate for anything tagged "Indie" and "2D" on Steam, but this one belongs in a category of its own. Nothing else touches the experience this game has offer, indie or otherwise.\n\n--------\nDay 2\n--------\n\nThis is a difficult game. You will die a lot, and there are many aspects to think about. There's a lot of puzzles.","January 20","true","1.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

You play as a creature summoned to a mysterious palace, to kill three guardians... but you have your own reasons for accepting the summons, and things are not as they seem.\n\nWhat's good?\nThe whole conceit of the game is well-implemented, and different enough to make you take notice. The art's nice, bright and vibrant. The character designs are decent. Writing is excellent; plot is top-notch.\n\nWhat's not so great?\nThe sound is only okay.

It has become one of my favorite stealth games. I highly recommend it and I REALLY love the story. I have become a bit obsessed with the secrets of the palace, and there are two things I am missing.\n1. Accessing one of the secret rooms (I can't figure it out still...)\n2. Find the final secret document.\n\nIf you like Stealth adventure games with a good story, play this! Also... I would very much enjoy if the developers make a sequel so we can interact with the Northerners a bit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deuxpolo/recommended/296030/","deuxpolo","deuxpolo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deuxpolo/","46 products in account","If you love Arabian Night, you'll love this little piece of masterpiece.\n\nHeavily focusing on stealth and one-punch death, players will control Subtle - a mystical creature summoned by a sorcerer named ah-Saahir with an assassination task: to eliminate 3 different targets and retrieve an extract of poison coming from their special weapons.\n\nOnce Subtle has completed the task, the game will be over, but the game's story line and secret is hidden so well that players can actually trick ah-Saahir and take time to explore his dark secret, motivation that makes him summon you from the beginning and what's hidden inside the palace that you take place in. The game focuses quite well on sound and visual as they're essential to the stealthy gameplay. With the ability of staying (Almost) invisible and one-hit kill, Subtle can walk around in the palace without having to kill (Almost, again) everyone on its path. But without its powerful poison, each kill Subtle makes will leave blood on its body, making enemies recognize it quickly, so trial 'n error will happen A Lot during the exploration.\n\nThe palace's design is well-done in a way that makes every room seem to be connected along with the characters in-game, making them look more life-like rather than repeated AI doing what they're programmed to. Secrets are also well-hidden and will force players to explore everywhere in order to solve puzzles and dig into the immersive story line. The sound and visual, again, are executed and prepared so pleasing that they represent a miniature version of your favourite Arabian tales when you were young. Puzzles are also designed well, making your grey matter work hard enough to solve them all.\n\nThe downside of the game is the clungy control during in-game and even in menu, especially when changing the binded keys. Sometimes you won't be able to use some buttons like the Examine one in a room or the dialog will be frozen, but these glitches don't happen too often, fortunately. Depending on your system's rig, V-sync may not work well and will create screen tearing while Subtle is moving around.\n\nBut overall, this game is a gem packed with tons of secrets that beg you to solve them in order to see what's behind the curtain. Totally recommended to try right now or you can wait until Steam sale comes.","January 25","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Within a few minutes of gameplay, it's easy to notice the qualities of this game - and there is a lot of them.\n\nThe mechanics are spare but very clever, with a surprisingly amount of depth. Aside from the stealth mechanics, there is a plethora of puzzles, branching paths and secrets that rewards patience and observation. The art direction is atmospheric and full of details, showing a deep commitment to craft and research. The plot is very straightforward at the beginning but is much more intriguing and complex than it seems. It is also one of the most unique and creative settings seen in a video game, with small vignettes and lush descriptions that result on a very rich and interesting lore. I would also recommend a good pair of headphones for the eerie sound design and music, which adds a lot of immersion and mood.\n\nNot all of these elements are perfect, but they are very coherent and consistent with the themes of the game, resulting in a sum that is greater than the parts. I would recommend this gem to everyone that is looking for a challenging gameplay that trusts the player intelligence while offering a unique setting and story.","January 24","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
