The direction from which the waves come will give you a hint (look at the flashing arrows)! Each time you kill an enemy, you will earn $1; accumulate money to buy, upgrade or repair your turrets. You will also be able to buy traps (lava Pod), defence droids and others to deploy in the path of your foe and see them vanish!\n\nMake sure to collect any credits that the aliens drop, you will need them to upgrade your turrets, sentinel and stronghold at your armoury in the pre-battle menu.\n\nAs you progress, you will be facing more and more waves of aliens per mission which will become hectic especially if you start losing several turrets and gates.\n\nSentinel 4: Dark Star is very fun, addictive, well designed and the graphics are good and polished. Mouse and keyboard for the control as you would expect. You will be able to play in campaign and endless modes with four levels of difficulty.\nThis game is a good tower defence game and I thoroughly recommend it.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good and polished graphics\n-	Good number of missions\n-	Fun and addictive\n-	Plenty of achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Can be a bit repetitive\n\n8.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Sentinel 4 tried to innovate upon a proven formula, but it was unsuccessful and made the gameplay worse.\n\nWhile players overlooked Sentinel 3's graphics due to its well-designed gameplay, the amateurish-graphics were not updated at all for Sentinel 4; in fact, some of the new graphical addition in Sentinel 4 looks horrible, and the poor graphics now really stands out when combined with the game's poorly-designed gameplay.\n\nSentinel 4 tried to build upon Sentinel 3, but it completely went in the wrong direction. The main problem with Sentinel 4 is that they added destrutible turrets and completely changed the reason why players enjoy Sentinel 3. Tower Defense games with destructible turrets sometimes work, but Sentinel 4 is NOT one of them.\n\nSentinel 4 have a similar upgrade system from Sentinel 3, and players who have played Sentinel 3 would be familiar with the new UI and upgrade system. For Sentinel 3 players, Sentinel 4 is easy-to-pick-up, but will find it changed and overall unenjoyable.\n\nThe game starts off by throwing exploding enemies that takes big chunks off of player and barrier health, then not long after, the game introduces airborne enemies with no path indicator that fly past defenses to attack your turrets. If your setup is built for attacking ground units, and have no anti-air turrets setup, the defense that the player set up is completely ruined on a random wave that the game announces will contain airbourne enemies.\n\nThe combination of destructible turrets and airborne units is frustrating and not an interesting gameplay feature. It creates a lot of busy-work where the player have to micromanage to avoid having your mech destroyed and constantly monitor and repair turrets. Tower Defense lovers who enjoy finding perfect turret placement and watch waves run into their immaculate tower defense design will find this game to be frustrating having to fiddle with repairs and micromanagement.","August 19, 2015","false","39.5"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/386840/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Any game series that can spawn 3 sequels has to be doing something right; Sentinel 4: Dark Star (S4:DS) is no exception. Offering a more traditional tower defense experience with solid & balanced game mechanics, there is 26 levels (plus 5 secondary campaign levels) in total with some good map designs & waves that can challenge, throwing your planned strategy into turmoil!\n\nFor seasoned TD fans, initially the game does feel rather easy on normal difficulty level. Myself, I managed to get through to level 15 before running into any real progression-crushing issues, which resulted in me having to go back and replay levels to upgrade up my towers. Unlike TD games like Prime World Defenders (which also has upgradable towers), the rewards for replaying are reasonable, which means although somewhat repetitive, you can progress at a reasonable pace even when you get stuck or continually loose at a level. Replaying earlier levels on hard or psycho difficulty will speed this up as well. For longer term replayability there is also (the always welcomed) endless mode with Steam Leaderboards for some competition. There is no maze/pathing in S4:DS.\n\nAs the title implies, you also have a unique unit called a Sentinel (basically a giant mech) that you can jump to certain locations on the map. They defend stronghold gates & support other fixed towers, allowing another layer to your strategy. As with the towers, your Sentinels can also be upgraded as they gain experience. Using these effectively can be the difference between success & failure. I really like the Sentinel feature & adds something different to what could be seen as a more generic TD game.\n\nGraphically it's competent but not great; tower weapon effects are ok as is the environments/maps, but could have benefited from some higher quality textures for the PC version & some smoother animations. Alien types are easily distinguishable even when things get hectic which is always a plus with a TD game. The musical score was good, getting stuck in my head long after I have exited the game, but other sound effects were a bit bland, but this does add a bit of an ol' school flavor to it all.\n\nThere are a few minor issues that did lead to frustration though. Firstly, attacks from the air can happen from almost anywhere on the map & from multiple sources at once (not following the traditional 'known' paths). These are not highlighted in any way at the start of the level (such as in Defense Grid) often leading to restarts once you learn where they come from. It drove me nuts at times! It diminishes the strategic element of the game, instead changing it to memorising the specific waves & entry locations.\n\nAlso, what I believe is a new introduction to the series, is destructible towers. Without having a fully upgraded tower, most are very squishy especially versus certainly aliens & can completely demolish any attempt to complete a level sometimes within mere seconds. Later levels seem to have specific waves designed just for this purpose. I am not against towers taking damage or being destroyed, as it adds yet another layer of strategy, but it is not as well balanced as the rest of the game in my opinion. You can cash-in/recycle destroyed towers to help cover the cost of the rebuild, but that down-time generally means a restart anyways. Very frustrating to see your precious towers built up over the last xxx waves of the level destroyed so quickly!\n\nS4:DS is not perfect but does offer good value for money, refined gameplay & a reasonable difficulty curve that can keep you coming back for some time after your initial round.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","January 28","true","33.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","4"

And the Sentinel series is my favorite Tower Defense series.\n\nPros\n- Playing on a big screen is definitely better than on a phone. Makes it more enjoyable to watch and easier to see what's happening.\n- Graphics look good on the big screen.\n- Great progression, in regards to permanent upgrades to your towers, gates, and misc. Carries to all future missions. Lots to do here.\n- Multiple difficulties to play thorough, and endless mode for each level.\n- x2 and x3 speed toggle.\n- Commanders to level up and utilize in your defense.\n- Towers to build both off and on the path.\n- Abilites, more awesome ones unlocked playing campaign.\n- Lots of missions, plenty of cool towers, lots of ways to play.\n- Mouse controls! No more fat-fingering on the phone XD.\n\nPro/Con\n- Interest gained for unspent currency each wave, subject to personal preference.\n- Graphical/art style, up to you whether you can enjoy this aspect.\n- This is not a tower defense where you build mazes using towers.\n\nCon\n- While there are tons of things to upgrade permanently, abilities and in-path towers/units are not upgradable. Worry not though, you still have powerful abilities in-hand and the pathing towers still useful in their own way.\n\nThis game will give you many hours of enjoyment and is most definitely worth it.

There is something a bit uncanny about the graphics which I can't explain but they look a little weird. The game seems very simple during the first few levels but completely changes later on and by the end it has enough complexity to compete with the best in the genre.\n\nI liked the idea of the sentinel which is a robot/creature that guards certain positions. Also the best part is the ability to upgrade so many different things for your towers, sentinel and stronghold. These other tower upgrades are different to the usual 3 level tower upgrades you buy during missions in games like this so it adds an extra level of strategy.\n\nAny TD fan will really enjoy this game the more they play it but don't be turned off by how simple it seems at first.","February 13","true","65.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
