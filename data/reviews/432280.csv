It's definitely worth playing if you enjoy shmups. The biggest turn off is going to be the controls, but don't let them ruin it for you, because a) if you play it a few minutes you'll get used to them, and b) you can remap them if you're playing mouse/keyboard and not with the controller. I'd recommend checking the help and controls screen before playing so you're not lost right away as to what everything is/does.\n\nAnyway, it's nice to see a good old fashioned shooter on Steam! Give it a try because, for 5 bucks, you won't be disappointed. Oh, and pro tip: utilize your shield!","March 24","true","4.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

When you start the game, music plays right away, and while I do like the music in this game, I found it to be slightly loud.  It'd probably be better if the developers set the volume at half, and just let people go in and turn it up if they wish.  One issue I noticed straight away was that you could not use WASD by default.  The keybindings had it to where the arrow keys were how you moved.  Given the fact that I'm right handed, this made it awkward to try and use the arrow keys with my left hand and navigate my ship's direction with my right hand/the mouse.  Fortunately, we can change the controls in the options.  It was in the options I discovered X (along with the left mouse button) were to fire.  I should've figured there was a button on the keyboard to fire.  My bad!  On the topic of keybindings, I noticed we cannot assign functions to side buttons on our mouse.  I suppose in this style of game it's not really a necessity to have it, but it would be pretty handy to assign the fire button to my extra mouse button.\n\nTo my surprise, Battlestorm has the option for high graphics.  Given the style of game, I expected one setting for the graphics, and that was low, about what you'd expect from this genre.  Battlestorm looks good with high graphics, but if you're planning to buy this game because you think the graphics will blow you away, you're forgetting what this game is.  I tested both high and medium settings, and even on medium Battlestorm still maintains good graphics.  Personally, I don't play a game like this for its graphics, so it doesn't really matter to me too much whether the graphics are low or high.\n\nOne issue I had was that the lightning is a bit too bright and distracting.  When there's a lot of enemies on your screen, it can get chaotic and a bit hard to follow.  The lightning doesn't help in the slightest.  I'm perfectly fine with having it in the game, but I think it could be toned down some.\n\nFinally, Battlestorm does have an online leaderboard.  I'm quite pleased with this, and think it'll help keep the community going when everyone is trying to be at the top of the scoreboard.  If I can make a suggestion to the developers, it may be worth looking into giving an award to people who remain at the top of the leaderboard for an extended period of time.  Maybe turn it into a tournament.\n\nPositives:\n\nGood music.\n\nKeyboard/Control customization.\n\nGood graphics, and an option to lower them if your PC can't handle it.\n\nKeeps true to the old arcade games, which makes it quite addicting.\n\nOnline leaderboard.\nNegatives:\n\nCan't assign any keys to your mouse's side buttons.\n\nLightning effect in game that is not only too bright, but adds to the chaos when there's a lot of enemies on the screen.\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators.","March 26","true","1.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/432280/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================BattleStorm is a fairly traditional style two-dimensional twin-stick shoot-em-up (shmup) with a slightly different focus to many.\n\nIn the game, you control a fighter that seems to be propelled by some sort of weird plasma jet, nimbly zipping around the screen and raining death on the unnamed armed forces that confront you. There are air and surface enemies that must be destroyed using two separate weapon types, and the ubiquitous 'bomb', which simply destroys everything on screen.\n\nThere's absolutely no background story or reason provided for what happens in the game, so you're left to wonder what's going on and why. This isn't as bad as it could be -- it's a shooter, after all -- but in particular it does make the boss battles at the end of every level rather unrewarding.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Graphics are good. The player's fighter and enemy units are well rendered, and mostly look quite nice over the backdrop graphics. Weapon effects are nice and explosions are colourful. Backgrounds are pretty and well animated.\n\nThere are plenty of options for screen resolution and window size, as well as a handful of levels of detail. After having difficulty getting it to run on my gaming laptop (the solution was to update graphics drivers to the latest; the game crashed the nVidia driver from three months ago that I had installed), I didn't play around with settings too much. Playing in a full HD window at max detail did cause my graphics card fan to make a racket, but everything on screen moved about without lag or freezing.\n\nSound - Music is acceptable, if nothing special. It didn't annoy me enough to turn it off, but I can't imagine wanting a soundtrack DLC. Sound effects are appropriate enough for a shmup: again, competent, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nGameplay - BattleStorm plays basically like any other twin-stick 2D shooter. Controls are a little different from other shmups I've played, though: WASD moves your fighter around the continually vertically scrolling screen, and the mouse moves your crosshairs around, causing your fighter to rotate towards the cursor, while mouse buttons fire air-to-air and air-to-surface weapons. There are also separate keys for activating your shield and dropping your one bomb per level. It apparently has full controller support, too, but I haven't tried that out yet.\n\nYour fighter is fairly zippy, but I found that its inertia seemed a little high, which took a bit to get used to. And I couldn't help wondering how my fighter was able to fly backwards using just a weird plasma jet on the rear of the craft. I know, I know: suspension of disbelief, and all that. Weapons power-ups are nice, but just didn't have that visceral, overpowered feel that I used to love from the classics. You don't gradually build up weapon power through powerups; instead, you pick up a new weapon each time.\n\nBattleStorm changes the traditional shmup formula by including health for your fighter, making bullet dodging much less important than in many other games, and dropped power-ups include health restoration as well. It also adds a score multiplier / combo meter, rewarding you for long kill combos with extra points and achievement rewards.\n\nThe game includes five levels on each of five different 'worlds' (background graphics), making 25 levels in total, but really once you've played one level for a world you've seen it all; the others just seem to be there to pad out the game.\n\nBattleStorm includes trading cards and Steam achievements as well, which should increase replayability. But without any sort of story or other encouragement to proceed, I found the whole thing a bit repetitive. And rather than adding to the game, I found the combo meter simply annoying, requiring timing of kills to try to prevent the meter from dropping to zero before the next enemy wave.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Smooth controls, once you get the hang of them\n+ Trading cards\n+ Achievements\n\nCons:\n- There's not much to it\n- No story\n- Score multiplier is a pain; it takes away from the fun rather than adding to it\n- It's not obvious where your surface weapons will fall, making them harder to use than they should be\n- The game doesn't 'hold focus' of the mouse in window mode, so you may find yourself unintentionally focusing on a non-game window in the heat of battle\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================I found it quite hard to decide whether to recommend BattleStorm or not. It's a good game, but not a great one. I suspect a seasoned bullet-hell veteran would find it disappointing and not worth his or her attention, so someone like me, who enjoys an occasional shmup, is probably a more suitable target audience.\n\nBearing that in mind, I decided to recommend it. I got a couple of hours' worth of fun out of it, and I'd expect most others in that target audience to do the same. I seriously doubt I'll bother trying to collect all of the achievements, though.\n\n6/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","April 5","true","2.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pokemonmaster888/recommended/432280/","Pokemonmaster888","Pokemonmaster888","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pokemonmaster888/","59 products in account","All right, I decided to review BattleStorm as it was a game I had been anticipating for a few months based on the pre-release news. That being said, BattleStorm is a great game. I really enjoyed playing the game and beating it. First off, I have played some shoot-em-ups in the past but I don't play them often. I like the genre and the concept of high scoring is something I really like to do. This game gives the player plenty of opportunities to rack up high scores and points, and the more skillful you are, the better your score will be. Powerups are random and that adds to the random aspect of high scoring; it's very likely no two runs will end in the same score. Keeping your score multiplier alive is key to getting good scores. Gameplay overall is not too deep, you just face a lot of enemies and have to destroy them to survive. This game has no story-line but doesn't need one; it's more of an arcade game. Shoot to win!\n\nWhen I first played the game, the original control scheme was an issue. Most players did not like it, and it was handicapping the game. It was holding it back, and I could see the game's potential beneath that. Once the new control scheme update was released, the game became way more playable, fun, and re-playable. The only downside is that the game did become a bit easier, but I think the difficulty balance is good as is. Instead of moving in the direction your ship is pointing in, you can now move freely around the screen no matter where you are aiming. The controls just feel way more useful and natural. I wish there were some difficulty options, but it isn't a big weakness of the game. The game's music is good, while the graphics are nice as well. The gameplay itself is great as you can fight via ground and air mechanics. Knowing when to shield, shoot, move, and how to play is essential to success. The options menu has some nice choices too, and the game at its core feels solid.\n\nBattleStorm is great, but doesn't feel completely polished. There are numerous bugs in the game and the menus/formatting lack professional flavor. However, those criticisms don't detract from the actual gameplay, which is good. The game isn't long at all, as it has 25 levels to play which are all autoscrollers. The game has a ton of re-playability though, which is its biggest strength. If I had to choose things I wanted to see in the game, they would be multiplayer, difficulty options, and perhaps more modes of play. If you are into competition and getting high scores, this game is for you. If you aren't a fan of the shoot-em-up genre, you probably won't find this game too interesting. Regardless, I can see many arcade gamers liking this game.\n\nTo sum it all up, BattleStorm is definitely worth its pricetag. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it given that it is this development studio's first game. The game has potential to be played for a long time given that the scoring system is detailed enough, and the developers did a great job for their first project. Props to them for getting an update out within days of understanding what needed to be done; that is the mark of good customer service. I am eager to see their next project! I wholeheartedly recommend BattleStorm. ^_^","April 1","true","8.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

As you play through each mission, you will find random power-ups that will improve your vehicle such as a permanent upgrade to your weapons, or a temporary but massively powerful weapon. As per the standard for this genre, each mission ends with a constantly improving boss which will need to be bested in order to proceed.\n\nThe game plays as a standard shooter except for its addition of a shield that will be needed to pass some of the more extreme parts, and the need to bomb ground targets for both a score improvement and additional power-ups. Battlestorm does suffer from the lack of any story at all, just five stages covering five worlds for a total of 25 missions.\n\nThe original controls for the game were quite difficult to use as you could only move forward and backward from the direction you were facing. However, the developers heard thier community and actually changed this function to the standard, which largely improved the games functionality.\n\nGraphically, the game is really pleasing. All the way from the foliage to the explosions and gun fire. Some of the effects really surprised me! As an example, when you drop your ships Nuke (The ultimate weapon you may only use once per mission), after the blinding white flash, all of the foliage or any other objects that could be seen have been removed leaving only the scarred flattened earth below.\n\nThe difficulty of the game scales at a standard pace and starts easily enough for new players to the genre and ramps up enough to challange veterans. One of the important things to note is that the difficulty of even the easier missions can change drastically if you have issues finding power-ups. This means that you could end up fighting the boss with little to no upgrades due to thier random nature.\n\nThe leaderboard and fast paced score system forces you to constantly be moving and lining up those perfect shots as well as picking up power-ups to increase your score multiplier. You can play the game through casually without penalty, but you will catch yourself hunting for those score multipliers as the game does make them easy to find, but with substantial risk to grab.\n\nOverall, I found this game to be an enjoyable experience. Even with the lack of a story, and the occasional infurating lack of power-ups, there is something strangely satisfying about anihalating an entire squadron with a bean of lightning! At the games current price tag of $5, I would deffinately recomend it for the casual gamer or the hardcore gamer looking to make it to the top of the score board.","April 11","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/recommended/432280/","pxabstraction","Parallax Abstraction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/","985 products in account","I also covered this game on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOQ0ezUyoLg\n\nDisclosure: I was provided a review code for this by the developers.\n\nThis game claims to be inspired by 90s classics and while I would agree with that, to me it feels more influenced by 90s PC shmup classics. This plays at a slower, far less manic pace that many Japanese arcade and console shmups and much more like something such as Raptor: Call of Shadows. If you're not into that pace, then you absolutely won't like that. If you are however, this is a good score attack shmup with a number of different levels and some unique mechanics.\n\nUnlike most shmups where you only control the position of your ship on screen and shoot straight forward, BattleStorm also allows you to control your rotation, giving you two axis on which to aim. It's vital to take advantage of this to deal with some of the larger enemy formations later in the game. You can also drop air-to-ground bombs on surface level targets, some of which will shoot at you, others of which are just structures which add to score.\n\nBeyond simply completing the level, you have a score multiplier that you'll want to maintain through as much of the level as possible as each has an independent online leaderboard that your score will upload to upon either finishing the level or dying. During play, you'll encounter a number of different powerups at random including additional weapons, upgrades for your existing ones, multiplier and score bonuses and health recharges. The randomness of these drops can throw off the balance of the leaderboards at times but given how each level only takes a couple of minutes to finish, repeated runs can be done quickly and the balance of the drops tends to even out in general I find.\n\nThe enemy and particularly, the boss variety are lacking somewhat. Some of the enemy designs are interesting but repeat frequently and the bosses all feel like variations of the same model, where they just put guns on in a different modular order. In addition, despite being playable in widescreen resolutions, there are always black bars on the side of the play area, as if a 4:3 ratio is being forced on you for no apparent reason.\n\nDespite these flaws, I still finished all the levels in BattleStorm and have played through others multiple times to improve my score. It's simple but great fun in short busts. If it was more than $5, I'd say it might not be the best value but for it's asking price, I think it's a fine shmup for those who can appreciate slower pace ones.","April 3","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
