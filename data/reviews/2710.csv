The single player playthrough is fun and gives you quite a few headshakes even for a old school RTS players like myself, every unit has it´s strenght and weakness which is amazing and makes it impossible to just take a huge bunch of tanks and win the game, every unit has a counter and even footmen the most basic unit in every RTS is in fact valuable in end game.\n\nThe story itself isnt much to talk about, it does the job and drives the game forward in a good speed and in a way that makes you want to continue, it is made with on old Red Alert/C&C formular with greenscreen recordings and real action videos, this gives you a more insightfull way to follow your missions and why you need to do what the mission states, it is overall a better story than most RTS`s i´ve played and it really keeps you stuck in many ways.\n\nGameplay wise Act of War has everything you could wish for in a RTS and more. That it starts with the entire lineup from any classic RTS, footsoldiers, light tanks, tanks, special units and ofc super weapons. Now that is all like any other and that is what we enjoy, but hold on, there is a lot more, like capturing prisoners of war for money, counter super weapons, off screen airplane control, usage of heli´s to save your wounded soldiers and tanks across the battle field and much much more.\n\nAll in all Act of War is a great RTS that has been overlooked by many as it came out while there was other more famous RTS`s on the market which is a shame as it is diffenetly worth buying and worth playing.","July 21, 2015","true","0.1"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","39","44","3","0"

This game does not use hit points for its units, but uses real world scenerios. For example, a tank will withstand rifle fire all day. But one shot with a helfire missile and it is destroyed. Most RTS would have the missile do 10 out of 15 damage but instead the missile will do its job. That is the basics. The campaign is great and skirmeshes are endless. The only problem is it is a pain to get to work on new computers. Which is a shame because it uses all real world models on all the units, and it still looks pretty good.","June 16, 2014","true","16.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

This game was built before its time so the graphics are not the prettiest but still good enough to get a closes comparison to C&C Generals, and with the destructive environment you will almost think its Battlefield 4. All factions are balanced with there own pros an cons Vs. the other factions so there is no top advantage of taking 1 faction over the other, but on that note I do recommend taking the group you can handle better than the others, but try the others if you don't like them then learn what they can do.\n\nNow the best part about this game is it's now available for Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1 and giving the time it was created this game should run fine enough on low end PCs.\n\n7.5/10 $10.99 CAN was hoping for $5 but still worth it.","May 29, 2015","true","70.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It was fun to play and they had some interesting weapons. For example there was a tank that can send out an exploding drone. I like the resource system being a simple system of oil or money. I also liked the different aircraft. Some where tactical while some where strategic. The also did a good job of using stealth for reccon. I often don't play RTS games because I am a TBS fan and RTS games are sometimes to quick for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/2710/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","Act of War: Direct Action is a military strategy game developed by Eugen Systems. Eugen Systems are the developer of games such as the Wargame series and R.U.S.E. The game is set in an unknown period though seems to be set around the 1990s-early 2000s. A global energy crisis occurs and the uprise of terrorist organisations allow them to use the crisis to their advantage to gain publicity. However, suspense is great as to revealing whether a president of an existing major oil company was in charge of the crisis and the uproar of terrorist attacks. You, the player take control of Task Force Talon to fight back the terrorist threat that is secretly hitting many American nations including San Francisco, Washington D.C. among other worldwide nation states.\n\nThe game sounds great on paper but the question of does it live up to that expectation is present. And yes, I can simply say that this game immerses the player into the story through the games mix of in-game cut scenes and a real-life movie. Instead of in-game cut scenes during each mission there will be a live movie playing that continues the story through actors. I really like this approach to the cut scenes because this game was released in 2005 and in-game cutscenes would have been dull at best. Therefore by placing actors to enhance and further the story it allows for more elements and reach in the story compared to in-game cinematics.\n\nAccording to the game mission selection feature there are 33 missions. These missions are crafted with profound engagement and are relatively simple. The main missions are solid. They progress the story, are intense, and they are entertaining. As the game progresses the missions and story improves in quality. Missions would include taking a stronghold and/or defending your base or secondary missions of destroying field generators to assist in your main mission. The use of secondary missions are substantial as just mentioned as if you complete them they provide benefits. For example, destroying enemy field generators help in limiting the enemy weapons. Or capturing a bank would provide more money for your base to build troops, among others. I completed the game in about 13.5 hours on normal difficulty. Each mission had an appropriate length of completion whilst varying in difficulty.\n\nThe gameplay is your typical gameplay for a strategy birds-eye view game. You control multiple units and move them along the battlefield while completing your objectives. It is good at best at times, however the pathfinding can be ridiculous. For one having many vehicular units is annoying because they get caught over little objects like civilian vehicles. Moving the units is annoying as there are no options for formations to move your best units at the front followed by your weaker/more useless units. So other than those two complaints gameplay was good.\n\nThe graphics are pretty solid for a 2005 game. They flourish in showcasing the buildings, locations, and capturing the various locations. The sound is pretty annoying including the main menu theme. I liked the dialogue in the game quite a bit. The dialogue is short, sweet, engaging and intense, which improved the quality of the story.\n\nTowards the technical aspect things are not so great. There is no full screen option in the game. The game is capped at 1280x720. However, the limited resolution is understandable for an 11 year old game and there is a mod to allow for higher resolutions. You cannot access steam overlay, which is a real nuisance. Basically if you want to talk on steam or do anything else on your computer while you play you have to quit the game as minimising will not work. It is a major nuisance as specified but if you are playing for multiple hours at a time it does not overly bother you. And there are framerate hitches when moving along the map or selecting other parts of the map.\n\nLastly the game was recently updated to allow for Windows 10. Fair to say it works like a breeze.\n\nOverall, Act of War: Direct Action is a very unfamiliar game amongst people on Steam judging by its 80 reviews. But for $2.99, I totally recommend this game. You will get a lot of value out of the game with multiple game modes but you will enjoy the story and the gameplay aspect of the game. The rating is low due to its technical issues but I can't penalise it overly due to its age. In saying that, the positives are strong. 6.75/10.\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

From dropping onto roofs and breaching a garrisoned building or setting up an ambush to take down a group of enemy vehicles they can do most anything.\n\nInfantry can also take cover (There is a cover system) behind most structures and objects including base buildings you have built or your enemy has built.\n\nJust a quickie but if you played and liked Command and Conquer Generals you might like this though Act of War can actually be a little harder to learn in some cases.\n\nMy biggest beef with this game however is that it takes some tweaking to finally get it to run on Windows 7 and 8. It can be tricky and in some cases simply refuses to want to work. Be patient and vigilant and I garuntee you can get this game to run.","November 12, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Small pain to get  working on a system with more than 2 GB of memory (easy to fix, just a process), but the game is totally worth it. Units markedly improve as they gain experience, the primary form of currency is POW's (capture prisoners on the field, make money), and I like the emphasis on infantry/ground vehicle/tank combat. It does have aircraft but they're not a unit you directly control. If you're a fan of RTS games, check this out!","December 27, 2011","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the game does have AI Skirmish with a nice selection of maps.\n\nAct of War is true classic, and I was always disappointed it never worked on modern machines. I am now delighted that it can be played once again. This game had stellar presentation for back in 2005.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnNavarro/recommended/2710/","JohnNavarro","Navarro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnNavarro/","55 products in account","Act of War is one of the finest Real-Time-Strategy games in gaming history. Its graphics are superb even by modern standards, and the realistic US Army faction makes Act of War what many gamers wished CnC:Generals had been. The game plays very similarly to Generals, but lacks any generals themselves to add flavor to the skirmishes. The units don't have anything witty or neccessarily interesting to say; they instead respond in ways that you'd expect their real-life counterparts to respond. If you're a fan of RTS but want to play in a world which looks and sounds authentic as opposed to the sci-fi or cartoon representation of other RTS games, then AoW is exactly what you're after.\n\nDespite its age, it works on modern machines, including Windows 10 and even NVIDIA mobile series graphics cards, which are notorious for their legacy incompatibility. If you're like me and more interested in playing skirmishes than the campaign, then Act of War: Direct Action is uneccesary because Act of War: High Treason is a standalone expansion pack which includes the full game. The only thing that DA has which HT doesn't is the DA campaign.\n\nAoW is an amazing game, quite possibly the best RTS yet. It's a steal at three bucks. Buy it, play it, love it.","May 9","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
