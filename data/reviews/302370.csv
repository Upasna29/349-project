A "fix" on the discussion boards loads adware "vopackage.exe". Beware!\n\nLater addition: Now the sound works, i followed a thread in the discussion board and installed some codecs. But this installed adware on my system, ... I hope, that the publisher will fix this problem.

An additional codec is required for sound during movies, and an incredibly convoluted solution involving two third-party programs is required to actually be able to hear the music. None of these are integrated into the Steam installer, and the onus is on you to figure out how to get the game to run properly. This is not acceptable. It is Night Dive's responsibility to do that, not the consumer's. I suspect the only reason that the other Night Dive releases I played were free of major issues was because they were running in DOSBox and ScummVM (respectively), emulators licensed from competent programmers.\n\nPlease do not publish half-functional ports on Steam. Fix it or remove it from the store. If I wanted to struggle to get the game to run, I'd buy an original retail copy.","January 24","false","4.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

Give it a try.  IMPORTANT: install http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow/ or you probably won't get audio.\n\nIn short, it's low-tech, a bit glitchy (quitting and restarting the game fixed a few dead-ended puzzles for me) and it inherits the lousy controls of its predecessors BUT the warm humour and story really shine through and more than make up for its age, linearity and shortcomings - you can see why this series has a cult following.\n\nTex is a great character - one of many - and in addition to the humour and cheese this is ALSO a genuinely interesting sci-fi mystery/detective story.\n\nEnds on a big cliff-hanger, fortunately (finally) rectified by the excellent 2014 Tex game 'Tesla Effect'!","April 1, 2015","true","17.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I wanted to collect all the games immediately but I can't reccomend the purchase of this game.\n\nI can't comment on the content or playability of the game, because the actual download itself is broken. If you are running a current gen system, this game will not work without multiple downloads of other programs to fix bugs and crashes. The developer has released a beta which he claims fixes some of the problems, but in actuality it now makes my game crash to the desktop upon launch.\n\nDo not purchase this game.\n\nIf the Steam store had any conscience they would pull this title until a fully working copy could be created.","September 24, 2014","false","10.5"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965383380/recommended/302370/","76561197965383380","อานนท์","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965383380/","212 products in account","This is the 5th Tex Murphy and the last Tex game that was made for 15 years before the reboot Tesla Effect. It is remake of the Mean Street so if you think the first Tex is "too old" to play then you have the change to experience it with newer game mechanics. I myself enjoyed the original Mean Street so I was looking forward to see how good remake they did.\n\nIt's much like the Under the killing moon and Pandora Directive, but minor changes have been made to the gameplay here and there, question list is now dynamic showing you what you have already asked and what not. Also it does sometimes remove some questions after asking, which I find little bit annoying as sometimes you might want to listen them again, so you need to reload the game. Aside from that the GUI and mechanics are better than on the last two Tex games. Pixel hunting is much easier this time because textures are much more clear.\n\nWhen compared to other FMV-games the acting is decent, sometimes there is a little bit overacting but mostly they do fine work especially Chris Jones starring as Tex Murphy. Frank Schimming and the guy who is playing Gideons CEO all are doing very good job, so it feels like watching a good movie and If I remember correctly many of the actors have been also acting in some A-grade movies.\n\nThe puzzles are logic and need some out-of-the-box thinking, gladly there aren't any illogical game stopper like the Pandora Directive's last puzzle, but they aren't too easy so it takes some time to figure them out. The game has build-in hint system so you won't get stuck easily, but I strongly recommend to avoid using it as solving the puzzles by yourself is part of the Tex experience.\n\nThe story, which is mix of filmnoire and cyberpunk, is compelling and keeps you excited to the very ending to see where the story goes next. The ending clearly tells that they planned to make 6th Tex Murphy right after release of the Overseer, unfortunally Access ran into some financial problems and got bought by Microsoft and got canceled, but thanks to the kickstarter we finally got the Tesla Effect, the sequel to the Overseer.\n\nThere seems to have some problems to get the game working. I have tried this with Windows 7 and 10 and got it work on both. You need to install ffdshow to get the cutscenes to work and install MIDI emulator to get music to work. Just follow the guide: http://www.gog.com/forum/tex_murphy_series/got_overseer_dvdversion_working_wonderfully_with_quality_81x64_midi_outputfinally\nEven after these fixes on the Windows 10 the game might crash on some puzzles, I didn't find any fix for that other then transferring the saves to my Windows 7 machine where the game seems to be more stable and didn't crash on anything.\n\nSo aside the technical problems on modern systems the game is excellent FMV game which I can recommend to anyone who likes filmnoire and detective stories.","March 24","true","27.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizarrojesus/recommended/302370/","bizarrojesus","bizarrojesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizarrojesus/","459 products in account","I initially gave this game a poor review due to technical bugs. I encountered an error that asked me to insert a disk in order to play, obviously this wasn't possible.\n\nThis was caused by installing the game on a computer that did not have an optical drive. With the help of Night Dive, I installed a virtual drive and the game ran fine.\n\nI haven't encountered any of the other problems people have mentioned, so I can only assume that they have been fixed, or are simply isolated issues, or I just lucked out.\n\nWith all of that said, Tex Murphy is an acquired taste. Humorous, post-apocalyptic, detective, noir, FMV, et cetera. If you are thinking of buying this, you are probably already familiar with the series. If you are not familiar with the series, you might want to start with some of the earlier entries (but you should probably avoid the first game).","May 13, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
