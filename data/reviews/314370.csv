And if he released boxlife 2 I would want to pick it up.\n\nBoxlife is a short exploration game with various abilities to find on the map to help you progress to the end of the game while finding 9 secret spots. There is less than 30 minutes worth of gameplay here so keep that in mind when considering purchase. I got this in a Groupees pre-order bundle myself else I would wishlist and wait for a sale since it is both short & really has no replay value. That said, I could easily see the dev adding the option to go through the doorway into a 2nd stage or map to add more gameplay and make it more worth the full price in my eyes.","April 27","true","1.0"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/314370/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","I WAS GIVEN A FREE COPY OF THIS GAME FROM THE DEVELOPER\n\nIf you’d prefer a video review, have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMFoEQxXGBY\n\nThis is an odd one for me. Nothing about the screenshots or trailers for Boxlife interested me, but the description: “Gain abilities, find secrets and escape from the box.” peaked my interest.\n\nI’m going to be blunt; I don’t think this is a good game. I don’t take pleasure in giving negative reviews, and I even asked my followers on Twitter if it would be worth posting an almost entirely negative review. The conclusion I came to is that it would, because it’s my responsibility as a reviewer to lay the truth bare regardless of how I think I’m going to make the developer feel if they see it.So, here’s the truth laid bare.\n\n\nPresentationBoxlife is not a pretty game, especially since I’ve seen some really awesome stuff come from the Unity engine, that this game was made in. The colours don’t go well together, and there really isn’t any art. It’s all made up of shapes, and rectangles which there is nothing inherently wrong with, but it doesn’t really feel self-aware. I don’t get the impression that this was the planned look for the game, or that any real thought was put into the design. And the cheap atmosphere is made worse by the really awful sound effects in which you can hear the background noise for -- since there’s no music in the game to mask it.\n\nMechanicsThe idea behind the mechanics is an old one, but not necessarily bad. You’re basically given free reign to explore wherever you want, and you're given no instructions other than the controls. What you find is that your character keeps finding new abilities that allow him/her to explore more and, in turn, acquire even more abilities. These range from jumping, to double jumping, to… being able to walk through certain blocks.. It’s not anything special, but I felt a twinge of satisfaction when I found a new ability that allowed me to progress further, but that’s no different to, say, any Zelda game.\n\nVerdictThe real deal breaker here is that the game is only 15 minutes long. Or, at least, that’s how long it took me to complete it. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with that, because a 15 minute story, if told well, can be extremely compelling. For $3, a really good 15 minutes of story would totally be worth it my opinion. But you might have noticed that I didn’t include a story section in this review like I normally do. There is no story and, because of that, I think this game is nothing short of a rip off. There’s no one I could recommend this game to, unfortunately.","January 14","false","0.3"," 46 of 75 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","46","75","5","4"

I have played the game after the patch was released and it heavily improves how empty the game feels, which I state in my review. Please take this into consideration in regards to reading my review.\n\nI saw this game on the 'Upcoming' section on the Steam Store and I was intrigued. Mainly by the description and the simplicity of it. I bought it when it came out (today) and when I finished it, I found that I enjoyed it, but it felt quite lacking.\n\nWe'll start with the flaws. You can tell that there is not a lot to the game from the trailer, but at times I found myself thinking that it was quite bland. I do wish that there was a story to go along with 'the box' or  why you're in there, but there is no story apparent. I'm not sure exactly what the dev was trying to do with this game because if you add more sounds (which there aren't that many) and dampen the colours, it could look quite eerie, but that's not what came across.\n\nBut as you can tell, I do recommend this game, and here's why. I have already said that I really did enjoy this and that's because of how well it is put together. The game doesn't tell you what to do exactly, but it is almost always clear what you should do or where you should go and it all manages to just flow. It succeeds in creating a rewarding feeling when you manage to find a secret or your next ability. I didn't find all of the secrets, but I will probably come back to this game,\n\nAll in all, I found boxlife to be an enjoyable and rewarding experience, albeit a little too simple. I hope that the dev comes back to this game with a few more unique features to make it feel less empty.","January 14","true","1.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The things that are sure, are that it is a First person puzzle exploration game in an obviously constructed world that serves no purpose but to make you jump through hoops and explore the area you are confined to.\n\nAs you explore the area, you encounter and pick up new abilities; however, these are pretty much standard, except for a few original ideas. Without a guide it may take you quite some time to 100% the game as there are obscure secrets you need to uncover which can mostly be done by exploring and trial and error. Doesn't seem much like a game but more like an obstacle course that you can't get injured or hurt while traverssing it.\n\nSound is pretty minimalistic and boring. You can mute it.\n\nGraphics are extremely basic... color choices sometimes make me wonder what the dev was thinking, but hey... I suppose it works.\n\nDesign needs some work... there are few things to do with each of the individual abilities except use them to get to the next ability. Extremely linear game play, and not really that interesting.\n\nPrice: for $0.99 I suppose it's not bad, but I'd prefer it in a bundle... or gifted from a friend with a spare key.\n\nOverall: 4/10 - If you find all the secrets, there really is no replay value.\n","May 9","false","0.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/314370/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","boxlife is a clear example of a game without any real reason or purpose behind it.\n\nIt has no music, it explores a similar artstyle to its predecessor (Fancy Skulls), and the gameplay is just a sequence of "go there, grab that" without a single line of dialogue or idea of any kind.\n\nGuess you could say "purity" and expect to run with it, but come on... And I don't mind games that are light on gameplay (on the contrary!), but there needs to be a purpose to it. There's nothing here.\n\nThe powerups aren't interesting at all, merely a way of getting you to a previously gated area. There's no challenge other than looking for secret cubes, if you're interested. But even those, it's just a question of looking at every object's corners...\n\nSorry, can't see anything worth while here... The visuals could have been cool, but they're not polished enough to stand on their own. Oh well.","April 27","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me about a half hour to complete, and I only found 7 of the 9 secrets.  You find perks to unlock new abilities to find more perks, to find four spheres to exit. The graphics are bare bones, but the progression of abilities is thoughtful and effective, and rewards exploration.  It's not something I recommend spending money on, but it's worth a try if you get it in a bundle somewhere.","May 13","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
