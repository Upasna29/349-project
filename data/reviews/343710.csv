I thought a game based on the Dyatlov Pass incident had tons of potential to make a great survival horror game. Unfortunately, I guess I didn't do enough research into the game before buying it.\n\nStop me when this sounds familiar: you explore a large, open environment in lighting conditions that aren't always that great, armed with only a flashlight, collecting notes, while avoiding an enemy that instantly kills you if it catches you. If at any point in that sentence you said "Ugh, it's another one of -those- games?", then Kholat is probably not for you, because that's all there is here. There's no puzzles, no resources to manage, just notes. The monster only shows up in certain areas, leaving most of it free to safely gather notes in peaceful tedium, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, because the monster is just an orange humanoid figure that you practically have to force to attack you unless you have your flashlight on, which is so weak that you're not really that much better off having it on in those areas anyways. He's more of a pebble in your sandal than a thorn in your side, so the parts where you can actually see more than five feet in front of you and don't have to worry about the game totally failing to scare you are welcome moments.\n\nAs far as the contents of the notes, you may or may not be disappointed there as well. If you were expecting to actually get any concrete explanation of what happened during the incident, you won't get one. If anything the game just adds a layer of fictional mystery onto the already real mystery, and while some people may be into that sort of storytelling, I wasn't a big fan of its presentation. The voice actors do a good job telling it, however - I was kind of disappointed that there was no Russian voice option to make things more authentic, but the English actors do a good job, and they somehow managed to rope Sean Bean into voicing the narrator.\n\nThe part of the game that I can definitely praise is the visuals. While the game seems to be pretty system-taxing based on what I've seen on the forums, if you can put up the specs to max it out the game looks fantastic, making the non-dangerous parts of the game all the more refreshing to explore.\n\nOverall, I'm just writing off Kholat as my yearly "I made a mistake in purchasing this" game, and I can't really recommend it to anyone except note-collectathon enthusiasts, a demographic which continues to baffle me with its existence. There just isn't enough substance to the game to justify its $20 price tag, or even the $13 price tag. It's very pretty, but this time it is just a pretty face.","August 23, 2015","false","5.2"," 620 of 694 people (89%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","89","620","694","20","19"

At least when it comes in the form of movies or written stories. And this might surprise some people, but I genuinely lack any positive sentiment towards horror games. The reasons for this are manifold. For one, most horror games rely heavily on jump-scares. And that’s not horror. It’s startling to see a freakish monstrosity jump out at you while your ears get assaulted by a string orchestra going through a meat grinder, yes. But it’s not scary and it’s not horror.\n\nAnother reason why horror and games don’t gel for me is that games are interactive. I have agency and I dictate the pacing of a game. I can take my time and explore every nook and cranny, or I can just jog through the level. I simply still have too much control over the game even if I’m completely helpless. And the final reason why I don’t play many horror games is because I’m just staring at a black screen most of the time. Horror games use darkness as a weak setup to hide stuff from the player in order to then build in jump-scares. Again, not horror. Horror is a feeling of underlying dread you get from being exposed to something.\n\nSo why did I voluntarily pick Kholat to write a review about? Well, first off it seemed to not engage in all of the tropes mentioned above. Your surroundings are mostly well-lit, it rarely uses jump-scares and when it does, it makes sense within the universe. And lastly, it manages to setup an eerie atmosphere from the very start. It accomplishes this with the fact that it’s an adaptation of a real event that took place in the Ural Mountains in 1959 when a group of alpinists were killed in an unexplained event called the Dyatlov Pass incident. If you want to look it up, it’s a great read and it has all the ingredients to make an absorbing adaptation out of it. Because of its unresolved nature you can spin any yarn you want out of it. And it’s an incident that hasn’t been widely covered a dozen times by other, bigger productions.\n\nThe plot of the game takes you to Kholat Syakhl, literally “Dead Mountain”, where you retrace the events in search of an explanation. Armed only with a map, a compass and a flashlight, you set out to traverse the mountains in search for newspaper articles, diary entries and other reports to uncover the mystery of the incident. And you obviously do it all by night.\n\nIf you read the above paragraph and thought to yourself “This sounds an awful lot like the Slenderman games”, you’d be in the correct ballpark. You’re running through the wilderness in search of a variety of documents. And there isn’t really much that’s chasing you throughout most of it. Where Kholat manages to really become scary is with its atmosphere. And it does so without artificially putting you in a dark environment. The mountains are brightly lit by a full moon and your flashlight – should you ever need to use it in the bright environments – has no annoying degrading battery that for some reason runs out in five minutes real time.\n\nNo, what makes Kholat scary is the fact that it manages to invoke a haunting claustrophobia. Even though ironically most of it takes place outside in the wide open mountain range. Maybe this is a particularly subjective observation on my part, but my favorite horror stories – The Shining, The Thing, At The Mountains Of Madness – all take place in remote, wintry environments, in which the location and the weather themselves are equally as eerie and threatening to the protagonists as the horror that stalks them. The feeling of isolation probably resonates with me a lot for some reason. All that makes me appreciate Kholat far more than most other horror games and it meant I could be fully immersed in its world.\n\nIt would’ve been too good to believe however if the game were an atmospheric mood piece for the player to experience without encountering hostility. During our excursions we cross paths with a bunch of specters who aren’t particularly fond of us wandering around. Encounters with them usually only last a couple of seconds, since directly engaging them leads to death. Running away is only a semi-viable option, since running in deep snow is very tiring for our character and they usually manage to catch up.\n\nBesides this, the game does have a few more drawbacks to it. First and foremost, the game contains very little actual gameplay. It’s largely a very literal example of a walking simulator. In addition to that, the game doesn’t give the player a lot of direction. This is especially a problem at the very start of the game. We begin the game at a deserted village without any indication of where we’re supposed to go. The player has to bring his own hunger for exploration in order to eventually find the correct path to the tent where the alpinists found their ends.\n\nBut even prior to that, the game puts another obstacle in our way. We find ourselves in a blinding snowstorm in which we’re supposed to find the actual camp of the victims. The whole screen is white, you can barely make out where the ground stops and the blizzard begins, though luckily after a bit of aimlessly wandering around and eventually finding the tent, the weather clears up.\n\nHowever this lack of direction turns into a strength later on in the game. When we receive the map of the mountain range, a bunch of geographic coordinates have been written onto it. Though you’ll have to figure out where they are yourself, because specific locations only get added to the map once you’ve found them. What turns this relatively simple objective into a challenge is the fact that your own position doesn’t get marked on the map. You’ll have to use the compass and the map itself to keep track of where you are, so it’s vitally important that you don’t become lost.\n\nWhat enhances the already dense atmosphere of the game is both the phenomenal soundtrack as well as the voice-acting. Sean Bean in particular manages to set the mood very effectively with his calm, soothing voice. But also the rest of the voice-acting that’s used to read the messages you find to you is very good.\n\nPeople who like jump-scare fests like Five Nights At Freddies or Outlast probably won’t find much to enjoy here. But I can definitely recommend the title to players who like subtle, introspective horror that is more concerned with building atmosphere and a feeling of dread rather than constant tension. With the caveat that Kholat is rather lacking in the gameplay department and unfortunately, the ending doesn’t provide much closure and at less than four hours – even though the developer claims it takes longer to beat – maybe it’s a bit short for what they’re asking.\n","June 9, 2015","true","5.4"," 510 of 590 people (86%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","86","510","590","32","21"

Kholat is a first person survival horror exploration game based on the real life Dyatlov Pass Incident. Unlike many other “survival horror” games, Kholat isn’t actually an action game or a crafting game with touches of horror.\n\nInstead, Kholat takes you to a beautiful, yet haunting world that heavily relies on atmosphere to create tension. Set in the Northern Ural Mountains, you are there a while after the Dyatlov Pass Incident trying to figure out what happened. With you, you have no weapons, no cell phone, basically nothing other than a flashlight, a compass, and a map that you find. On the map there is a list of 9 coordinates – major locations for you to visit and find out information about what has happened.\n\nKholat is a difficult game to score because it is one that if it resonates with you, it will be in your game of the year lists I think. However, it is a pretty niche title with the difficulty, the genre, the map navigating and other factors, as well as a relatively short average run time (unless you get lost all over the place like me). If a game that focuses on atmosphere, beautiful graphics and horror generated not through cheap tricks and jump scares interests you, I recommend Kholat wholeheartedly.\n\nFinal Score: Very Good 7/10 "Kholat is a welcome challenging and atmospheric take on the horror genre"\n\nRead the full Review[techraptor.net]","June 10, 2015","true","14.0"," 168 of 194 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","168","194","5","0"

I'll tell you.\n\nIt's a little bit like Myst. You're dropped into the game's world without even a single hint as to what you're supposed to do. But Kholat isn't a point & click game, and it isn't nearly as frustrating or easy to get stuck in.\n\nIt's a little bit like Gone Home. You'll gradually progress through the story in almost any order you like, and try to make sense of the events taking place around you. But Kholat has a more interesting and mysterious story.\n\nIt's a little bit like Amnesia. You'll have similar things chase and torment you. But Kholat has stunning visuals.\n\nIt's a little bit like Dear Esther. The story segments you come across are as ambiguous, and following visible points of light in the distance tends to be a good idea. But Kholat has actual gameplay, and you can die. You WILL die.\n\nIt's a little bit like Cryostasis. It's Russian, meaning it's freezing and it's frightening. But Kholat gives you no weaponry to defend yourself.\n\nIt's a little bit like Slender. You'll be collecting a lot of pages out of books, newspapers and diaries. But Kholat does NOT only base itself around this single gimmick.\n\nIt's also a little bit like actually hiking in real-life. You can get lost, and it can get frustrating. But Kholat gives you a map and a compass. Use them, don't be an idiot, and this potential element of frustration should be minimal.\n\nIf ANY of the above even slightly interested you, then I'd say Kholat is worth your time and money.

But alas...always eluded me.  There's some trick about it I just don't seem able to fathom.  Oh well.  Chalk it up to yet another failure in a life chock-full of 'em...\n\nWith a little luck, you don't share this same problem, and even if you do...this will still be one of the most flat-out, full-on atmospheric journeys you'll ever undertake.  Unless you actually holiday in places like the Dyatlov Pass in REAL LIFE, in which case you are a SCARY ♥♥♥♥ING PSYCHO.  Or at least a much, much bigger Man than me.  But for the rest of us cowards, this game will immerse you in a world of snap-frozen freakiness, and as an added bonus, if your sense of direction/ability with compasses is as bad as mine, you can add the frustration of getting frequently lost into an already nerve-fraying foray into the unknown.  Not since Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs have I experienced such an enjoyably "oppressive" game...but instead of the constant clanking of epic machinery and scary pig-men, we get relentless snow-storms and...well, you'll just have to see for yourself (apologies for the spoiler about the pig-men in Machine For Pigs, but you probably guessed that one already for yourself).\n\nMore plot than Slender!  More gameplay than Dear Esther!  So if you fancy a (rough) combination of those two, Kholat may well be one of the best purchases you will ever make in the magical land of Steam.  Put on some headphones, turn off the lights, leave a window open if it's Winter (to simulate the freezing conditions; c'mon, you know the pneumonia's worth it)...and prepare for one of the most chilling (pun intended) games you'll ever play.  All this, and voice acting by Sean Bean!  What the ♥♥♥♥ are you waiting for?  Hell to freeze over?!  Be a MAN, dammit!!

(Actually, come to think of it...I'm not really sure what purpose the hair on them presently serves, but...that's a philosophical discussion for another time, perhaps.)  C'MON, BUY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME ALREADY!!!\n\nVerdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If the devs had just put a measly, teeny-tiny DOT on the map to show me where I was at any given time, I would'a given this a 9.5.

Although if you are a very casual walking simulator player, you will probably get lost, as the environment is big and the map is realistic, but little help in navigating.  I wish developers like this could give their environment to some puzzle and creature designers and come up with a real game.

The game makes heavy usage of the typical, slow, and unsuspecting explorer, and bases its gameplay on it. It's not a game where you're constantly running away from jump scares like in games such as outlast. If you're looking for jumpscares, this isnt the game for you. It's a more psychological approach to horror. The horror and fear aspect comes from the immersive world Kholat puts you in. The sound of the wind howling, the sound of an old mountain creaking, and the wolf howls in the distance all work together to create a very atmospheric and eerie/dark environment for you to explore. It's very slow paced for the most part, although there are a few faster segments towards the end of the game. The game also explicitly tells you to pay attention to your surroundings, and I didn't truly understand what they meant until I saw massive skulls formed from the rocks, staring right at me as I slowly made my way through a pass.\n\nPros:\n-Incredible detail to the environment\n-Eerie sounds make the game even more immersive\n-Level of helplesness not as high as say outlast\n-Psychological and introspective\n-No campaign order (you can travel to any point of interest in any order) Noce for the free roam aspect.\n-Relatively smooth (Running an i7-4790k, GTX970) Max graphics (looks incredible) @ 1080p\n->Average 55-60 fps w/ v-sync on. Occasional frame-rate drop to 40 (not sure why? Rendering environments-shifting from cave to snowstorm maybe? idk)\n\n-VOICED BY SEAN BEAN! How badass is that?\n\nCons:\n-Nothing to do after you finish the game\n-Lacks replay value (wouldn't play this game multiple times as it's essentially the same exact story)\n-relatively short game. about 10 hours tops. Sure you can make it last as long as you want if you just wander the paths over and over again.\n-Feels like the story is unfinished. The game mentions a lot of really interesting conspiracy theory-esque conversations that don't really give closure to the story (that may just be because of the actual story/inciedent game is based off of.)\n\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game if you like immersive horror, don't buy it if you want an outlast-esque game.\n\nI definitely reccomend this game if your rig can handle it, and if you're looking for a slower paced immersive game to lose yourself in.","December 30, 2015","true","9.6"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","46","54","2","0"

You will love it or hate it. Kholat is a slow burning eastern European style walking game, in which you try to unravel a strange mystery. It is not an American style horror experience with violence, blood and screeching mutant monstrosities. It is all about atmosphere, tension, ambiguity and story with a good mix of eastern European mysticism and surrealism.\n\nI would advise going into the game blind. Dont read some of the longer more detailed reviews, dont watch on you tube, and dont do too much homework on the game. Doing so will spoil the biggest driving factor behind the game: mystery, the unknown and unexpected. This seems like the kind of game that you will know you will like or not.\n\nThe game is short, and does not outstay its welcome (unlike some other games of this sort). It has excellent sound design and wonderfully fitting musical track, and very well done voice overs.\n\nMy biggest complaint is performance. While my machine does not meet all the recommended specs, I had very low FPS even running with low resolution and low settings. I would have expected to at least run at medium settings with good FPS. Unless there are some performance patches in the future, I might advise avoiding the game if you dont meet the recommended settings, and dont even bother if you only meet the minimum settings. Additionally the FPS difference between running on high and low was fairly small for me, with high being around the 10s, while low in the 20s. (however it must be noted that even low setting still look quite good, though I would love to experience this game again at 60fps and the highest settings)\n\nDespite the poor performance I loved the game, and will probably play it again in 6 or so months.

Review Copy Provided By Developer !!\n\n(Video review linked at the bottom)\n\nThe horror genre is slowly becoming a mess, games that focus on cheap jump scares are flooding Steam and other services while very few games that are actually “scary” hit the market. Kholat steps away from the “jump scare” subgenre and shows us that there is still some hope for the horror game genre.\n\nKholat, based on the actual event of the Dyatlov Pass Incident, is a fantastic horror game that shows the industry how a horror game is done right. To give a little bit of backstory, the Dyatlov Pass Incident is an event that happened in January to late February in 1959 when 10 Russian students went on a hike in the Ural Mountains on the eastern side of Kholat Syakhl. After one of the students went back due to illness the others pushed forward and were never heard from again. So a group went to explore in hopes to find their whereabouts. The remaining 9 students were all found dead from various, and still unexplained reasons.\n\nBased off these real-life events the story of Kholat is one of the best stories I’ve heard told in the horror game genre. Narrated by the famous Sean Bean, the games writing, narration, and story are all fantastic. The narration I will say is good, but not the best, solely for immersion purposes. Most of the voice actors seem to have british accents, which works well for Sean Bean but not the others. The diary entries are narrated by a british actor, playing a Russian student. I would have liked to see these entries narrated by a Russian voice actor, but this is just me being nitpicky. I wouldn’t consider this a con, just thought I’d mention it. The sound in this game is excellent, the sound effects and music fit the game perfectly and create very tense feeling situations. One thing I loved was oddly the sound effects of walking in the snow. As a Canadian I can say the developers nailed those sound effects right on the head. The atmosphere in this game is amazing, wandering in harsh mountains has never been so enjoyable. The mountains and caves are all beautifully designed, the various places of interest all feel distinct and unique in their own way. (Mild spoilers here) From burnt and hell-like looking forests to sacrificial altars and abandoned bunkers, these places all hold story significance while providing the tense atmosphere that makes this game true horror.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and only requires your inner explorer. You start off in an abandoned Russian town with no markers, no arrows, no nothing. Just your willingness to explore. You will eventually find your way around where the real game begins. You go to a whole new area, deep in the Ural Mountains where you must just simply explore with your handy map, compass, and flashlight. Keep in mind, this area is completely non-linear and open. The map has coordinates of all the places of interest but I found all of these places without any real navigation involved. The flashlight I found to be extremely useless as most areas are lit by the full moon in the sky. I guess if you were playing the game at a low brightness to add to the experience the flashlight would be a very nice touch. The game itself is around 4-6 hours in length and is filled with many little notes and diary entries to collect if you feel like getting more backstory.\n\nLastly, the performance of this game is quite good, I will say though having to play through the entire game in 30fps was quite annoying. I feel as though my processor was bottlenecking my graphics card in this game, I could play the game on medium-high and maintain a solid 30fps. This game does require a decent rig. The game is powered on Unreal Engine 4 and it looks amazing. I could easily see this game being used for benchmarking purposes.\n\nIn most horror games the “horror” is caused by cheap jump scares that startle, not scare. Kholat on the other hand uses it’s interesting backstory, immersion, beautiful yet creepy atmosphere, and fantastic sound to be possibly this years best horror title.\n\n\n\nhttp://youtu.be/x81CnFoJhuo","June 22, 2015","true","3.8"," 52 of 71 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","52","71","2","0"

Basically, the map only gives you the direction and where you are if you just luckily picked a note to mark your current position on the map. However, it doesn't mean you get lost all the time. I actually accidentally run into places I need to investigate most of time without map.Following right direction or keep moving on the path that you've never reached before would actually lead you to the new place. Most of all, some paths are not marked on map, meaning you have to explore by yourself.\nI really love the graphic and sound effect of this game. Though, one thing is that it requires a really long long walk among different incident places in order to progress. Afterall, I would say I did have a good time while feeling frustrated playing this game. You might want to give it a try. But, when you find yourself getting lost in the snow, get yourself out of it as fast as you can, because there is something wrong among those mountains and curiosity would not save you at the last moment.","November 27, 2015","true","5.1"," 37 of 50 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","37","50","4","3"

The atmosphere of the game is very creepy and really makes you feel alone, and a bit on edge. It's not your average first person horror game. I wouldn't call the scares "jump scares". The whole game itself makes you feel very tense and a bit paranoid. I really enjoyed how the game makes you actually feel like you are lost as well. I think it adds confusion to the situation. You're thrown into the mountains with just a compass and a map(which doesn't show your location), You must explore and navigate through the landscape and caves to find landmarks that will give you a better sense of direction. You collect notes in different areas of the map giving info about the Dyatlov Pass Incident and revealing more of the story. The game also looks very beautiful, It runs on the UE4 engine and if you have a decent PC, there are some remarkable landscapes and views to see in the game. The falling snow and visual wind gusts give the game a very realistic feel. If you're into extreme exploration games, then I highly recommend picking this up.","June 10, 2015","true","2.0"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","30","38","2","0"

To do so, you only have a map, a compass, and a bunch of coordinates. The realistic approach to exploration means you don't get to see where you are on the map as in most games.\n\nThe Slender-type mechanic is more or less scripted it seems, so you won't be bothered that much except when reaching a newly discovered area, and the threats can be avoided by simply running away, which worked for us most of the time. There are a few instances when you'll die when taken by surprise, but not that much in the 5 to 6 hours you'll need to complete the game.\n\nIt's not a game for everyone, but it's a game that deserves your attention in our opinion.\n\nFor more thoughts on the game, you can watch our livestream here:\n\nhttp://www.gamersyde.com/hqstream_kholat_replay_en-34801_en.html\n\nFor uncompressed 1080p/60fps videos, head over to this address:\n\nhttp://www.gamersyde.com/news_our_videos_of_kholat-16595_en.html","June 10, 2015","true","7.4"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","31","43","0","0"

It feels like its only purpose is to confuse you, which might be a stupid thing to say but then again, I'm stupid with maps and navigation.\n\nThe optimization of the game is crap to say the least, I can run the game at 45 fps with an i7 and gtx 760 while there are certain parts where the fps drops down to even 15.\n\nOverall experience has been positive due to the atmosphere and the curiosity to find out what actually happened (according to the devs at least).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/j_dee463/recommended/343710/","j_dee463","J_dee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/j_dee463/","49 products in account","I am a huge fan of Russian Science Fiction and Horror, usually in books and movies, but also in video games like Metro 2033 and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. So I felt it was my duty to play this game as well, and even if I'm not through yet, I can absolutely recommend it.\n\nLet me state first: This is NOT an Action game! Your only weapon is naaaah, not your flashlight! Put it away 'til you reach a dark cave. It's your stamina, but it's precious and very limited so don't use all at once*! This game bears Exploration game in its description for a reason, it's slow-paced, you're supposed to keep one eye on the compass, and one eye plus both ears on your enviroment - which is fairly beautiful but devastating - otherwise you're gonna overlook something important and/or die. If you're looking for a fast-paced action horror game you can finish as quickly as possible, shooting/beating down all enemies in your way (I've seen reviews comparing Kholat to Silent Hill and stuff...), then please look on, you won't have fun with this one. ;)\n\nThe controls are very close to reality. Imagine just for a second you're going on an expedition to the Ural with like -50°C at night - do you go there in shorts and t-shirt with flip-flops on your feet? Really? You're serious? xD Nah, you're not. I'm sure you don't...\nSo you're wearing heavy winter clothes, maybe even multiple layers, agree? And that's exactly what the controls feel like: You cannot move as quickly as you want to 'cause you're simply wrapped and packed in clothes to avoid hypothermia, there's fresh-fallen snow all over and maybe even ice underneath making it fairly hard to walk fast.\n\n- Is there much to do in this game?\n-- No, not really. It's mostly walking, observing your enviroment, sometimes running, finding (reading/hearing) records or hidden paths... And yeah, you might die a few times. That's pretty much all you can do (you might call it a walking simulator with a death feature xD) since it focusses on its story, and it is doing very well telling it in small bites. The biggest challenge is navigation with a compass and map, because that`s all you have beside your flashlight. Regardless of the map and compass you're probably going to get lost a few times. Even with fast travelling between the camp sites you're gonna walk alot, in fact most of the time! You can also try to sprint constantly, but if you're forced to run then, you won't be able to anymore...\n\n- What about the story...\n-- I'm not at it's end yet, but it definitly got me hooked after the first hour and I cannot resist playing, I must know how it ends, and how it began! You start hopping off a train in a small, quiet Russian village to find details about the Dyatlov pass incident. It's a beautiful place, so I definitly recommend taking a look around - you're not yet in a hurry. Then you head to the forest. The next moment you find yourself in the middle of a snow storm close to the Dyatlov group's camp on Kholat... The storm is over, you start your investigation. Hard to describe without spoiling too much, so I'll keep it this short ;)\n\n- ... and the atmosphere?\n-- It's perfect. A perfect Russian psy-horror theme. If you allow to immerse yourself in the game, the snow and wind will make you freeze. The English voice actors have done an amazing job here, they bring the story to life (I'll check the Polish voices in the next run!). You can feel the desperation in this place, that something evil has happened, and someone or something is lurking in the dark, waiting for you to make only one false step. But most of all you feel lost in the middle of nowhere.\n\n- Is this a Horror game after all?\n-- In my opinion it is. Don't confuse Horror with Splatter, please! There are only very few jumpscares though. Therefore the "anomaly" poses a subtle and steady threat since you can easily overlook it, especially in shady places. And if it get's you, you die in an instant. So if you notice it, and it notices you: Run, run for your life and hope you don't get lost.\n\n- Other reviews mentioned bad performance?\n-- Yes, that's particularly true and unfortunatly I cannot deny it. The game is absolutely beautiful with fascinating graphics of realistic landscapes, but as the game progresses the framerate continues to drop on my machine. It started with 30 - 35FPS during the first one or two hours, then went down to 25 - 30 and by now it's around 20 - 25, sometimes (and only for a short moment, when turning around too quickly) dropping to 10 - 15. It's not as bad as it reads! To be fair: The game detected my machine could run it with ultra high graphics (AMD Phenom II X4 960T, nVidia Geforce GTX 660, 4x4GB RAM ganged @ CL 7-7-7-11) and I did not lower them since. If you're playing it on anything else but a low-end machine, then the performance issue should not bother you too much.\n\nThere's just one thing which is really annyoing me, and I feel like I must mention it, so maybe the devs read it, too: You can jump down slopes, twenty meters high, hopping from one snowy! rock to an iced! one to the next, and don't even stumble, but you're unable to climb a 50cm edge... C'mon, you must be kidding! Due to this the game doesn't feel as much open-worlded as it should ;) Whatsoever, I'm looking forward to the devs' next exploration horror project.\n\n\n* see the Kholat Community Guides here on Steam for details ;)","May 5","true","12.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

What makes it stand out above other games in this genre is its unique setting of being in a remote part of Russia, drawing lore from the real-life Dyotlov Pass incident of 1959. The story of Dyotlov is fascinating in its own right, but it's interesting to see a game using it as inspiration to tell its own story.\n\nThe remote, desolation of the game alone provides a pretty thick atmosphere, and unlike some "walking simulators" where you're on rails the whole way, KHOLAT gives you the freedom to explore each major point of interest at your own pace. Learning how to read a map and use a compass are important to navigating the tough terrain, and despite being given a set of scribbled-on coordinates that you need to visit to progress the game's story, you'll find many points of interest that are optional along the way that provide further clues as to what may have really transpired there in 1959.\n\nThe horror aspect is mostly provided by atmosphere, but there are creatures that pose a threat to you along the way. Really, though, there's only one enemy type, and once you learn how to detect and avoid it, outside of a couple difficult areas you're mostly in the clear.\n\nThe game tells a unique story about what may or may not have happened in this strange region all those years ago, but it certainly isn't direct about who you are and why you are visiting this place. Or, even, who Sean Bean is as the narrator.\n\nIn any case, it's a fun adventure and certainly worth picking up if you like exploration titles with a horror theme, so on a scale of 0 to 10, where 5 is an "average" score, this game gets a rating of:\n\n=========================\nGOOD...... 7.5 / 10\n=========================","May 10","true","7.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The exception is a forest with burnt tree stumps.\n\nYour equipment:\n\n-You have a torch but there is absolutely no motivation to use it because your stuck in a wintry white wonderland, and it doesn't help during the blizzards.\n\n-A compass which is side-on and doesn't prove useful because:\n\n-The map isn't accurate to the trails and doesn't show the proper direction and shape of the paths always.

If anything it just stretches out a game which would otherwise be completed in less than an hour.\n\nThe horror: Encounters are predictable. It is extremely easy to avoid any confrontation throughout the game, except at a few scripted events which you *almost* can't avoid. There is only one type of enemy. A semi-transparent orange ghost who has the eyesight of a mole. You pretty much have to run towards him within 5m and shine your torch in his face to get his attention...at which point you get an achievement for doing so.\n\nYou see him coming (walking with the speed of a tortoise) from far away, giving you plenty of opportunity to open up a can of sardines, make a sandwich, eat the sandwich, then come back to your computer and hit the w key to slowly walk away from the impending doom...\n\nGameplay/Story progression: The game consists of picking a direction, making your way to a landmark, picking up notes along the way, then repeat. There are only a handful of unique areas scattered across the map and there is nothing else to see or do there except pick up the next piece of paper to complete your diary of...notes.\n\nThere are alot of notes to collect around the place, but they all pretty much say the same thing:\n\n"Today the weather was cold.

Bring me more test subjects so we can create a supernatural psychic being which will probably turn around and kill us when we're done. I'll write about it while it's happening too. Where's my cup of coffee?"\n\nThe ending (Spoiler...sort of): There is no ending. It's abrupt, unsatisfying, absolutely nothing scary chases you and nothing really happens. No shocking revelation, no real conclusion. You just find the tent from the incident. Screen fades to black. It leaves a disappointing taste in your mouth. It's not the good 'I want to play more' disappointment.

Between the music, the scenery, feeling truly lost, and constantly feeling watched wherever you go, this game is immersive and atmospheric in the absolute best way. This game is horror done right. While there was only one time that nearly gave me a heart attack, every moment of gameplay was tense and uneasy.\n\nThroughout the first hour or so, I honestly had no idea how to navigate. I had no idea where to start or what to look for. But slowly, the game allowed me to learn naturally instead of forcing a tutorial down my throat. Needless to say, by the end of my time on Kholat Syakhl I was an expert navigator. The sense of accomplishment from that alone was extremely satisfying.\n\nIn terms of graphical fidelity, this game is very impressive. The textures especially were simply gorgeous. They all look like you could reach out and just feel the bumpiness of the rocks or the grit of the dirt. The mountains give you beautiful snowy forest vistas, while the caves are cold and damp, literally dripping with ambiance.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite good, although it's not necessarily one I'd listen to outside of actual gameplay. A couple tracks are sweeping and nice to listen to, but by and large the soundtrack is full of gripping drums and blaring low horns. It does a great job of keeping you always looking over your shoulder. There are some vocal tracks, and they are used appropriately. One at the beginning, one towards the end that fits well with a note you find just before you get a story beat, and one in the credits that, in my opinion, was maybe the weakest of the vocal tracks.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful graphics\nSimple controls that do only what you need\nRewarding navigation difficulty curve (maybe a negative for you - YMMV)\nInteresting story that ends in such a way to keep you guessing and speculating\nPretty good soundtrack\nTop notch voice acting\nA lot of content and scenery to discover\n\nCons:\nI might've liked a few more graphical options\nStamina mechanic (though this is just a personal dislike in games, and a minor gripe at worst)\nIf you're a seasoned horror vet as I am, you won't be scared out of your mind constantly. Look elsewhere if you want that\nNo manual saving\n\nAll in all, this game is an 8/10 from me. Or a must buy. Whatever scoring appeals to you, it's worth a buy, even at full price.

It has bugs, a lot of them. Maybe you'll die randomly or  maybe you'll fall through the map .\n\nThe map it's beautiful by definition, you can go wherever you want and just take a sit to admire the landscape. If you desire to get a 100% you'll have to check every corner of the map so you have 2-3 hours of gameplay. Don't buy this game searching for horror, buy it for it's plot, which is not perfect, but it works enough.\n\nSound and graphics are just amazing, can't criticice anything.\n\nAs today I can't recommend this game due to the bugs, if they patch the game and it's discounted >66% buy it, it will give you a nice time.","March 3","false","8.2"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","0"

Glitchy and incredibly heavy to run. 100% completion: 6-7 hours. Speedrun: 1 hour.\n\n\nI was so hyped for this game. I love exploration and I don't like horror games so I thought this was a good choice for me, given that the game is not incredibly scary (it is still a bit scary for me, but in a good way). Sadly, it didn't meet any of my expectations.\n\nTECHNICAL:\n\nThe game looks nice enough. I was so looking forward to a game built and developed on UE4. We have UE4 since years and nobody using it. Unfortunately it is unbelievably poorly optimized. With a 970, it stutters like hell even at 1920x1080 on medium details. Framerate goes from 35-37 fps to 60+ fps for no reason. Shadows glitch all the time.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nLot of exploration that turns into an extremely boring and long and slow walk. You can fast travel but only to camps you already visited. You can sprint, but only briefly because it's cold and you get tired. If you exaggerate, you have to wait even more because your sight is so blurred you can't see anything so it is even worse. The scenery is all the same, the map system is quite weird because the map does not actually (in my opinion) reproduce exactly every little cranny and path that you can take, making you disoriented. I was expecting a wonderful mix between snowy and icy spots, lost woods, abandoned buildings in small villages.....but no, the whole point in the game is to run (walk) around like crazy and finding some 'hot' spots that will be shown on the map.\n\nMiasmata did that well, with the whole triangulation system. In this game exploration is just hit and miss and breaks immersion.\n\nI hate badly optimized games....there is no reason why the game should run this bad on my system and the developers were just too lazy to even investigate and release some performance improving patch.\n\nSo, the game is nothing particularly good, plus it is for sure not well enough optimized, so I don't recommend it.","January 22","false","7.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

One of my favorite things was that the trees are shivering when there is wind and you really get the feeling of it. Never experienced this in a game.\n\nThen the  first bump in the road : The game was killing my geriatric GTX 650 Ti Boost on ultra... Didn't expect that from an indie game! So: slide show or adjust to high setting. DAMN! But looks great on high,too!\n\nSo for one hour I was running around and enjoying the grafics. I kind of liked, that you have to navigate via compass and card, so you get the feeling that you don't know where you are the whole time.\n\nAfter one and a half hour, I was kind of awaiting this huge horror and survival experience.\n\nBut I was miles out!\n\nNothing...Really:  Only running from A to B , dying from falling down a hill, running from A to b again, because you can't save except in your tent.

Map reading and orientation skills a must. Little rough around the edges but for the asking price, wonderful experiance.\n\nFirst game developed by IMGN, a polish publishing company, which shows a lot of promise. Seemingly stranded on the Ural Mountains, the player is tasked with exploring the mountain range to uncover what happened. A key part of the game is exploration and orientation where the player is given and a compass. The map shows a number of paths around the range and written on the map are a number of cords that the player needs to find in order to uncover what happened in the Ural mountains.\n\nWhile the game is open exploration and there is no set order that the cords have to be visited in, some of the paths that are on the map are blocked off with knee high walls and are meant to be travelled down rather than up. While many are well designed into the world so not to be too obvious, there are a few moments where it feels like the player is being sent down corridors rather than open to explorer where ever the player wants. It does not have the openess of skyrim, but that would never be a far comparison to make.\n\nWhile having the invistable walls adds obvious direction, it can take away from the otherwise amazing immersion. There have been at least two times now where I felt I should have been able to easily access an area that was blocked off. Also it's really easy to get stuck between trees (never to the point of needing the restart I should say) and run for a gap thinking you can make it through but hitting an invisable wall like a fly on glass.\n\nStill given the price and high quality of the assets, it being a little rough on the edges is something that can I can easily forgive and work with.\n\nRunning the UE4 engine, the game is visually stunning. There is a large and varied area to explore. At time running through forest, others scaling along and up mountians or going into a maze of caves. It's easy to get lost which is part of the fun, I had my compass up pretty much all the time.\n\nThe monsters are a weird one and ill not talk too much about them save to say they are less a threat in there own right but seem instead to try and confuse you and make you loose your bearings to the point where your sprinting through the snow, praying that you wont hit a dead end. They do there job fantastically, always in the back of your mind when trying to make sure you stay heading East.\n\nI have to mention the voice acting which is amazing. It really lends some weight to the story as you piece the parts together. It's narrated by Sean Bean for crying out loud. The score is also great, if a little jumpy at times. The 'Chase music' will jump start and stop quite abruptly.\n\nWhile it can be a little rough around the edges","June 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It’s not about jump scares. It’s about the environment of the region, which changes as you progress in certain areas.\n\nWhat makes this game difficult is not the slow-walking, semi-transparent monsters, or the orange smoke, or the primitive traps, or Sean Bean. It’s the fact that this game is a pre-GPS walking simulator. There’s no mini-map on the corner of your screen, with a dot or a triangle indicating where you are. All you have is a paper map that fills the entire screen and a compass, so it’s very easy to get lost. Fortunately, there are some places with coordinates handwritten on rock, so you can confirm where you are. Confirm or even find out you’re nowhere near where you expected to be!\n\nAlso, your character is physically limited. You can’t run for very long before losing your breath. Save the running for when you see the orange smoke or when your compass starts shaking.\nThe worst part is that you can’t jump nor climb. Given that you’re in a mountainous area, this can be very frustrating.\n\nBasically, if you’re interested in the paranormal, if you like somewhat scary games, or if you’re looking for a unique experience, you should get this game. However, if you’re looking for something as scary or disturbing as “Amnesia” or “Outlast”, if you hate VERY long walks, or if you have no patience for the kind of exploration this game requires, you should stay away from it.\n\nI suggest you only play this game in the winter. You’ll get a better feel of it that way.\n","May 7","true","8.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Both finding the clues and enjoying the atmosphere of rough Russian mountain country. Produced by Polish developers, game was supposed to rely more on visuals and this should intense the story, mysterious and creepy in its very nature. Lets see in details on the aspects of the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Open world\n+ Impressive atmosphere\n+ Useful devices - a map and a flashlight\n+ Accesible notes\n+ Main anomalies\n+ Nice story about speculative incident\no Map orientation\n- Inability to jump\n\nGameplay is decent, and it reminded me another game designed in this way (The Vanishing of Ethan Carter). What I evaluate as the most positive, is open world and atmosphere. You are able to explore the world as you wish and the night at Russian mountain accompanied by perfect soundtrack. Yes, you have to seek for notes and clues behind the Dyatlov Pass Incident, but you can give yourself a beautiful time just walking around and enjoying the sceneries.\n\nAlso, the story is perfectly designed, it does not show the only right possibilities, but it lets you have your own theory by giving another point of view, which you can live through the notes and environment.\n\nIt is a great idea to use only map and compass for orientation, furthermore, you have to rely on your memory, because there is no "GPS" to show, what your current position is. But, there is one confusion, though the North is on the lower side of the map, when you are going north, you are approaching the upper side. After realising this, the orientation is a piece of cake. And there needs to be mentioned, that compass and flashlight are going nuts, when anomalies approach, so you know you have to walk away swiftly.\n\nThe most negative was the inability to jump. Seriously, one rock and your progress is delayed, until you find a route around, what may disguise players from playing this game.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Beautiful voice acting\n+ Sean Bean narration\n+ Believable settings\n+ Mixing with other event even beyond Soviet Union\no Mystery behind our hero\n\nI like Sean Bean's reading of some notes and telling the crucial points. Even the voice of the female student is perfect, you can see, as the events went from paradise to complete horror. Settings were believable, everything is messed with another events, which are transcending even the existence of Soviet Union.\n\nWhat confused me is our role, but the end was really creepy and shocking, I recommend to collect all notes to reveal it, you will be shocked. I did not know until the last moment, what might discourage people from playing the game.\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Perfect sceneries\n- Tree glitches and resolution\n\nSceneries are awesome, it can be called "Scenery Porn", they are really enjoyable, each screenshot can serve as wallpaper. But the resolution is not very well adapted for 1920x1080 screen, it is well compensated while playing, but after recording, you can see, that it is a bit lower, and I can not help myself, that nowadays, 1080p is a standard in gaming industry. I have encountered few glitches, when snow was "dancing" on the trees. Just details.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ Well set according to the situation\n+ Beautiful vocals\n\nSoundtrack has no mistake, if you like the game music, it has a reasonable prize, for buying. It enhances the atmosphere and serves as a well designed addition to the game. Brilliant.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nKholat is a specific genre of game, very often named also as "walking simulator". I have to admit, that not everyone should like the game, but if you seek something, that will give you a decent story, stunning environment and some amount of creepiness, you will be pleasured. I also think, that even players outside this genre might be pleased.\n\nSo in the end, even despite some scars on the game, as inability to jump or confusing orientation in the beginning, I can recommend the game and soundtrack as well.\n\nGo to the Russian wilderness and seek out the truth! Strongly recommended.","October 10, 2015","true","30.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/recommended/343710/","littlemissmirage","ItsJustaMirage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/","73 products in account","Kholat is an horror-adventure/exploration game based on the Dyatlov Pass Incident. The tragic and mysterious event involved nine Russian hikers who ventured out to the Kholat Syakhl mountains in high hopes to climb its daunting size but, unfortunately, met an untimely end. The reasoning behind their deaths is still unsolved to this day.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9oiz_zqHLM\n\nWhat I Enjoyed:\n\nWalk in the park - Despite the dreadful and mournful wintery setting, the game visuals are at its highest peak, creating a lot of realism and utilizing it to present a haunting experience that will surely leave players’ skins crawling. Every sway of the frosted pine trees to the brisk, snowy winds are so evident in detail that it only furthers the fear players will endure when embarking on the Dyatlov Pass trail. The title fully optimizes the immersiveness in the game by adding stunning imagery as well as sounds that results in an unpleasant yet necessary experience to grasp the terror that had befallen the nine mountaineers.\n\nStorytelling - The game dwells deep into laying the foundation of the Dyatlov Pass incident by relishing players who have no prior knowledge to the horrific events that took place; it provides basic information while foretelling theorized depictions of what resulted on that eventful night. The story paints grotesque imagery at the beginning which hooks the player off the bat and opts for an interesting playthrough.\n\nSimple is best - The gameplay mechanics is not meant to detract from the story or the exploration by keeping the game style simplistic, which allows it to not be the focal point of the game. While possessing the generic run, zoom, and flashlight commands, the game also introduces players to a map and compass that are unlike other games’ versions as this maps does not record your current location. Instead, this special map reveals conspiring events and potential savepoints in disguise as campfires.\n\nWhat I Disliked:\n\nSquare one - The difficulty appears when players are not utilizing the map and compass effectively, which results in endless walking/running around the same dead tree stump or the same creepy, grinning totem poll. To prevent this, you must understand how to get to the desired location by locating the set of coordinates written on your map. This, unfortunately, requires some map navigational skills and proper compass usage as well as memorizing key landscape structure. Overtime, those who are prone to stubbornness (like myself) who are using these available tools prove more as an annoyance and tedious.\n\nTurtle’s pace -  The threats in this game seems to be minimal at times. As the game implements a running command that ends so sporadically, it offers a nerve-wrecking sensation when pursued by predators but will frustrate you when simply try to find an unexplored area. This results in a whole playthrough the almost appears to go at a turtle’s pace. Players must use the running command spaciously and in spurts or risk exerting the character’s stamina. Sadly, the recovering time is longer than the running duration so plan your actions accordingly.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe story of Kholat brought me through an unnerving adventure, successfully making me question every sudden sound I heard. The game did a wonderful job with the atmosphere but the endless roaming sometimes made the game feel like a walking simulation instead of a horrific adventure. Despite that, I really enjoyed the time I’ve had playing this game and found myself lost in its storytelling.\n\n","January 10","true","4.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I started over once because I thought maybe I was getting the notes in a 'bad/confusing' order, but it turns out it makes no difference.\n- The map you have lies in a few cases. There are a number of places where the map shows a viable path that are actually blocked. This is somewhat realistic, since the blocks were usually things like rockslides and such that would not be reflected on the map if they happened recently, but it did mean a lot of trudging along routes that were ultimately dead ends.\n- While there are mechanics that influence whether you die, I had a few occasions where I felt like I died randomly without any clear reason. This didn't detract me much, since I just loaded back in at the last note node, but I can imagine it irritating some players.\n- Performance is rough. My PC is moderately high end and I was regularly getting 15fps or even lower in places.\n\nThe cautious above aside, it was a very immersive environment, visually striking with very well done, chilling audio.","January 17","true","5.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

However, I am slightly disappointed that it was only a 4-6 hours long gaming experience.\nThis game gave me the sensation of being alone in a vast harsh environment with the only exception being that evil was lurking all around. The only items available to me were a flashlight, a map, a compass & a few notes found in key areas of the map which, in my opinion, really didn't help me much in my venture to solve the mystery behind these unexplainable events. It took me a while to figure out how to use the compass & map but I managed to get the hang of it pretty quick.\nOverall, I really enjoyed playing this game because it gave me a true sense of fear and that I was almost always... completely alone.

I got a good 20 hours of play out of this game searching for every single journal, the atmosphere is one of the best that you'll be wanting to explore every nook and cranny before finishing the game.\n\nThe few negatives I have are performance, it needs improving, the story is vague and while most of the journals are interesting, you'll wish there was more going on and a few annoyances of a certain visitor which you'll meet often but you soon understand how to deal with it.","June 14, 2015","true","22.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gorgeous snow covered landscapes combined with the crunching of your feet in the frozen drifts and stinging winds made me physically shiver and pull the blankets closer to my body. There's a peacefulness found in the isolation of the mountains that affected me in a very real way. I've trudged alone through wintry forests, lost in my own thought before, and Kholat recreates that feeling with near perfection. The supernatural elements may be things of folklore and imagination, but they effectively convey that awe-inspiring sense of mystery and danger that lurks in the untouched, dark wilderness.\n\nUsing the somewhat obscure but true events of a group of hikers meeting their untimely end in the Ural mountains under mysterious circumstances, Kholat charges the player to set out into the frozen Russian nothingness to uncover the truth behind the rampant speculations. You arrive in a small town with almost no guidance, trek up a pathway toward the mountains, and find a small survival tent containing a map, compass, and flashlight. These will be the only tools at your disposal for the entire game. The map has GPS coordinates scribbled in a corner, but there is no indicator to show you where you're located. You have to use landmarks and a rudimentary sense of direction to adventure toward those vague points of interest, and even then the map isn't entirely reliable as what appears to be straight pathways are often blocked or misleading. It may sound more difficult in concept than it is in practice: the environment isn't nearly as vast and open as it first appears. There are clear pathways and walls so basic maze-solving logic applies, but still, the lack of hand holding and gift of player freedom go a long way to sell the play space as untamed.\n\nThis is very much a walking simulator, and it's also a game about picking up notes. Kholat is a very good one of those experiences. It's the perfect length, ending before the wonder of exploration wears thin. It leverages the simplicity of note gathering for gameplay mechanics; you'll hear them fluttering in the wind well before you see them, so you're forced to heighten your senses which makes every wolf howl or cracking branch that much more unnerving. The notes also act as save points, so they're objects of tension relief on top of mere story dumps. There are fail states, and while the game certainly isn't difficult they come frequently and with enough unpredictability that you never let your guard down for long. It's packed with just the right amount of variety that it never becomes formulaic; you have to hide in a closet from a monster... once. There's some very light platforming, and a couple set-piece chase sequences. It's a game about the supernatural and there's a subplot about inhumane experiments, but it's best described as “tense” rather than full of jump scares or gross out blood and gore. It's the rare instance of a game understanding the strengths of the genre (horror and walking experience) and using them correctly rather than making an empty game and passing off laziness for art.\n\nAs I hiked up a narrow mountain pass I thought I caught what looked like a vaguely skull shaped rock in the mountain. Winding further upward my suspicions were confirmed as there were several giant, silent skulls staring at me. I felt uneasy, but also taken aback at the beauty and subtlety of these impossibly titanic symbols of death carved there amidst the softly falling snow. Kholat is more about the experience than traditional gameplay, but it's an experience that moved me deeply and I highly recommend it.","January 20","true","4.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The extended bouts of exploration and note collecting will be tedious for some, but the environment and soundtrack are beautiful and atmospheric. The game is heavily reliant on narrative, developing the story little by little with each note that you find scattered across the desolate, snowy landscape. The voice acting is excellent and delivered with convincing emotion. You aren't completely safe on your journey, in that you'll occassionally come across enemies that will pursue you, but are not an especially difficult threat.\n\nThe game is by no means without its (rather frustrating) flaws. Progress will be slow as you cannot run for any significant amount of time before being winded. The compass/map system is confusing and will get you lost on the twisting, large map. The enemies are minor irritations and while the first couple of encounters may startle, the effect soon wears thin. There are occassional glitches that will result in your character becoming stuck in the environment or falling right through it into voids unknown.\n\nUltimately though, you'll want to keep searching to know what happens next, with an ending open to various interpretations. If you're patient and you like a haunting story with good atmosphere, you'll enjoy Kholat.","August 27, 2015","true","13.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The visuals are quite astonishing with the style reminding me of MW2 (Where it kind of looks like a painting). I run SLI 980's on an Asus PG278Q 1440p monitor and I get around 60 FPS on max settings. AA seems to be needed in some form in this game.\n\nSome tips:\nAlways look at the map to get around. This may seem obvious but you get lost in the woods and you won't be sure which way is up or down on the map. If you look at your first camp and turn around, you are looking towards the bottom of the map. Like wise, looking towards the camp is looking towards the upper part.\n\nThe compass still confuses me and I'm not sure if the C means camp on it.\n\nSlight spoiler:\nIf you encounter a monster or two, you're best bet is to run and hide or try to get by by staying away from their path. They seem to follow but if you oof it away from they don't seem to stick with you long.\n\nYou can only fast travel when you find them. to and from other camps. Camps are just like the first except they will have a fire going and another tent that isn't broken down. It makes me want to stay at a camp in one of the caves because the fire light seems to feel like false security.\n\nPlay with the best headphones you can get. It really adds to the experience.\n\nFinally, look at the coordinates  on the left side of your map and go for those. The notes you find help for the story, but won't get you any farther necessarily. Going to camps, finding notes and finding important coordinate locations will save the game.\n\nLook around the walls and ground. You can sometimes find coordinates on rocks and such to tell you where you are.\n\nI'm still playing this game and it is quite good for what it is. It's just a little taxing on your PC IMO. Maybe at 1080p this won't be such a problem.","June 12, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

They really build the world with the magnificent visuals, from the haunting caves to the light deprived forests, it always delivers the correct feeling when entering an environment. The visuals are all tied together very nicely with the evolving sound design. The cold whipping of the wind or the deep ambiance of the caves sometimes accompanied with some chilling choice of instrumentation in their soundtrack keeps you feeling your surroundings while on edge the whole time.\n\nA well crafted haunting exploration experience. I did find it to fall a little short in how scary it was but I'm not taking too many points off for this, as it didnt seem it even needed to be a horror game at all.

This first area is new and unfamiliar and the game certainly doesn't lead you by the hand at all, it leaves you alone to discover the harshness of the landscape. You come to the opening of a forest and this is where the horror truly begins.\n\nKholat  leaves you on edge most times with the eerie noises and a sense of loneliness. The monsters you encounter resemble mere shadows that turn orange the more aggresive they become, once they are fully aware of you they will kill you causing you to start at the last save point. The story of the game will leave you wanting more as you pickup each of the notes, journal entries, or case files.\n\nKholat is an amazing looking game, mostly due to its rendering of the Russian wilderness. From the snow on the ground to the ghosts of pasts incidents everything is detailed and distinct. The environments are all very intricate, every single part is made to be different with markers to help you on your way. The music and sounds are possibly the best part of the game with most tracks being a haunting piano score or the sounds of the wind and storms. The attention to the sound is part of what makes the game atmospheric with little knocks and sounds of wolves making you feel like you may not be as alone as previous thought.\n\nKholat's weakest point is its gameplay, as certain bits of it tend to infuriate more than scare. The game's concept is a simple collect pages and avoid the monster gameplay, the problem being is your character is not really fit to navigate the landscape or run from the monsters. your character is able to look far distances, run, as well as use  one of the items you are given to navigate.\n\nYour character cannot jump, and when he runs he can jolt for about 3 seconds before getting tired out and requiring a significant amount of time to recover. Kholat is an expansive free roam game where low stamina is a very bad thing to have and the compass you are given becomes another issue as well. The compass, initially, is a very hard item to use entirely because you end up spending half of your time figuring it out hoping something doesn't kill you while you do. A large saving grace for the game is the ability to fast travel from campsite to campsite.\n\nI won't discuss the ending as it is something you just have to experience for yourself. DO I hate this game? No, I actually highly recommend playing it as the horror feel is always present, it's a very nerve shattering experience and it's easy to get caught up in the information the game gives you. If you enjoy games like Dear Esther and Slender: The Arrival, I recommend trying the game out, be warned though, the game can be oddly frustrating at times, and is not recommended for just one sitting.","June 27, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's certainly no conflict/resolution. You never get to actually understand what's going on. Full disclosure, I didn't find every note, but I did find a good number of them and they were far too vague to reach real conclusions from.\n\nThe narration and (disappointing) ending tell you pretty much zip about what you're actually interested in: "what happened here? why is this weird stuff happening now?".\n\nExploration-wise, there are some interesting landmarks you can often see from a long way off that give you motivation to keep going to try to reach them. You can also follow the coordinates on your map to get to some that are a bit more hidden. But those areas are small and there's not much exploration within them, and most of the map is very boring to explore because it's all snow, mountains, and trees. I actually got a "Tree" steam card for this game. I assume they have the other major characters like "Rock" and "Snow" too.\n\nI realize that that's meant to be the game's atmosphere: bleak, snowy, windy, forboding. But it's just not that interesting to walk around in for 15 minutes at a time just getting from point A to point B.\n\nThe game looks good and they clearly put a lot of work into it, but for the reasons above I didn't find it fun to play. Maybe pick it up if it goes on sale for $5 or less.","August 22, 2015","false","3.5"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","11","22","0","0"

You wander around the bitterly cold landscape looking for notes and "anomalies." Sadly, the anomalies are just notes in areas that have some visual interest and change things up from the snowy covered trees and rocks. Around the anomalies are specters (black transparent humanoids) that patrol and try to get you, if they do you're dead. Sneaking by the specters or outrunning them isn't too fun, nor are the particularly scary. And really, most of the horror element stems from them so it doesn't quite work all too well.\n\nTravel is a major pain in the ♥♥♥, you're slow and your sprint is seriously limited. Honestly, it's probably the shortest sprint I've seen in any game I've played. Which ultimately, gets annoying. 90% of the game is just ice, snow, frost, trees, bushes and plants and you grow tired of it fast and just want to sprint your way through, but you can't because of the limited stamina of the main character. If you drain your stamina you're stuck for a couple seconds walking slower than the normal walking pace as your character regains his breath. It's a major annoyance.\n\nThe map will mark off any notes, anomalies and camps you find, but it doesn't say where the hell you are. I get it, maps don't do that, but this isn't a nitty gritty survival game and it REALLY doesn't need to have a map that doesn't pinpoint exactly where you are. It's terrible and leaves the map almost useless.\n\nThe last mistake the game makes is that death requires you to restart from the last camp or note you picked up. Yes, in a game where there's nothing to do in between locations of interest and where death can come easily if you die 10 minutes away from your last "checkpoint," enjoy making that massive trip again. After 6+ deaths I'm done and I don't think I'll continue with the rest of the game.\n\nI'm a sucker for atmospheric "walking simulators" but this really ups the ante of annoyance which I just can't get behind. If you're looking for one, wait until a sale. Other than that give this a pass.","June 5","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Then you may like this although you may not. Generally this game boils down to wandering around aimlessly through a snowy enviroment listening for the flutter of paper in the wind which indicates a note to collect. You are given a compass and map but without having the ability to place waypoints or see where you are on the map I found these pretty much useless. The horror elements are literally non existent, the sound scaring you more than anythingelse. The story is based on a true story but with crap narration done by Mr Sean Bean himself you dont feel like you completely get it, given to you in a muddled up manner. You feel like you need to put the notes in order at the end of the game, and then read it through carefully to fully grasp what there trying to say. Another annoying thing is the stamina, I understand its hard going walking through snow but this is a game and a game should be fun. An extension to the amount of time given before you get tired wouldve worked better. Also being unable to jump or climb leaves you following trails,,, you can forget about stepping over that pebble. Theres also many places where you can get stuck which will require a restart. Achievement wise its very easy, none are challenging and only need you to be in the right place on the map.

This game should not be running like this on newer hardware, especially since the minimum requirement is a 470. From what I have played it seems like just a walking simulator rather than a horror game. It also requires you to pay very close attention to your surroundings and almost constantly have the map and compass up to actually know where you are, which can get very frustrating. The atmosphere sound and graphics are amazing, minus the fact that it runs like crap. But other than that I cannot recommend this game for the 21.99 that it costs.

I suppose to many negotiating the obstacles might be part of the fun, but to me it just seems contrived.  I also don't like games where you suddenly get killed without any warning.     I don't mind dying because I fell off a rock - that's my own fault, but I object to being killed by a creature that suddenly appears out of nowhere giving me no chance to do anything about it.  Also I think the character must be some sort of invalid as not only can he not climb, he can't run for more than ten seconds without getting out of breath.  Maybe it's the altitude.  But it would be a better game if it actually let me explore instead of putting all these restrictions in the game!","February 5","false","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

For those of you looking for an experience like the FNAF series, Amnesia, or even Slenderman, don't buy this game.\n\nFrom my impression, Kholat is a suspensefully atmospheric completionist adventure game where you experience gorgeous scenery, intense music, a haunting environment, and Sean Bean. Kholat is suspenseful, but hardly scary: jumpscares are rare and predictable, and there isn't an overabundance of horror imagery. It could be called a gateway into the horror genre for gamers who aren't comfortable with the bigger horror titles. For what Kholat gives, it does it fairy well.\n\nNow I should give my critique of what Kholat could have done better.\n-Sean Bean honestly isn't the best voice actor, neither is any of their other voice actors for the game. Not terrible, but sub-par for the atmosphere the game is trying to create.\n-There's not nearly enough enemies. Overall, the Ural Mountains seem quite empty with the exception of the primary points of interest.\n-A little too paranormal right off the bat. The plot flow could have been stuctured much better\n\nKholat is structured like a dungeon crawler, where you set off towards a  coordinate, the environment getting more and more spooky as you go, encountering some spooky creatures that try to kill you, then you reach the point of interest, find a spooky (not really) clue, and return to home base, where it's safe, then repeat until you unlock everything. Fun for some, not for everyone. The plot isn't scary, and neither is the gameplay after a few hours of exploration.\n\nStory: 5/10\nSetting: 9/10\nScariness: 6/10\nReplayability: 4/10\n\nFinal Verdict: Not bad at all, but could've been a lot better. I bought it on sale, so i felt like $12 was worth it, but don't buy it for the full price. The game is beautiful, but it doesn't get any deeper as you play, and at the end you feel like you didn't really accomplish much. That said, it's still pretty fun if you take it for its face value.\n\n7/10","August 24, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's very much a walking simulator type game with your only interactions is the collecting of documents and avoiding death from the anomaly/orange mist.\n\nThe story you piece together is hard to follow and like the actual real event, raises more questions than it answers.\nGraphics-wise, it's above par, but not top-notch. I had some issues with sudden freezes between zones(Loading regions?) and pop-in of ambient lighting.\n\nMy biggest caveat though is the core gameplay. It just doesn't feel all there(Of what little there is to begin with). Admittedly most games of this type don't offer much for gameplay, but in Kholat it just felt glaringly obvious there needed to be more going on here than just collecting paper. For instance, the map is fairly decently sized and you spend a great deal of time traversing it, but so little ever happens in it with the exception of a few easily distinguishable areas. It just got boring very quick. Why couldn't there be random/weird/creepy events or encounters in the huge empty areas to mix things up a bit? The extremely brief sprinting ability and very limited fast travel doesn't help with this much either.\n\nAlso, this game has no quick save or manual save system. So be prepared to backtrack from your last checkpoint all the way to where you accidentally died. Adding to that as well, if you're trying to be through and think you missed a path to explore and want to backtrack... Think again. This game likes to have one-way paths forcing you take the long way back around if you know you happened to miss something. Manual, player saves would fix both these issues.\n\nDevelopers, stop doing only automated checkpoint saves. STOP IT.\n\nOverall though, I liked the game. It was interesting, if a bit medicore with it's gameplay.\nI would suggest giving it a try if it goes on sale if you're into these kinds of game.\n","August 26, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's not bad but compared to the other horror games I've played this one is a bit slow.  Boring actually.  There's parts where the monster chases you and some ghosts show up but when that's not going on there's just walking...and lots of it.  The navigation is pretty bad.  Most video games give you some sort of "blip" on the map to show your location.  Not here!  You have a map and a compass and you're expected to use it like in real life.  I like realism but that's a bit extream.  This game is very non-linear and open world.  That's good in one aspect but since the navigation is very basic it's easy to get lost and the game doesn't nudge you in the right direction.  The only hints the game gives you is map coordinates written on a wall or you'll hear paper blowing in the wind to let you know you're near a note.  The good things about this game is the enviromental sounds, ambient sounds and graphics.  It really makes you feel like you're there.  For an open world horror game it's good but not as high-paced as other horror games.\n\nPros\nBased on a real legend!\nOpen world\nGraphics - Unreal 4, very good\nSounds\nBasic controls\nEerie horror game\nMakes you think\n\nCons\nNavigation - You'll get lost easy unless you check your map often.  They should mail you a Scout badge after beating this!\nCan't jump - such a basic open world ability and you can't do it.\nNot the best horror game due to lots of wondering around with nothing happening.  During long walks and not getting attacked it just feels like a hiking simulator.\n\nI still recommend it because it's based on a legend and it looks like they put some work into it.  But since I've played lots of horror games (ones that make you jump often and make you feel constantly on edge) I had to give a harsh but fair review.","September 30, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's no real gameplay, you run around looking for notes while trying to avoid orange ghosts, demons or whatever.

I would have loved to explore an alternative reality about the Djatlov Incident, it opens up a lot of room for imagination and crazy stuff. It's a great concept, but after less than an hour already I lost my interest in finding out more. You can't expect people to wander around without any guidance or action for papers.\n\nPlease developers if you want to make a game like this it must have the best atmosphere ever to at least be up to par.

In the snow.  You have a cold, and you're a fat, slow, pathetic slob who can't run more than 4 seconds without wheezing and getting dizzy and having the world go grey ...er.  GreyER!!!!  And you can't jump.  Guess Momma never showed you how.\n\nSo you're walking around ... in Siberia.  I don't know why.  You don't know why.

A bunch o' stupid college kids went runnin' ALL over Siberia just throwin' their diary pages all over the damn place, and now YOU gotta pick it up ... slowly.  In a blizzard.  Oh, and some science-y investigator type did it to.\n\nYou can read all that stuff if you want.  It tells some kinda story.\n\nOh, and there are some creepy orange dudes running around.  What a mind job.  So you're here to save the world.  What do you say to something like that?  A little piece of advice.  You see an age.... I mean "an orange dude", you do what we do. Run.

So, yeah, I'm making fun of the game.\n\nHowever:  I love Kholat.  I've been interested in the Dyatlov Pass incident for a long time.

The whole story is in there, and piecing it together was fun for me.\n\nSo, I'm sorry I'm making stupid jokes, but here's the truth:  you walk, in the snow, in a barren landscape, picking up the pieces of a tragedy that happened years ago, while something sinister stalks you.  It's creepy.  It's sad.  It's bleak.\n\nBut it was thoroughly enjoyable for me.\nNo, it's not a game everybody will like.\nYes:  I highly recommend it.","July 2, 2015","true","6.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","33","1","3","4","0"

It isn't amazing, but it certainly isn't terrible. If you are a fan of horror games, this game is for you. There are some issues here and there... But it all works out.\n\nPROS:\n+Sean Bean narrates the game and his voice is perfect. There are other voice actors, and like Bean, they are wonderful. Whomever was the voice director really got their actors to... ACT!\n+The story is pretty good. It is told through notes found and narrations by Bean. Walking in the snow can be linked to what is going on, but the game is meant to be interpreted.\n+There is no "YOU ARE HERE" dot on the map. You must use the compass and pay attention to landmarks. This is great! It adds to the terror of being lost while something is hunting you down.\n+The big bad monster will never jumpscare the player. There was one time where he respawned in front of me (and killed me) but, other than that one fluke, you'll notice him walking around, the flashlight flickering, or the compass spazzing out.\n+Sprinting can only be done in bursts since the character will tire out. This is good since it adds to the terror if you're found by the monster.\n+The level design is pretty good! I found myself enjoying the well designed snowy areas. But....\n\nMIXED:\n+/-...There's no jumping. I know this may sound strange since other games like this, such as The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, do not have jumping or removing the ability to jump would not change anything. The level design is far and wide and, as the game expects you, there are times where you have to walk down steep hills. The problem is that sometimes you can get stuck between two rocks, or there's a rock in the way of your path, both of which can be easily JUMPED over. The funny thing about this is that I really do think jumping was in the game at one point since there are some paths that are cut off by a high ledge. Even with jumping, it'd be impossible to get them. It doesn't kill the game, but it certainly hurts it because I'm supposed to be immersed in the game and the fastest way to pull me out of the experience is to put a small ledge that I could get over in real life by simply raising my leg higher to step over!\n+/- The ambient sound is amazing, despite one detail: foot steps in the cave and water droplets. Throughout the game the sound is amazingly designed, until you reach the caves. Your footsteps still sound like you're in the stone and I could hear water droplets, but I could see multiple sources of them and they are all out of sync. Once I got out of the caves, the wonderful design came back, but it still ruins the overall experience.\n\nCONS:\n-The game will last about 4 hours. Since you'll go back and collect all the notes for the extended ending, you'll end up 100% the game within that time, which I did within said 4 hours.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants a lovely horror game that relies on making the player feel alone, weak, and terrified to move without the use of jumpscares.","March 12","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Track down the journal pages at each of the coordinates to advance through the story and track down other hidden pages along the way by finding coordinates scribbled about the place. The game would have taken longer to complete if I wanted to track down all the optional journal entries, but the ones I did find added so little to the game's story that it is not worth it to find them.\n\nThere is only one type of enemy which is easily avoided and not very threatening. Although there are some atmospheric parts with funky effects and times where you are being chased, most of the game is just trying to figure out where you are and navigating to the next set of coordinates, as the map does not show your current location.\n\nUnfortunately even Sean Bean's excellent voice acting does not carry the weak plot, which makes no real sense at all.\n\nThis game is also incredibly short, as I beat it in 3 hours only. Overall I'm disappointed by this game but it was enjoyable enough in some parts. It is definitely not worth full price in my opinion, so try to buy it on a %50 or more sale if you are still interested in playing it.","February 19","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At first it seemed that it would be just another walking simulator with little objective and nice scenery. However, in Act 2, the map actually has objectives to reach in the form of latitude/longitude spots, notes, and campsites. The challenge becomes reaching those spots. The map/compass (a Russian compass!) helps only a little as I struggled to guess where I was on it. The terrain is very unforgiving and made it impossible to walk in just one direction as I kept walking into rocks, water, trees, caves and high rising mountains that the character can't move through. The character has some limitations as well as he/she walks slowly, can’t sustain a run for very long and can’t jump. The character limitations sometimes broke the immersion as it was more frustrating than challenging (I mean -- really -- this character can’t jump over a fallen tree?!). If you fall, you die and have to start back at the last note or campsite. Also, you find out you are not alone from time to time with deadly consequences.\n\nThe voice acting, music, sound effects and scenery is amazing and really did immerse me into the game. I can't emphasize this enough, they really did an excellent job on setting the mood. Sean Bean and his supporting cast is so convincing that I forgot that these were voice actors, the music is hauntingly beautiful and lonely, and the scenery with the accompanying sound effects really made me want to shiver in cold and bundle up in warm clothes.","February 20","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gameplay is just you walking around this big map avoiding monsters and other anomalies, and by other anomalies mostly the same monster (but he's invisible sorta) picking up notes along the way in order to solve the mystery of the Students that died there, and it's a big big map. Its a pretty game, very pretty, so pretty in fact that i can only play with medium settings. Still, atmosphere is everything for this game (biggest thing its got going for it) from the music to the ambient sounds its super creepy.

While it falters in some areas, it does some things so well that it merits a recommendation.\n\nThe game features a large open area that the player must explore.  The player has a map and a compass, but navigation is initially disorienting, something that enriches the experience. The landscape feels confusing, and mastering it is part of the challenge. The element of navigation in a unique snowy landscape brings something new to the genre.  It's the first game since Miasmata that made me feel as though I really had to pay attention to find my way around. This approach works particularly well in a horror game.\n\nThe sound and atmosphere design is amazing; snow whips and howls around the player constantly, and the baying of wolves seems to follow the player.  Occasionally, the player will navigate through narrow caves or dark forests.  Sometimes, you are not alone, and I experienced frequent dread and occasional shocks throughout my time.  The game varies the dangers you face, and I never got comfortable. Finally, it should be mentioned that the entire game is gorgeous.\n\nThe plot, however, features a number of themes-supernatural, government conspiracy, to name the most prominent- and mashes them together. The story does not tie together all of these ideas in a cohesive manner.  The voice acting works well, but everything is so scattered that it didn't hold my interest.  The considerable talent of Sean Bean is not utilized well. It's one of those approaches to horror that's designed to 'leave it to the player's interpretation,' but there's nothing solid to hold on to.  Nothing comes together, and the ending is insubstantial.\n\nHad the story elements been more focused, this would have been a stronger recommendation.  However, the gameplay of navigation in a blizzzard, the incredible atmosphere, and the consistent chills, make this a worthy choice for anyone looking for a quality horror title.","June 19, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story has weight, the pacing is very well done and the environment is beautiful yet terrifying all at the same time. Taking the time to absorb the environment is probably one of the best ways to adjust to the time between the vital points of the game. I found myself just wandering and getting lost because I was so entranced by the scenery... and then I nearly have a heart attack because the anomally pops up in front of me.\n\nSumming up, if you enjoy a game that has pride in its ability to pull you away from the thought of being scared while being a horror game Kholat is a very good choice. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of psychological horror games and I would say a good way to play this game is in longer sessions.\n\nI hope to see more games coming from IMGN.PRO and hope they continue in the same style as Kholat.","June 15, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Throughout the course of the game the player will explore the treacherous mountain landscape, hoping to uncover the answer as to what truely caused the hiker's deaths.\nLike most mystery based horror games as you start to uncover answers you'll also find more questions arise from your investigation which keeps you going until you reach a rather ambiguous ending. Unlike my previous attempts to play these sort of games, this one actually managed to hold my interest to the very end, and the ending itself made me want to go back through it and potentially uncover more information.\nThere's also some terrific performances by the voice actors in this game. Sean Bean's narration along with the voices from logbook/diary entries really flow well with the tonal shift of the story as the player progresses. And the ambient audio/music help keep the tension going as you get lost in the endless sea of trees and rocks.\nIn terms of actual gameplay, my favorite thing is that the map is an actual map. Player's have to read coordinates and use a compass in order to know where they are located in the world instead of having a little dot on a mini-map showing their exact location. This really helps to put the player in an explorer mindset and really keep track of their surroundings. Its just a shame the surrounding environment is what almost kills this game for me.\nThe environment, apart from a few key locations, is visually bland, poorly optimized, and riddled with so many bugs that I could never get truely immersed in the experience. The environment just feels too big and empty. Bugs included huge amounts of clipping, stretched textures, environment pieces popping in/out of existence, and sometimes the entire floor disappearing resulting in my character falling out of the environment to my death. Of all the things in this game that needed more attention, it would be the design of the evironment and the rest of the gameplay.\nAs I said earlier, the map function was an interesting design choice and one that I liked, my problem is the rest of the gameplay is just a walking/running simulator. As a player, nothing makes me feel more constrained and limited than being blocked by a 2 foot tall rock that I should be able to just jump/climb over but the game won't allow me to. I'm just asking to be able to interact with the environment and not feel like I'm trapped on a linear path surrounded by invisible walls.\nMy other problem is the monsters. While there are story clues as to what/who they are, they didn't really add to the tension and in fact felt more like an obligation because "its a horror game, which means we must have monsters to chase the player." They're more an annoyance really than actually scary.\nBut despite the gameplay and environment nearly destroying the experience, the story itself should keep players interested. My recommendation is to definitely play the game, but I suggest waiting for a sale.","June 13, 2015","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really really REALLY wanted to. When I heard what it was based around I was hyped I instantly bought the game. I was so interested to see what kind of horror game it would be. I was very let down. When i first got in. Absolutely beautiful. Amazing scenery and graphics. Sound was amazing and the creepy atmosphere had me on the edge of my seat. It stayed that way for a while. Until I reached the first coordinate on the map. There I encountered the.."monster" or whatever you wanna call it. It scared me. Really really badly. I was like man this game is awesome!!\n\nSo..continuing along the game I quickly realized that..the monster just appeared in certain areas and you were pretty much free to roam the map no issue. A large chunk of the map. The monster was very predictable and east to avoid and really lost its scary factor instantly after the first encounter then it had none at all when I realized I had a way to know when it was close.\n\nIt was just walking simulator with good atmosphere. Which is fine. But I feel like calling it a horror game is a bit much. I did finish the game though it was offline so it only shows around two hours of play time. This is a good game. Its just not a horror game to me.\n\nAlso one of the points in the preview video is you will get lost..if you have basic knowledge of how a map and compass works.

It brings me back to my first time playing Silent Hill, when that first came out on PlayStation.\n\nThe game unfolds with almost no direction, using only cues from the environment.  The player has no hud, only a compass, map, and flashlight.  You can only run for short sprints before getting out of breath, and can wind up death without so much as a warning.  I'm only a bit into the game now, but I look forward to seeing the end.\n\nCheck out my first 30 minutes of the game on my YouTube channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaOMA3biWuM&index=1&list=PL0ChqurHdrD6euMxgeZELQR-CAmPsBhsA","June 13, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehManio/recommended/343710/","TehManio","Manio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehManio/","187 products in account","Kholat is a horror game developed by IMGN.PRO. The game is based on the true-event known as the Dyatlov Pass Incident. In Kholat players take on the role of some person walking through the mountains and collecting notes and avoiding some teleporting/slow-moving entity (very similar to Slender) all while being narrated by the ever-famous, man who always dies, Sean Bean. The notes you are collecting are supposed to reveal the story and events around the Dyatlov Pass Incident but there really doesn’t seem to be much of a story present in Kholat and it feels more like the developers didn’t exactly know what they were doing and decided to just adopt the tired, and stale Slender formula we’ve been seeing in indie-horror titles as of late, which is a huge bummer coming from Kholat.\n\nBasing a game around the events of the Dyatlov Pass Incident should be a solid premise, and make an amazing horror game but that doesn’t exactly happen when you dip into Kholat. Instead you get a pretty boring, and frustrating game that feels like a chore to progress through, and doesn’t offer much in terms of excitement or enjoyment. You’re thrown into an ‘open-world’ environment that looks gorgeous, I won’t deny that. Kholat is one damn good looking game, thanks to Unreal Engine 4 and the amazing environmental work that was done on the game. The mountains look foreboding, and unnerving especially when I came across two giant skulls carved into the face of a cliff. Sadly, that’s about all that Kholat really offers in term of a horror experience. Through-out my time spent with the game I really only found myself feeling creeped out by certain parts of the environment. The enemies weren’t exactly terrifying, and were more so frustrating, or downright annoying to deal with. They work pretty similar to how Slenderman works. A slow-moving, possible teleporting (it seems like they can teleport in front of you which is downright annoying) entity that stalks you the entire time while you collect notes. Seem familiar? That’s the core concept of Kholat in a nut-shell. Explore a creepy environment, collect notes, and avoid the entity that is stalking you. Even the entity seems to be confused during the game as well. I often found myself watching the entity stop chasing me and just stand still, or change direction and start walking away from me. Where’s the fear in that? And you’re most likely to be killed by the environment, which offers no sort of warning when you could die. It’s more like a random, gotcha sort of incident which is horrible. Kholat doesn’t exactly bring anything fresh, or new to the table in terms of an experience, which again is a bummer considering how good Kholat could of been.\n\nThe game also allows you to fast-travel at campsites that you discover which is a glorious feature that I’m glad was implemented due to how agonizing, and boring it is to traverse the environment after a while. This mainly stems from doing a ton of backtracking, and walking in circles. Then again, this could be intentional due to the disorienting environment and this could possible be what the victims of the real-life incident felt before their untimely demise. Sadly, it doesn’t work and just makes the game boring and again, feel like more of a chore to play. That and the entire movement system in the game is pretty godawful. You can sprint for what is maybe a few seconds before tiring out and moving at an extremely sluggish pace and it takes a fair bit of time to be able to sprint again. It makes the moments where you need to run-away from the entities, and the “orange fog” that tends to chase you to be frustrating. It feels like this was intended to make players feel tense and scared but all I felt was severe annoyance, which isn’t a good thing. You want players to have fun, and feel terrified. Not annoyed, and angry at poorly designed mechanics.\n\nI’ve only put around 3 hours into Kholat and I can tell I’m nearing the end-game area. The story seems to be expanding, but is still extremely convoluted with no real direction. What am I doing in the mountain? Why did I decide to come here? Who the hell are these entities walking around? The game offers really no explanation for anything, and even Sean Bean seems like he didn’t want to be there, and maybe even he too was confused by the entire ordeal.\n\nIn the end, would I recommend Kholat? That depends. At $21.99 (currently on sale for $19.79) I wouldn’t. Maybe if the game were to drop to around $10 I’d be happy telling people to pick it up, but I don’t feel comfortable recommending a bare and a non-enjoyable experience like this for that kind of a price-point. Kholat had a solid premise, and some unique concepts but it sort of failed to deliver. It has amazing visuals, and the setting is great but it really just falls flat on delivery.\nPros\n\nAwesome setting, and based off of a spooky real-life event with the Dyatlov Pass Incident.\nGorgeous visuals, and at times can feel really uneasy while traversing through the snow-ridden, blizzard like environments.\nSandbox-ish?\n\nCons\n\nNot much meat to the game. More of a Slender clone by walking around, gathering notes, and avoiding some slow-walking/teleporting entity.\nSean Bean’s narration feels a tad phoned in.\nThe story is extremely convoluted, and the game doesn’t really have any sense of direction.\nThe game is more frustrating then it is fun. The deaths you experience are more so random, and put on a more luck-based feel. Maybe you’ll randomly get killed by the environment with no warning.\nDoesn’t exactly feel like a horror game, and more so feels like an adventure narrative sort of experience in the veins of Dear Esther.\n\nSadly, Kholat just isn’t all that great of a game and for that price-point I’d recommend you check it out if it gets a price drop. I was really excited for Kholat as I’m super into the Dyatlov Pass Incident, but the game didn’t fully utilize what it could of with these events and sort of just falls flat.","June 9, 2015","false","5.4"," 157 of 323 people (49%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","49","157","323","13","11"

Nice to get to play a new horror game with some production behind it... it's been awhile. :D\n\nYou're going to want to check out my review (with game play footage and the very minor spoilers that come with that): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4WLVELKis0\n\nBased on real events, in Kholat you are going to be exploring the icy, snowy Russian wilderness looking for answers regarding what happened to a group of students who died under mysterious circumstances.\n\nPros:\n-Game looks fantastic. Just solid graphics all around and there is some serious visual FX wizardry in this game that make it a lot of fun to explore.\n-Music and SFX are top notch. Holy crap.\n-Some really scary moments. Pretty nice to have for a horror game and all.\n-HUGE map. Tons to see.\n-Freedom to explore where you want, when you want; kind of like the horror version of Skyrim.\n-Great environmental storytelling with narrated notes and such.\n-Not in a mental hospital. A fairly unique setting for this kind of game and it's nice to get some variety.\n\nCons:\n-Non linear gameplay may be a turnoff to folks that want to be thrust into the action/scares\n-The map takes some serious getting used to as it doesn't show your position (but does offer limited fast travel options as you play and find campsites and shows discovered landmarks)\n-Not being able to jump feels limiting\n-Frame rate dropped occasionally when a lot of effects were on the screen at once\n-Died falling into a 2 foot deep pit without much explanation as to why that killed me. Probably because I can't jump making that a death sentence.\n\nAll in all I think you'll have a great time with this game! I can't wait to finish my play through and see how things work out for our mysterious protagonist and learn what happened to the students. :)\n\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a copy of this game for review purposes but was not compensated in any other way.

Seriously the game looks beautiful (especially for an indie open world game). But the most important thing is the gameplay and this game is sadly severely lacking in content. The world is absolutely barren, there is nothing but you and the ocasional shadowy figure which kills you instantly if you come too close. You are no fighter, you even lack the ability to jump, which prevents you from entering areas, which any normal human being should be able to access. The only thing you are allowed to do is collecting diary pages and notes, which gradually unveils the story. Collecting notes is also one of two ways to save the game (the other is fast travel), so it is entirely possible to scout out a large portion of the map without saving only to die and have to do it all over again. Combine this with an absolutely dreadful map system and you have a very irritating game. Yes, you have a map, but it's inefficient at best. It doesn't show your position and you cannot put any notes on it (missed opportunity). Sometimes you find coordinates, which tells you your position. But all this effort just isn't worth it, I ditched the map very quickly and managed relatively fine, I mean the world isn't that big. Way to make a big portion of the game irrelevant.\n\nRunning is as you might have already figured out your main activity in this game. But your stamina is very very low, run for too long and your wision becomes blurry, which forces you to stop. So learning how to sprint in short bursts becomes essential. Let's return to the shadows/ghosts or whatever they are. They are very easy to see, because they leave behind bright orange footsteps. But sneaking around them can be tricky because there is no stealth system, one time I've been hidden in a bush and was detected, other time I stood in plain sight an wasn't detected. So the only thing that triggers their AI is proximity. Keep your distance and they will never be a threat to you. But if you trigger them, you can run away from them, if you react quickly. Hovewer, this usually involves running away from the direction you were going, and you might end up in a completely different area then you wanted to. This is probably the only time, where the coordinates scatered throughout the world will actually come in handy.\n\nSo, we've established that this game doesn't offer too much in the gameplay area, the main focus must be the story. The story, which is told throughout the notes, it ranges from diary pages of the Dyatlov expedition, to insane ramblings which make everything more confusing. Instead of bringing answers, everything you read/witness raises more questions. It does hovewer a decent job describing the Dyatlov incident at the beginning.\n\nLet's sum this up- this game lacks in gameplay, lacks in storytelling, the map system is tedious, the world looks nice but is completely empty. You have to ask yourself, is that worth the asking price?","July 16, 2015","false","3.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Why?\n1. There is only 1 type of monster and he's not scary. Just a see through black figure. This monster is barely anywhere really. You can go on for 15 mins and not find one or find 3 in one spot and have them kill you.\n2. The game is TERRIBLY optimised. Running an amazing rig which can run games with great graphics at consistent-ish 60 fps. This game has terrible fps drops down to 30 even on low settings which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with my 5820k cpu, 16gb ram and 970 gtx.\n3. It's short - most of your time you're just walking really slowly as you can only sprint for about 20 meters which is ridiculous.\n4. The only thing that's truly scary in this game is dying to a non-scary mob and wasting 15 minutes walking back to where you were.\n5. Mapping is terrible. Pretty much everything looks the same.\n6. You can't climb over knee high obstacles and have to spend another 10 mins walking around and getting lost.\n7. You fall through the ground sometimes and die. Waste another 10 mins walking back. This is a bug.\n8. Story makes little sense. It is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ that tries to use catchy cool lines which make no sense.\n9. The narration is great but about half of the papers are not narrated. Devs are so damn cheap they couldn't hire a voice actor for another hour or two. Pathetic scumbags.\n10. You will sometimes walk into a corner and then a monster will spawn next to you and trap you. Another 10-15 mins wasted to walk back.\n11. There is also no quest whatsoever. You just walk around until you decide to see if you just need to follow coordinates to some useless papers with their crappy lore. You are not even sure if you need to be doing it. Just stupid.\n12. You also find these papers in the dumbest places. On walls, on tree stumps and they always make a lot of noise being moved by the wind. Even if they're inside an underground building in a closed room with no wind.\n\nI hope everyone who developed this game and those who upvoted it get rectal cancer.\nShame I can't get my refund as I played it 18 days after I bought it.\nNever trust ♥♥♥♥ing idiots and their steam reviews.

So, I'm writing my first review to save others from making the same mistake I did.\n\nIn Kholat, you spend the majority of time using a map and compass to walk around and explore a snowy, stormy, mountainous landscape, collecting notes and reports and avoiding the Anomaly along the way. If you don't know how to use a compass, it can be tough to navigate, but I had no problem doing so.\n\nI'll start by describing what I liked about the game.  The graphics are incredible. I had some framerate issues at the highest settings, but I turned it down a bit and they went away. The soundtrack is also very good, with some haunting and resonant sounding tunes. Combined with the graphics, the game creates a chilling environment to trek through. I am a huge fan of the Amnesia series. Kholat has ONE similarity to Amnesia: notes scattered about the game, some containing excellent voiceovers. Others have no voiceovers, and are rather long and boring.\n\nNow, on to what I did not like about the game. First, when you start up the game after installing, the first thing you see is the "set brightness" screen, and there is a typo in it. Not a huge deal, but definitely leaving a bad first impression. I thought, "Uh oh, what did I get myself into?" and continued on. There are various other typos in the game, but again, not a huge deal, and obviously an effect of translating into English. Second, the story leaves much to be desired for me. The "open world" structure of the game makes it hard to piece together a tangible, straightforward story from scattered notes and reports. Third, the game was too short. I beat it in about four hours, which is definitely not enough gameplay for me for the price. Fourth, the save structure is baffling. There is no manual save option, so you have to rely on auto saves, which only happen when you pick up a note, discover a camp for the first time, fast travel between already discovered camps, or (sometimes) when you approach an already discovered camp. Fifth, the game design is not conducive to people (like me) who like to collect everything. After beating the game, Continue brings you back to the previous Act, so you can explore and reveal more locations on the map if you wish. However, without spoiling anything, there are loud sounds and ground shakes constantly coming from the center of the map that are annoying and really discourage me to continue playing. So if you DO get the game, I recommend doing all of your exploring BEFORE travelling to all of the major locations listed along the left side of the map. In other words, leave at least one major location undiscovered or you will have to deal with loud sounds and ground shakes for the remainder of your journey.\n\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed Kholat for what it was, but it is simply not worth the money. It definitely creates a chilling overall atmosphere that will unnerve some players, and it was fun getting scared out of my wits and yelling when the Anomaly popped out unexpectedly a few times. But overall, I am disappointed. If you are a fan of the Amnesia series like me, and are looking for a similar experience, I'm sorry to say that you won't find it here. If you want to check out Kholat, I would wait for it to (hopefully) go on sale for at least half off (~$10), or wait for the developers to patch the game and address the various issues I described above.","June 14, 2015","false","5.0"," 11 of 34 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","11","34","0","6"

The game had an awesome set up and a realy interesting mystery to build off of. But instead of taking advantage of that this game feels like a high quality slender clone.\n\nFirst off all you do is walk around an amazing looking enviornment and look for pages or in the case of this game notes, cause thats how the majority of this games story is told. Yeha Shean Bean pops up to sprout a few lines hear and there but thats it. And while im on the subject his performance is on the level of dinkle-bot from destiny\n\nThe slender man is replaced buy some generic monster, He dosent move that fast and is some times shockingly easy to get away from, most of the time. and that brings me to my next gripe the moving/finding your way around the map. lets start with moving.\n\nYou play as a retired defensive linemen cause not only can he only run 10ft at a time before gasping for breath like he just ran the NYC marathon, but he takes forever to "recharge" and be able to sprint again. Now in all honesty its not that long but when your trying to get from one place to the other with hardly anything to see inbetween it can get to be a problem. Infact this is the only reason you die, your sprinting to try and move faster and BAMM Slender Man 2.0 pops up and you cant get away cause you diddnt time your sprint right. Now i know you wouldnt be able to run that far in the snow but then why have a monster your have to run from?\n\nAnd finaly the map....its useless. Theres no way to tell where you are on the map. yeha you got a compass but knowing what direction your pointing dosent mean anything when you dont know where you are. its one of the big problems with dayz and its snaked its way here. Im from the GPS generation and have no clue how to read a map. you gotta be a cartographer.\n\nnow in all honesty i diddnt finish the game but i found no evidence of anything that will make me want to play this to the finish. It has amazing potential and i was looking forward to a real good indie horror hame, but all i got was a bore fest with a bunch of reading and mabye a jump scare once in a while.\n\nThats not to say this game is a complete failure, its not. its got an awesome looking world to explore (even if most of its boring), the sound is A+ and the sound track is killer. its just to bad none of the effort that went into making those great went into the gameplay or the story worth it.\n\nNow if you could get this for five bucks then yes grab it its absolutly worth five bucks, but dont spend 20 on it. from what ive read and what people tell me you can get about 4 hours out of this game and theres alot better games out there that offer alot more for the same and some times less.\n\n\n","June 16, 2015","false","1.2"," 6 of 26 people (23%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","23","6","26","5","0"

Voice acting - I love Sean Bean, he could read it with a mouth full of marbles and I would enjoy it. Music - Incredible.\n\nThat's where the enjoyment ended.\n\nMap - I do not need a moving map with an icon, I am trained to use a lensatic compass and map and identify terrain features to navigate, as part of my job. These guys got it wrong. First of all, checking features in game against roads and hills on maps, they don't match. Also, your compass is turned sideways, noone uses a compass that way. You need your cardinal headings set, as in N straight in front of you always for quickly referencing the map to orientate yourself. I liked the idea of using your own wits to navigate, but you guys missed the mark on this feature.\nSave points too far apart. Not a big deal, but when you can die from falling 10 feet or are killed by a spirit with no warning this becomes a sheer waste of time. There is no learning curve to dying. I could understand if something happened and you learned how to cope with it to continue as a way of playing through, but this is all just random death with the result sending you back 30-45 minutes easily, and I just don't have time for that. Its frustrating, and I dont play games to be frustrated.","June 11, 2015","false","0.1"," 13 of 43 people (30%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","30","13","43","6","3"

The game promises 4 to 6 hours of gameplay. I completed it in 3, collecting everything and exploring every location (yes, there's something i missed as seen via achievements, but this is due to the confusing nature of the map than anything else).\n\nNext up, the art displayed is not anything you'd see during the game, not that there's anything wrong with it, but the art direction could've gone crazier, seeing how good the enviroments are.\n\nNow for the gameplay, it's mostly one of those walking simulators you might remember, and people compare it to Slender a lot, which is pretty true. You sometimes get chased by spooky shadows that you can easily outrun and after an hour or so they become not much of a threat. Sometimes they managed to spawn right in my way and gutted me withot remorse.\n\nThe game itself is really pretty, there's a lot of cool areas, the atmosphere is cold and harsh, powered by Unreal engine it looks incredible most of the time. There are some hiccups though, with the flashlight being perfomance hindering and thing like DoF Blur popping into your face which brings FPS down somehow.\n\nNow for the sad part. As all these games go, the first hour makes you curious and sets up a good premise, with eerie stuff that's going on and overall juxtaposition of alien horrors and harsh, grinded in reality enviroment.\nBut then as you collect the notes and articles that hype you up, you're only going to be let down. Maybe it was the path that i chose to explore the map, that put me through some of the best parts of the game first, but the story started to fall apart pretty fast. With things built up and never getting any closure it's not clear if even the devs made up their mind as to what's actually going on and what role the protagonist or the Sean Bean (Who's not narrating a lot, i might add. Certainly not enough to placate this fact as a selling point) play in this. The premise was cool and uncovering that, or even seeing the glimpse of the horrors described in the notes would've been way better.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing special, you go around collecting notes and sprinting around from scripted dangers, you can crouch but can't jump, and it really unveils the level design being way more linear that it seems at first\nThere are no survival mechanics that could've made this more of a game, and your main enemy will be your map.\n\nWas it art? Not really.\nWas it an exciting videogame? Not really.\nIs it a great story? Not really.\nIs 3 hours of gameplay a good amount of content for 20 bucks? Not really.\n\nWas it the most terrifying journey of my life? Definitely not.\n\nIf you're itching for some chilling Soviet horror, coupled with the possibility of actually freezing to death, get Cryostasis, a way better game in almost every way.","June 10, 2015","false","3.2"," 30 of 82 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","30","82","0","0"

Wind blows past your ears; snow falls in varying degrees of intensity, sometimes robbing your sight; mysterious beings howl in the distance; an old bridge creaks dangerously when you walk over it...\nAnd whenever you find certain notes you'll witness a paranormal phenomenon that is certainly worth witnessing ... which is something that I cannot say about the rest of the game.\n\nThe incident it's based on is already the most interesting aspect of the entire story, whereas most of the notes I found told me nothing of importance. Some are written by the people who died, some by a guy who tried to find out what happened, and then there are theories trying to explain the incident. Once in a while, you will also hear Sean Bean's character calling out to you, mentioning things that happened long ago. He seems to have some plans for the nameless protagonist … but when the game fades to black only a minute into the final act, you will be none the wiser, as the game doesn't really try to explain anything ... or have a resolution ... or anything that could be called an ending.\n\nIs the gameplay worth it, at least? No, not when you spend most of the time walking around aimlessly, always hoping to find whatever it is that the coordinates on your map are meant to signify. Sure, you might say that feeling lost is kinda the point, but not when it's so annoying that you'd rather stop playing than trudge on endlessly.\n\nIt could have been less annoying if the map was actually useful, but unless you're standing in front of a camp (which serves as a fast-travel-point), you'll have no idea where the hell you are. And even then you might have trouble charting your course. And if you happen to run into a monster (none of which are scary) and haven't found a camp or note in a while, then you're going to be screwed, as there are no manual saves. The first time it happened (when I didn't even know that enemies existed), I had to start over from the other side of the map.\n\nTherefore, I can only recommend Kholat to those who like to explore the beautiful environment. Everyone else will be sorely disappointed by the lack of interesting gameplay or a story worth following.","June 9, 2015","false","6.9"," 37 of 114 people (32%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","32","37","114","4","0"

It's not going to be around much longer (victory is near!).  I've gotten alot of notes, reports and journals but might finish the game with a few missed, although I think I've gotten enough out of the story.  Also have all but one tent location it seems.  Anyways, time for a review!\n\nThis is a pretty solid survival/adventure game.  Kholat is somewhat creepy, tense and grinding because of the atmosphere, constant snow and chase sequences.  It does have a couple of good jumps and a few areas are downright intense because you're racing against time to keep out of the clutches of an instant death mist that's chasing you.  So the gist of the gameplay is that you're running around on a snow-covered mountain where things aren't as they seem and a bunch of supernatural goings on are occuring trying to piece the a story together by collecting as much written information as you can.  The last folks that traversed this mountainous impasse didn't make it back alive to tell their story.\n\nThe game isn't flawless that's for sure, but I enjoyed alot of it.  It's like a point and click adventure with light elements of Amnesia and Outlast, because you can die and you will die as you trial n' error your way to each key location.  The game is immersive enough that you really feel like you're lost in the mountains, freezing to death and all around completely ******.  After some frustration I was able to successfully use the map to figure out where I was at and where I needed to go.  You basically gather your bearings at different base camps before setting out on the next hunt for reports, diaries and journals.  Along the way you will traverse mountains, valleys, forests, stumble on a few signs of where life once was and encounter numerous one hit obstacles that will render you dead,\n\nThe graphics and atmosphere are great.  This game grinds in much of the way that the highly underrated Cursed Mountain did and feels a bit like John Carpenter's The Thing.  The landscapes are beautiful to behold and even though the map is not quite as huge and daunting as you initially think, there's a good sense of vastness and scope that really puts you into the heart of adventure.  The story unfolds in semi-confusing bits of prose narrated by Sean Bean, a female actor and yourself.  Due to the difficulty of travel, there is a sense of accomplishment when you successfully reach new locations and landmarks, and even though the pace is a ruthless slow burn, it's dangerous and fun.  The map/compass system is challenging.  As a dogged old school gamer I figured it out with no videos, walkthroughs or otherwise and it took me time.  This game makes you feel lost, isolated and generally f*cked but the more you play and discover things, the more the map fills in and becomes easier to navigate.\n\nSound design deserves a special mention here because it's probably creepier than the actual evil spirits you're up against.  You will hear different cues providing clues to what situations, discoveries and key locations are nearby.  As I first played the game I found myself running everytime I heard one of these sounds thinking I was about to be attacked.  Eventually, I figured out that these were things I was supposed to stop and take notice of, so keep your ears open while playing this one (not just for monsters!).  Never before in a game did I get friggen excited over the sound of a rustling piece of paper, but Kholat makes you yearn for minute pleasures.  These cues also provide the location of game saving tents and I had no crashes or problems in terms of saving (knock on wood) 5 hours into the game thus far.  Though glitches do occur.\n\nUnfortunately, Kholat is not without its negatives.  While the save system wasn't a problem for me and was just spaced out enough for my liking, prepare for some cheap deaths.  As an adventurer, I think it was a little bit silly that you couldn't jump.  I do understand that not being able to jump made travel more difficult, but it was somewhat nagging when you couldn't hurdle a two foot ledge.  I died a decent amount during Kholat.  Sometimes warranted and sometimes very cheaply.  I stepped on a ghosts head that was stuck in the ground because of a glitch, died descending ledges that the game didn't want you to go down and ended up dead because the game would be playing smoothly one minute with alot going on and lagging like hellfire the next.  Though I never lost large amounts of progress, there are certainly some ludicrous things that will kill you, so prepare to do things over a few times even if the cause of your demise was completely out of your control.\n\nThough some runs for key story pages are tense and exciting (the forest), the enemies are kinda stupid.  There is no stealth system whatsoever to avoid them.  They killed me far away and out of sight, chased me to the ends of areas and other irritating stuff.  You can stun them with your flashlight, but it's never worth it.  The spirits don't provide too many problems and can be easily avoided the majority of the time, yet other times you will die at their hands while cursing the very mountain you're climbing.  They weren't a particularly interesting opponent either and sometimes were so stupid they wouldn't bother you if you walked by them right in their field of view.  The whole system was somewhat poorly implemented in my opinion and definitely a major buzzkill on the tension.  A few other cheap one hit kills will take you down.  For example, I got hit by the same falling rock 3 times a row, and whether I'd wait, rush or run, the game would lag up and I'd get killed.  I passed that part by luck and luck alone.  Thankfully, none of this stuff puts you so far backwards that it's game-breaking, just rather cheap, laggy and poorly conceived.\n\nThe story is solidly narrated but is mostly confusing.  Those hammy diatribes and goofy bits of poetry don't make much sense even if Bean did a good job with the narration.  It just doesn't make alot of sense and I found myself less involved with what was going on with each passing journal page instead of becoming more intensely engrossed.  Despite the story being rather overblown and not so well-written, the desire to push on and see what location is ahead more than made up for the yarn not pulling the gamer in as much as it should.\n\nOverall, Kholat has been an enjoyable experience and I'm looking forward to wrapping it up either later tonight or tomorrow.  I don't think the couple of things left to do would change my score drastically, because I know endings are not usually all they're cracked up to be and it's the gameplay itself that concerns me.  Did I have fun playing Kholat?  Yes.  Was it a perfect game?  No.  Will I pick it up a second time fro the beginning?  No.  But do I regret spending the money?  No, not at all!  A good horror themed game for players that would rather the scares come from the atmosphere than a bunch of silly jump-gimmicks.  Pure adventure fans might find it worth a look as well.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\nPros:\n\n-Excellent graphics\n-Sound design is not only top-notch but important for gameplay\n-Solid voice acting\n-Overbearing sense of dread and isolation like a good horror flick\n-Exploration is mostly fun\n-Cool compass/map system (You really do feel like you're lost and trying to find your way)\n-Some solid set-pieces and chase sequences\n\nCons\n-Laggy gameplay can lead to cheap deaths\n-Boring enemies with awful AI will either stupidly ignore you or murder you ruthlessly\n-Muddled story\n-Could use more actions (jump, climb)\n-Limited tasks/objectives leads to some tedium late game\n-No stealth system when stealth is part of your mission\n\nOveral rating:  7.5/10","September 7, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is purely a horrific adventure of discovery, which I did enjoy, but felt some simple yet brain twisting environmental puzzles would have made the beautiful and chilling environment even more intimate, and would have slowed down the pace of the gameplay while also making it more dynamic.\n\nEnemies (or I should say enemy) could have also used some dynamism. Once the enemy is aware of you, there's really no getting away or hiding unless you just keep sprinting as much as you can until you get even more lost. I did like that you couldn't fight the enemy and that getting away was difficult, but encountering them would have been much more interesting if I had more opportunities to hide.\n\nLastly, there were some missed opportunities in the environment itself. There are a few wonderful scripted moments when you walk up to an abandoned radio tower, a burnt forest, a rotting church, but when you get to these awesomely dark scenes you just grab the note and get the hell out of there - I wanted to spend more time in these places (*cough* environmental puzzles *cough*).\n\nPeople complain about the compass and map in this game, but I think this is one of its most immersive qualities and an impressive way to bring a subtle level of strategy and skill into the game - I wanted more elements like this!\n\nOverall I felt this was a great survival horror experience and was well worth the price, but could have been a legendary survival horror experience if more elements of the game were developed, like the absence of environmental puzzles and more ways of dealing with the game's enemy.","August 23, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a rather interesting few hours of gameplay, and the developers delivered on every point that they advertise in the description.

It's a brilliant game concept, and probably a good way to fill a stormy Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn some ways, it fell a little flat. There was very little in the sense of true danger. A typical encounter with an "Anomaly" is more akin to accidentally bumping into a rather aggressive stranger on public transit than to a terrifying paranormal experience. I felt more inclined to apologize for invading its personal space than to run away.

What more could you want?\n\nThis game is fairly unique, The aim is to find your way around the snow covered Dyatlov Pass and find clues about what actually happened. You are only armed with a compass and map and there are very little indicators on where you actually are, So prepare to get alittle lost which really only adds to the immersion of this game. The horror element is more of a Amnesia/Penumbra style of something following you rather then the typical jump scares, It's not too over the top either more just a constant feeling of nervousness.\n\nI did enjoy this game and would recommend it however it only has a couple hours of gameplay unless you are deadset on finding all the notes scattered throughout the game. Also I felt the enemies seemed somewhat "dozey" as they seem to have no situational awareness leaving you able to just bolt it straight past them and keep running in most cases, So unless you sit there flashing your torch at them they dont usually see you and leave the game feeling a bit easy. Nevertheless a decent game but would recommend getting it as long as it's on sale.","December 27, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got pretty excited when I found out that it had voice over by Sean Bean AND sweet graphics. I went into it pretty hyped up... maybe a bit too much.\n\nThe game is gorgeous and the sound design is even better. Kholat's presentation is what really shines. You walk around the frozen mountains of Russia by yourself at night when you know something terrible happened, something is out there. It really got to me at first.\n\nWhat is not so shiny, however, is the gameplay... it's too simplistic. It's basically a "walking simulator" in witch you explore a huge open environement picking up letters and files to figure out the story. It also has a bit of stalking monsters and those are the weakest part of the game. Their AI is less than impressive and it really hurts the experience. They're so simple in their patterns that it took me out of it. It probably would have been a more solid experience if they had been removed or if there was an option to do it.\n\nI still really liked it.

But if Ethan Carther gives you a sunlit valley, Kholat throws you into an anomaly zone in the dark night.\nYou hae a compass and a map, but your position on it is not shown, so the main experience is getting lost again and again, with rare occasions of running or hiding from monsters. It is interesing for a while, but after you see the same place for a tenth time, understanding that you're moving in circles, but having no ide how to get to the place you want, your ultimate reaction is boredom.

It was on my wishlist for months, waiting for me to free up from other games. Once I finally played it, I was so excited to watch the suprisingly good intro video and so shocked to realize the game takes a nose dive after that.\n\nI have no idea why the game was so inticing when watching videos on YouTube, perhaps it's the "cooperative" nature of watching someone play. This game, as others have pointed out, is truly open world. Don't get me wrong - open world is fine for some games where you discover new equipment, quests, and characters. Kholat does none of these. You simply walk around and look at things. Again - don't think this can't be done well (look at the excellent Dear Ester), but Khloat simply mysteriously lacks atmosphere. Real life mystery? Check. Snowstorm? Check. Nighttime? Check. Monsters? Check. Yet...this game makes you feel no dread. You don't have to hide and you don't have to get your character to safety. You simply walk.\n\nOn the bright side, as I said earlier the intro video is a good summation of the real life mystery and the visuals of the game are pretty great. I would recommend Kholat only as a novelty, or to someone who truly, truly wants to play this type of game.","January 10","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a shame because the graphics and visual effects were really good.\nthe scare and horror factor wasn't that great either. Although some parts and moments may creep you out, if you're playing alone at night in the dark.\n\nBut if you like games where it's a big open world and you have to figure everything out with minimal resources and unfold the story as you progress with minimal hints, then this game is for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dansrodriguez/recommended/343710/","dansrodriguez","Dans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dansrodriguez/","12 products in account","Kholat is a survival horror game based on true events that took place in Russia decades ago, when hikers were found dead for unknown reasons. The game begins without further introductions to its lead character, whose identity or motivation are never revealed during the game. Then, Kholat turns into a mountain hiking game as we take such mysterious character to find some notes spread on the mountain are - that's the best part of the game. The scenarios look stunning and the sound effects, plus the great musical score creates one hell of an atmosphere. It's possible to walk for a long time and get completely lost amidst all the snow and rocks; the game is truly disorienting, which increases the immersion. Also, considering the player has to get through everything using only a map and a compass (which I never figured out how to use), it makes for a very challenging experience, but very fun nonetheless.\n\nEach note found, reveals a little (very little) more about what has been happening in the region during the last century, including the real life event. The supernatural elements are heavily based on Lovecraft - people dreaming about a powerful, nightmarish being from another dimension and going insane - however, the in game supernatural elements are completely random and off tone with the rest of the game. The shadows, who are the main 'enemies' on the game, have no pattern at all. Sometimes you can just sprint next to them and poof, he's gone. Besides of the lack of coherence when it comes about the supernatural elements, the invisible barriers were the most annoying bits of Kholat. There are lots of moments when you are forced to walk a lot to find a new way, when the character could have easily jumped a rock, a feat which clearly any average human being would have been to pull off. Except the protagonist of Kholat.\n\nThe game lenght is very short - it took me around 6 hours to finish it getting almost every note (missed a few). But the truth is, if you don't feel like mountain hiking and being scared by wolves (wolves were the scariest part of the game, even though they only howl and never show up), this game might be really boring. I recommend it but with some reservations.\n\n7/10 (Good)","January 3","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/recommended/343710/","GameReviewsAU","GRAU","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameReviewsAU/","44 products in account","Have you ever heard of the story behind a group of missing Russian students in the Northern Ural Mountains of Russia? Based on a true story, Kholat delves into the chilling story of those missing students. Filled with horror, the supernatural, and incredibly unnerving environments; Kholat takes you on a crazy journey that’ll leave you questioning why the hell you decided to play it at night time with only a lamp to light up your small room…\n\nFor those loyal GameReviewsAU fans out there, you’ll probably have learnt we like games that genuinely freak us out rather than ones that rely on jump-scares.\n\nKholat does a great job of being genuinely freaky by placing you in the middle of a relentless blizzard with only a map, compass and torch to help you get around. There are jump-scares, but because they’re so spaced out, you’re always left unprepared for what is waiting for you around the bend.\n\nBackstory\nFor gamers out there who don’t know the events that transpired in those freezing Ural Mountains, here’s a little excerpt taken from Wikipedia.\n\nThe incident involved a group of nine experienced ski hikers from the Ural Polytechnical Institute who had set up camp for the night on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl. Investigators later determined that the skiers had torn their tents from the inside out. They fled the campsite, probably to escape an imminent threat. Some of them were barefoot, under heavy snowfall. The bodies showed signs of struggle; Dyatlov had injuries to his right fist, as if he had been in a fist fight. One victim had a fractured skull and another was found with brain damage without any sign of distress to the skull. One of the skull fractures was so severe it was determined that he would not have been able to move. Additionally, one woman’s tongue was missing. Soviet authorities determined that an “unknown compelling force” had caused the deaths; access to the region was consequently blocked for hikers and adventurers for three years after the incident. – Dyatlov Pass Incident: Wikipedia[en.wikipedia.org]\n\nSounds pretty damn scary right? To this day, no one knows what happened up there. So here’s where the creative minds at IMGN.PRO join up to give us a truly spine-chilling experience in Kholat.\n\nCompass – Check, Map – Check, Torch – Check\nArmed with only a map, compass and torch you are tasked with exploring the massive area where the tragedy occurred and finding out what happened to the missing students. One of the best parts of Kholat is that the exploration is completely non-linear. You can go wherever you want at any point of the game. So long as you can read a map that is.\n\nOn your map are sets of co-ordinates. These indicate places of interest in the mountains such as camp sites. Other such places of interest can be found purely by chance or by finding extra co-ordinates that have been etched into the side of rocks. These co-ordinates can take you to notes that document diary entries by the students, reports of supernatural occurrences and the like.\n\nYour compass is a bit pointless I found. As for one: I couldn’t work out which end of the needle was North or South, and two being that you can work out where you are with the map by itself.\n\nIn Kholat, there is no mini-map. There is no marker saying “You are here”. All you have is a map with highlighted paths drawn to show you which parts of the mountain are accessible. Only once you’ve found a place of interest will it appear on your map for reference.\n\nYou also have a survival guide that gives you some suggestions on how best to navigate the treacherous environment, as well as being a place to record previously found diary entries, reports, logs etc.\n\nHowever, the survival guide can be a bit misleading. For example, the guide suggests, “Before setting off for a longer journey, rest in the camp“. Reading this made me think there must be some kind of stamina system which requires you to rest at a campsite before being able to set off again. That wasn’t the case though, as you can journey around the entire map without needing a single rest apart from regaining your breath after a sprint. Instead, what the campsites do is act as fast-travel points.\n\nSprinting is quite limited and, if you use sprint to it’s full extent, will leave you moving very slowly and not being able to see clearly. Therefore you really need to use sprint scarcely in case you get chased by anything.\n\nWhat chases you? I still don’t know but they’re scary b*stards! They look like shadowy figures that walk around in the dark and leave behind glowing orange footprints. If you get too close, they’ll give chase and not stop until you’ve either outrun them, or they catch you and end your life. Sound effects alert you to when there’s one nearby, and also if it’s started chasing you, or disappeared because you outran it.\n\nThere’s no way to defeat them because you are completely unarmed except for a torch. “Maybe the torch can shine some light on what they are?” I hear you ask. Nope… Shine the torch on them and they’ll get slightly annoyed. Well not really slightly, more like p*ssed off to the extent that they chase and kill you.\n\nAesthetic Charm\nKholat is powered by Unreal Engine 4, giving us incredibly high quality graphics. For an environment that is completely covered by a blizzard you’d think there’s not much point to be so detailed, but IMGN.PRO have done an incredible job with giving us such an HD mountain to explore!\n\nSound-wise, the howling blizzard screaming all round you whilst in the mountains never becomes repetitive and keeps your ears pricked up for other sounds, such as rustling paper, which indicates a note is nearby.\n\nSean Bean even makes an appearance as the narrator of the story. Every now and then you’ll reach an area where Sean pipes in with his two cents worth of narration. It’s very comforting to hear a familiar voice when you’re up to your knees in snow at a place where a group of people went nuts. But his words aren’t very comforting…\n\nFinal Thoughts\nKholat is a true adventure game, placing you in a deserted mountain with only a map, compass and torch. I love that you don’t have a minimap because it forces you to use your noggin and work out where you are with only the few tools at your disposal.\n\nFinishing Kholat one hundred percent will take around four to six hours depending on how generous you are with sprinting. There’s a good lot of achievements to unlock, so completionists may take an extra hour or so finding out how to unlock them.\n\nI absolutely love the graphics, sound effects and narration by Sean Bean and had an absolute blast sh*tting myself by playing at midnight with little light source. I can’t wait to get back in and find the rest of the hair-raising reports to get a better idea of what transpired during the Dyatlov Pass Incident.\n\nRead the full review[gamereviewsau.com]","March 26","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebeanregime/recommended/343710/","thebeanregime","The Bean Regime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebeanregime/","346 products in account","Just take a gander at my avatar. Then my name. Is there any question as to why I would be interested in such a game?\n\nOn top of that, I am quite a fan of horror games, and atmosphere is key to their success. So when an atmospheric horror game narrated by Sean Bean comes along, well, my knees go weak.\n\nNo, the entire thing wasn’t going to rhyme. What a senseless review that would be.\n\nAlright, so step one, how is its atmosphere? It is very well done. I’ve had some of the biggest jumps I’ve had in a considerable amount of time playing this game, and that can directly be attributed to the atmosphere. It builds up a slow anticipation at nearly all times due to a wonderful use of sounds and environment, until, like a spring, the tension snaps and you jump. Now, would I call it scary? Not quite. Moreso chilling. Heh. Cause it's cold. But really, it doesn't make you feel like Amnesia, Outlast, or other such good games make you feel. Those games, I could only get a maximum of 30 minutes (and often much less) before I'd just have to stop and take a break.\n\nThe voice acting was good, not great. Well, except for Sean Bean. I didn’t feel as if the sense of dread or horror were adequately portrayed in some of the acting. They sounded almost calm when talking about fear and losing their minds.\nThe gameplay isn’t anything new. I never liked the term “walking simulator” but this is the type of game that will get that term. You find notes left behind and campfires (which you can fast travel between. Didn’t know that for the first half of the game. More walking. Yay!) that slowly uncover the story. So if you’re thinking “well, that’s nothing new,” you’re absolutely right! And if you ever played Amnesia a Machine for Pigs or SOMA, you’ll be delighted (not) to find that this game too flashes your flashlight when an enemy is near (and jiggles the compass). Why, oh why does this exist. Please stop implementing this awful feature into horror games. I cannot fathom why anyone thinks it’s a good idea. “Oh, you know sounds you’re hearing? They mean nothing. Nope, still nothing. Oh hey, now somethings there! Quick, run!” It definitely lessened the experience.\n\nI didn’t want a huge paragraph, so here’s a new one. One last gameplay mechanic I wanted to mention, and that is the navigation. You have a map and a compass that you can use to navigate the world. Use them. Don’t wander aimlessly.\n\nThe story was alright. It was based on a real incident. Not too memorable. What was it about again? Ghosts?\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game. The other reviewers seem to have taken much longer, and I wonder why. Was it poor navigation? Did they replay it, and to what end? I don’t see any replay value with the game, unless it unknowingly unlocked a new mode. Or perhaps they wanted all of the achievements.\n\nBut yes, overall, good, not great. Stupid idiotic flashing light.","March 30","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are on your own type game I hope you can learn latitude and longitude, I never learnt someone needs to teach me!!...yep guess im boned!\n6) Oh ya Sean Bean is the Narrator and  who doesn't love sean bean!!! I want your dam game of thrones sword!! Tywin lannister shoulda never melted that ♥♥♥♥ down!\n\nI will edit this as I need to but so far the game is a quest into the imagination of humanity..time travel,teleportation,and ones very own soul!!!...Overall a great game worth the price and was, spooky, fun, and a relaxing game all in one...peace","April 20","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A great horror game based on a true story that unfolds as you collect items throughout your quest for truth.  You will feel your avatar be sucked into his own madness, and you may begin to ask yourself the same questions.  Feel the fear, the uncertainty, the horror.\n9.7/10","May 2","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it works very well.\n\nYes, in places it gets a little frustrating when you truly have no clue what to do next, but it's a rare game I've enjoyed without having the answers spoonfed.\n\nIn terms of the story, it's complex - there are answers, but they too aren't spoonfed - you have to decide for yourself what happened based on how you interpret the journals.\n\nThe ending itself is poor - pure and simple - it makes little sense and is a bit of a cop out, but the flesh was in all the stuff in between and there's where you can build the picture from.\n\nOn a technical level, Kholat makes beautiful use of UE4 - it's a stunning looking game for an Indie title, not unlike Ethan Carter, also UE3 and 4. It does struggle in places with poor optimisation (1080P occasionally stuttered on 980Ti SLI) but it's forgiveable.\n\nYou'll play worse games than this, just don't expect it all wrapped up in a nice bow for you.","May 20","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
