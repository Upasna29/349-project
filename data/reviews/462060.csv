I didn't even think it was possible.  But in its present state, it's worse than a Digital Homicide game.\n\n- Only 3 actions: left, right, left-click to fire (all using mouse).\n- Cannot change controls without third party program or scripting.\n- 1 single board/map.  The one in the pictures.  For every level.\n- Same 3 enemies that walk swinging their arms back and forth. For every level.\n- Speed of game slows to a crawl in later levels, without very high system specs.\n- Bullet range also decreases in later levels, due to same issue.  More Info\n- Utterly monotonous game-play.\n- Building one single wall is the only defense measure.\n- Cannot buy weapons.  They are dropped randomly, with very limited ammo.\n- Cannot buy weapon upgrades.  They don't exist.\n- Achievements are all obtainable by merely finishing the game.\n- Non-responsive "team" of dev's.\n\nThis video shows a late level at which point the game has slowed to a crawl.  The earlier stages are on the same board, same enemies, and just a little bit more fun to play.\n\nThis[imgur.com] describes my thoughts on "What The Developers Have To Say", using as little snarkiness as I could muster.\n\nIt is currently on sale for 4% off (seriously?).  In its present state, it's not worth 4 cents.\n\nI will update this review if anything improves.

First things first: It's somekind of wave based tower defense top-down shooter. Your only aim is to earn fast money for the 50k achievement. Build a simple wall and repair it instantly when the aliens are munching it down. You (the green trooper on the bottom screen) and your 2 turrets should keep on shooting permanently. Though the sound of shots is unbearable. Before you start searching the buggy menus, you can just mute the sound for the whole game at windows volume control.  The in-game controls are also horrible. You move left-right over mouse movement. Very bad if you have to go everytime to the right menu for the wall repair button. Powerups pickup over right mouse button. Anyways they will remain just for 5 secs. After 9 waves the game has official ended (last wave). But then starts the grinding part for the 50k. Haven't found a way to restart and keep your money (buggy menus). With 50k finally you can upgrade your walls and base (turrets) to max and you are done. I wouldn't play it any longer.","May 10","false","1.7"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/462060/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1843 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USRREdSFi3I\n\nBase Squad 49, also known as Base Square 49 on its Steam Greenlight page, is a newly released budget title on Steam from developer/publisher Arthur Kariev, his debut creation. The trailer for this latest Unity lane defense style action game didn't quite make it appear anything all that engaging to the player, speaking more to those looking for some quick achievements and trading cards for resale or badge purposes. That said, it could still be a fun little romp if the execution is done well. So, does this one do just that and make itself worth of that dollar, or is it better left sitting in the digital budget garbage bin?\n\nBase Squad 49 pits you against hordes of demons trying to break into your base. You are armed only with a pistol and two slow firing turrets atop it, both upgradeable. As you grind away, you collect cash for all shots that hit the oncoming horde, all of which carries over every time you restart. The goal is to manage these funds towards building sturdier walls and fortifying your base's weaponry to stand a better chance. While the walls and guns are simple enough to unlock once you reach a certain wave, the base unlocks don't seem to become available. The second said I needed to reach level eight, but I was on level twenty-four.\n\nWhile the weapon upgrades are straight forward to unlock, they are pretty much trash. You only get a minimal amount of ammo for them, often being just ten shells, which replenish every wave, or by replenishing from the ammo button on the top right of the screen. You can acquire a chain gun from right clicking the giant gold stars from enemy drops, similar to picking up bonus cash in wooden crates with a question mark on them. Sadly, it only lasts a few seconds, much like the initial first wall you build. In order to really survive early on, you need to constantly repair that wall, making it seem like building up a stockpile of money before even doing so is the best idea to combat having to navigate your character to attack and initiating the repairs at the same time, which is just infuriating.\n\nAnd then there's the hit detection issue. It's unclear to me if this is intentional or not, but a number of bullets just seem to whiz through your foes instead of making contact and causing damage, adding to the stress of having to grind to survive for any extended period of time even more infuriating. Thankfully a simple auto clicker program pointed to the right spot on the screen will save you hours of sitting there watching the demons destroy your base over and over, allowing you a chance to get up and do something more with your life. Of course, when you actually build a wall, the bullets seem to make contact even less, allowing the hordes to reach/destroy it insanely quick. Even the smallest of foes seem to take a minimum of seven hits to take down, which wouldn't be so bad if they didn't reach the base so damn quick in the first place.\n\nOther than that, the graphics just look terrible, the sound effects are stock or stolen (the shotgun sounds like it was ripped straight out of the original Doom game) and the enemy movements are laughable. Then there's the frame rate issues, as all your foes leave blood behind when they die. The more blood on screen, the more it lags, requiring a computer with much higher powered hardware than what's listed on the store page. Even if you do have anything better (like I do), you'll still find your rig struggling to keep up, dropping from a steady thirty frames per second all the way down to nine by the time I reached the point of not caring, which just so happened to be wave twenty-four. That was also about fifteen more waves than the game's score allowed as it seemed to end by the ninth (though this includes times I had to restart) and I was left with silence a good majority of the time. It was a problem until the wall was maxed out, the frame rate plunged further into the depths of hell, and walking away for five, ten minutes became a possibility without killing my character and losing my progress.\n\nEven for an early access title, Base Squad 49 is just too simplistic and buggy, not to mention oversights like "Wall title" or "Base title" showing text from a template that was probably from a prebuilt Unity asset Arthur probably forgot to remove before publishing. For ninety-nine cents, no, you can't always expect anything great, and this one proves that train of thought. It's boring, incredibly repetitive, and has no actual sense of completion given how it slows down and almost forces the gamer to lose interest and quit before any sort of resolution or pinnacle for bragging rights can be met. Hell, even Digital Homicide's use of assets from the Unity marketplace offer up some sort of overall value to their titles as of late that makes replaying them appealing to gamers looking for a quick playthrough here and there. If a flip isn't exacty the case for Base Squad 49 and it was largely programmed by hand, then this title needs a lot of work before it'll become at all enjoysble, and by that I mean scrapping the original coding entirely and building from the ground up again.\n\nDigital review copy of this release provided by personal funds.","May 3","false","3.3"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","30","42","7","14"

On the default configuration the enemies go so fast that finishing the first level is technically impossible. If you change the configuration to get less FPS, the game is an automatic win since the AI turrets are enough to kill all the enemies. This is not a problem just on my side, the forums have many threads about it. Then as you keep advancing levels, the blood splatters pile up and your FPS starts tanking, eventually making the enemies extremely slow and your weapon range extremely short.\n\nThere's another annoying bug that happens sometimes when you die, I'm not sure when it happens but I think it's after a certain number of levels. You will press the "Continue" button but immediately die again before any enemy appears being again in front of the "Continue" button in an endless cycle.\n\nWhy awful?\nThe whole game consists of you pressing the left mouse button at all times and simply moving slightly to one side or the other to kill the enemies. Enemies are all the same except they have 3 different speeds. All levels in the game are exactly the same as the first level. Killing enemies gives money that can be used to buy upgrades: a wall and a few different weapons.\n\nThat's all the game. It's one of those games that would be okay as a free flash game, but not as something sold on Steam.","May 17","false","3.2"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

I'll go through the list of descrepancies as I played through this deathmarch:\n\n#1) There were times when monsters didn't spawn at all yet I kept advancing through stages without even lifting a finger.\n#2) Character can slide completeley off screen for some odd reason....\n#3) The awful music loops for 30-60 seconds before it just stops playing altogether.\n#4) The upgrade buttons are a hit or a miss. Either you can interact with them or you can't. (Your results may vary between uses)\n#5) To purchase weapons you also need money which you get from killing monsters kinda hard to do when no monsters spawn (See descrepancy #1)\n#6) Title is just confusing not sure if this game is called Base Square or Base Squad. It's misspelled from page to page so I'm not sure\n#7) For that matter what squad are they talking about? For 27 levels it was one guy dancing between to gun turrets.\n#8) Awful design choice as you progress through the higher levels, your weapon range gets nerfed every level advanced.\n\nBy the time I got to level 27 the weapon range of my turrets and personal side arm barely reached my barriers. At that level you basically have to fight without barriers just to engage the enemy. And when the turrets shoot at an angle the range gets even shorter somehow. It's like the game is just trolling you after you get pass level 19. Level 20 should just be called trolling stage 1. Enemy speed is just laughably slow. I literally had enough time to go up stairs get some juice, heat up some food in the microwave, take a leak, wash my hands and come back down only to realize my turrets had just now engaged in the first wave of enemies.\n\nHow in the f*** did this hot mess of a game get greenlit to begin with? Even if the game was free it would still be awful choice to play. Heck this game is so awful and boring, it could give Time Ramesside (A New Reckoning) and Day One: Garry's Incident two of the most negatively reviewed games ever a run for their money in how awful it is. Again this is just another clear cut case of UEA (Unity Engine Abuse). There's a difference between an early access game and a game that's just not ready at all. This definitely falls in the latter category. 18 months of development produced this? Yikes...","May 8","false","1.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","12","12","4","0"

First the game never explains anything at all. It just opens a screen with a top camera over what I'm guessing is some kind of wall with 2 canons on top (one on each side of the screen) and some weird square between them. Then there is this green guy, which by the way is you, and you need to use him to shoot monsters that are coming at you. I didn't get too far because I was bored prety quick but someone said there are 3 kinds of those monsters...\nAfter a few seconds you find out you use your mouse to move around the top of the wall (by movind the mouse left and right) and to fire (by clicking).

Which you often have to do if it gets into an infinite loop of immediate failure pressing "restart"\nNo clue how to buy weapons, buy a simple wall and become invernable by just repairing it with a click. Longer session go super-slow and your turrets (and own gun!) cannot even hit enemies anymore.\nGood luck getting that 50K money achiev with the game reset, failure loop and if you do use a longer game, extreme slowdown.\nUpgrading base goes gradually, but stuck on "unlocks on level 8" even if 12+ (clicking it does substract money, and got an  achiev). You can skip wall progression straight to the top (buying inbetween doesn't lower cost so is generally worthless), although apparently the upper one did take money to repair. Can get full wall achiev (got that) without half-wall achiev (don't have that).\n\nThis game is a mess, don't buy it.","June 5","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
