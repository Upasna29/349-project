To clarify:\n\nYes. It's a roguelike. You start out without any passive or active abilities, and you have to "learn" them as you re-live your life.\n\nI started the game in normal mode, and made it down to floor 59. That's almost half way to the bottom on my first go-around. That's unheard of in most roguelikes.\n\nThe battle system and enemies lack any particular flair. Called shots make things interesting, but there's not really a point if there's no advantage in hitting a specific area. Yes, striking a monster in the head will cause more damage than the torso, but why not have a chance to stun or blind? The same goes for limbs: why not a chance to decrease enemy strength or cause accuracy to fall?\n\nMissing the ability to equip your character with any sort of armor was confusing. It definitely made things less interesting when it came to decisions about what I would attempt to upgrade.\n\nFinding food and health objects is not necessarily difficult. The first time I decided to head back to the VIP room was because I wanted to see about crafting a weapon. I didn't even know that you could use the bed to rest and trade food for health. Strangely, sleeping off your injuries isn't really a great deal compared to just exploring a few floors to find some more health items.\n\nThe crafting system is more interesting for sure. As you progress in the weapons you can make, things get even easier.\n\nThe mechanic of entering a room and clicking on objects became boring and repetative. Coming upon a locked door didn't really make me frustrated, because I knew I was only missing out on the contents of a single room.\n\nControl boxes found on some floors require tampering to ensure that power goes to the floors below. I found this the most interesting aspect because it was the only challenging question I had to deal with: do I want to try fixing this thing? The answer was always "yes", and it felt like 50% of the time I could do it on the first shot. I never attempted to use an item to fix the panel. It seemed like a waste of time.\n\nItem drops are notably sparse aside from basics like food and health. A weapon above a basic killing implement was never dropped during my game. That is to say - I had a few weapons drop, but they were far surpassed by the things I had already created for myself.\n\nNo, I did not give this a whole shake. Yes, I only played for about two hours. No, I don't want to continue playing - the game is boring, and I have better things to do with my time.\n\nOh, a few positives - the voice acting in memoirs left behind seemed to be mildly engaging. Unfortunately, grasping the full scope of the situation was not something I really felt was necessary. Especially since your character doesn't really have a dog in the fight besides "I am in the top floor of a tower. I would like to leave this tower."\n\nThe crafting system is interesting. I could see it going far, but armor would be a welcome addition. Further, the ability to create almost anything required with wood, rags and scrap metal is kind of odd.\n\nThere's also some flavor text notes left on walls and corpses which seem to hint at a greater story arch.\n\nThis game seems like it would be better suited on my phone, and played specifically while taking a long dump. Paying rapt attention to the goings-on are not necessary, and there's not really much of a decision-making process when it comes to playing the game. Will I explore both rooms on this floor? Yes. Will I continue down to the next floor? Yes. Rinse - repeat.\n\nIf I were to recommend something to the developers, I would recommend somehow increasing the size of the floors beyond two rooms. Missing out on a room due to a lock is a non-issue. I have no idea what I missed by not entering those rooms, and even after I found keys to go back and find out later, I didn't. Finally, I am not sure if I missed it, but a map would be useful - something to see if I can get back to a locked room.\n\n\n**ADDENDUM**\n\nA note to the dev team: dive deeper guys. This game was on training wheels, and I can tell that you definitely tried. I did not experience a single bug. The art work was great. The animation was smooth. The sound and set design were great. The concept was engaging, and I am a HUGE sucker for rogue-likes. This concept pushed all the right buttons.\n\nYes, I was disappointed, but that's alright. I want bigger, better, more complicated stuff from you in the future. I want you to succeed. This was a good idea. THIS GAME WAS A GOOD IDEA! I swear to god, if you create an R-rated version of this with more complicated features, I will be back.\n\n**SUPER ADDENDUM**\n\nThis is addressed to Broshan:\n\nMaking the game more difficult would have made it more of a challenge, but it wouldn't have changed the fact that traversing floors was more of a chore than it needed to be. A quick way to improve this specific game would be to at least speed everything up - have a keyboard command to just retrieve all items in a room. At least then you can get done with everything immediately instead of going through the chore of clicking on separate room components.\n\nBecause of the floor construction, there was no complexity. There are almost no choices to be made in a direction of travel. There isn't even an inventory system - your character has pockets that can hold everything, and there's no need to leave behind some items in order to store or keep others. Again - no choice to be made; just take everything you can click on. You can't save inventory items on the top floor because there's no need to. It would be  logical for a game like this given you have a safe room which you can effectively return to at almost any point.\n\nRoguelikes in particular suffer when you lack the ability to make informed decisions. It feels really good when you make the right choice, and are duly rewarded by the game's mechanics. On the contrary, it feels like you are on rails when nothing you do necessarily affects how the game progresses. No one wants to feel like that when playing a roguelike.\n\nYes, tweaking aspects of the game are necessary pertaining to item drops, but that is a drop in the bucket. The issue I am attempting to indicate is more systemic. This game needs an adult version. One with real choices, massive rewards, and crushing defeats.","October 6, 2015","false","1.6"," 461 of 552 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","461","552","11","25"

Then why I don't like it now? Because 100 minutes later I didn't find anything else.\n\nI'm bored, the gameplay is this: you click down, get to the lower floor, see en enemy, click to kill it, click to loot, click, click, click. You'll click more than you'll think. You can craft, you can find different enemies (not more than 10 different enemies to be honest) but it's just numbers, your better weapon will do some more damage, the stronger enemy will do some more damage.\nFor a roguelike game this is easy, and straight forward, there are no choices, you go down, kill, loot, craft better weapon, assign your skill point in order to use that weapon and so on, you'll never think "I was good here!" or "Damn, I made a mistake" (well, except for silly mistakes, of course), there's not satisfaction, your failure or success is just a coin flip. And... I'll tel you this: you won't even see the actual coin! I mean, you read the perchentage, click, and you'll just see the damage you inflicted or the "Miss".\nThat's it.\n\nGotta say the contents here are well crafted, there is just... not enough content, and what's worse: no depth in the gameplay. And everything is obnoxiously repetitive.\nThe price is not high, but it still should be 33% to be fair. In that case would i suggest to buy it?\nNo.\nI'd still think it's boring, there are a lot of better games.\n\nIn the comment people told me that this is a point and click, so i shouldn't complain if you only have to "click" in the game. Then I'll add this:\nYes, this game mixes point & click and roguelite, I already said why it's a bad roguelike, now:\nthree things make a Point & Click good. The narration: dialog and/or story. Here there's none.\nThe environment: graphics, scenarios, here is always the same.\nThe challanges: usually enigmas, anyway a Point & Click asks you to think about a solution to something, in order to be happy and satisfied when you find it.About this last one, probably the most important, as I already pointed out: there's nothing to really think about in this game, no challange, no satisfaction, it's easy and repetitive, so... it lacks of every aspect a point and click needs.\nThe conclusions are that this isn't just a bad roguelite, it is even a bad point & click.\nI'll stick with it!\nYou click, click, click, then click, click and click again and nothing really new or interesting will happen!","October 7, 2015","false","2.0"," 214 of 259 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","214","259","10","8"

You can choose what part of the monster to attack, but the only difference is damage vs. chance-to-hit, which is not an interesting choice.\nThere is crafting, but it is not interesting.  You can combine items that give you health or hunger into items that give you (more) hunger or health.  You can create weapons, but the only difference between weapons is the damage.  (Also the UI for crafting is extremely lacking)\nThere are simply not enough strategic choices.  You either walk down to the next floor, or check out the two rooms on this floor.  When you enter a room, either you loot all the stuff it in, or fight an enemy and then loot all the stuff in it.  Every floor is the same.\nI made it to floor 60 on my first game, and was really bored the entire time, so I let myself die and started over hoping the the first game was just a tutorial.  Unfortunately, it's wasn't.\n\nOn a more positive note, the art was decent, the voice acting was good, and the programming was well-done (the game is not buggy).  Unfortunately it's just not fun.  I'd wait until this game is in an indie bundle if you want to give it a shot.","October 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 117 of 158 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","117","158","0","5"

If you buy it during a sale, may be worth it as it's a decent casual game.\n\nIn essence, it's a simple rogue-like game that relies heavily on RNG, i.e. luck. I had a few games that I needed to restart after a few floors as I wasn't getting any items. The best perk I have discovered is "Total Mess" as it guarantees that you get an item every time you search (which is very VITAL), although you do lose an item randomly every 10 actions, which can be really irritating if it's your primary weapon. The strategy is to leave as much junk as possible in your inventory, while consuming stuff that you do need so that they don't randomly disappear. Another strategy is to put as many points as you can in accuracy while still having sufficient points to carry a decent weapon.\n\nStoryline is very thin, and not very satisfying. Gameplay wise, although it's quite fun, there is much room for improvement. Go ahead and read some of the other negative reviews, and you will get a good idea of what it is lacking.\n\nOverall, a 6/10.","October 7, 2015","false","7.9"," 38 of 54 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","38","54","0","0"

Go here, attack this, move on. There is no consideration of your actions, like where you go or how to spend resources. Nothing feels important in terms of your actions.\n\nIn short, when a rouge like is just dice rolls, it doesn't matter how well presented it is, if I have no choices. As mentioned in the top review a rework of the layout would be needed or a reworking of fundamentals in the game, otherwise this is about as deep as clicker heros.\n\nNot all bad, but certain design fundamentals, haven't come off here.","October 7, 2015","false","0.9"," 48 of 72 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","48","72","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bladechild/recommended/382140/","bladechild","bladechild","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bladechild/","79 products in account","The main problem with this game is there is too much of not enough.\n\nThe game has turn based combat - but there is barely any strategy to it other than picking which dice to roll. There is nothing actively happening in these fights to make the player feel interested. All you feel is frustration over your health ticking down when there is nothing you can actively do inside or outside the combat system to better yourself.\n\nThe game has RPG stat elements  - but they are probably the lamest, most simplistic I've ever seen. Leveling a character is so linear and obvious that it shouldn't make a player scratch his head any longer than 5 seconds to figure out what path to take (largely dependant on what weapon the game's RNG decides to give you early on). There isn't even any defense ratings for character or monsters, making the whole weapon/damage system feel hugely simplistic and unrewarding.\n\nThere's a crafting system - it's pretty bread and butter. The actual items you can create and variety isn't too bad really. But the way the game plays out just makes it another aspect that falls to the side as unrewarding, plagued by RNG happenstance, and rather pointless. It's true you will need to use it to some extent to make it to the bottom, but I doubt you would need to invest in much, which is good considering there is no active way to get materials you really need. In other survival games, you have areas that have greater or exclusive chances to wield certain items. This game it's all at the drop of a hat, and it completely makes the player feel void of any real sense of achievement, because they never feel like they are actively surviving.\n\nThe premise of the game sounds super neat - but in reality it's such a hollow rendition of what the game promises on paper. You have to escape a hotel from the 100th floor and get to the bottom. When you realize that each floor has two... yes, two rooms on each floor, I think that's when it kicks in how lazy, barebones and unadventurous this game really is. I'm also not sure what hotels these developers have been to, but this building barely even qualifies to be a crappy highrise in Newham.\n\nIn the end , this needed to be fleshed out, in all areas, by a factor of 10. The price of admission makes it clear that they're not even shy (or are perhaps ignorant) to have made such a minimalist and lacking game.","October 14, 2015","false","1.4"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","1"

It's a roguelike, 2D, turn based, dungeoneering type thing. You're a dude who booked himself into a VIP room in a hotel, then an apocalypse happened. You have to fight your way from the top floor to the bottom floor trying to maintain your health and keep your hunger levels down along the way. You can use the hotel lift to get back up to your Room, where you can sleep to heal if you're running low on medical items and make other improvements to the room that allow to to craft more complex foods (which replenish your hunger by more points) and build more complex weapons and medical supplies.\n\nThe mechanics reward careful thinking and efficient resource allocation but the turn based combat does involve an element of luck. You might not always find good food or medical items and you can't rely on anything. Even on the easy difficulty it's a fairly challenging game. I think it'll take me a few attempts to get much further than floor 50.\n\nI did get my key for this game free in a giveaway the developer did on the fly during one of Dodgers Twitch streams because Dodger was playing Skyhill at the time.

However, I am going to give it a CAREFUL recommendation at the current stage and the current price. 15€ is a tad high for what this game is. It needs some more content, methinks... For now, anything from 33% off or more would make it an easy buy, as you will absolutely get your money's worth.\n\nLonger version:\n\nIn Skyhill, you are a businessman on a short trip who decides to rest in the best Suite of a large luxurious 100-story hotel during a time of war. During his stay, one of the warring sides (and obviously the losing one), the Confederates, launches a biological weapon at your location that turns everyone into mutants or zombies. You survive, but soon the hunger drives you out and you need to find a way to survive and go to the ground using all the resources you can fnd at your disposal, or die trying in this post-apocalyptic rogue-lite game.\n\nSo let's take a look at what the game does well, and what poorly.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n1. Lots of rooms to explore and loot - you will have over 190 rooms to explore and loot throughout your adventure, contaning everything from food to stuff you can use as weapons or consumables, or to save for later for crafting.\n2. Upgradable stations - in short, your suite is your fortress. You can improve it in a number of ways. You can create better weapon building or cooking stations, fortify the door and fix up the bed so you can rest better and regain health.\n3. Lots of items to craft and use - the amount of weapons to make and use in combat is amazing - and it pays to note that some weapons can also be upgraded to better versions by using the core weapon(s). The devs really went overboard with the craftables be it weapons, food, or stuff you can make on the fly like bandages and medicine. The system really forces you to think whether you should use a certain item or save it for later. And about that...\n4. Decisions you make when it comes to craftables matter - being a rogue-lite with a randomly generated loot, it is always a huge decision whether to use a certain item or not, as god knows whether you'll find another one of those. In the end, when all falls into place, knowing that you've made the correct decisions is extremely satisfying.\n5. An RPG system that ties well into the weapon crafting - you have 4 skills that can be improved throughout the adventure and govern various types of combat - strength (the ability to wield powerful heavy weapons that do the most damage), speed (the ability to wield fast weapons and also get faster with improved chance for 2 action per turn), dexterity (the ability to wield weapons based on agility and dodge in combat) and accuracy, which improves you chance to hit.\n6. Starting and unlockable perks that make your playthroughs vary a lot  - from the ability to always go first to being extra lucky or have an extra ration or a medkit in your backpack, picking different perks during the various playthroughs will let you experience the game from a different perspective.\n7. Great combat - as a consequence of 3-6, the combat in this game is really good, and the outcome of a fight always ties into every decision you have made so far, be it wrong or right. And talking about decisions, you can also manually target various parts of the enemy body to inflict more damage at a higher chance to miss or less damage with a higher chance to hit. Just remember to run away when things go bad... No need to die heroically when you can still live to fight another day.\n8. Mini quests to keep you occupied while exploring - from finding keys to open various rooms to discovering cell phones with messages on them, you always have someting to look for as you search the floors of the hotel.\n9. Good game aesthetic for a rogue-lite - while I wouldn't put that on the top of the list, I still appreciate how the game looks for a 2-D one.\n10. Great replayability - the combination of perks, stuff you find, character build you make, and the little quests always make for a different experience the next time you boot up the game.\n\nAnd now let's take a look at the BAD:\n\n1. To counter #10 of the GOOD, even though a good number of parts of the game feel differently based on the perks, skills, weapons and stuff you pick, you ultimately do the same thing over and over again - find loot, craft, eat food, make weapons, open rooms, fight, survive, and hopefully get out of the hotel alive. I, personally, finished the game 3 times in my 5 hours of play, and sadly, I couldn't shake that feeling upon leaving the hotel...\n2. The RNGesus can make or break your game, unless you like to invest heavily in accuracy so that you wont miss too often. Or, of course, you get stuff that doesn't fit your character build at all... Or not enough food or medicine... or other stuff... you get the point.\n3. You can lose games through no fault of your own - in true rogue-lite fashion, victory through correct actions is not guaranteed. You may not find the stuff you need to get you set up properly, or you can get attacked way too often and die, and so on and so forth.\n4. I didn't exactly enjoy the music... while it undoubtedly fits the whole experience, I eventually muted it and played my own.\n5. Once you unlock all the perks, dying does feel like a true game over - until you unlock every perk, dying is ok and always lets you try something new the next time around. But once you unlock everything, dying is just that - death, game over, force restart.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI am keenly aware that Skyhill does enough right to merit a recommendation. However, I am going to give it a CAREFUL recommendation at the current stage and the current price. 15€ is a tad high for what this game is. It needs some more content, methinks...For now, anything from 33% off or more would make it an easy buy, as you will absolutely get your money's worth. Why?\n\nEasy. If you are a huge loot hoarder like me, like exploring, improving and seeing the stuff you do matter, this game is absolutely the right one for you. However, if you get easily irritated by loss, bad dice rolls, or games that expect you to play them for a bit to learn their quirks, I would stay away from it.","October 18, 2015","true","6.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

It's the stats, equipment and some dice rolling that decides if you win for the most part. Some fights are unavoidable too, while others can be bypassed entirely or occur in side areas.\n\nThe game is randomly generated which adds to replayability but also makes obtaining the components for your desired weapon that much harder.\n\nAnd there's multiple endings too, if you're engaged enough to want to look for them.

Because rogue-likes, by their very nature, add in highly randomised elements to determine the mapping and what-not of the game in question, the likelihood of such games being "well-designed" becomes greatly compromised.  Having said all that, it is my relief to announce that SKYHILL IS A STAGGERINGLY WELL-DESIGNED GAME.\n\nI guess it's maybe a bit like improvisation jazz music...occasionally, it rocks, but for the most part it emerges as little more than a sloppy, communal WANK.  But when that chaos somehow all pulls together - bear with me, trying to keep the "communal wank" metaphor going - then something magic can happen.  That's precisely what the makers of Skyhill have pulled off here...MAGIC.  It's deceptively simple, but hard as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  You'll "get it" in very little time at all - the combat system is straightforward, ditto the crafting system, and anything and everything else you care to mention - but it's designed in such a way that you will almost certainly die multiple times before you beat it, even on Easy difficulty.  This is partly because progressing through the one hundred floors of the building unlocks "perks" which you can choose between at the start of a new game, without which you're really not liable to make it all the way to the bottom.  There's also a learning curve, such as one which led me to prioritise achieving certain things (such as crafting certain weapons) as soon as possible in order to improve my chances in the long-term.\n\nI dunno...maybe to super-seasoned rogue-like/RPG-lite gamers out there this would be little more than a grind-fest, but for me personally it required the gradual accumulation of a STRATEGY to get through the ♥♥♥♥er.  And, of course, luck also plays a role...but it's always going to in this genre of gaming, let's face it.  But it's still pretty darned "fair" on the whole, in my humble opinion.\n\nOverall, I really can't imagine how this could have be any better designed, and it's just challenging enough - but also just "hey, at least I'm slowly making progress" enough - to be a really fun and addictive little game.  I hit it for five hours' straight the first night I played it, and that's a rarity for me, to say the least.  It's also nice to have a game which is a bit of a "dungeon-hack", minus the dungeon (though the horror setting is only liable to be "scary" to your grandmother, but it's still a tone and atmosphere which I personally prefer to the usual "light fantasy" fare).\n\nOh, and for all the value-for-money people, there's four difficulty levels, as well as innumerable weapon crafting options, selectable perks which significantly change gaming strategies, and a hefty ♥♥♥♥-tonne of achievements to aim for, so even at full price no one needs complain about longevity of gameplay (I mean sure, it might get a tad repetitive eventually, but all you people seem to enjoy forty to fifty hours of mindlessly shooting and looting the same stuff in Borderlands game after Borderlands game after Borderlands game, don't you?)!\n\nDefinitely one of my "games of the year", even if the ending is a bit on the lame side (no big challenge or boss fight or anything...you just walk out the front door of the bottom floor of the building, and somehow end up in a cut-scene on the ROOF)!  Luckily the game isn't really about the "story", though, but rather the EXPERIENCE...and a very, very enjoyable and compelling experience I've found it to be.  Let me put it this way:  Now that I've conquered the Easy mode, I'm already itching to beat it on Normal, and no doubt the higher difficulties after that.  If that's not the definition of a well-made turn-based game, I'll be darn-♥♥♥♥ed if I know what is.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.","November 24, 2015","true","29.8"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","15","20","4","1"

Some rooms contain useful items, others are entirely empty.\nIn some floors' stairwell or rooms you might encounter monsters that need to be fought, in others you don't.\nSome rooms may be locked and unaccessible, but you can find or make keys to return and open them.\nNot all locked rooms are worth re-visiting and unlocking, except for the achievement, some contain nothing at all.\nOn some floors, the elevator doors or some electrical box will be broken.\nYou can't do anything against broken elevator doors, but you can repair broken electrical boxes.\nIn fact, you HAVE to repair the electrical boxes in order to use the elevator on and below the current floor.\n\nWhile you're moving about, there's a fairly basic leveling system that should underline your progress.\nYou collect experience points (XP) by fighting monsters, when you level up you get to distribute a few ability points.\nThis, to me, does not seem to affect the overall gameplay experience, but mostly controls which weapons you can use.\nHaving a high accuracy level still means that your guy can miss up to 5 turns. In a single fight. In a row.\n\nThere's a basic crafting system involved - basic, because it's not very deep or demanding.\nMost weapons can be crafted, some can only be found (golf club, machete).\nSome food and health items can be combined "on the go", but most things (weapons, meals, etc.) can only be crafted in the room on floor 100, so you will probably need to constantly travel back there in order to craft things or meals.\n\nActions cost "food points", energy if you will. Changing floors or rooms uses 1 point, going by elevator uses 2 points.\nSome food types can be combined to more interesting ones. But beware, some combinations only give you +1 additional food points, which means it's better value consuming the two items right away (or waiting) rather than spending food points for traveling.\n\nOn your way down (and up) you'll come past different types of vending machines: crafting items, food and medical stuff.\nYou'll occasionally come by coins, these can be used to buy random (mostly not very helpful) items from those machines.\n\n\n\nHints:\n\nMake sure that you build a kitchen and upgrade it as soon as you can. A better kitchen gives you access to better recipes, you could for example eat 4 items with 5-10 food points by themselves - or combine them into one tasty 65 point meal. Even taking the 4 points for elevator travel up and down away, that's still a worthwhile gain.\n\nYou can not "dodge" or evade monster attacks, and you can not apply medical items (Medipack, Painkillers, etc.) during a fight sequence, but you can flee and leave the room or change the floor. Although monsters may attack you an additional time while you do so, it still gives you some extra breathing time to heal. After healing, you can return to the monster which is still as weak as it was when you fled and finish it off.\n\nDon't forget your bed! I can usually complete a run without going to bed at all, but I've more than once ended up in "the lower floors" with ZERO health items left, no Medipacks, no Bandages, nothing. Not even Alcohol and Rags (combine into Bandages) or Coins to spend on medical vending machines. Retreat to your bed and heal, it basically turns food into health and can get you through.\n\nSome monsters can "infect" you, which will drain your health points pretty quickly and won't stop without medication.\nTo avoid this, always be prepared. As soon as you come across Antibiotics and Mutant Blood vials, combine them for an antidote right away rather than using them to craft Painkillers or what it is. You can always recover health in your bed, but it won't get rid of the infection. It's better to have 4-6 antidotes ready, rather than looking for one when you need one.\n\nUpgrade your Workbench once, maybe twice if you have nothing better to spend your materials on. Don't bother upgrading more. All it will do is give you a larger variety of weapons, but not necessarily stronger ones.\n\n\n\nI'll end with the things that bother me, devs pay attention:\n\nOne run can take several hours to complete, especially if you're doing well. Being a casual "work night" gamer I don't always have 4 hours in one go to spend. It's a huge PITA that I can't save a game mid-play and then return to it the next evening. If I have to leave the game, for whatever reason, all my progress is lost. PLEASE, dear devs, include a possibility to save games.\n\nThe success of the game mostly depends on nothing but bare luck. I see no value in leveling up, except that it helps get access to better weapons. Having level 13 or so speed and accuracy will do nothing, the guy will still miss up to 5 times in a row -- and this is with up to 96% hit probability, not just "aiming for the head". When you're down in the lower floors, this can mean sudden and unexpected death. Oh so many times I thought "this is going pretty well", stocked with lots of food and medipacks... encounter one of the "long ones" and wham, all gone to waste because the guy misses and misses and misses and misses... *sigh* PLEASE again, dear devs, DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.\n\nThere aren't a lot of cut-scenes, one at the beginning and one at the end, but catogorizing them as "music" is quite enfuriating. I tend to play my games without background music, or with the music turned all the way down. Not because I wouldn't appreciate the work that went into the soundtrack (I'm a musician myself, so I do), but because it distracts me from the gameplay. So... I turn the "music" down in the options dialog, and now the cut-scenes are turned all the way down as well. It's either "music at full blast" or "can't hear the cut-scenes". PLEASE once more, dear devs, make the volume of the cut-scenes independently configurable, or at least control the cut-scenes' volume with the gameplay volume.\n\nThese things are NOT challenging, encouraging, action-enhancing, thrilling, entertaining or anything else.\nThey're just plain annoying.\n\nThe startup configuration dialog offers the ability to set up 2 additional attack types and a jump command... either this is preparation for a coming update, or it's a bug.","January 7","true","17.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

However, what I was met with turned out to be a fun and addictive rogue-like title with simple mechanics and a simple premise.\n\nYou're Perry Jason (yes, I know), and your main goal at this time is to get to the bottom of the Skyhill Hotel. You have 100 floors to traverse, and three rooms on each floor. The variety in items and monsters is very slim, but the amount of events that can occur and the highly likely event that the game will screw you over during a good run will keep you coming back for more.\n\nOut of the nearly seven hours I've put into the game since its release, I have only been able to beat the game twice; both the alternate endings, I haven't even unlocked the original ending yet. I haven't even unlocked Hardcore mode at this point. So there's still quite a bit of replayability left.\n\nThe achievements add another element to the game which will elongate the experience for players. Feeling extra lucky? Try an all Vegan run! Hate your life? Beat the game on Hardcore! Super unlucky? Well there's achievements for those of you who can't stop dying.\n\nOverall, Skyhill has been one of my favorite rogue-like experiences. I highly recommend it for fans of the genre, as it is challenging but you can take things at your own pace. Let's also not forget the crafting. If you're good at prioritizing your goods, you can come out of Skyhill with some pretty godly weapons; though remember, you can't take them to the next playthrough.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 16, 2015","true","10.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"

Thankfully you have a room with a bio-shield that will block the harmful radiation or poison that is now spewing all over the town. There's only one problem, you see you're going to run out of food, and when you do that you are going to have to venture out. So you have to ask yourself one thing, can you make it out of the hotel alive?\n\nIn the game of SkyHill you are going to be forced with that very question. The thing is once you are out of your room, you might as well try to get out of the hotel. There is one slight problem though, you see the VIP room is on the top of the hotel, a hotel that just happens to have 100 floors, so to get out of there alive you are going to have to go all the way down.\n\nThere are two statistics that you will have to pay attention to ABOVE all else, and that is your Health and Hunger. If you let your health dip below zero, well then you are dead. If you let your hunger dip below zero, well your health starts taking a hit. So you will have to balance your food intake as well as your medicine intake. Don't take too much at any point, but don't take too little that you will fall prey to the monstrosities that now hide within the building.\n\nThere's not much I didn't like about this game. There's challenge galore, you will never play the same game twice as the building is randomized on every playthrough. I will tell you this, though, your hunger will slowly increase through EVERY room that you walk through, and it will greatly increase when you are trying to fix something without the correct materials.The good thing is that you there's only always 3 rooms to a floor. You have the stairway/elevator hall, and then a room to the left and right. Be careful when going anywhere in this game because enemies can appear in ANY of these rooms. Oh and on a side note don't get to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you discover that there are rooms that have nothing in them, or that appear to have something but turn out to be empty.\n\nFor the completionist out there one of the main reasons why you are going to continue to come back and play this game is that there are collectables hidden in the game, and of course you have to collect them all. For those who are just looking for a one run type of experience, I'm going to warn you now, even if you make it to the bottom and get an ending, you're probably going to want to play again just to see if that's the ending that will always happen.\n\nSo here's the deal, are you looking for a solid game that deals with mutated human beings, some of them that you hope you only see once in the game (I'm talking about the lady mutant, once you see her, you'll know you don't want to EVER see her again)? Are you looking for a game that has crafting of weapons, food, medical supplies, and upgrades to the crafting areas so that you have access to more stuff? Are you looking for a game that if you play your cards right you will HAVE TO play from start to finish? Well this is the game that you have to have on your radar. There's no other way to say it, this is a good game, and there's only 1 flaw that irks me to no end and that is that sometimes you consume more than 1 piece of food or medical supply when you are trying to decrease your hunger or heal yourself, but it doesn't happen all the time, and the way I played the game it actually was never truly a waste. So here's the score, this game gets a 9.3 out of 10.","November 15, 2015","true","3.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's survival horror, what with the crafting and monsters and surviving. It's an awesomely laid out rogue-like, heading down these flowers is fun and scary! No, no "jump scares" or anything. Just dreading what's around the next corner because you are always teetering on the edge of, well, NON-survival. The art style is superb and the audio fits well (but can get annoying with the battles and such). THe gameplay is top-nothc, with the combat system being a big success for me. I really dig this combat system quite a bit. Risk/reward was a solid way to go, especially for a game like this. HTis is just a top-of-the-line PC game. A shining example of why indie games truly own the scene right now. Go enjoy som SkyHill. You don't even need to be a horror fan to like this game. A true gem. Only the repetitive sound effects realy kep this fm being a truly perfect game. I'm going 4.5/5 here.

As you move down the floors they take one hunder point away from you and each floor has three rooms to explore. As you travel down the tower there will be monsters to attack you but you can easily find and craft your own weapons to destroy them. You also find food and medical suppies to help you with the climbing. the goal is to make it to floor one. One thing thats fun about the game though is that you will find occasional papers telling of the history of the world or pieces of pictures tell you about the history and back story. So it is fun to try and find all the missing links to the main character. As you travel down the tower you unlock power-ups or skills for your character, these skills can be later used in another run of the game. This means that after you die you can start another game and use the powerups. You also have a base at the top of the skyscraper that helps you recover health and has a kind of work bench that you use to scraft weapons and food etc. This is a new game so there are bugs, but as long as you have patience with the game the bugs shouldnt be that bad. Over all i think this is a good game to buy if your into survival. It not difficult at all to craft things or to use the skill points you get when you level up. the skill points just make it easier for you to fight the monsters. I would recommend you buying this game for the full price if you like survival games but f your not into survival games that much and are iffy about the game wait for it to go on sale for a few bucks cheaper then buy it. I would recommend this game to everyone.","October 16, 2015","true","15.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However, it is overpriced for what it is.\n\nWhen you first start playing the game is fun, however after half an hour or so it quickly becomes repetitive and it will seem as if your success is very random and there is no real skill involved.\n\nIn fact this is not entirely true - to have any hope of completing the game you need to make good use of the crafting system and you need to be strategic to survive. Once you start paying attention to upgrading your room, crafting weapons and cooking food the odds start to shift in your favour and for me the game then became fun again.\n\nUnfortunately you'll have to figure out most of this stuff for yourself as the tutorial is pretty lightweight  - I didn't realise until I'd played and died a few times that you could sleep, upgrade the bed and various other items in your room etc.\n\nOnce I started to formulate a strategy I did enjoy the game again - I think a lot of people give up before they ever reach this point though because the game doesn't really emphasise the importance of crafting, sleeping and so on. A lot of the perks actually make things worse too, which can be frustrating, so choose wisely.\n\nGameplay is based far too overtly around probability - I sort of didn't mind that but a lot of it is trying to be clever by offering perks that on the face of it sound good but aren't or vice-versa, which really is a way of making you die more often and lengthening the game. There are perhaps eight or ten different enemies and several of them are variations on the same creature.\n\nNow I've beaten the game there's really no replay value left in it. For £5 or less I'd probably recommend it if you enjoy roguelite games - it will entertain you for a few hours if you don't get bored before the strategy elements start to crystallise. At over a tenner I'd save your money and wait for it to get cheaper.","October 10, 2015","false","12.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/382140/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","This review was written for FREEDOM Community Gaming Collective[freedomcgc.com].\nAfter checking into the hotel, I decide to watch a bit of television. My plan to unwind is abruptly cut short as the newscaster reports that the city has been attacked. I look out of my penthouse window and I can just see the first impact. A huge mushroom cloud appears on the horizon. It’s something we never expected would happen. Nuclear war. But it’s not just ordinary nuclear weapons. These bombs apparently contain biological agents that turn people into horrible mutant abominations. I try calling the cops, even the front desk. No reply. After a while, my food runs out and I realize that I have to leave this place if I want to survive. But I have also been hearing strange noises. I suppose it’s better to go out there and try to survive than die of starvation.\n\nSkyhill is a 2D point-and-click game that places you in the aftermath of World War III. People have turned into mutants and your objective is to try to escape from the hotel. The problem is that you’re stuck in the penthouse of a hotel with 100 floors. And the elevator is out. You have to make your way down, floor by floor. The layout of each floor is exactly the same. The central area is reserved for the staircase and elevator with one hotel room to the left and another to the right. Your first priority is scavenging for food. The protagonist has a hunger bar and a health bar. You lose hunger points every time you move from one room to another. If your hunger bar goes all the way down, the health bar is next. And if that one hits zero, it’s game over.\n\nThe key to Skyhill is exploring rooms and picking up food and various items. Your penthouse acts a base of operations. You can return there whenever you want in order to craft or upgrade items. Every five to ten floors you will be able to fix a small section of the elevator. The elevator can take you back up to your penthouse or upper floors that you have already visited, but it won’t go down. You have to use the staircase and repair the elevator bit by bit until you reach the ground floor. You may be tempted to just go all the way down without exploring hotel rooms, but that won’t get you very far. You’ll either die of starvation or you’ll encounter a deadly mutant. Preparation is important.\n\nAs you gather various items, you will be able to use the workbenches in your penthouse and craft weapons, medkits, and other items. The crafting system is intuitive and easy to understand. You can also combine multiple pieces of food to prepare meals that provide more hunger points. You can also upgrade these workbenches in order to unlock more elaborate meals and weapons. If you’re running out of health and don’t have any means to heal yourself, you can use your bed and go to sleep. This will exchange hunger points for health points. Just be sure that you have food to restore those hunger points. Upgrading the bed will make it more efficient. Sometimes you will be awaken by nightmares or strange noises, which will affect how many health points you were able to restore. To mitigate this effect, you can choose to upgrade your doors, so you can feel perfectly safe while sleeping.\n\nOnce you enter a room occupied by a mutant, a fight will ensue. The combat system is turn-based. You can just click on the mutant for a basic hit or you can go into the battle screen. This will enable you to choose where you want to hit the mutant. For example, hitting the head will deal more damage, but the chances of missing are significantly increased. That’s pretty much all there is to it, the combat system is very simple. That can actually be said about all of the game’s systems. The exploration, level design, character upgrade system (each level you can choose to upgrade damage, speed, dexterity, and accuracy), crafting system, combat system – it’s all relatively basic. However, I still found the game rather enjoyable. Roaming through the hotel, looking for that one elusive item you need to craft that badass weapon is actually pretty interesting.\n\nAfter each playthrough you will unlock passive and active perks that you can enable at the start of a new playthrough. Choosing a different combination of perks does provide a slightly more different experience, but after several playthroughs, the simplicity of the design and systems in place is going to start to wear very, very thin. The truth is that the design and gameplay simply cannot sustain more than a few playthroughs. You will not only feel like you’ve seen everything there is to see, you will actually see it all. There are three different endings to shoot for and that is where you will have completely exhausted the content of this game. I have to say that the endings are rather unexpected and well done. However, as everything else in the game, the storytelling is rather rudimentary and not particularly involving.\n\nSkyhill sports a very nice, clean art style. The interface is also simple and intuitive. You always know what is going on around you and what items you are missing for that weapon that you want to craft. The sound design isn’t that noteworthy. There’s barely any music to speak of and the sound effects are entirely unimpressive.\n\nThis is a slightly odd call to make because I did enjoy Skyhill. This is a good foundation. But it needs to be built upon. There is simply no denying the fact that the design and gameplay systems are too basic. Roguelikes need to support many playthroughs, all of which should provide a different experience. Skyhill simply doesn’t succeed in this task. However, it is still an enjoyable romp while it lasts.\n\n6 OUT OF 10 (FAIR)","February 2","true","5.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

But after the first fifteen minutes it degenerates into exactly what it is -- a Flash-created, resource-management, monotonous, disappointing affair.\n\nI had some major concerns before I bought this one -- I don't like games created with Flash, I find that more often than not they are all sizzle (appearance) and no substance.  So I hesitated for a few days before purchasing this one.\n\nI also hesitated on this one because it is a resource-management game.  In my opinion, it's not the resource-management aspect of any game that limits it.  Truly, games such as Banished are games of resource-management.  But managing food (or any resource) in those games is not crippling.  Your participation in the game, unless you are completely ignoring the resources, is not largely limited or dictated by your immediate possession of and constant high-level of consumption of those resources.\n\nNot so in Skyhill.  This was the first thing that made me say, "uh-oh" once I learned of this.  It's not that you have to manage food in the game, it's that food dictates nearly everything you do.  Every action you take depletes your food inventory significantly.  And, while this in itself you can argue is inherent in a resource-management game, is the harbinger of what will, I feel, be a tremendous lack of content.\n\nWhich this game severely lacks.  A fresh-looking game to me triggers a hope of nice content.  I guess I should stop hoping.  This type of resource-management game exchanges vigilance for resources for content.  Too easy for player to "beat" the game?  Instead of adding more content, increase the need for those resources.  It seriously disappoints me when I see this in a game.  If I want to count beans or push pencils I'll just go to work.\n\nI purchased this game for $8.99.  That is way too much for this game.  I would most likely have a thrombosis or an embolism had I had $14.99 for this thing.  It's a great idea, and my hope is that the developers will add more content.\n\nThen again, being essentially an existentialist, I'll leave hope to the most positive schools of philosophy.  Not the worst game I've ever played, but not worth my time or my money.","June 5","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/382140/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","Review copy provided by developer\n\nDescribed by the creators as a point and survival game Skyhill sees your character survive a nuclear apocalypse and after eventually running out of food and supplies having to venture out from his protected penthouse on the 100th floor with the intention of reaching the ground.\n\nThe main mechanics of the game are managing both your health and hunger as you travel down each stairwell with the option of investigating both rooms on each floor. Every move you make uses up one point of hunger so sensibly navigating the games rooms is essential.\nAnother key mechanic is the games combat. As you meet an enemy you must select your weapon and then choose which body part you are going to attack. Different body parts have a higher percentage chance of missing but equally harder to hit parts do significantly more damage. This turns the combat into a logic puzzle as you get further down the building and the enemies get harder and harder.\n\nIn order to help manage your hunger and health there is a well fleshed out crafting system to allow you to craft food, resources and weapons as well as a level up system with a simple set of stats you can add to.\n\nAs you descend you unlock access to the elevator that allows you to travel back up to your penthouse and improve food and weapons. It also becomes important to use you Penthouse to sleep and regain life especially on the higher difficulties as enemies become harder and first aid kits become scarcer. This works by increasing your health but reducing your hunger bar meaning you are generally starving when you awake.\n\nThere are a few issues I have with the game to do with balance. I will say that with each play through there is an active and passive ability to help you that you can choose at the start. Some are more helpful than others with a particular overpowered favorite of mine being Bulimia which reduces your hunger loss by 50% but makes it possible to take damage when you eat. Equally there are a few weapons that are easier to gain than others that are very powerful the clock work axe being a good example of this.\n\nNow I am not usually a fan of roguelikes but there really is something about Skyhill that grabbed me and would not let me go. As you progress you are drip fed storied through articles you find as well as some key bits of information about side plots that only become apparent through multiple playthroughs and alternate endings.\n\nHaving completed the game relatively easily on easy and just about on normal the hard is proving difficult and the currently locked nightmare mode is about as far from seeming possible to me right now as it could be.\n\nAll in all Skyhill is a very original roguelike game that is different from anything I have played before and is well worth your time. Games take a reasonable length and it never outstays its welcome with subsequent playthroughs drip feeding you more and more of the games story.\n\nCannot recommend it enough though, fantastic game.\n\nFor our video review check out the video below\n\nhttp://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/150929_game-tutor-grades-skyhill","October 6, 2015","true","18.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

You can be the greatest tactician of all time, but some games will just refuse to give you anything to work with; all of your skills mean nothing when what little food you get is rotten, you can not find that antidote for the eternal poison, and the game thinks that kitchen knife will be the only weapon you ever need or should have access to.\n\nSkyhill is pretty much one of those Rogue-likes. The playtime is entirely dependent upon how far the game feels like letting you go. Stats give such pathetic bonuses that leveling up feels pointless once you're accurate enough to reliably hit enemies, and you will constantly be relying on it to not give you impossible requirements for fixing elevator panels so you can make frequent trips back to your apartment to craft everything that requires you to be there. Eventually, a roll of the dice will just give you an easy but slow grind straight to the first floor.\n\nStory?

I shall list them for easy reading:\n\n\nPros:\n-Looks very nice, the art style and graphics are well suited to the gameplay and concept\n-Music and sound effects are appropriate for the situations you find them in and are original; No Wilhelm screams here\n-Controls are simple, straight forward and respond well\n-I really like the concept of starting at the top of the building and working your way down to the ground floor to get out. It's an interesting take in a game genre that usually involves you starting at ground floor and either going up a castle or down into a the dungeon. The idea of being trapped in a building full of windows is a cool twist.\n-This game is difficult, but after you unlock a few perks and get familiar with the gameplay you can get further in each attempt, which is exactly how it should be.\n-Crafting is solid and well thought out, there aren't many arbitrary items, everything you come across can be useful\n-Enemies are well designed and all stand out from one another. You'll need a different strategy for each one which makes the combat a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n-I've encountered a glitch where sometimes I will get a lot of artifacting. My computer doesn't quite have the grahical memory the game recommends, but I've played many other games where I don't meet the exact standards and the game runs just fine. Thankfully, the artifacting seems to only affect the background and if you have the interactable object indicator on, then the little eye symbol will show you which boxes of colour you can pick up. Strangely enough, even with this glitch the game is still 100% playable and is actually pretty funny; like playing on a SNES that's acting wonky.\n-The accuracy seems to be a bit off. When I have an 80-85% chance to hit an enemy it seems a lot more like 70% from the amount of misses. That problem scales as well; at 50% chance only can hit an enemy 1 out of 3-4 times, which can truly screw you over. This should be looked at in the next few updates as it is the most annoying part of this otherwise great game.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIf you like RPGs, Rogue-likes, and crafting, then this game is right up your alley, I would highly recommend it.","November 4, 2015","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You start at the top of the Skyhill building and have to fight and scourge your way through 99 floors back to possible safety.\n\nVISUALS\n\nSimple but solid 2d. I'm not too fond of the art style, but after a few hours I got used to the character model and enemies. The building itself, the rooms really, look quite allright and post-apocalypticsy. Intro and outro are made in a comic book way and are rather meh.\n\nAUDIO\n\nSimple and not annoying. The background music is plink plonking, the sound effects are very basic, but you don't need more. Nothing much to say here really.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe premise is pretty simple, it's turn based, you can move one room at a time, each move costs food, food can be found. Each encountered enemy has to be killed if you want to pass through. You can find medpacks to heal, if your base is upgraded enough you can also heal by sleeping there. The base can be upgraded to allow for building new weapons, items or cooking better food. There is permadetah and the game can be very random, but that's not necessary bad. It's a roguelike after all.\n\nAll in all I had 10 or so hours of fun before I managed to get to the bottom for the first time. There are three endings, so there is some replayability.

Too much randomness in the procedural map layout, and way too much luck involved in the core fighting elements.\n\nIt's a decent game for what it is, but I'm just left feeling a little too bored playing this game after only about 20-30 minutes.  I wish it had something more, I dont know.  For a game like this with so much randomess determining the outcomes, maybe I want to see some dice being thrown and see those numbers either coming up 'hit' or 'miss', but this game just leaves me feel like something is "missing".\n\nYou start off the game in the top of a 99 floor hotel.  You can use the elevators on each floor once you find a VIP card by searching dead mutants you kill or searching searchable items you find in the rooms.  There is no WASD or even arrow keys, its all mouse driven and point-and-click.  Point and click items to search or rooms to walk into.  Every action has a result typically success or fail which is really all based on randomness, and perhaps your characters "skills" in fighting.  Still it all just feels like a bunch of dice rolls to me, and very little in the way of strategy or puzzle solving.  And that's where this game fails to deliver for me in the game satisfaction and overall challenge.\n\nIt works well enough and might be fun for some people to play, but again to me.. it's just lacking either a real satisfying level of strategy or in showing us the dice rolls that determine our fate.  I don't mind games of chance, but for a game that involves this much luck with every move, somehow I think it might help to see the dice rolls on the screen.\n\nIn the end, I cannot give this game my personal thumbs up even though the game works well enough.  It just lacks enough engagement in the players choices to make it satisfying to me and therefore fails to deliver a high enough level of enjoyment while playing it.\n\nMy score is a 60% and I think there are much more fun games out there of this style and at or under the same price.\n","October 6, 2015","false","0.8"," 24 of 50 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","24","50","2","6"

It's hit a specific niche: if you like roguelikes and survival mechanics, this game may be up your alley, as it does that rather well. But that's if: if neither of those sound entirely interesting, then the games lackluster sound design and mechanics that could have gone a step further or two really won't make you play it in the long run, especially considering the repetitive nature of the runs. The lighting does stand out in the visual department, and I enjoyed my time with the game even when I'm not necessary a survival mechanic fan at times, but it's the home run hitter of the genre: if it connects with you: you'll be playing it for hours and hours. Or you'll strike out.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review:  https://youtu.be/SzBsBtbU4s8\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nSurvival Mechanics work in terms of risk/reward: the idea being that when to use your assets and when not is vastly important, and each decision can become interesting in that way. Good mix of the roguelike mechanics here.\nLike stats working into weapons in terms of positive/negative impact, giving reason to customize your stats on more levels.\nDifficulty levels are perfect in terms of providing little/ok/hard challenges and hit the sweet spot there for all kinds of players who want to play.\nPerk system gives reasons to play a tiny bit differently with specific runs, whether it be skipping levels or building up your equipment.\nFeel the strength of your character make a reasonable difference, gives you reasons to go after enemies and grow.\nSpeed option was needed, and it still works in terms of preformance.\nThe visuals aren't exactly the greatest, but it does standout in style. Shadow/lighting work is the strongest element and works rather well.\n-:\nAim system misses. Could have been really interesting depending on weaponry, but risk/reward mechanic doesn't work very well here.\nToo little random events means that variety in gameplay is hurt over time.\nStory integration lacks. Doesn't ever tie that well into the main gameplay, and feels seperated from what you are doing overall. Even elements that you pick up feel disjointed like it was pieced together.\nSound Design lacks. Horror needs elements of sound to really be a focus, and there's just an overall lack of sound on all levels of the game's elements. Loses impact of critical moments because of it. Also the voice acting....isn't good.","October 6, 2015","true","7.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","0"

It's not that the game is bad, but that it simply too minimalistic, and I'm not talking about the art style--which is one of it's main good features. There's simply not that much to the game itself. It's a point and click roguelike game that admittedly tries but fails to achieve the basic aspects necessary regarding those two styles to make it worthwhile here. With the only options being to go down the stairs or to one of the two optional side rooms to ransack or kill the monster then ransack, it's too tedious to be enjoyable as a roguelike.\n\nA point and click game needs strategy, which the option of where to hit monsters and what item you're going to smack them around with simply doesn't offer. But above all, it must have a good narrative. And that's what we're missing here, which is also quite possibly my biggest issue with the game, which is why it confused the hell out of me as to how this game got an award for it.\n\nSpoiler alert: The initial narrative here is that you're stuck at the top of a building when nuclear war hits and the monsters start crawling out of the woodwork. You as the protagonist have to work your way to the ground floor while crafting tools to bludgeon things with or to fix the broken elevators/lights which inexplicably stopped working for all but the top five floors, and to cook up food because apparently you're an anemic who can't go from one room to another without suffering hunger pains for it. Not a bad premise in and of itself, but the execution is poorly handled.\n\nThe story can branch off in three different ways, but all are jumbled together in the course of the playthorugh that they contradict one another, and none actually contribute to the gameplay. From this, you get three potential endings, all of which are depressing and none of which are in any way original twists to include when they're all a few years past "done to death". The "twist endings" become pretty obvious early on depending on where you find the randomly generated plot-specific items that relate to them, and ultimatley lead to a slow, drawn out crawl through the samey, boring, tedious levels making up the rest of the building before you finally receive the ultimately unsatisfying confirmation of them.\n\nEnding one: You're crazy.\nEnding two: You're crazy and you murdered a bunch of innocent people along the way. You monster.\nEnding three: You're trapped in a computer simulation a la The Matrix but without the graphics or Keanu Reeves powers to make it worthwhile.\n\nSo in no version of the storyline is anything you're experiencing real even in the context of the game itself. It should say something when even the game is showing how pointless it is to play it. Even worse, all of these endings are detached from the initial narrative and disjointed from the gameplay itself. What about all the little background hints that suggest there is more going on than what is in this man's head? Nope, all equally pointless and of no real value to the game or story within it because even in the game, none of it matters.\n\nIf I have to give the game credit for anything, it's the art style and the initial concept. I certainly liked the crafting system which was a main reason I was drawn to the game, though the random luck of what items I could find in a single playthrough to even try to make anything worthwhile made it more annoying than anything. Some of the earnable perks weren't worth it, though they could add an extra sort of challenge to the game even if it does nothing to really enhance the gameplay itself.\n\nUltimately at this point, I have to say I don't recommend getting the game for full price. It was fun at first, but quickly became tedious and lacks replay value that would actually have me WANTING to play rather than feeling obligated to do so just to get two other comic-style pages showing potential "what if" scenarios that still leave me feeling just as confused and unsatisfied as the first.","December 9, 2015","false","11.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebulan/recommended/382140/","zebulan","Zebulan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zebulan/","824 products in account","Notice: I had been provided a complimentary copy of SKYHILL by the publisher, Daedalic Entertainment, for review purposes.  These opinions are my own.\nSKYHILL is a turn based action-RPG pitting you with the task of escaping a 100-storey hotel by descending from the top floor to the Lobby.  You're set up against increasingly difficult mutated human beings in hand-to-hand combat using either found or crafted weaponry.  Mutants are not your only difficulty as you are faced with a hunger bar that depletes for every room you move from, causing starvation and eventually death if you can not sustain yourself.\n\nYou're granted a "VIP Card" early in the game which allows you to use the central elevator, so that you may quick-travel between floors or to the VIP room itself; an absolute need since walking up each floor will cost you your difficult-to-attain hunger bar.  The central elevator however is in a state of disrepair, requiring you to find or craft the necessary parts to fix it as you progress through the game.\n\nYour VIP room is your hub for healing yourself by exchanging an equal number of hunger points for health points and allows crafting of foodstuffs and new weaponry.  SKYHILL does not contain any armour at all, so you are going to take many damaging blows as you complete the objective of reaching the Lobby, making hunger trading for health a must-do.\n\nUltimately, the game is unforgiving, even on Normal difficulty making it difficult to play for those easily frustrated.  Although you may die often, depending on your level of descension, you will unlock "perks" for future playthroughs.  These perks give you a bonus (and some a detriment) for your character.\n\nSadly the game is not very long in length (Beat the game on Normal in 5 hours after 5 playthroughs), and the random generation does very little to supplement the game (The tower is always 100 stories, different mutants are found in generally the same depth, the only randomism that kicks in is room loot quantity and contents along with attack rolls).  Therefore there is very little replay value once the game is complete.  Difficulty levels also seem to only adjust mutant hit point values: On Normal a standard 'clawer' has 20 HP where it has 22 on Hard, as an example. I failed to notice if anything else is adjusted between difficulties.\n\nIn conclusion, I found SKYHILL to be very addicting and entertaining for what I did play!  Always getting just a little further each time, developing new strategies and trying out different perk load-outs until I found one that I liked ("Total Mess" perk is extremely overpowered.  Every lootable container and creature corpse contains an item, where regularly it's more of a 50/50 of a container having an item or being empty.  The downfall of the perk is every 10 turns you lose one random item, so once you get going, the worst that could happen is you lose a really good weapon or your VIP card).\n\nDefinitely a fun game in my opinion, and that's why I recommend it.  Would be significantly better with extra replay value (Modded content, different size floors or rooms, additional challenges or story, etc.) - as now that I've completed it, I have very little inclination for beating it again on a higher difficulty.","October 6, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I got out on first floor and then I watch how I appeared on the roof... where is logic? Then I just was disappointed, I went and read other endings. So story narrative is cool, but this first ending is awful. After this end I don't want play more this game. But what more important is I was disappointed and was no any desires to continue play this game.\n\nWhat about other parts of this game? I think there are many reviwes about it. I just message my brief opinion:\n- gameplay: 8/10, (just I don't like when the game controls me. Maybe it's just luck, but I rly figure game had have some algorithmes for controlling player and if you do all right, the game will give you much new "surprises" like rly more monsters or rly less resources. It is not cool. I want feel fine myself if I did all right).\n- story: 7/10, (if woudn't that stupid end I have described the above, it wound be 8/10)\n- music: 8/10, (just cool music, nothing more)\n- graphics: 7/10 (but who care the graphics)\n\nРазработчикам желаю удачи в создании новых игр!","October 8, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

You put points into certain skills, and use weapons and plan fighting accordingly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilazaurus/recommended/382140/","bilazaurus","Bilazaurus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilazaurus/","262 products in account","Verdict:\nA shallow, uninspired and short lasting roguelike experience. Although pleasing at first, it falls flat with repetitiveness and strongly luck based gameplay. For the price, you’ll be much better off looking somewhere else to quench your roguelike thirst.\n\nScore: 6/10\n\nFull review:\nWith everlasting indie gaming boom and rising survival/roguelike trend, it’s no surprise developers are trying to apply some freshness to it. Skyhill is just that – a long shot. But let’s see where it failed and where it succeeded.\n\nStarting the game, you’ll see what we call a tight budget. Reminding a Flash based browser game,  Skyhill keeps that convention. You’re welcomed with a short and lazily written story – being on a business trip, our protagonist does a little luxurious escapism in VIP room of Skyhill Hotel. Just then tragedy happens – a downpour of chemical weapons. Somehow you survived. The other inhabitants of hotel too but no longer in human form. And you’ve guessed it – it’s time to fight for your life.\n\nNow, your objective is to descend to first floor and get out of this hellhole. Of course, it is not as easy as calling an elevator to get you straight to the exit door of Skyhill. Luckily, this roguelike is not THAT shallow. But learning quickly the ropes you’ll know what to expect soon enough. Quite honestly, it took me half an hour to realise that there won’t be anything besides what I saw in this short time.\n\nThe main flavor of Skyhill is crafting and fighting. The latter is a very simplified turn-based combat with possibility of choosing where you want to hit your enemy – giving more or less damage. Damage itself depends on your four stats. Each weapon is  bound to one or several stats. More points equals more damage. Overall, pretty basic, yet engaging.\n\nVarious mutated victims of chemical warfare aren’t your only adversaries. You’ll fight with every lifeform’s enemy – hunger. Any step you make in this 100 floor colossus takes away a portion of your hunger points. When it runs  down to zero, you start to lose health. Even when you take a snooze in your room to regain some of your hit points, your hunger grows. And it’s all about balance between wandering in hotel and keeping your hunger in check. You’ll find various items to keep you sated. Among others are weapons, meds, tools and supplies. With them you’ll be able to craft more nourishing meals, stronger weapons and improve facilities that provide better recipes and more effective, safer resting. Of course, it takes the right items to do that and you get them completely at random. Seemingly, luck is the main factor, balancing thrown out of the window.\n\nEncountering enemies is scripted much better. They range from rather harmless zombies to notoriously hard, disfigured giant. The good thing is that you can die by any of them which induces some tension, keeping you from feeling safe. Sadly, you cannot expect the riskiness and excitement of exploring every nook and cranny or peeking to an unknown room. This is one of biggest offenders of Skyhill. Every floor is just a corridor with elevator door and two rooms. 15 minutes into a game and you know there will be no surprise. True, there are random events and snippets of story but they’re forgettable at best. This applies to whole presentation. Music, sounds and graphics are just unambitious. You’ll struggle to get into the mood but it’s more of you wanting it than you experiencing it.\n\nOverall, I would lie that I didn’t enjoy playing It even with it’s shortcomings. I did enjoy it. But Skyhill is just too forgettable. I’ve managed to find the right tactics in matter of 2-3 hours along with lots of luck and finished it. After that, I didn’t feel any need or desire to come back and try higher difficulty. I’ve bought it for a fraction of it’s retail price. If I did pay it, I would feel cheated.\n","June 6","false","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
