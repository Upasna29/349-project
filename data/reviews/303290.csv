There are a lot of people to choose between and you can have routes with girls or multiple people. Sadly, there are some routes with basically no romance. (ie, the one guy who is so friendzoned that the protagonist Fuka thinks he's a girl at first)\n- you can disable your portrait if you want to be more immersed\n- there's a tonne of options in settings. Plenty of save slots, audio options for literally every character bar a few, an option to full screen and windowed mode. Also, lovely options for skipping\n- tonnes of options. I'm 20 minutes in and I've already been given 5 options.\n- super sexy and unique characters\n- a metric tonne of endings. There are bad endings and even an ending where you choose to dump a person and date another, which is insanely rare for an otome.\n- it doesn't demand you pick a person to try dating in the very beginning, which is brilliant because you get to know the people and then make a decision.\n- the heroine isn't a complete waste of space\n- there's a log of previous dialogue that you can scroll up at any time in case you miss something someone said or don't understand a character's response\n- you can name your character (this has been known to cause glitches, but the developers are very attentive and fix this as it happens)\n- there's no percentages for available romances so you go in blind\n- the characters have clearly defined personalities, no more guessing what to say randomly and being totally wrong\n\nCons\n- there's no percentages for available romances so you go in blind\n- no steam overlay and no taking screenshots\n- no steam achievements\n- no steam achievements which makes it stupidly hard to remember what endings you've actually done. There is a grand master ending unlocked after you completely finish routes, and I think a lot of people will find that hard to keep track of what they've done. (Edit - there is a CG gallery that tracks overall completion.)\n- the fullscreen mode lowers the quality of the images (slightly, not dramatically) so all the crisp screenshot examples on the steam store are not so crisp when you actually play it. It isn't bad in windowed mode or normal mode, however.\n- I've come across a few words that are itallian or similar sounding, which kind of threw me off. It's no more confusing than your typical "onee-san" but they're odd and confused me a little, at first.\n- it's really expensive, the most expensive otome I have seen on steam to date, but I feel it's deserving of the price. The only thing I can think that is remotely this quality is Amnesia, and I'd pay double for Amnesia if I had to.\n\nI'll be commenting more and editing this review as I play, but this is all I have right now.","April 29","true","106.2"," 76 of 90 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","76","90","4","9"

Just as the screenshots showcase, the art is beautiful and beautifully detailed. The options menu has plenty of changeable things (i.e, background music, effects, and voices), including, surprisingly, individual voice controls, which I didn't expect, and the ability to re-size the window box entirely or have a full-screen (which has a minor impact on quality, so I prefer windowed). It also has detailed backgrounds, interesting and unique characters, and superb voice acting.\n\nAlso, thus far, I haven't seen any major bugs or translation issues; though there are a few instances where the dialogue will refer to the default Heroine name rather than the name you chose--but that's rather minor, IMO.\n\nOverall--if you're a fan of a) otome Visual Novels, b) stories or games based on or around fairy-tales, and c) a thoroughly enjoyable experience, I wholly recommend OZMAFIA!!.\n\nUPDATE(April 30th): Also, for a perspective on length, my first route took me almost 7 hours. Needless to say, it was a blast.\n\nUPDATE(May 1st): It seems that the mistake of the game showing the default Heroine name rather than your own has been fixed. It never really bothered me much, but I'm happy that they care about their costumer's enjoyment so much.","April 29","true","33.8"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","33","37","2","4"

With so many characters to choose from, and 2-4 endings each (none of which are technically "bad"), there's enough story there to more than justify the cost.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone. There's plenty of violence and blood all throughout, and while it's mostly written and not really gory there are some bloody sprites, and CGs that might make people uncomfortable. The True Ending is also exceptionally violent, even considering the rest of the game.\n\nThere are also two drugging scenes, and another scene that was likely the result of a drugging. There's implied ♥♥♥♥, prostitution, and one of the routes made me seriously uncomfortable. But that's only in two routes out of about ten, both of which are easy to avoid. You're warned away repeatedly in one, and here's a tip to avoid the other without spoiling too much: leave the married guy alone.\n\nBut with ten routes (thirteen if you count the secondary routes for the three Ozes) there's bound to be something you'll enjoy. There're a couple star-crossed loves, an adorable friendship, and an entertainingly sarcastic jerk. Or the brothel, if you're into that; just because I disliked it doesn't mean that you will. There are some really funny moments, and while the main character isn't very bright, she's almost always enjoying herself.\n\nOverall I had fun with it, and unless you’re really bothered by the things I mentioned earlier I think you will, too.","May 1","true","77.0"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","25","27","5","0"

I've been waiting for this release since probably around January when I was looking around for new games to play when I saw a tumblr page on it about it being released on steam soon.\n\nAnd here I am! The moment it was released, I immediately bought the game and got it started up!\n\nOverall, I'm very happy about this game being released and everything about it is absolutely gorgeous in my eyes despite it just being released.\n\nAnd the music is so beautiful and gorgeous as well, I could listen to it forever. To be honest, I sometimes come onto the store page JUST to listen to the video for the song. The art is amazing and I absolutely love that it's made by the same person who did the art for Diabolik Lovers.","April 29","true","56.6"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","27","33","3","0"

For what I have played I can easily say that it's money well spent. When I first spied this game in the upcoming games list I knew that I had to have it and I knew that I was willing to pay up to $40 for it. It looks like a high end title to me, it doesn't look like a VN that's going to take me 2-3 hours per route to complete and I'm so happy that I'm right.\n\nIt takes me back to the good otome games, the ones that are released for the Vita and the 3DS. The otome games like Amnesia, Code Realize, Norn9, and Hakuoki. I was instantly taken back to the building up feeling, the thought that I actually have to work for the guy's affection. I actually have to take the dang time to get to know the men of the game and it feels great to be playing such a title once again. I want more titles like this to come to America.\n\nA lot of people fret over grammar issues in VN's that are released on steam, I don't blame you. They suck, they just do. Ozmafia laughs at them, they say "We have a beautiful art style and excellent grammar, we make portraits for unimportant characters." This game is so detailed that shopkeepers that we don't see at all really, have portraits drawn up for them to give us more of a visual aspect to it. I was super impressed, the music is pleasant as well.\n\nMy main complaint is small I must admit, the female (Fuka) isn't voiced. All of the male characters are voiced, including unimportant characters, and even all of the female characters are voiced, except for Fuka. She's not and she's the main character, so this sadens me.\n\nThis is a minor complaint and it doesn't take away much if anything from the game for me. The CG's are obviously gorgeous and given out like candy, the backgrounds can be a little lackluster but the character modules are to die for. I remember a moment when Kyrie didn't have his hat on and then he picked it up and put it on, the module instantly changed to one with his hat on, simple details that made me smile.\n\nThe characters themselves seem very interesting. It's your typical "Who do you want to see today?" kind of game that doesn't feed you the right answer to the choices. I love that. Each character is unique and takes on a classic fairy tale like character ranging from Puss in Boots to Hansel and Gretal.\n\nBuy it.\n\nEspecially buy it now since it's on sale.\n\nThank you for reading.","April 29","true","23.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","4"

The voice acting tends to cut off in some scenes but that's not really an issue if you're used to it. Having a lot of characters to choose from and routes to go through it has 26 endings not including the Epilogue. I find most of the side characters okay but Ande was really annoying -_-'\n\nOverall I had fun going through the many stories and endings this game had.","May 9","true","48.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Now translated and localized to English by Mangagamer, I now fully enjoyed being immersed in this exciting fairytale spin-off.\n\nThere are 12 attainable characters. 10 endings not counting bad ends and divergent routes (so there are more than 10 endings).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehGartonator/recommended/303290/","TehGartonator","Tiffles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehGartonator/","88 products in account","TL;DR. 10/10, One of the best Otomes of all time. Well realised characters with fantastic development, attractive visuals and settings, wonderfully deep and intriguing universe and a brilliant soundtrack. Somewhat pricey as far as Otomes go, but it's well worth the cost.\nFirst of all, a friendly "screw you" to all of the spoilers in the reviews. No matter how small they were, they dulled my experience in what should have been powerful scenes quite a bit. I'll do my very best to sell this game while spoiling nothing.\n\nThere are so many routes to choose from, and unlike some games, this one isn't overly ambiguous about which route you're being locked on to. It has a very user-friendly interface that allows you to select a character to spend time with. Which means, if you hang out with someone and change your mind, you still have time to find someone else to cling to! I've finished 4 playthroughs and completed 30-something percent of the gallery. There's a really cool system (which, admittedly, pads out the length a little) grants characters additional scenes on your second playthrough with them. It also seperates these scenes with unique loading screens so you know when you can safely stop skipping. Each route has multiple endings and there are way more routes with specific entry requirements. I accidentally landed on one of these, and it was absoloutely fantastic.\n\nSo with that in mind, I've received about 9 endings so far, and have only actively hung out with 4 characters. And with each new route, I've learned so much more about everything and everyone and it's only deepened my curiosity about the universe and the charachers.\n\nThe art style is vaguely reminiscent of Valkyria Chronicles, in the sense that it's like that of a storybook. The colours are somewhat watery and there are sometimes little blotches of colour on the screen. It might sound a little distracting but in actual fact, it's a fantastically subtle touch and it only emphasises the already impressive visuals. Every character is beautifully designed, with unique qualities matching their personalities. The backgrounds are pleasing to look out with enough detail to tell you where conversations are taking place, but not enough to be distracting, which is a nice balance.\n\nThe soundtrack, though simplistic and somewhat limited, is still very good. It's not "run off and buy" good, but it compliments the game wonderfully and I think it more than lives up to everything else that the game does so well.\n\nI can't recommend this enough. It's a great Otome for anyone, whether you're a veteran or new to the genre, and I really wanted to get a review out there with no spoilers. Hopefully there aren't any big spoilers. I'm still mad that some routes were spoiled for me :c","May 5","true","10.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

His route almost killed me though..... I don't know if my heart can take another play through if each one hits you this hard in the feels. Usually, I don't care for love triangles but that one got me good.\nI actually wept. T-T\n\nOverall I have very few complaints. In any other VN, I probably would have considered this main character to be too dumb but I liked this game so much as a whole that it really didn't bother me. After a while, it was actually endearing when taken in context with her condition (as cliche as it is). The other characters even comment on her naivete like "wow, how do you not know this stuff? It's pretty basic" which I think helped sell the MC to me. There were times I wished she had more speaking parts that weren't one word answers or her repeating what someone said, but again, all the good bits of the game allowed me to overlook its flaws.\n\nI really enjoyed the music. Every track feels like it fits the scene and they are all fantastic.\n\nAbsolutely loved the charater designs, voice acting, artwork and overall the plot was really enjoyable.\n\nAnyway, my head is still swimming and I'm having trouble finding more words to explain why I adore this game.\nJust buy it, It's worth every penny.\n\nTLDR\nPros:\nGeorgeous artwork\nLovely soundtrack\nVoice acting\nClever modernizations of classic characters\nRoutes are LONG (Axel's took me almost 6 hours to complete.

That said, this otoge has fantastic art, and I like the character designs. Not only that, the voice acting is great. It's also well-written, with only a handful of relatively small errors that I've run into. I've been looking forward to this game ever since I first saw it pop up on Steam, and I'm really enjoying it so far. The only things that really bother me are that the storytelling is in third person, and the voices are just nonexistent for some scenes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/momokeen/recommended/303290/","momokeen","momokeen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/momokeen/","146 products in account","I hardly ever write reviews, but felt that this one was necessary.  At the time of this review, I've completed one route, which took 5.5 hours.  I loved this game!  As another reviewer has said before me, this was really the full otome experience, harkening back to games like Amnesia and Hakuoki, Dandelion and Nameless.  After playing mobile otome games for the past few months since I don't have a PSP, this was a more than welcomed change, the depth and length (bow-chicka-bow-wow?) of the storyline dwarfing the typical mobile experience, leaving me more than satisfied with the time spent.\n\nRight off the bat, the artwork really stands out.  The light watercolor-esque designs of the characters, settings, and CGs lend a luminosity to the experience despite the darkness of the storyline in places.  The music is inobtrusive and atmospheric, and the characters are well-developed, nuanced, and dynamic.  The inter-character relationships are well-developed from the start too, and the dialogue is realistic, really well-translated, and quite funny!\n\nThe MC, Fuka (renamable), is pretty vapid, though her cheerful air-headedness certainly makes for some pretty funny situations, especially when placed against Caesar or sharp-witted Kyrie.  Her complacency bothered me a little, as I'd have thought someone who lost all of her memories and woke up in a strange place where no one knows her would kind of want to work on figuring stuff out, but she's just as content to let the Oz family take care of her like a pampered housepet, which more than one character points out to her.\n\nI enjoyed the adaptations of the Oz "Main Three" for this game: The Cowardly Lion has earned his courage, yet lacks brains; The Scarecrow has a razor-sharp wit, yet in all other ways lacks a heart; The Tinman has a heart, but lacks courage and is very shy in the face of love.  It's little tweaks like this that really made this game unique and its characters quite endearing to me.\n\nRelationships are built slowly and, for the most part, blindly (there are no heart gauges or affection menus), letting you get to know the characters like you're peeling the layers off of an onion (or a cake, or a parfait!), until you reach their rich, nougaty center.  (Why does this onion have a nougat center?  What has happened here?)\n\nSunday is the only day of the week that the mafia famiglie agree on a strictly imposed peace (violations punishable by death in some cases), and allow you to visit with a character of your choice in order to build your relationship.  I started off picking Caesar whenever possible, apparently because I have a predilection for things like Hybristophilia and Stockholm Syndrome.  JKlulz ~ I just really really love tsundere characters, and what can be more tsun tsun than a guy who's literally trying to kill you, amirite?  (sigh)  Courting the literal Big Bad Wolf on the Sunday Compromise starts out as an exercise in futility.  Over the weeks that you visit him every Sunday, there certainly were moments that I doubted that the appeals to Caesar's humanity would prove fruitful, as they must, considering he's like a viable romanceable character, but I was rewarded in the end for my foolhardy persistence.  That being said, I could totally see how a bad ending would be possible if you weren't thorough enough with your good choices.  My advice, as always, is to quick save at the choice and wait for the affirming "ding".  Without playing the other routes, I just felt like you walk a very, very fine line between love and impending doom in this route, Caesar sometimes playing the caged animal peering out from between the bars all too well.  On the other hand, once you've won him over completely, he's fiercely loyal and unarmingly sweet, though still a blustering, self-important tsundere character, no matter what anyone says, huffing and puffing like the Big Bad Wolf should.\n\nIn short, Ozmafia!! is a well-designed, beautiful otome experience that both rookies and veterans alike would enjoy, as well as fans of fairy tales, manga, and anime.","May 1","true","15.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

The game has very beautiful art, a lot of play time and I like how there's so many different routes. There's at least around 8 (not sure how many brothel chars there are you can play) playable characters. The 3 main characters alone get 4 routes each. Because there's so many, I think it was a good choice that there is no "super heartbreaking" bad ending. It ends on a bittersweet note but still I would say it is a favorable outcome. This is really good for those really worried about bad endings (like me).\n\nIt's also a game I could recommend to people who are new to otome games. Oh, also, this game is only partially voiced so not every single line has the characters talking. From experience, I think it is 60%-70% voiced? The UI is simple, but still pretty enough and very easy to use. I think it was translated pretty well and from what I remember, not much (or was there any at all? if there were, it is rare) typographical errors. Again, this is only speaking from my experience with the 3 main playable characters, not sure about the rest.\n\nIt's a bit on the pricier end, but seeing as I paid even way more for other games in CDN dollars, I feel this is really, really worth the price.","April 30","true","43.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Still, no regrets buying it. Now, firstly, some personal criticisms, then some good :3\n\nTo put some relevance and potentially be helpful as a comparison, some of my favorite otomes/VNs are The Second Reproduction, Nameless, Dandelion and Cupid and I don't think OZMAFIA!! surpassed any of those frankly (and two of those games are basically free). I like story-rich plots and hate games with tons of unanswered questions and plotholes, and found too many of the latter even after finishing every. single. route. of this game.\n\nNow some things I enjoyed about OZMAFIA!! (I seriously can't help exclaiming the title every time I read and/or type it out ~0~;;).\n- The sprites are absolutely GORGEOUS. Some of the prettiest sprites I've seen even though the guys remind you of Diabolik Lovers but less...sadistically crazy lol so definite plus in my book\n- The voice acting was also done well, especially those by Pashet, the 3 OZ boys, Hamelin, and Scarlet, just a shame it's only partially voiced but I went into the game knowing that so didn't mind the missing portions as much as others.\n- TONS of routes, and not all of them are romantic per se...I'd advise following a walkthrough if you're a completionist like me\n- MC isn't a doormat and she's actually pretty hilarious at times with a lot of spunk and appropriately cued stubbornness. She is also adorably optimistic, albeit somtimes naively so, but I actually didn't mind her naivité as much as I would in other games because her sanguine disposition was pleasantly infectious. I also liked the fact that she's somewhat AWARE of her present uselessness and tries making up for it somehow, unlike a lot of other amnesiac characters.\n\nTL;DR: I'm guilty for over-thinking a lot of details in games, books, shows, life in general (lulz sigh), so I tend to nitpik when something just has too many unanswered details/plot-hole inconsistencies, which is why I felt a tad unsatisfied at the end with this game. But, if you go into this game not expecting much depth but a pretty decent way to pass time by looking at pretty sprites/cgs and listening to decent VAs, this game is worth playing. Regardless of it all, if you like otomes half as much as I do, I definitely recommend buying this game at some point (especially when it's on sale) to support the release of future otomes :)","May 15","true","61.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have done all of the romances (I have yet to finish all the possible different endings). The game itself looks pretty and seems promising at first. I will say now that it took me awhile to get through all the romances because I got bored. I don't think it is a terrible game but I didn't particulary enjoy it myself. The romances were dull at times and disturbing at some points. There was only one romance I enjoyed and that was caesar, the rest were a bit dull or weren't neartly fleshed out enough. Despite having a great many romance options I felt very limited within the game. The protaganist was weak, indesisive, and an airhead. The story annoyed and bored me. I won't spoil anything but I was fairly dissapointed and let down by it the ending.  Now just because I myself disliked the game doesn't mean everyone will, it has gotten good reviews on here from what I have seen but don't go into it expecting anything amazing because even at it's best it was mediocre.  There were only 3 romances I even thought were semi okay and the story just annoyed me the rest of the time. I was so bored having to skip over all the repetative dialoge that I was forced to go through every single romance.   I have played better otome games and some that are much worse, so overall it's dull and repetative not something I enjoyed or would play again.","May 9","false","23.3"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","13","22","2","0"

Worth the $30-40 in my pocket. Nice art, soundtracks, characters, story line, character developments, AND "many characters to choose from". 11/10, a perfect otome game. (BTW, nice humour you've added in the game XD).\nI laughed most of the time while I was playing this, because of seeing Axel getting jealous and shy, Kyrie bashing out what he wants to say sadistically, Scarlet trying to act tsundere,  AND  many much more. I'll be honest here  I didn't regret buying this game, I had fun with it because of--- nearly everything  XD. Also, it really was worth off those $30-40 in my pocket, so many character's to choose from, so I give you  9/10   (-1 for Hansel and Aelling not having a route ; -;) . But, I won't mind about Hansel or Aelling having a route now, that I'm reviewing this.  If one buys the game and play it, I don't think that they WON'T be tempted to do other routes at the same time they're doing their current route character... .  (Look at me, I'm doing 2-3 characters in the same time) .\n\nOver-all : 11/10 for the otome game itself || 9/10 for all the character ROUTES || 11/10 for all the CHARACTERS/CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT || 9000/10 for the humour. I had a good laugh XD\n\nIf Poni-Pachet or Rejet  releases  another otome game to Steam,  I'd gladly buy it with my own money!  I'm hoping to see more otome games being localized! :3  (Especially if it'll be Diabolik Lovers or any version of that game *cough* XD)","May 5","true","15.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The visuals were stunning, the concept was interesting and the reviews were overall pretty decent.\n\nUnfortunately the game itself was not what I had been anticipating and certainly was not worth the 35 bucks I invested.\n\nThe good: The character designs are pretty, you are provided with a lot of different route options, and the game definitely makes you work to get more of the story. Ozmafia is heavily romance-driven as opposed to plot-driven so if that's your preference I'd say it also can count as a positive feature. Oh and....the soundtrack is pretty nice.\n\nThe bad: LOADING SCREENS. ALL. THE. TIME. No seriously..... there were times where I read about 10 lines of dialogue and I hit a loading screen. All of that waiting gets extremely frustrating......especially when the plot gets extremely dry. Speaking of the plot........if I had to sum it up....I'd say the plot is basically a glorified slice of life anime with fairy tale references and the occasional fight scene. So for those of you (like me) who were expecting something with a little more depth and creativity...this is not the game for you. Unfortunately the characters are also severely lacking in notable development which makes them a lot more two dimensional. In particular, the main character is extremely undeveloped and almost entirely unrelateable. To top it off...... the game is also NOT fully voiced.\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this title to otome gamers with a thirst for some mindless romance and pretty visuals. I'd also recommend those who are interested in this title to purchase it after it lowers in price. However, if you are looking for a compelling visual novel that has it all....Ozmafia is not the title for you.\n\n","May 12","false","5.2"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

If you're a CG completionist the game makes you want to play every route.\nLovely cast of VAs. The game is not fully voiced, but you do have full scenes of voice work vs games where you just get 'hey' 'oh' bits voiced in full sentences. All of the important and heart clenching parts are voiced.\nA lot of cusomization options to personalize your reading experience. You have options such as choosing text speed, a volume master that includes individual character controls, and even being able to disable the Protagonist's character sprite.\n20+ endings as described in the overview. You have good and what I call 'bittersweet' endings for each route.  If you unlock one ending for each character you get a fully voiced epilogue and if you unlock all endings (including the switch route endings!) you are given a fully voiced grand finale!\nThe game brings some more adult themes that localized Otome games severely lack. I have no problem with endearing otome games depicting a pure and innocent love, but the localized Otome industry is severely lacking in adult content. While most games dance around certain topics in the writting and leave you guessing---its really nice to see (at least in some of the routes) a more adult relationship portrayed. And to answer your inevitable question: No, this game does not have H-scenes. At the same time, however, it does not shy away from adult topics and telling you outright that our protagonist has sexual encounters with her lover (Or multiple lovers--holy moly I still can't believe the brothel route is a thing that actually happened). I do consider this a step in the right direction to show the industry that girls DO want 18+ otome games localized.\nPro/Cons Depending on your Perspective Constant Loading screens can get a little annoying on your first playthrough but they become EXTREMELY handy when speeding through your second run and onwards.  After completing a route for the first time you will unlock bonus mini-scenes that add to the character/story.  You'll notice a mini-scene via the blue silhouettes vs the usual orange.\nThe Oz Love Triangles. The writting gets a little hasty and is not paced very well in my opinion. It just adds a little quick drama to a story that was already progressing just fine. When you do switch the writing is short and doesn't really give you much time to attach to the new love interest before reaching of the two endings. Its not all bad, however. The game provides different pre-triangle stories per route per intended rival (i.e. Your beginning to date Kyrie scenarios are different depending on if Axel or Caramia is your 2nd runner in affection). ALSO If you do switch you get a bit more information on the boys that isn't present in their main routes as well as some CGs.\nThe game is written in 3rd person vs the usual 1st person for visual novels. I know a lot of readers prefer a more immersed experience and this can disrupt that.\nThe Bad:The story gets a little confusing at times and it leaves you questioning a few things even after the Grand Finale. What happens to Ceaser and Hamelin? Is Fuka/Protagonist considered ruling class?Given the amount of quality content, OZMAFIA!! Is definitely worth the price tag (and is actually even more in JP so we actually have it at a 50% price drop). Please give OZMAFIA!! a chance and support the visual novel localization industry!","May 29","true","118.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Truthfully, I haven't completed the game yet, but so far I have to say it's pretty good. The story its self has a strong Fairy Tale theme. Obivious by the Oz Family and the Grimm Family. Oz family made up of the characters of Wizard of Oz, and indirectly stated through out the game. Grimm family made up of Hansel, Gretel, and Scarlet (which I so far think is like the boy version of Little Red Riding Hood). Which leads me to believe that every character is based off a Fairy Tale character, so I've set out on a mission to see who is who (cause they change so of the names, which is seen through the Oz family). Also, there seems to be a narrator here and there to imply time passing and so on, surprisingly it is not annoying at all either, it actually boosts its Fairy Tale theme and feeling!\n\nAbout the game, there are some translations which throw me off by how odd they are, for example they use signorina for ojou-sama/ojou-san which is kinda weird o.o I have to say the story is good and the translation still gives a good vive to the game (I mean it's a good translation, just odd at times). It's also kinda sending you in blind not telling you how far you are with one characters and the others (you know, like a love bar). It's ok not having one, it's just nice to see one, you know? It would also be nice to have some Steam Achievements (IDK why, but I love to look at them once I finish a route). However, these are very minor things, and overall so far I really love the game!

Very positive feeling since the beginning.\n\nHowever, I would like to notice that the character's voices are only there 70% of the time (as the developer said in the discussion), so there would be awkward moments of silent. It's nice that the background music are there, but still, for the price I paid, I kind of expecting much better voicing for the characters.\n\nThe first route I'm taking is Axel's route, and I haven't finished yet. I will update my review later on for other routes. However, my first choice might be in the 30% that wasn't voiced, since there were a lot of time where there is just silent and background music going on (sorry to keep nagging, but yeah, I'm disappointed abt this).\n\nOn the other hand, the plot for Axel's route (or at least I thought I'm in Axel's route) is well written, there are interesting moments and enough cuteness that keep me move forwards. The plot was a bit confusing at first, then gradually gets better (spoiler alert: probably because I chose him everytime, so there a disconnection where I was with him then with another character a moment later on, without any leading line or connection(?)).\n\nJust finished all endings of Axel's route. The plot gradually gets better as you advanced further into the story. There was drama and twist along, therefore, the game becomes more attractive. Definitely compensate for the lack of voicing.

Secondly, the loading screens are so frequent, the worse I've had it was for Axel's route, he said one sentence, then the dorothy and three companions pops up, with a short version of the theme song.

This allows me to say without a doubt that it's amazing the depth and story that's gone into each and every route and ending. It's really superb. Even replaying parts to get to other endings, there's always something new to catch your attention.\n\nIt's worth every penny and more and if I've spent over 13 hours on just two characters, what more with the rest of them? Value for money doesn't even cut it for the story and art and music. This game is excellent. It certainly stands proudly beside others like it such as Hakuoki and Amnesia in my opinion and it's a strong contender to becoming my favourite one.","May 2","true","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now that it is out, I am happy to say that the wait was worth it! The game itself is very entertaining and fun; the character choices are unique and diverse, making each route fun to go through. The options allow you to change individual volume for the characters, and there are plenty of save slots for the different characters and routes! I am looking forward to going through all the characters and completing their routes. Definitely recommend if you like visual novels/otome games.","April 30","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I've finished two routes so far - receiving one of Axel's main endings and a transferred ending from Axel's route to Kyrie's ending. If that last statement sounded confusing to you, it basically means that you can choose to cheat on your main route and go towards an alternate route with the guy you cheated with. Woah!\n\n\nSome Pros:\n- Beautifully drawn\n- Likeable and attractive characters\n- MANY options and routes; it's fun going back to see what choices lead to which story\n- If you get one ending, you can go back and see small side stories to what the guy was thinking during each event\n- Good theme song\n- Not an innocent lovey dovey romance; can get "steamy" at times\n- Love triangles\n- Heroine is pretty; you can name her\n\nSome Cons:\n- The story leading up to one guy can be draggy and long\n- The loading screen can get annoying.\n- Wish there was a more variety in music, but nbd\n- Heroine's facial expressions don't really match the mood/tone of the text at times\n- You might dislike it if you absolutely hate adultery in otome games (cheating is possible)\n\nAll in all, I really like this game so far, and it was totally worth the sale price. I would still list Hakuoki, Amnesia, and Norn9 over Ozmafia but I think it's definitely better than Code:Realize (which I had a very hard time liking because of the heavy story > romance type of deal). Ozmafia has a good balance of story, romance, and beautiful graphics.","April 30","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So far I’m 3 hours in. It feels like I’m still trying to adjust living in a strange world and meeting its people. I’m at a point where it felt like I ended someone’s life and that’s the end of the route but that didn’t happen. If it ended like that, then I would had been very upset for play something that I just started to get the hang of it and all of the sudden my favorite character dies. Instead, the story continues and now that character is finally starting to warm up to me~ :)\n\nI enjoy being immersed into the mafia town setting with its fairy tale characters. All the characters have different personalities which makes the story fun, interesting, and amusing. Like how I wouldn’t personally want to mess with a person like Heidi but hearing Heidi’s dialogue is hilarious! Even minor characters get character portraits which means the creator puts in lots of thought into the details of their game.\n\nI have very few complaints but none that would prevent me from buying the game. Considering the high quality art, beautiful music, huge range of characters that get voiced, and long routes (a route is about 3 hours for most visual novels I’ve played so far and like I said before I’m at the 3 hour mark and haven’t even finished Axel route yet finally finished first playthrough which took me 9 hours) I say the price is fair. It’s a visual novel that otome fans would enjoy.\n\nPros\n+a range of different character personalities\n+characters partially voiced (Even though I’m not fluent in Japanese, I didn’t noticed it. Except for the part where you first meet Soh and a chunk of dialogue has no voice but afterwards you’ll hear his voice again. Well, any voicing is a plus for me since it gives the characters more personality) I noticed this happening more after I played 3 hours so it's not a bug that some dialogue are not vocied.\n+appealing artwork\n+lovely music\n+you aren’t forced to choose a guy to start with/stick to their route until the end and you choose who you want to spend time with on “Sundays”\n\nCons\n-fullscreen = lower quality (but I don’t mind playing in windowed mode)\n-some voices are low even at max (I tried lowering the background music but then I wouldn’t be able to enjoy the music and at the same time I want to hear them both so I just beared with everything at default settings)\n-doesn’t keep track of routes you finished\n-just realized there’s no gallery to collect CGs you’ve seen?

I believe this was their first game as well so I really applaud them for the hard work they put into it because it’s certainly not an easy task for just two people to make a visual novel with hours of content.\n\nI found the main premise of the story to be interesting. I’m always a sucker for fairy tales and adding the mafia setting makes it even better lol! It’s great since no character is necessarily good nor bad, it’s your choice to decide that based on how you interpret their actions. However, I felt that the plot was kind of all over the place.One of the main issues I had with this game is that they would jump from one scene to another very quickly. On my first route I literally saw that eye catch above every 5 minutes. Because there are always a lot of transitions and things get cut off to move to another scene, I had a hard time seeing a romantic development with Fuka and certain guys (not all, but for some it felt so out of no where). There’s also the love triangle routes between the Oz guys. Personally, I didn’t have an issue with them, but I know there are many people that may be put off by it. Luckily, if you mess around with the settings in the game, you can easily skip through all dialogue even if you haven’t read through it yet if it makes you uncomfortable (same thing with the brothel route if you’re not into that either).\n\nMoving on to the characters, which I always feel is the most important part for me in any game, I have to say that I really enjoyed reading and learning more about all of them. They were all unique and even though some presented morally ambiguous traits and actions, I found myself sympathizing with a lot of them once I got to know more about them. Some characters which I didn’t expect to like ended up high in my favroites because of how well I felt their routes were written My top three favorites were Caesar, Kyrie, and Axel! Honorable mention goes to Pashet because of the super sweet friendship she developed with Fuka!\n\nYou may find yourself questioning certain things in some routes, but if you play everyone’s route and get all their endings, you can begin to piece things together. Then when you reach the grand finale, a lot of your questions will be answered so it’s highly recommended you read it. I absolutely loved the grand finale because there were things I wasn’t expecting at all and it really blew me away. The grand finale is not necessarily the happiest or best ending. In fact, I found it to be rather bittersweet, but I still loved it nonetheless because of how it ties things together. In conclusion, I think Ozmafia!! is a wonderful otome game and I would recommend anyone who loves otome games to give it a chance. Not only was it a fun story from beginning to end, but it will also show companies that otome games can be successful overseas!","May 1","true","30.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LorenaFA/recommended/303290/","LorenaFA",".:|:Lorena:|:Ray:|:.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LorenaFA/","133 products in account","Mkay, first off - I'm a veteran to otome games, so I'm probably a bit more critical/hardened to certain things.\n\nThat said:\n\nGameplay 4/10 - Most of the alternate routes are repeats of the main route, minus the love triangle endings, and the paths although basic (2-3 options at best) are meticulous. As in you miss one single choice and you've messed up getting the route you're after. Also the game crashed a total of 6 times, usually directly after the intro video, but one time it was just a grey screen.\n\nThis game leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, because for the price I expected something more polished. There's no option to re-watch the route's paths after finishing them, There is nothing to do after finishing the game and getting the final endings, and even the final end left me going "Ugh... How cheap."\n\nI'll also mention that this game is 100 percent otome. There are a few paths with eroge text, but it's very much softcore, and not too big of a deal unless you're ONLY into romance. The "dark" paths in this game are really tame compared to other ones, so it's a good one to start with imo.\n\nMusic 6/10 - The music in this game isn't bad, but if you're skipping already seen text, there's overlap issues - and that gets a bit annoying at times.\n\nVoice - 5/10 - Half of the scenes are NOT fully voiced which makes the auto-skip kind of annoying to use since without turning the autoskip to full. Some places were fine, but for the large paragraphs I did have to scroll back. That got annoying.\n\n* The other issue I had with this was a personal one. Fuka/MC's voice actor was terrible imho. I don't mind voiced MC's, but I literally set her volume down to mute. Luckily you can turn down individual character's voices, because ugh gross.\n\nCharacters: 7/10\n\nI don't want to use spoilers, but I will say that the Oz character "True" paths were all irritating to me towards the end of the route. The only thing that made them better was the "love triangle" endings although even they were lacklustre in a lot of ways. Also - I did not like playing through any of Pashet's routes. They felt like an after thought, and boring in comparison to the other routes. It really just left me empty.\n\nMost of the characters too - I had difficulty figuring out what character types they were. A lot of them felt extremely basic and one dimensional which made it hard for me to actually care what happened to them/with them. The designs are really nice, but the actual text made the characters seem really boring and it made it hard to figure it out.\n\nMy recommendation: If you're into these games... Get this one only if it's on sale - I personally think $40.00 CAD is way too much for this game, when you can spend a little less on games with WAY better end-game content and a much more stable game system... It's got quite a few flaws to work out with the crashing thing, and It would be better if the Dev's added some extra options. The replayability of this is pretty low.","June 6","true","30.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had high hopes for this game but had to wait a couple of days after release to get it.\nMy first impressions of this game are far from great. While I've barely played through the intro, the thing that really stands out in my mind as a negative I might not be able to get past is the fact is narrated in the third person. For an Otome game where you're supposed to put your self in the heroines place, it really distanced me from the leading lady. Not only that, it even made me want to stop playing. I'm going to try and battle through that initial uneasy feeling because I know this Otome VN has some dark themes and that interests me, but I have to say, I'm finding it hard to soldier on. I might change this review later if I'm able to get over my language hangups.\nApart from that, it seems a pretty good VN, one of the best if you can get over the dark themes and third person dialogue.","May 6","false","10.3"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","0"

You may think completely different, and that is 100% okay!\n\nSo I was very much excited for this game. The music sounded cute, the art was absolutely stunning and the story seemed really awesome! Fairytales and a dating sim? Heck yeah I'm down for this! So I bought it the day it came out.\n\n.. and refunded it about 2 hours later. I want to like it, I honestly do. But there is just so much about that either doesn't sit well for me or I just simply hate and with a price tag of over $30 I just can't justify buying a game I'm not in love with.\n\nSome problems I had included very minor things like spelling mistakes, the default name being said which was rather jarring, the third person perspective was okay at first but I felt so disconnected from the Protagonist that I couldn't get as interested in the story as I'd liked, and around the 2 hour mark my game wouldn't stop lagging, which really surprised me.\n\nBut the most jarring thing? The actual romance. After refunding the game I looked up a quick summary/review to see what I was going to be missing out on and holy-! The amount of NTR in this game is awful, and some of it is impossible to avoid, which really didn't sit well with me.\n\nAgain, this is my own opinion and don't let this stop you from purchasing it. Am I glad I refunded it? Yes. Completely. Would I purchase this again in the future? Honestly, yes.

I'd recommend anyone who's interested to try it out for yourselves first instead of basing your decision on reviews only. While I usually enjoy more story-driven visual novels, Ozmafia offered some interesting plot and gameplay elements that entertained me a lot. I've been interested in this game for a while so I was thrilled when I found out about the English release. I mistakenly assumed that we'd get a localization/port of the newer and improved PSVita version, which, unfortunately, we didn't and I think that was probably the biggest source of disappointment for me.\n\n\nWhat I like:\n- visuals\n- mafia/fairytale theme\n- big cast of characters\n- variety in relationships\n\nThe visuals is what initially caught my eye and got me interested. I love Satoi's art, it's just somethign that appeals to me 100%. The combination of mafia and fairytales also sounded intriguing and I was happy about the big cast, as it made me hope for some variety in relationships. I did get variety, in fact more than I thought I would. Not all routes are cute and happy stories about girls and boys falling in love; some are platonic and others address darker themes and explore different kinds of relationships. It is something that I enjoyed very much and probably what I appreciate most about this game.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- loading screens\n- pacing/presentation of the story\n- no real bad ends\n- no overview whatsoever\n\nDespite all the problematic content and hindrances some character couples have to face, there are no real bad ends for the character routes, which was kind of a disappointment for me. It also took me a while to figure out what to expect from each character and each route since the game offers no overview whatsoever. I found this to be extremely confusing considering the amount of available characters. My biggest issue, though, is the way the story is presented and paced; it's broken down into many short scenes that play one after another, divided by loading screens. These loading screens tend to be extremely annoying, even more so since some scenes consist of only four to five lines of dialogue in total. In addition to that, some scenes unlock only after playing though a route once. While this makes the second playthrough more enjoyable, I always felt like the first playthrough was kind of lacking and I couldn't appreciate the ending as much as I wanted to.\n\nneutral points\n- music\n- heroine\n- not fully voiced\n- 3rd person view\n\nI can't really say that the music is bad; if anything, I actually think it fits the setting quite well. It's just not something I enjoy personally. The game not being fully voiced didn't bother me much, althouth I will admit, that I had to get used to it at first. I expected to have issues with the 3rd person view, but even that worked out just fine. Lastly, the heroine....she is an airhead, but I can't bring myself to hate her, nor was I overwhelmingly annoyed by her (sometimes her naivety was actually kind of cute). Considering the way this game is structured, it probably wouldn't work if the heroine had a more distinctive personality.","May 15","true","65.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is insanely long and immensely satisfying (I counted 25+ endings while I was playing for 100%.). There were some endings/CGs I had trouble getting (even with a walkthrough) but I felt like it was worth it. The artwork and voice acting is high quality and the majority of characters were very loveable. No route made me bored.\n\nSome problems I remember having when I first played was how some routes cut off too abruptly (you have to replay each route at least twice to get some extra dialogue, I soon learned). And that if you used a custom name first and switched back to Fuka's name you'd have to reread the whole story all over again because each character actually says the MC's name now. Soo I kept my name throughout the whole game but I don't feel as if I missed much.\n\nHonestly the price is justified. It's a bargain compared to games with no voices for a few dollars less (now that is a rip-off lol).","May 29","true","52.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As I sit here and type this at 12:30 am I'm thinking about continuing to sit and go through another route too, haha. There were a few times this story got me to laugh out loud, and I don't think I was expecting that either. I'm glad I chose this one for my first Otome game, and I'm looking forward to playing through all the routes to learn more about the world they've built.

It managed to make me laugh. It is written from third-party point-of-view, which irked me at the beginning but once I get used to it, it's nothing.\n\nVoice acting wise, do note that this is partially voiced.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pikangie/recommended/303290/","pikangie","Fran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pikangie/","27 products in account","If you want a HIGH quality otome game, I highly recommend getting this.\nThis is NOT a mobile port, so it is actually high quality and the art is beautiful and it never has "derpy" looking CGs, only beautiful CGs. The music is very nice, and really adds to the emotions that you will feel while reading, and I think they did great timing it to the situations.\n\nYou can choose volume options for voices, so if you are like me and HATE high-pitched squealy falsetto anime girl voices, you can disable your own voice and the loli girl's voice.\n\nIf you plan to watch the anime, another one of my reasons you should get this game first, is because like almost any otome anime-adaptations, the anime will most definitely feature her super high-pitched voice and her acting like a stupid doormat (you can make smarter choices in the game), and probably will skim through some routes without the deep emotional involvement, and for sure you will not enjoy the anime as much as the game.\n\nMy only complaint with the game is that Caeser's route is short and kind of linear compared to the main 3 guys, but somehow, I liked it a LOT better.\nI've only played Caeser's and Axel's route so far, but I much preferred Caeser's.\nAxel's route started cute, but became more and more anticlimactic as it ended... It's just my own opinion though.\n\nI highly recommend Caeser if you like beautiful Kuudere-type guys(characters that start off cold/anti-social but warm up to you gradually). He also has a beautiful uniform in one ending (my favorite ending so far). His route overall had a little bit of a "Beauty and the Beast" feel to it, it was sweet.\n\nOn the other hand, if you do like the main 3 guys, you will have a great time because their routes are really long and have many alternative paths.\n\nIf you play any route a second time after finishing, you also can see the guy's perspective kind of like a behind the scenes thing.\n\nOverall, if you like fantasy-themes and Otome visual novels, definitely consider this.","May 17","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After completing every route, ending and grand ending, learning the full story, I believe it's time to give this game a proper reveiw. I can safely say that I absolutely adore this game though!\n\nAre you hungry for some more Otome game into your life? Well consider picking OZMAFIA!! up. It doesn't matter if it's on sale or full price, this game definately ranges at top along with other great Otome games such as Amensia:Memories and  Dandelion, which we got translated and transfered over to Steam so we can enjoy it in a language we all understand.\n\nYou start your journey being chased by someone mysterious. Quickly after you learn that this game is written in 3rd person, so the MC (main character - female) is not yourself, incomparison to what other Otome games do where they make the player the MC. In this game we read in the perspective of she, not I. Which I found a little strange at first, but I got used to it rather quickly.\n\nBeing chased we stumble along and faint in the arms of some mysterious men who saved your life and claims to be mafia of the Oz district/familia as they often refer to it. They ask you who you are, but then you get surprised that you have lost your memories completely, so you got no idea who, where or what this strange place is (seems kind of familiar, no?). Regardless of that, because the MC has amnesia, she does seem to be quite incompitent and annoying at first, but it gets better the further the story goes and we as players learn a little more of the universe they live in.\n\nThe Oz have offered to take care of you until you manage to gain a little more of your memories and knowledge of the town so you can fend on your own. From here on out you are supposed to go after your love interest and pick a route you find fancy. Don't be scared to pick whichever at first, because you can change whenever you want untill you only get a single character icon on the map you are forced to click on for the rest of the game. If you do this though, you might not get the TRUE/PURE ending of the game though, so you have to replay the game.\n\nBeing new to the game, I reccomend going for the Oz guys first. The reason for this is that they tell you more info about the town and how it works than the other side characters, especially Kyrie. Also don't be angry of sad that you don't manage to get the ending you want. You can just start from the beginning of the game and skip the conversation boxes you have already went through to save yourself time, but as you do that... for every character you have gotten an ending on, you get a little extra scene with more info about them. Usually they contain more backstory for the character you're pursuing a love interest with, or just in general a funny/silly conversation (I especially adore the ones with Kyrie and Caramia. The teasing never ends).\n\nIt's going to take a little time to get used to get repeated dialouge since there are so many endings to the game to get all the CGs to unlock the grand ending of the game, but that's why you have so many save slots and you must know where to save as well so you can save yourself some time. You can of course use a walkthrough to get the endings you want, but I recommend going in blind until you know you absolutely can't get that final ending you want/need. You'll get less spoilers of dialogue that way.\n\nI'm not going to spoil any more of the game than I need to, as I want this to be a helpful reveiw to anyone who's interested in buying this game... so lets get on with the summery of it all!\n(Contains minor spoilers)\n\nGOOD:\n* Each character had a lot of personality behind them - they were all each of their own. They were all their own person and had each their own goods and flaws, which made them appealing to go for. (But I seriously can't stand Ande. Sorrynotsorry...)\n* Beautiful artstyle - I feel like art style has a lot to say when you play Otome games. It's different to a book, but very similar to something like a manga and anime.\n* Good soundtrack - It wasn't boring or repetetive. It gave a good mood to each scenario that was playing out, some music tracks only played on certain routes/endings.\n* Great themes - Fairy tale + Mafia + Characters drawn by Satoi = LOVE!! I want more!\n* Taking a risk by adding the 'Brothel' route to the game - it makes it dark and sexy, but I thought it was too short and disapointing that none of the main Ozes tried to save you except for the very end where nothing happened in the end.\n* A lot of save space\n\nBAD:\n* Not fully voice-acted! - Not a major whoop, as some Otome games don't have voice actors at all, but this game being at a steep price, even more expensive than Amnesia, I thought it would at least have full voice-acting. It did not.\n* Voices were either too quiet or music too loud - It was annoying and hard to tell what the cause was. Sometimes the characters whisper in certain scenes and I get that their voices should be more quiet, but they are waaay too quiet sometimes. And it even happens when they don't whisper!\n* No bad endings! - There was no risk for you to die or get rejected on any of the routes (except for brothel). You always got some sort of happy ending, and none of the characters would go into madness/ragefit or crazy, which is what other Otome games do to make a bad ending. (Would have loved to see how yandere Caramia would turn out if he went crazy in his lion mode! <3)\n* The story was lackluster - However the characters kept me going into playing this game.\n* No translation on the CG gallery - it has voices but no subs, Amnesia managed to sub theirs so why not this game too?\n* No way to watch progress with the character you are interested in - it makes the game hard to remember if you are doing good or bad, or check which ending you're leaning towards until the very end of the story.\n* The translation was off or weird to someone who is familiar to japanese words - As with most Otome games being translated to english, there are prone to be some errors, but in this game it was almost stupidly obvious. I seriously don't understand what the deal is with the german/italian translations to words which were said and meant differently in japanese.\nI'm going to list the ones I remember:\nDon - it means "boss", in jap they say "Boss", but wrote in the subs that it was "don", I had no idea what it meant until later into the game and listening to the voices.\nMafiosi - it means Mafia, but they write it either as mafiosi or mafios, In jap they say "Mafia/Mafio" so why change it?\nSignorina - In jap they say "Ojo-san" which is another word for "Miss" or "My lady". I know that Signorina is basically the same thing, but it's not what you say in english!\nGrazie/danke - Why couldn't the translation just say "thanks/thank you"? They literally say "Sankyu" which is a slang term in jap for the english "thank you".\n\nAll in all, I still love this game, I can't get enough of the characters.. So I do hope we get an OZMAFIA!! 2 game in the future. Also... I wish the makers good luck with airing the anime of this game in july 2016!
