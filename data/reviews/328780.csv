But beware, you have Vampires can only turn right or left and others will be happy to go straight ahead. It can become quite tricky when you have to save 5 vampires on the same level.\n\nHardcore gamer or not, you will have fun with this one and for $4.99 it is a great pastime.\n\nThe positives:\n\n-	Great game atmosphere (music, sound effects)\n-	Easy to learn\n-	9 levels with 8 sub-levels\n-	32 achievements to unlock\n-	Only $4.99\n-	Downloadable content\n\nThe Negative:\n\n-	Can be frustrating in some levels\n\nOverall, you must help those vampires to safety or you will have blood on your hands! A great game to have in your library.\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE","November 5, 2014","true","3.5"," 51 of 64 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","51","64","0","4"

To start with the latter, you will be challenged: Both mentally and in skill, it's genuinely demanding and only the finest will ever 100% this game.\n\nNow casuals will have a blast, it's kind of cute despite its ghoulish theme and the game is easy to understand. It's perfect for a 'quick run', most levels don't take more than a minute to complete so you can just jump in and play for any period of time.\n\nThe game itself is hard to describe. I don't think I've ever played anything like it. There are some tower defense elements, a pinch of 'puppetmaster', a healthy dose of Lemmings and some influences from Orcs Must Die!. That may sound weird, it probably is weird, but it still makes for a very decent game.\n\nNot knowing how/if the difficulty will ramp up, but there's plenty of gameplay for your money here. If I may give an estimate it'll keep you busy for at least 10 hours. And for 5$, that's a steal.\n\nPro's:\n- Pretty fun\n- Great art direction\n- Good value\n- Quite original\n- Can be as difficult as you want it to be\n- Trading cards\n\nCons:\n- Some mechanics seem unfair\n- Getting those gold medals can be frustrating as hell\n\n\n7.5 / 10","October 23, 2014","true","4.8"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Well there's two answers to this question:\n\n- You do? Great!! Then you can help save them from sunlight, silver bullets and hired assassins by guiding them to their lairs.\n\n- You don't? Great!! Then you can guide them into sunlight, silver bullets and hired assassins to your hearts content.\n\nWhether you love or hate them, Vampires: guide them to safety is a fun and challenging puzzle game that's great to kill a few minutes or even spend an hour or two on. With increasingly difficult chapters which add new dangers and new tricks to use, it's certainly no walk in the park. More like a walk in a cemetary, at night, in the fog..... with odd sounds and a wolf howling.","October 25, 2014","true","3.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","13","16","3","0"

You need to be able to tell left from right in a hurry. ;)\n\nThat aside, it's a nice little puzzler, quirky, cute and smart, provided you like to test your reflexes while thinking on your feet. Personally I like my puzzles to wait in the background while I'm lazily reaching for my coffee mug, but despite the fact that I won't be playing this game much, I'm still enamoured with the concept, the puzzles, the music and the love that clearly went into this (really cheap for the amount of content) little game. So if lemmings meet reverse tower defense sounds good to you, and if you like to twitch a bit while you think, then this one might be for you.","December 9, 2014","true","0.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

Finding a solution to a puzzle is but a small part of gameplay: you then have to implement it.  It's real-time, and most of the challenge comes from having your attention divided and having to time your clicks just right, which is never something I want to see in a puzzle game.  Results can be unpredictable, which means there's a fair bit of trial and error involved.  It gets even worse when the game starts introducing randomization in the pathfinding, ensuring that you can't work out a solution ahead of time.","February 22, 2015","false","1.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

After addressing the doorman in Romanian, my attendant leads me in the club. And just as I order a drink, the sprinkler suddenly system activates, raining blood down on everyone inside. It is then that me (and the audience) realizes that everyone in the club is a vampire.\nI suddenly throw open my black-leather trenchcoat. The vampires look on my weapons opened to their view now, figure with awe, mumbling the words: "it's the Daywalker!"\n\nI pull out a shotgun and open fire on the vampires, who instantly burn to ashes when killed. When the gun is knocked out of my hands by bartender, I use a set of silver stakes to kill that dodger and more vampires, including the disk jockey. Soon all the vamps are either dead or have fled except for one; a heavyset vamp...\n\nThen I turned 'Blade' movie off and started to help old disabled vampires to cross the roads and put 'em to sleep in their cosy coffins in time.\n\nMany of them never got to rest although.. And there's even an achivement for this.\n\nVampires: Guide Them to Safety! - best vampire kids boyscout simulator around here!","April 17, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
