Set after an apocalyptic war, the world has largely been abandoned and only a remnant of civilisation remains, alongside what's left of a hostile robot army.The setting is at times stunning. The skeletal remains of civilisation are being re-enveloped by verdant nature. It's a refreshing move away from the barren browns and reds we usually associate with post-apocalyptic settings. Despite its age and technical limitations - coupled with even more limited graphics options - Enslaved is a beautiful game with obvious care and attention paid to its lush environments, its detailed, motion-captured animation overseen by Andy "Gollum" Serkis, and its nuanced character design.It's also clear that care has been lavished on the story. Main characters Monkey and Trip are fully rounded out. The nature of their strained relationship plays out naturally, and develops organically. There are the occasional fumbles, especially at the very beginning as the rules of their relationship are set, and the conflict feels a little rushed and too quickly resolved. Overall, however, the dialogue and character development prove to be sophisticated to a degree far in excess of what one might expect from an action-brawler.Other characters taken and adapted from the novel are equally well represented, and the central narrative pays homage to original story reinterpreting its themes of action, choice and consequence expertly and without the heavy hand mass market media so often utilises. The game plays out as an extended escort mission of sorts. The concept may strike dread in the hearts of many a gamer, but it’s not so much a burden and plays in a similar fashion to Bioshock Infinite’s Elizabeth. Trip will hide from combat while Monkey lays the smack down on robots. The combat its self is initially frantic and exciting, but soon it becomes clear it lacks any sort of depth. In fact, for all its visual punch the combat has no actual power behind it and its limitations quickly become evident. Other aspects of the game also suffer from being pedestrian and uninteresting. Platforming and puzzle elements are functional, but both lack any imagination and act as little more than a distraction from the combat zones.Enslaved is highly scripted and very linear, and despite the verticality of many levels and the sprawling nature of the world Money and Trip have a very narrow path to follow. The scripted nature of the game is both its strength and ultimately its biggest weakness.Despite some stunning art direction and a rich story complete with interesting and complex characters, Enslaved fails to provide a compelling game play experience to complement its artistic and narrative strengths.","November 7, 2014","true","10.2"," 291 of 322 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","291","322","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/245280/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Disclaimer: Do not buy this game if you do not own a gamepad.  The mouse support is about as bad as it gets.  I use kb/m whenever possible in third person games and I had to use a gamepad for this one.\n\nEnslaved is a well-written and satisfying-but-simple spectacle fighter with a heavy story emphasis and some minor puzzles.  It is a post-apocalyptic adaptation of a classic Chinese novel "Journey to the West."  There are several nods to the original story, such as the names of the main characters which may interest those who have read the book.\n\nThe writing is excellent for the most part and acted very well.  The game manages to be both serious and humorous while telling the story and rarely feels out of place.  My one issue is the way that the two main characters Monkey and Trip meet.  The meeting should be the biggest source of conflict in the entire story, yet it is glossed over and forgotten within a minute.  It reminds me a lot of the criticism aimed at Tomb Raider 2013 and Far Cry 3 for how quickly those main characters got used to killing people after leading normal, peaceful lives up to that point.\n\nGameplay is pretty simple and definitely nothing groundbreaking.  The game is a simple yet satisfying spectacle fighter with simple one-button traversal mechanics.  You also need to solve a few basic puzzles to make it through some levels.  It is quite easy even on hard difficulty.  Unfortunately the game makes use of seemingly randomly-placed fixed camera angles that can easily confuse the player and will sometimes make your character immediately walk back through a doorway after entering a room.  The other big issue with the camera is during combat itself.  It likes to jerk the camera around randomly every time you attack and zoom way in so it's impossible to keep track of enemies other than the one you're attacking.  It may also cause motion sickness.  It's a stupid design decision chosen just to make the combat more flashy, as seems to be a common problem with spectacle fighters.\n\nThe game has a nice art style, but average last-gen console-quality graphics.  I find that this is enough to hamper the art style in what should be a very beautiful game, which is very unfortunate.  It still has its moments, but it would be an absolutely gorgeous game if the developers had put any effort into the PC port.\n\nSpeaking of the port, it's just about as lazy as it gets.  The mouse is treated like a joystick and is given a deadzone when you go into aim mode, just like Dead Space.  It's basically useless and I found it unplayable.  Graphical quality is limited to low/medium/high though it thankfully has a separate toggle for motion blur which looks even more fake and ugly than most games.  There are no graphical enhancements for the PC version.  Button prompts always show controller buttons even if you don't have one plugged in.  The game has a custom mouse cursor, yet the mouse doesn't work in menus.  The one good thing about the port is that the game uses Unreal Engine 3 so it runs very smoothly and will handle 120/144 Hz flawlessly with only a minor config tweak.\n\nSo while it's far from a perfect game, mostly due to poor and outdated design decisions and a lazy port, it's quite fun and a great story experience.\n\nThe Premium Edition on PC also includes the Pigsy's Perfect 10 DLC.  It turns the game from a simple-but-satisfying story-focused spectacle fighter into a sub-par stealth/cover shooter starring a fat, disgusting, misogynist pig on his quest to build a robot girlfriend.  Seriously what were they thinking?  Thankfully it was short.","July 24, 2014","true","21.3"," 126 of 140 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","126","140","0","1"

Reasons quoted for this were that it was overshadowed by a number of other AAA titles and that there were quite some glitches. But reviews praised it, especially for its story. With a delay of 3 years, it has now been ported to PC.\n\n"Enslaved" is very loosely based on a classic Chinese tale, "Journey to the West", and plays 150 years in the future. The planet has been ravaged by a brutal war the remainders of which are ruined desolate cities and hostile mechs that attack anyone they encounter. Humanity has scattered far and about, not only threatened by the mechs, but also by mysterious slave hunters that kidnap people without so much as a clue as to where they're taking them. Onboard a ship of slaves-to-be, Trip, a young woman with tech skills manages to escape her cell. This also opens up a way out for fellow prisoner "Monkey", a muscular loner who has subsisted in the wilderness on his own for most of his life. They manage to flee from the crashing slave ship on the last remaining escape pod, but Monkey loses his consciousness. He awakens to find that Trip has put a slave headband on him that will kill him should her heart stop. She wants to return to the community where she came from and knows she would never stand a chance all alone. So Monkey is forced to cooperate: He is the muscle that takes on all hostiles they meet, Trip is the brains with her knowledge of technology.\n\nGameplay consists of combat, climbing and some mini puzzles. Monkey has a staff he uses to fight with mechs and later on also shoot at ranged targets. The weapon can be upgraded in various ways using energy orbs found in the levels. Considering myself a mediocre gamer, I found fighting to be at an okay-ish difficulty once I had figured out how to block (others said combat was too easy - obviously, your mileage may vary on that). There could be more help with the controls though, special attacks are still described by giving console control pad keys.\nClimbing is rather easy since one cannot fall or miss a grip point, all of which are highlighted relatively obviously. Also, in some sequences Monkey steers a hovering disc called the "cloud" over water and ground surfaces - these segments add a little speed to the otherwise pedestrian experience.\n\nThe changing relationship between the two main characters is at the centre of the plot. Thus, it's fortunate that voice acting is very good. And when, at times, not a lot is said (Monkey is not a man of many words), the finely motion-captured facial expressions convey all one needs to know. Story, characters, acting - this is where the game really shines and becomes a "page turner". Okay, well, I won't spoil the ending to you, but I think that was the one part where they could have done better. It just left me with "Hmmmmmmmmm."\nOther than that, a captivating journey and definitely recommendable.\n\nHelpful notes in case you get the game:\nNote 1: Others have reported graphics problems. There are quick INI fixes mentioned on the Steam forums: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=188863412\nWith those tweaks I didn't have any issues.\n\nNote 2: You can skip cutscenes with the Backspace key (didn't find that mentioned in-game).\n\nNote 3 (since I've seen this problem pop up in several threads, to the point that people called it game-breaking, but hey, the solution is already in-game, so no need to get stuck): For some jumps during climbing, you have to move diagonally, not straight up/left/right. That's possible by pressing two direction keys at once, e.g. W+D http://steamcommunity.com/app/245280/discussions/0/648811670597314811/","November 11, 2013","true","18.4"," 95 of 101 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","95","101","0","2"

It follows the story of the great classical Chinese novel, although is set in a post apocalyptic future where seemingly armed robots are enslaving people.\n\nArmed with a staff and some sweet climbing skills, you play the enslaved warrior Monkey. Tasked with helping your captor, Trip, get home to her father. Throughout most of the game, you will be jumping, climbing over obstacles and mowing down mecs in either brawling close combat or shooting plasma bolts long rage style.The game is designed in such a way to keep this recipe fresh and not feel repetitive. Smart enemy placements contribute to this as mixing ranged and melee enemies in fights makes you think before you act. Boss fights are a sweet bonus.\n\nWeapons, shields, health and combat techniques are all upgradable and a must to get past the later chapters.\n\nContrary to what you may believe, the post apocalyptic setting in Enslaved really does its art justice as the environment and visuals are just gorgeous. The greenest of trees, bluest of skies and warmest colors of explosions are visually pleasing. The art is well complemented by the ambient sounds and music.\n\nAfter about half of the game, you are joined by Pigsy who is, although a disgusting pig, easily the most exotic and colorful of characters. He livens up the game to a high degree and counters the somewhat reserved character of Monkey.\nPigsy is playable in the included DLC and offers a different kind of play style by scrapping the melee combat in favor of a rifle and four kinds of cooldown-based items (distraction device, EMP, ally bomb and damage based bomb). Accompanied with the joyful Truffles, Pigsy goes on his own little adventure. The extra content is a must play and Is just as good if not even stronger in some parts than the main game.\n\nThe only weaknesses I found in the game was the overly scripted camera that takes camera controls away from you to show objects of interest in an overly obvious way. Sometimes the camera becomes fixed in a static position for portions of the pacing through the level. This can sometimes become a bit distracting. I was also annoyed with how some animations take to long to complete. While fighting (bosses especially) I found it very difficult to evade after attacking due to the attack animations not completing yet. Similarly when climbing pipes jumps to other objects would not register.\n\nSo, linear post apocalyptic action adventure brawler with ravishing visuals and interesting characters. Action, drama and humor packed into an adventure with a deeper meaning. It has completionist potential and took me 12 hours to beat with the must play extra Pigsy campaign. Sit back, plug in that controller and go on a fun adventure.","May 17, 2015","true","12.1"," 84 of 90 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","84","90","0","3"

I have no idea why, because I absolutely love it after having played the PC version. It managed to pull me in right from the start and it has that fine mix of solving puzzles, platforming and combat that only few games have these days. The combat starts off shallow, but once you get access to the shooting part of your staff it becomes immensely satisfying. Hitting robots feels heavy and right, and looks great in motion.\n\nPlatforming is pretty much the same as the later Prince Of Persia and Assassin's Creed games, You can swiftly move horizontally and vertically without being afraid to fall to your death, which is always a bonus if you ask me.\n\nThe puzzles are of the platforming kind and usually require pressing (and holding) a button. It's not all that exciting and that's why there aren't a lot of them in this game. Which is good. It's just enough to keep it from being boring or frustrating.\n\nThe graphics are awesome (except for a few shadow glitches) and there are lots of colors used for the environments. It's truly beautifully made. The same goes for the characters. They are very well animated and the faces - usually a bit flawed in many, many games - are great, making it not awkward to look at whenever a cutscene starts playing. The voice acting is done extremely well, and by well known people; one of them being the great Andy Serkis. That guy just has a great voice and his motion capture performances are through the roof. Just awesome.\n\nThe story is deep and makes you think, and the game is just long enough before it becomes a chore. It lasts around 8-10 hours. If you want to find all of the orbs it could take you several hours longer. But no more, because it's a linear game and there just aren't any collectibles to be found here. Which is great for me, a guy who just wants to play through the story, but not for those collectors out there.\n\nEnslaved is a wonderul experience and I sincerely hope more people will give it a try. It deserves another chance, people. This is it.\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","February 7, 2014","true","7.8"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","57","65","0","2"

Great story with compelling characters and great voice acting, although by the end it leaves a lot of unanswered questions that I suppose would be answered in a sequel or two, that sadly we are unlikely too see. In that respect it felt a little lackluster and just a bit weird.\n\nCombat on the whole can become very repetetive but it's still a challenge in some scenarios and not bad overall for such an old game. Climbing isn't much of a challenge but still feels cool enough for that to not matter. I feel like a lot of effort went into the opening sequence and would have liked that level of immersion to carry on throughout.\n\nThe key thing that kept me playing was the synergy between Monkey & Trip and I feel it would have developed into an excellent franchise had it continued.\n\nOverall: 7/10","October 18, 2014","true","7.4"," 53 of 62 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","53","62","0","3"

This game reminded me a lot of the Prince of Persia game from 2008. You do a fair amount of easy platforming and also spent a pretty good amount of time in combat. The combat is by no means difficult and by no means super interesting.\n\nWhat makes the game work is that it does the few things it does very well. The platforming is solid and has great controls. I found myself enjoying all the little platforming sections they threw at me. They make the next object you are to leap to flash so you never find yourself wondering where to go next. Also, the combat in this game responds well. You are able to upgrade yourself as you play and I found that the extra costumes that came with this version of the game were really useful.\n\nWhat does not work in this game are the turret sections. I found aiming the turrets in this game to be a chore and that it was really hard to hit moving targets enough to kill them. Obviously, I made it through the game, but I dreaded every time I was in a turret section. Fortunately, there are only about three or four turret sequences. All have terrible checkpoints as well....something that is actually a problem throughout the game. It doesn't save after each major section, but rather saves when it feels like it. I quit once, confident that I would be fine, only to come back and learn I had to replay 10-15 solid minutes. Annoying. The "surf board" sections are also annoying, but quite brief.\n\nThe laziness of the PC port is obvious at times. There are graphical glitches and I once had to reduce the game to the lowest resolution for the character to make a jump. Odd.\n\nA final note about a few high points of the game. The characters and story are really good, as are the graphics. I found myself really liking both the main leads and was very much pulled into their adventure. The voice-acting is top notch and the facial capturing they did for these characters is one of the best in any game I've seen. The environments  are lush and beautiful and the game ran smoothly for the most part(aside from a few glitches).\n\nIn the end, I loved the game and really recommend it if you liked any Prince of Persia game.\n\n8/10 - a solid game everyone should pick up.\n","October 27, 2014","true","11.0"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","44","50","0","0"

To see my full review, please click HERE[genkisgamegab.forumotion.com].\n\nWe have full 360-degree control of both our character and the camera... most of the time.  Sometimes we have only limited control of the camera, which I believe the devs did to help us know which direction we're supposed to go.  There were a few moments when I simply could not figure out what I was supposed to be doing, but by taking my time to look around, I'd eventually spot something flashing.  These flashing objects are items that you can climb, jump on/to, clamber on, etc.  Our character is quite acrobatic, but you don't have to stop and watch him twirl around to finish his maneuver before jumping to the next location; that can be fun, but when you're being attacked, I really don't recommend it. ;p\n\nWe have a companion on our journey, which already know if you've looked at any of the game screens.  Trip has many abilities of her own, and she is also the reason we've been collecting those tech orbs.  First off, though, let me explain a little bit about the dynamics.\n\nWe have a screen we can bring up to interact with Trip, and there we have some options.  We can tell her to create a distraction, run or do some kind of action (like flipping a switch for us), apply a health serum (provided that we have some), and the upgrade function, which is where the tech orbs come in.  There are four sub-options for upgrades: Staff, Combat, Shield, and Health.\n\nThere is a well-known GLITCH during one scene in the game, and I'm putting this in spoilers in case you don't want to see the solution:\nThe second time we run into one of the mechs with wrecking balls for "hands" is where the glitch shows up.  You hear something, but see nothing unusual.  There's a brick wall there that's supposed to have broken, but all you see is a solid wall.  Eventually one of these mechs will appear, but there doesn't seem to be a way to defeat it, no matter how many times you hit the damned thing! Meh  The game is telling you to taunt it, but it just runs into one of those low walls and gets stuck there. *sigh*\n\nWhat you need to do is taunt it until it runs into one of the large, solid walls -- the one right below Trip is the one I used (and maybe it's the only one that works, I don't know!)

Why no recommendation?  It's hardly a game at all.\n\nI love the world, and the atmosphere they've created.  I like the characters, and wanted to see where their story went.  If it weren't for that, I would have quit after the first level.  This game is totally on rails.\n\nYour character, appropriately named Monkey, does a LOT of platforming.  Most of it is climbing walls and jumping from perch to perch.  The problem?  You can't miss.  You hang from one pre-determined (and helpfully glowing) spot, hold the direction of the next one, and press A.  Then you get there, and repeat.  There aren't even any choices of where to go; you're simply following a path.  Even though you're jumping around like a monkey, it's effectively no different than walking down a hallway in FF13.\n\nYou can't even hop down from platforms in non-predetermined places.  The game LITERALLY won't let you die from jumping the wrong way.  Even in dramatic sections where the wall you're climbing on is crumbling away, you can rest assured that you will make it if you simply hold up and mash A.  Seriously.  As long as you push the button, you will never lose.  If you somehow DO manage to die, it only feels like the game's fault.\n\nAnd that's the biggest problem: with 90% of the game so streamlined, whenever something isn't immediately obvious the game grinds to a halt.  More than once I found myself completely baffled by what to do next, simply because the game had never asked me to figure anything out before.\n\nI beat this game back when it came out on 360, simply because I wanted to see how it ended (Answer?  Very strangely.)  Now that I'm REplaying it, all I want to do is fight the on-rails system in place here.  I find myself constantly grumbling about how Monkey won't do what I'm telling him to, because it's not exactly what the game WANTS me to do.\n\nIt's obvious that Ninja Theory really just wanted to tell a story and make some nice cinematics, only adding the gameplay to glue those elements together.  You are an actor in their movie, with lines and marks that you must follow, and that comes before actually PLAYING anything resembling a game.  If those elements appeal to you, and the game's on sale, you might ultimately enjoy it.\n\nJust don't expect to PLAY it.\n\n\nP.S. As far as the port goes, it ran well on my PC, but it doesn't support 2560x1440, and if you have both a controller and a joystick, you're gonna have to unplug one before it'll work.","June 26, 2015","false","4.7"," 84 of 125 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","84","125","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkStarSword/recommended/245280/","DarkStarSword","DarkStarSword","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkStarSword/","853 products in account","I loved every moment of this game. This game has near perfect nVidia 3D Vision support with the use of Helix mod and between the excellent motion capture and lush post-apocalyptic setting it's just so damn beautiful. I took many 3D screenshots, but I'll have to import them into Steam to upload any of them ;-) Heck - even the menu screen is at least a thousand times more awesome in 3D as it is in lamo 2D!\n\nSince this is a third person game I played it with an Xbox 360 controller with no problems, but I hear that it doesn't fare so well with keyboard+mouse, so if you don't have a controller you might want to stay away.\n\nI enjoyed the story, though I have a feeling this might be a bit of a hit or miss affair for different people. It is very much focussed on the journey the characters endure and how it affects them - the motion capture really adds a lot here as they perfectly nailed the characters facial expressions and body language, which really says a lot more about themselves and their journey than the words they use.\n\nThe character's backstory is a bit light and I would have appreciated a bit more detail, particularly on Monkey (the main character). Plot wise it might be a little light / simplistic for some, but I didn't mind because the focus was really on the personal journey of the characters. I'd love to talk about the ending a bit, but that would be spoilers so I'll just say it made me think and reflect on a few events from the story.\n\nThis game offered me a rare chance to discuss my hobby with my fiance, as the game is adapted from the classic Chinese story Journey to the West and it was interesting to talk a bit about the similarities and differences between this and the original story. Obviously the futuristic post-apocalyptic setting of the game is quite different to the original and a lot of elements have been changed to fit the setting and work in the context of a video game, but there are plenty of similarities - the character's names, Monkey's slave headband, the fact that Monkey rides on a cloud (of different sorts), PIgsy's advances and even Monkey's fighting stick (which packs away when not in use so he can hide it on his arm / in his ear).\n\n\nGameplay wise it's a fairly standard spectacle fighter & third person platformer with a couple of *very* basic puzzles every so often. The combat hit a pretty good balance for me - button mashing works some of the time, but there's a few different enemy types that need different strategies to deal with effectively. Cover is important to avoid weapons fire and/or remain hidden - plus there is a distraction mechanic which can be used to safely move from cover to cover. Certain enemies can be used against others if you do a finishing move on them first so there is a bit of strategy involved, but nothing particularly difficult. It did seem like using ranged attacks was a bit OP, but I tend to prefer melee when I have a choice so that didn't bother me, though it took me most of the game to work out the timing to pull off a counter attack.\n\nWithout giving too much away I must give it bonus points for the final boss fight as well - the fight feels very epic, but they didn't make the mistake that so many games do of changing up the gameplay - you're just using the exact same platforming and fighting as you have been through the rest of the game, but this time it's all part of a rather awesome showdown.\n\n\nFinally, this edition comes with the Pigsy's Perfect 10 DLC. Pigsy's character provided some comic relief in the main game, so naturally it follows that this DLC is more humerous and light hearted than the quite serious main game. I'm not sure whether to call Pigsy a side character or a main character you only meet halfway through the main game, but whatever the case this DLC is a completely separate campaign following Pigsy's quest to quite literally make a new friend. This really felt like DLC done right - Pigsy plays quite differently to Monkey as he does not have any melee weapons and uses a combination of gadgets and his gun instead. I was pretty happy with the length of this DLC - it perhaps could have been a little longer, but I don't think it was too short.\n\nI score it a "You should play this" / 10","August 19, 2014","true","16.5"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","38","48","0","3"

I'm surprised that there wasn't more people championing it back when it originally came out. The environments, dialog, and character design are excellent (though sometimes things momentarily turn to annoying cliches). The homage to Journey to the West is interesting and I think they handled it well, but sometimes I worry that games can only do a good adaptation by adding post-apocalyptic robots.\n\nThe gameplay feels a lot like The Last of Us except actually fun and with visual flare. The PC controls can be pretty awful. It uses controller button prompts so I was constantly groping around to guess the key. I never figured out any of the special attacks that required button combos. Some of the menus will suddenly use arrows instead of WASD. I used gamepad on occasion and it was better there, but I have to relearn the controls.\n\nThe ending is really odd and makes me think that maybe they were going to develop 2 endings and ran out of time. I can go along with it, it's just very abrupt. There's also a DLC with different gameplay and tone. It's a nice companion if you want some more time in that world.\n\nOverall it's beautifully polished with some highs and lows, but one that I think was more forgotten/ignored that it should have been.","November 29, 2013","true","8.2"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","34","42","0","0"

I really did. It takes place in amazing environments, the characters seem interesting enough, and the story seems interesting as well. But, frankly, the gameplay is terrible, mainly because of the ridiculously awful camera controls. It doesn't matter if you are using a gamepad or kb/m, the game has it's own ideas about what it wants to do with the camera and it will fight your control of it every step of the way.\n\nThe worst is in combat, where the camera will often shift angles automatically, usually to angles more about making your character look cool than about actually giving you a decent view of or angle of attack on your enemies. Many times this stupidity will cause your attacks to go completely in the wrong direction, which really sucks for charged attacks.\n\nSeriously, it's just not fun when you have to fight the camera just as much as you fight the bad guys, and you have to do so while trying to fight the bad guys.\n\nIf the camera were better under user control without the game randomly shifting it around based on whatever automatic rules it follows, then I would probably be willing to recommend this game. But as it is now, with utter crap camera control making combat pretty much impossible, or at least insanely frustrating, at times, I cannot recommend this game.","November 11, 2014","false","7.8"," 217 of 357 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","217","357","0","11"

I wanted to get it for PS3 when it came out but decided to wait. I was excited to see that a few years later it came to PC with enhanced graphics and picked it up on sale. Here's the quick bullet points:\n* The graphics are quite good, even though this game is not very recent. They really did upgrade significantly from the PS3 version.\n* The story starts out boring but gets better after the first couple hours. I wish they would have gone more in-depth by the end. The last half is actually quite good writing.\n* The combat is meh. Initially I was irritated with it but I adjusted. It's not Arkham, but it's ok. Tips below.\n* My machine is pretty hefty but the cut-scenes would pop and stutter a bit, which was really annoying. No idea why. It didn't ruin the game, though.\n* Character shadows we were weird on my 7870 with maxed graphics settings. But again, did not harm my playthrough.\n\nCombat tips:\n* Get the upgrade that allows you to charge your stuff and burst out. Very very handy.\n* Learn to use the block!!!! Upgrade it and your shield strength. Also, get health regen +1 or 2 before getting health upgrade, as the regen is much more useful.\n* Learn to use wide attack (I completely forgot about this ability).\n* Get the staff gun ammo capacity upgrades, as stock-piling the ammo is very handy to have in reserve. But use it sparingly as it is rare.\n\nEnjoy!","October 14, 2014","true","8.6"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

Having heard positive things aobut it made me try the demo out, and it, in turn, wetted my appetite for the full game. But somehow I only managed to play this game now, years later, and on PC. It started great, but slowly got more and more disappointing almost in every aspect.\n\nThe beginnings are strong - quite unique concept of interaction between two characters with active and passive roles, great location design and interesting world, seasoned with a bit of character development (through upgrades). Sadly, none of this ever develops past what you see in the first 30% of the game. Combat quickly becomes repetetive and feels stiff, platforming is straight up brain-dead, enemies lack diversity (and there are only two unique boss fights throughout the campaign) and character development never really manages to get interesting story-wise. The ending feels glued on, and while it attempts to round off the game while also introducing a twist, it falls flat on it's face by feeling really, really out of context.\n\nThe game manages to present the player with reasonably diverse environments throughout the campaign, though I couldn't shake the feeling that the further I got, the less inspired they were. Game's visuals are also compromised by some gnarly texturework at various spots, shadowing glitches and one of the poorest motion blur implementations I've seen (it's luckily possible to turn it off) and 30fps, highly compressed FMV's that litter the campaign. Dialogue is well done, but it's coupled with awkward lip sync and character animations - I don't really know where all that motion capture Ninja Theory bragged about is utilised. And finally - the camera has really narrow FOV, which sometimes caused confiusion for me (it tends to get stuck and perform rapid rotations on it's own), and there is no way to adjust all that.\n\nAll in all - I am very disappointed by Enslaved. I've finished the campaign once, didn't even touch Pigsy's Perfect 10 that is included because I really don't see a reason. As a non-interactive story this possibly could have worked, but all the "game-y" aspects of Enslaved feel half-baked way too often. With so-so quality of PC port, I really can't recommend this game.

Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a 3rd person adventure character action game in which you play as Monkey on the 2 core gameplay aspects of fighting robots and platforming, while journeying into some great enviroments and through a nice story which will take you around 7-8 hours to beat.\n\nThe combat feels good but it gets repetitive, there's not that much enemy variety, even a boss is reused once, and you only have 1 weapon with limted moves, I wish they expanded on it a bit more, but it does the job I suppose. The camera can be quite bad at times though, it is too close to your character so sometimes you'll get hit from enemies offscreen and whatnot, they should've zoomed it out a little bit. You can also use your staff to shoot damaging and stunning projectiles but I will warn you that aiming feels a bit sluggish with the mouse.\n\nNow the platforming looks cool and all but it's very linear and there's not much of a challenge, you're just pressing the movement keys and the jump button at the same time following a simple path, it can get a bit fidley however, like sometimes there's just this one very specific spot to jump from to grab another ledge, and even if you're just slighly to the side of it, your jump won't work, and sometimes it works from anywhere, so it's a bit inconsistent on that note.\n\nRight now you can probably see the game's flaws, but here's what they did right, the enviroments are really beaultiful, and it just takes you right in this post apocalyptic world that the game's trying to build, it definetly feels lonely, and the overgrown nature on New York early in the game serves to reinforce that. The story is quite good too, Monkey the main character escapes from a slave ship and crash lands on the city of New York, only to find himself wearing a slave helmet put on by another prisioner who escaped, Trip. She does this because she needs his protection to reach her home community, so Monkey is now forced to help her, otherwise he's killed by the slave helmet, and also if Trip dies, she set it so his helmet triggers too. That is quite an interesting set up for our two main characters and you can definetly see the chemistry between them as you play the game, I'd say the story is great on that regard, but on a side note I thought that the ending is kinda bad in my opinion, but to avoid spoilers that's all I'll say about it so you can check it out for yourself.\n\nOverall, Enslaved: Odyseey to the West has quite a few flaws, but I'd definetly recommend you pick it up on sale, the story and the gourgeous enviroments will definetly make for an exciting journey into this post apocalyptic world.","January 15, 2015","true","8.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

There are many great parts, but I wouldn't tell anyone that the experience is worth it. This game is completely mediocre, but with the potential to be amazing. A few slight adjustments would have turned this into a must-play game.\n\nThe storyline is nothing new, but it's compelling and engaging. The quick cut scenes and overall flow make the game seem really relatable and it's easy to care about the characters. They are also funny and the plot makes sense from start to finish. Nothing is stupid or contrived.\n\nHowever, those are the qualities, all related to the cinematic potential. The gameplay is boring, tedious, and repetitive. The path is lined up in front of you (figuratively), and you never have to guess what to do next. That's not really a bad thing, but it's been a long time since I've played a game that was this incredibly linear. There is no way to mess up, no reason to second-guess, and it makes the game feel more like a slog that slows you down between cut scenes than an experience you want to have again.\n\nIf I could spare a few words for the developers in the hopes that they might read them:\n\nThe orbs are a bad idea. Running all over hell and back to collecting floating orbs that are never explained at all was the single worst part of this game. I collected 92% of them overall, and I'd rather lose my all hair than do it again. Ever.\n\nThe RPG system is weak, making the orbs even less appealing to collect. The majority of combat focuses on melee, but the upgrades for melee are few and weak. The ranged attack becomes very strong, but ammo was scarce and I only used it when I had to. I played on Hard, so maybe ammo is more plentiful in lower levels, but I prefer the challenge. However, I wasn't aware that I'd only be able to upgrade my ranged attack with any great improvements when I started. More upgrade options, please.\n\nCertain parts are laughably incosistent. Monkey can toss Trip up to those high ledges, but can't jump up there himself? Other times he makes leaps across gaps so huge I would have been sure that I needed another route. However, the worst part of the incosistency was the Cloud. Works sometimes, inexplicably? Yeah, Monkey says it, and Trip offers a vague reason, but there are times where it doesn't work even in the same area once I've killed the boss that requires its use. The Cloud is the single most enjoyable portion of gameplay in Enslaved, and it was a shame I didn't get to use it more.\n\nFinally, the camera work. An auto-center is a must-have feature in any game, and I can't tell you how many times my attacks would swing wide because the camera angle changed on its own and I had to swing it back around manually. Those fixed angle sections caused me a lot of headache when Monkey decides to do a 180 because the camera just flipped in front of him.\n\nFinally, just some continuity stuff. In Chapter 14, you get the clear message that this is your final chance to upgrade any further. Why the heck are there orbs after that point then? More tedious collection with NO payoff this time. Perhaps there's a New Game + feature, but I don't want to find out. Harsh review, I know, but I'm only being so precise because I think thsi game could have been so extremely wonderful that I will be looking forward to seeing how Ninja Theory progresses from here. Learn from your mistakes, and you'll have a bright future in games.","October 12, 2014","false","9.1"," 74 of 120 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","74","120","0","1"

Its most compelling aspects are the story, voice acting and world design. The game is set in post-apocalyptic USA and looks amazing. The destroyed remnants of modern civilization are overrun by vibrant plant life and the world looks absolutely gorgeous. The story was written by Alex Garland (author of The Beach and screenwriter of 28 Days Later, Sunshine, Dredd) and the player character is voiced by Andy Serkis (who did a great job and should totally be in more games). If you're the kind of person who plays games for the story, give this game a try, it's really great. There's quite a lot of platforming, frequently involving puzzles which are mostly not very difficult to solve. The combat is pretty decent: your weapon is a staff that serves both as a melee weapon and a long-range weapon, providing a variety of options for dealing with enemies. In the DLC you can play as a different character with a completely different combat style and powers.\n\nThe less great aspects of the game are the rather linear nature of the levels and the stupid checkpoint system which will put you before the cutscene (some of which are completely unskippable) if you reload the game, but if you die the game will restart from the point after the cutscene. Makes no sense. Another thing that makes no sense is the forced camera in many situations where it's not needed to highlight an important area or path (since it's hard to get lost in the levels anyway), so it's just mildly annoying for no reason. But other than that, the game is a very enjoyable experience and a must for fans of good storytelling in games.","October 17, 2015","true","23.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

The voice-acting is spot on. The characters, they grow on you and make you invested in the game. Pigsy, he has some pretty spot-on one-liners that unexpectedly make you laugh and look like an idiot. haha. From start to finish, this game will entertain without skipping a beat.

To begin, though, it's worth pointing out that this isn't a game for everyone: in particular, if you have no interest in narrative-focused games then don't bother playing Enslaved. The gameplay is enjoyable, sure; clambering around the gorgeous environments is fun, and the combat is solid (if a bit repetitive). The focus for Enslaved, however, is definitely, without a doubt, on the story it tells, the feelings it provokes, and the experience that it leaves with the player.\n\nIt would be easy to say that the game isn't breaking any new ground here, since it's an adaption of Journey to the West, but the writers took the building blocks of that familiar story, placed them in a completely different setting, and created something both fun and compelling. Aside from the very end, there are no surprises in the plot as everything is clearly foreshadowed; if anything, though, this just increased the impact of certain scenes, as the game builds up feelings of excitement, anticipation, or dread.\n\nTo me, this is the key to Enslaved's success: every aspect of the game is crafted almost perfectly to evoke these strong emotional responses, from the music to the writing to the visuals (especially the excellent mo-cap for facial expressions, which adds a whole lot to the delivery of each character's lines). By the time the game ended, it really, truly felt like a long journey, and to me that's the most satisfying emotion after completing a game--even with its disjointed environments and simple, text-based transitions (a la "two weeks later", etc), it still conveyed all the feelings one would expect with a subtitle like "Odyssey to the West."\n\nWhile the gameplay isn't the focus for Enslaved, though, it's still very much enjoyable. The combat felt a bit simple, and there were a few too many fights that were a little bit too long, but fighting has a really satisfying, visceral feel to it. The boss battles perfectly encapsulate both the positives and the negatives of combat: they're exciting and well-crafted, but they take a bit too long to beat and a couple fights are recurring and get a bit boring. About two-thirds of the way through the game, I was starting to get sick of the regular encounters with enemies, but it obviously wasn't enough to dissuade me from the game entirely. The platforming, while a bit simplistic in nature, never got old to me; the puzzles are solid if not spectacular, and the collectibles are a nice diversion without taking away too much of the focus from the rest of the game (Alan Wake really suffered from this).\n\nIt bears repeating, however, that Enslaved is first and foremost a narrative-focused game. It's a fantastic choice for those who enjoy video games as a storytelling medium, as it provides an incredible experience to the player. It's not as fully realized as something like Spec Ops: The Line--where every single aspect of the game contributed to its narrative--but Enslaved does an excellent job of combining a great story and fun gameplay into a single package.\n\nAlso, if you played and enjoyed it on a console, it is absolutely worth picking up on PC; it looks and runs very well, and it deserves to be seen at 1080p+/60FPS.","October 3, 2014","true","8.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/245280/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Ambitious. That's a word I'd use to describe Ninja Theory. In terms of game narrative, this is one studio that goes all-out and is never afraid to stray from the accepted archetypes that have plagued so many other games over the years. Originality, depth of story, and incredibly rich characters are the name of the game, and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West has that in spades.\n\nHeavenly Sword, Ninja Theory's previous game, also had those things. However, it was sorely lacking in the gameplay department, a problem that demonstrated why ambition alone is never enough. With Enslaved, Ninja Theory has taken everything good about Heavenly Sword and added the one crucial element -- great gameplay.\n\nAnd by God ... the combination has never tasted so sweet.\n\nEnslaved tells the tale of Monkey, a hard-headed loner who must survive in a world where most of humanity is dead, and an army of violent robots stalks the ruins of civilization in its place. After barely bailing from a mech slave ship with his life, Monkey awakens in the wreckage of an escape pod and comes face to face with Trip, a young girl who has trapped him with a slaver's headband that forces him to do as she says, and will kill him if Trip dies. Her terms: get her home, and she'll let him go.\n\nThus starts an uneasy alliance between Monkey and Trip, an alliance that, during the course of the game, evolves and becomes something much more complex, deep, and quite believable. The power dynamic between the two characters constantly shifts as Trip holds Monkey's life in her hands, yet is thoroughly dependent upon him to survive herself. Once a third character, the inimitable Pigsy, is introduced, you have a cast of characters more original, endearing and heartwarming than that of any other videogame released this year.\n\nWith its loose nods to the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, some excellently written dialog and wonderful vocal performances, Enslaved does what games so often fail to do -- bring its characters to life. The game feels like the odyssey it sets out to be, and the narrative really has it all: genuinely amusing comedy, surprisingly touching tragedy, and plenty of action.\n\nAs far as action goes, Enslaved has a natural flow between environmental clambering and combat, with the game often seamlessly switching between the two. The game does this with cutscenes as well, giving the entire campaign a sense of natural progression that very few titles have ever achieved.\n\nThe climbing sections may or may not be a problem depending on what kind of gamer you are. Those who love titles like Prince of Persia may want to be careful with what they expect of Enslaved, as the climbing has not been designed to explicitly challenge the player.\n\nAlthough later climbing sections have traps and pitfalls, Enslaved's monkey business is more geared around delivering a sense of exploration and providing an empowering feeling of acrobatic skill. Indeed, there are no pitfall deaths to fear in this game. Monkey won't jump off something unless he definitively can, and once you find a foothold, it's a pretty clear path from A to B. The lack of challenge might upset some gamers, but I personally appreciated a title that wasn't full of cheap pitfalls, and Monkey moves with such fluidity and speed that it's much better to simply enjoy the ride. Very few games make climbing feel both swift and fun, but Enslaved has done it.\n\nThere are a few issues, however, with the game's fussiness when it comes to climbing. There are some sections where Monkey clearly has to jump from one platform to another, but the game wants you to stand in one exact spot before letting you do so, and even if you're a few inches away from the "sweet" spot, Monkey will simply stumble and refuse to jump. It can get a little annoying, and sometimes it's just confusing, as one could easily be fooled into thinking they've gone the wrong way.\n\nCombat is significantly more challenging, but it can be a mixed bag. Monkey is armed with a magic staff that performs light and strong attacks, and can also be wielded like a gun to shoot plasma or stun bolts. Combos are very simple and amount to little more than button mashing, but again, it's the speed and fluidity that really makes it satisfying. Learning when best to stun enemies, perform a crowd-clearing move, block and counter is the key to victory, and while at times the combat is terrific fun, it can also get frustrating. Monkey's dodge move, for instance, is borderline useless, and he also can't cancel attack animations to block, which often means getting pummeled with cheap shots.\n\nThese issues aside, the combat is mostly pretty good, and feels varied enough despite the simplicity of the commands. Switching up between shooting and melee attacks, not to mention unlocking new moves and enhancements with "tech orbs" collected in each stage, makes the combat system feel much deeper than it actually is. It's also somewhat nice to see health packs return to an action game. Health is pretty easy to come by, and you can lengthen the life bar and unlock a regen skill as you delve deeper.\n\nWith the help of Trip and her pet mechanical dragonfly, Monkey can analyze various enemies and gain the ability to tell which mechs are defective. These defective mechs can be beaten with a special "takedown" move so they grant an extra advantage in battle. For instance, defective combat mechs can be taken down and then thrown at other enemies for explosive damage, while an electric-firing variant detonates an EMP shockwave that stuns surrounding foes. It gets a little tiresome watching the dragonfly scan everything at scripted intervals throughout the game, but the various takedown moves are incredibly cool, so it's a fair trade.\n\nAll of this is fun enough, but it's the interactions between Monkey and Trip that really put Enslaved ahead. In essence, the whole game is an escort mission, except that the person being escorted never becomes a hindrance. Trip is only very rarely in danger, and even then, she is able to temporarily stun enemies to give Monkey a chance to rescue her. Trip didn't die once throughout my entire game, and I never felt like she was a burden.\n\nAt times, Monkey and Trip will need to create distractions for each other. Commanding Trip is a simple case of opening a command wheel, from which you can tell her to distract enemies or follow you. Monkey also has his own distraction command, and using these simple skills, the duo can avoid enemy gunfire and help each other progress. As with everything in Enslaved, it's an incredibly simple concept, yet it just feels great to pull off. There are other co-op puzzles throughout the game, and while none of them tax the brain, they're not annoying, either.\n\nThe star of the show, however, has to be the Cloud. A flying disc that Monkey can access at various points of the game, the Cloud scores points not only for being fun, but for being easy to control. It's so easy for "vehicular" sections of an action game to fall apart, but by keeping the controls for both Monkey and the Cloud uniform, Ninja Theory has crafted an excellent little steed for our nimble hero. There are also a couple of fantastic boss fights that require use of the Cloud, and the only complaint I have is that the game doesn't give us enough chances to use it. More chase sequences, or just a chance to use it more regularly than being limited to a few areas, would have really been wonderful.\n\nA huge part of Enslaved is the art direction and graphics, and I have to say that they are simply stunning. The gorgeous, lush, colorful environments provide a totally different take on post-apocalyptic America than we're used to, and in an industry full of brown and grey. 10/10","September 13, 2015","true","6.3"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","27","39","0","2"

There's no cold, drab, desaturated colour-palette; instead, everything from the environments to the characters are beautifully vibrant. If there was a single word to describe this game it would have to be "lush".\n\nThere's not much to the story, there's almost no exposition, but that's okay. I enjoy how the very, very few characters interact with each other. The humour and insults exchanged throughout the dialogue are quirky at first, and there were a few words said that I wasn't expecting to hear from a game such as this, but I found it hilarious and strangely comforting. Maybe because I'd grown attached to what appears to be the only humans left in existence.\n\nThere are a number of issues, though. Firstly, the battle camera is horrendous, it makes fighting a lot more difficult than it needs to be as there is no lock-on camera. The field of view is so close to your character it's hard to tell when to block or evade an incoming attack. The battle system is also quite clunky, fighting numbers of enemies at once with melee attacks is sometimes frustrating and tactics such as countering and evading attacks aren't accurate. I found that maximising your ranged weapon's upgrades makes it a lot easier in order to manage groups of enemies from a distance.\n\nThe story also seemed to come to an abrupt end. I feel as though an additional one or two chapters would have improved how the last portion of the game unfolded but that's not to say it was a poor ending, it just seemed to be over sooner than I'd have liked. It's a shame too, because the ending raised more questions than had been answered; it was a huge contrast to what I'd previously experienced through my journey and not at all something that I expected to happen.\n\nI also hugely appreciate that the optional collectibles throughout the map actually add to the significance of the story. It's not clear at first what meaning is behind them but it all comes together quite neatly in the end.","December 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

It's one of the few games that I think is a lot stronger for its sticking to well-tuned though tried-and-true mechanics, linearity and focus on (a still rather janky) story as it drives the gameplay quite well, though the ending leaves much to be desired.\n\nOverall an unpretentious, well-balanced, well-executed action-adventure romp through a beautifully ruined post-apocalyptic world.

Despite never having read the novel Journey to the West I expected it to be a game with history about slaves and our history as a nation escaping slavery of the days of old. However, what I found was a game that has more on its plate then what is just under the surface of its base description.  It has parkour, a decently good story to follow along with at the start of every new chapter, collectibles for replayability and a world that seems as just a lonely and barren wasteland.\n\n\nStory: At first the story I thought was rather lacking. However, once I made it past the first chapter this whole synopsis about this barren wasteland being the home of enslaved people really caught on to me. You play as a character named Monkey which later on finds one slave remaining that has survived and wants to return home to their family just like yourself. However later on we find out Monkey doesn't really have a home anywhere while Trip the female character you partner up with does have  a family and a home where she grew up.  Early on Monkey and Trip's friendship isn't that strong. However when later you need teamwork as you help Trip up to ledges she can't reach and more , the friendship between you and her get close and strong knit.\n\n\nAppeal: Many people will be interested to try out this game because of the description of it being a game about companionship, emotions and the escape of being enslaved by your own world and order that controls your daily life. Many people's first question would be can you find freedom outside yourself and others through embracing a new life to claim your freedom. The answer is yes and the ending of the game's story concludes with a very emotional transversal of events. The thoughts that went through mine and I am sure others who have or want to play this game is , would it of made a difference if Namco Bandai Games added more history about slavery into this game?  I think history of enslavement and enslavement camps would of gave this game a more appealing and interesting story overall. That is not to say that the story was not good. I highly enjoyed the game's story and Pigsy this other character you meet along the way with his one liners that are somewhat humerous in tone.\n\n\nOverall: 8.5/10.","June 8, 2015","true","14.4"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","3"

The Jak series has always been one of my favourites, anything close to that was something I would be happy to play. When I finally got the chance to purchase it on steam I had mixed feelings. The general look of the game interested me, vaguely steampunk with a scrapyard feel to it. The control scheme was close to what I expected except with more of a God of War style to it. No jump instead a roll and the combat despite being satisfying became very repetitive and was not especially free-form.\nThe game is split into two distinct sections, the parkour and the fighting. These sections rarely mix and when they do it is just frustrating because enemies will interrupt your forward progress at awkward times. The parkour itself is average at best. It is very constrictive and lacks any skill. Flashing handholds and bars make it a simple task of pressing the right direction. In fact the best thing I could say about the gameplay is that it is satisfying, the animations are smooth and the characters have a real sense of weight to them however this is overshadowed by the number of almost identical situations and encounters that quickly become tedious. The game has some puzzle elements, very simple but not necessarily boring.\nAt this point the game seems somewhat unappealing but what I mostly enjoyed about this game was the character interaction. The story is simple, not really good or bad, just enough to set the scene and move the game along. However the relationship of the two main characters, Monkey and Trip soon becomes the main focus. Trip is your captor, she placing a headband on Monkey that forces him to obey her and kills Monkey if Trip dies. This adds an interesting dynamic between the characters. Initially there is a hate for Trip and her selfishness but as the story progresses the headband stops being the reason the player looks after her. It almost becomes irrelevant. It probably sounds like the game would do little to support a strong connection between you and Trip but actually this is its most successful piece. Gameplay revolving around carrying trip through areas she can't navigate and protecting her strengthens your involvement in the relationship in a way I didn't really expect. On the other hand don't think Trip is another useless female companion for you to escort, while she cannot fight the huge mechs on her own she has many gadgets to both protect herself and aid you, so that's nice.\n\nSo should you buy it? Maybe. The main thing to consider is whether the gameplay sounds too repetitive for you. If you enjoy God of War style combat then go for it. Enslaved definitely isn't something I regret buying however it is far from being one of my favourites, it was good while it lasted.","October 27, 2014","true","8.3"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","19","26","3","1"

Nothing groundbreaking, but if you're not averse to games like Prince of Persia 2008 or Uncharted, you might find the game to your liking as well. Funnily enough, the platforming segments are even less interactive than widely panned PoP2008 (single button+stick for directional input).\n\nThe environments, especially in the opening chapters were simply beautiful. Great use of color, lush vegetation, decayed civilization. Personally, out of all UE3 games I've played so far, I believe only Spec Ops: The Line could top this game graphic/design-wise. It gets minus points for some rather questionable texture work (at times you would think UE3 glitched out and stopped loading mip-maps of the texture after the first one) and the later levels, especially the junkyard ones, which simply didn't look as nice as the opening segments.\n\nStory was... there, I guess. Doesn't make much sense if you try to piece it together, but oh well. It's an action video game, if I wanted a story that wouldn't insult my intelligence I'd read a novel. Characters were all right, mocap work very impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, where Spec Ops was a really solid, (un)pleasant experience, I can't say Enslaved was as stress free. There is a well known bug with the game, which results in it freezing randomly once in a while. I'm not sure if you can call it stuttering when the freeze can last up to 30 seconds, and can be almost immediately followed by another one lasting as long. Also, shadows during cutscenes were beyond broken for me.\n\nAs you can imagine, this completely kills immersion, and is downright infuriating if you're hit with this during a fight or a timed platforming section. I hope my neighbors won't think badly of me now, with the amount of swearwords I uttered while playing (or rather waiting to play) the game.\n\nDLC was a completely separate thing, both story and gameplay-wise. And I do mean separate, where the main game had mostly QTE, platforming, fights and bits of shooting, DLC is pretty much a cover-based forced-stealth puzzle game. Reminded me more of an Oddworld game, truth be told. Later sections devolved into shooting galleries, which is a bummer.\n\nOverall, both the main scenario and DLC are a good way to spend a few hours. Your enjoyment of it will be largely dependent on how much the bug I mentioned will affect you, and, well, how much you like interactive movies.\n\nPrice I'd pay for the game and wouldn't feel ripped off? $3.75 tops.","April 2, 2014","true","12.5"," 31 of 48 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","31","48","0","1"

Don't get me wrong, the story in itself is not bad, although very predictable, but there's lack of lore and the ending doesn't really make much sense imo. Or at least didn't answer much of the questions i had, and left me with even more question.\n\nStill the game is worth it's price.\n\n8.5/10","November 14, 2015","true","13.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I've been on actual train rides that have been less railroaded. I get that it is for console gamers originally, but please, they cannot be that weakminded. Not a single place in the game can you figure stuff out for yourself, which pathway to take, or which way to solve a problem. You're basically just following instructions the whole game.\n-A lot of the gameplay involves jumping, but you can't jump wrong and there is only one path, so most of the time you don't need to see or aim where you're jumping. Just hit whatever direction you're going and jump, jump, jump. Ta-da, you're there.\n-Occasional annoyances due to camera angles\n-Some sections are impossible to succeed at unless you're very lucky or you know where the next obstacle is going to be.\n-The port from console is not flawless, sometimes when selecting menus with the mouse the cursor is not where it is supposed to be.\n-Unskipable cut-scenes. That you have to watch again and again if you die at a difficult section. Seriously, this is not acceptable!\n\nMain gripe:\nThis could have been an awesome game. But the way it has been designed, it should have been an animation movie instead. There's just not enough actual game in it. The player has no agency. I still finished the game, because I wanted to see where it was going and I was marginally pleased. No spoilers, but a waste-disposal related question popped into my mind when I saw the end cutscene, which is the kind of thing that annoys me. Aside from that anal-retentive (pun may be intended) technicality, the game as a whole just doesn't do it for me. There were times in the early game when I thought, this is going to be neat once all the hand-holding and easy linear paths become more complex, but that never happened. As such, I would not recommend this game if you're looking for a good game. If on the other hand you're looking for a cute interactive animated series, then, heck, it's all right for that purpose.","May 20, 2015","false","9.0"," 133 of 239 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","133","239","9","7"

It has absolutely everything you could want in a game, and in a world where games struggle to capture my attention for an extended period of time, this adventure had me engaged until the very end.\n\nEnter Monkey, a man who wakes up on a slave ship in the distant future. Humanity has fallen to a war with machines, and our hero has been captured by a slave ship run by robots and the mysterious organization "Pyramid". Then Tripp, another girl captured on the ship, inadvertantly helps you escape. From this point on you need to help Tripp return to her home village in the West. That's the basic story, but the relationship that forms between these two characters through the course of the game is not only believable, but keeps you, the player, going. This is all attributed to the pitch perfect voice acting, and detailed facial animation system. And let me just say, it's been years since my first completion on the Xbox 360 and I still think about the ending to this game.\n\nThe gameplay boils down to combat with robots, traversing gigantic set pieces, and completing simple puzzles. Everything about this game is so incredibly smooth. Combat feels great as you unleash deadly combos on your enemies with a variety of abilities, and the finishing moves look amazing. Traversing is similar to Assassin's Creed, and many of these sequences involve climbing crumbling buildings, massive robots, and everything in between. The puzzles are an easy distraction and aren't too challenging, but probably the weakest aspect of the game.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is the world. The art direction is absolutely gorgeous. The world of Enslaved has been reclaimed by nature, and the first half of the game has you venturing through locations with lush green and vibrant reds. In the later stages the levels become more mechanical, and heavy hues of purple become a regular theme. Every once in a while I just had to stop and look around to admire the view, it's that amazing.\n\nOther things I'd like to note are that the musical score is epic and really conveys a post-apocolyptic feel, and the game ran perfectly on my laptop with no issues to report.\n\nBottom line, don't wait any longer and get this game. It's beautiful, fun, and you will not soon forget it.","June 12, 2015","true","8.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

But I recently saw this in a sale on GMG and thought why the heck not and bought it. Boy am I glad I did. What a wonderful gaming experience!\n\nInspired by but very loosely based on the ancient Chinese tale, Journey to the West, ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West is one of the best 3D action games I have played. With a script written by Alex Garland as well as voice acting and mocapping by Andy Serkis, the story is one of the best I have experienced in a video game. Set in a post-apocalyptic USA, art design is splendid and it looks like the art team took their inspiration from the documentary Life After People, which isn't a bad thing. Setpieces are amazing, from beginning to end.\n\nGameplay however is merely adequate. Yes, it gets the job done. Yes. platforming segments are fun, especially if you love Uncharted-style platforming. But puzzles are super-easy and combat is just... perfunctory. It's not deep and it just seems to be there for the sake of being there.\n\nThe PC port isn't perfect either. I had input problems occasionally (usually after cutscenes). And while I have a fast PC (Core i7-3770, AMD Radeon HD7870XT), most times the game didn't feel like it was running at 60fps even though I had it vsynced. I didn't check but it also seemed that anti-aliasing didn't really work even though I had it switched on in the settings. I'm also left wondering whether the game was even running at 1080p.\n\nBut even with those slight hiccups, I enjoyed my time with it. I wholly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good action-platformer. It truly is an underrated gem.","April 6, 2014","true","14.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

A bad PC port, horrible camera and poor controls hamper what could of been a fun game. You spend more time wrestling with the game than playing it. You are constantly sabotaged while fighting by a camera that spins away from enemies, a autotargeting system that fails to target anything remotely useful, attacks that get redirected into thin air, attacks that simply pass through targets as the autotargeting decides to hit something else out of range. An unresponsive combat system, combo's that don't end even when you stop pressing buttons, and game crippling bugs that will force you to replay areas that you already cleared. The list of problems goes on and on... Attacks that won't activate, dying during some minor animation clip as it paralyses you while the mechs are still moving and attacking.\n\nThis game might of been passable 3 years ago on console but in todays world we expect some finesse in our combat and controls you will find this title sadly lacking. Its just a button mash of a game, with little skill required.\n\nThe character "acting" is the highlight of this game however, as it was when it first came out with some great moments in the cut-scenes that work better than most games.\n\nIf you want to play this game, pull it out of the bargain bin. I completed it on Hard on my first playthrough out of pure spite. And shame on the publishers for not having the games crippling bugs fixed in their game after 3 months of release time.","January 4, 2014","false","17.5"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","33","55","0","3"

I make that point because the graphics are beautiful - they really are! The face animations for the lead characters are humanly accurate and the textures for the world are stunning. You won't be let down.\n\n-STORY\n\nThe story was good, but I'm not talking about the actual plot here. I'm talking about the character development between the two lead characters progress very well as the frustrated yet powerful 'Slave' and the vulnerable yet dominating 'Slave owner' grow a bond that I won't spoil, but will say it was welcomed.\n\nAs for the main plot; well, it is what it is. It's good! But if you've watched most of the major sci-fi filmes of the last 20 years you'll recognise what book this page is ripped right out of.\n\n-PIGSY'S REVENGE\n\nI played the Premium Edition of the game that comes with all the extra costumes and a nice expansion pack called 'Pigsys Revenge' which is pleasantly long, and surprisingly good! You are not the physically powerful 'Monkey' of the main story but a grotesquely obese gadget god of the wastes; meaning you have to rely on gadgets in every room you enter. Which is great, because it's a nice change of pace compared to the main story. You have to stop and think in EVERY situation you enter.\n\nOverall this game gets a 9.5/10. I'm taking .05 off because the story is just not original enough. The rest of the game however, is a professionally polished joy ride.","August 1, 2015","true","12.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I simply love anything with a post-apocalyptic theme so it is somewhat odd that it has taken until now for me to get stuck into this. The storyline is based very loosely on the novel 'Journey to the West' written by Wu Cheng'en. But unlike the original story that is set in a fantasy version of ancient China, Enslaved is set 150 years into the future following a global war, with only the remnants of humanity left along with mechs left over from the conflict.\n\nWhat is refreshing though is that coupled with the damsel in distress angel, the world after the war is actually beautiful to look at. The usual reliance on a grey and brown colour pallete is not here, instead Ninja Theory have taken a different approach and the world hums with light and colour. The ruined city of New York, now decayed and destroyed has been taken back by nature (think of the documentary 'Life After People' and you've got the idea). The games great art style is not restricted to the scenery, as the characters are also pleasing to the eye, especially during the cutscence sequences.\n\nThe game is a mostly linear experience that is heavily narrative driven, but this is combined with good action/adventure and platforming mechanics. If you're familiar with console games like Uncharted, you'll be familiar with the formula here. Get from A to B, fight a few monsters, climb on some buildings/structures along your way and deal with the occasional boss.\n\nSo go on and buy it! It's worth the asking price.\n","May 9, 2015","true","10.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

One of the hidden gems of the last generation.\nTL;DR version in the bottom of the review.\n\nSTORY:  A reimagining of the Chinese novel "Journey to the West" by Wu Cheng'en. It’s set in a bleak overgrown with vegetation post-apocalyptic world, ruled by slavers and machinery, you follow Monkey and Trip on their journey to get Trip back to her home safely. If Trip dies, you (Monkey) die.\nThe game's opening pulls you into the story and it never let you go; you're constantly on the lookout for what's next!\nI won't spoil much because the story is the game's highlight for me.\n\nGAMEPLAY:  The game is an action adventure platformer at heart, with some simple puzzles thrown at you a few times to shakeup the game's pace a bit.\nThe combat is simple, yet fun enough to keep you engaged through the game's 7 hour campaign. Red glowing orbs are the game's currency; they are used to upgrade Monkey's fighting capabilities, health and shield.\nWeird floating white masks are the extra collectibles found within the game, they reveal much about the game's world and story since they give you glimpses of the life that was before the war.\nOne of the major gripes with the gameplay is the camera, sometimes you'll be fighting the camera instead of fighting the enemies! Other noticeable flaws with the game is the lack of direction in some of the platforming areas, you’ll be wandering around aimlessly in until you find the correct path.\n\nGRAPHICS:  Varied beautiful looking locales with vivid colors shining all through the game coupled with great animations and facial expressions that bring the characters to life. Motion capture genius Andy Serkis (Gollum - Ceaser) worked on the game's motion capture and he even co-written the game's story ( he even appears in the game! and he is also Monkey's voice actor ) . The game runs on Unreal engine 3 which runs really well. Don't expect to be blown away by the game’s graphical prowess though, it’s a 2010 game. The game relies on its style to impress.\n\nAUDIO:  Superb voice acting that brings the characters to life. The soundtrack sets the mood right in every scene, weather being chased by a mechanical rhino or chilling in a boat gazing at the stars, the soundtrack is mesmerizing.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing, captivating story set in a believable world and lovable characters.\n- Great platforming gameplay\n- Simple yet fun combat\n- Short but sweet (7 hours)\n\nCons:\n- Wonky camera (at times)\n- Misguided platfroming paths in some sections\n- Short but sweet (7 hours)\n\n9/10","November 23, 2014","true","6.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

At the first glance, the game is absolutely gorgeous, despite its age. But our first meeting was marred by a s-hitty camera and bad controls (keyboard and mouse). I was told it'd be better with a controller but I don't have one to test it with. But anyway, I managed to complete the game with only keyboard + mouse.\n\nThe Chinese story (or legend) that it was based on, Journey to the West, is a personal favourite of mine; and so, I persevered and boy, was I glad I did. I got used to the control somehow (though it did still gave me problems, especially during fights), and I fell in love with the game. I didn't even take to Trip initially because she was very needy and all, but she grew on me. There was never a dull moment in the game and even though it's a face-paced game, the dialogues gave us valuable snippets and insights into the characters' personalities and helped the players' immersion into the story.\n\n+ Loved the graphics; for a post-apocalyptic world, it was vibrant and stunning\n+ Loved the characters, yes, even Trip, the damsel in distress ("Save me, Monkey!" ~ *sigh*).\n+ Loved the dialogues, especially the light and funny banter between the characters.\n+ Good melee system, though simple.\n+ Great story.\n+ Superb voice acting.\n+ Very forgiving check points.\n\n- S-hitty non-flexible camera, sometimes made me dizzy\n- Average controls (keyboard + mouse)\n- Easy and short final boss fight.\n- Unskippable cut scenes\n- Linear; path is marked.\n\nIt was sad to say goodbye to the characters; I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH TRIP AND MONKEY NEXT. *sigh* I wish there'll be a sequel.\n\nAnyway, yes, I was glad I gave it a second chance. It was definitely a fun ride. Would absolutely recommend this at its original price, and it's a no-brainer if it's on sale.\n\nMy Rating: 9/10","October 26, 2015","true","12.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It has one of the most interesting settings I've ever seen and the character development is phenomenal. The voice acting in particular is some of the best in all of video games. The only real downside is that gameplay is as standard as you can get. It is mostly a God of War style hack n' slach with a needless and hideously broken RPG style upgrade system. The level design is reminicent of Devil May Cry but the platforming is contextual, meaning there is only one real way to go and is impossible to fail. There is some form of collectible hunting but it is mostly tied to the upgrade system, makeing it almost just as needless.\n\nThe gameplay in the DLC would have better suited the entire game, with abilities unlocking via progression and the game presenting you with a problem and expecting you to resolve it with what you have at your disposal. All in all, as someone who values story, setting and Immersion over gameplay, this game is pure gold and comes highly recomended. Indeed even considering the lack luster gameplay, I was completly won over by the charm and richness of the setting and story.","November 3, 2014","true","11.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'm not sure how else to put it. Maybe I was just in need of a good story but I'm not sure I care. I enjoyed every bit of Enslaved. The story was simple but well thought out and, for me, really felt alive. As far as games go there were some minor "issues" that should be mentioned: Some choppy screen rates, awkward lighting, blocky animations, but they were few and far between and didn't really take anything away from the experience. The puzzles were simplistic but still had a nice rhythm to them and the overall flow of the game just felt right. Combat was also rather simplistic but still left your options wide open. With no set combos you were really just free to go crazy with it but in doing so it didn't feel like you were just mashing buttons.\n\nNotable parts to mention for me included:\n1.Great voice acting as well as an interesting script that felt realistic at every moment. Nothing felt too cliché or over done and It was really easy to relate to the characters and their emotions from sad to funny and angry to carefree.\n\n2. Story. It's a story about a journey and questions that may not have answers. Very relatable and has a strong impact for better or worse. For me something like that is timeless and deserves many replays.\n\n3. I'm kind of a sucker for the unreal engine\n\nEnslaved doesn't feel like it's trying to be some ground breaking adventure game that has new twists and is trying to force some special mechanic. It just feels like a solid, down to earth, absorbing story that really carries you along, is easy to relate to and keeps you interested.","June 25, 2014","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

He's the character you play as, and you'll spend much of the game climbing around, keeping an eye out for Trip, and crushing mechs with your staff. There are even rare moments where he can use a hoverboard (which he refers to as a "cloud") to cross over lakes and such.\n\nThe parellels to the classic Chinese novel "Journey to the West" are pretty obvious.\n\nAs an action-adventure game, Enslaved leads towards the simplistic side of things. Well, perhaps simplistic isn't the word I'm looking for. Overly approachable, casual, automated, ehhh I'm better off just explaining it. Enslaved is one of those games that would have been very difficult a generation or three ago. Let's use Tomb Raider for comparison. The original game featured some difficult platforming segments. You had to account for several different possibilities. Is Lara moving fast enough? Did she jump at the right moment? Are there obstacles nearby? Fast-forward through numerous sequels and now you don't have to worry about where and when to jump. If you're facing the right direction, Lara will always make the jump. Enslaved pushes this game-design even further. You can't die from falling even if you wanted to, Monkey won't allow it. I think I managed a falling death once, and that was by getting zapped out of the air by a Mech. It was more of a fluke than anything.\n\nThere is a lot of fighting to be done in this game, but it's typically very trivial. I have to wonder how Capcom decided Ninja Theory was a good fit for Devil May Cry after playing through this game. While not quite a button-masher, Enslaved's combat doesn't require much effort. Enemies fall into certain camps. There are the close-range slashers, the long-range shooters, shockers have some mid-range ability, sometimes they have shields. The strategy rarely deviates from "hit them really hard" or "blast them with plasma and/or stun shots". Also, there's not much in the way of stylish maneuvers. Monkey does some flipping and spinning around, but he's not pulling off any Dante-esque combos. None of the mechs survive long enough anyway. I made the mistake of playing this game on the easy difficulty. Not only did Monkey never die (in combat), he never lost more than 1/5th of his health. It's best to jump straight to the hard difficulty, which doesn't make much of a difference aside from everyone doing a bit more damage. Most of my deaths came from mines.\n\nWith easy combat and platforming, Enslaved thrives almost entirely on its other aspects. The locales in this game are pretty neat to visit, and there's some nice attention to detail in this post-apocalyptic land. The pacing is also effectively done, with a nice balance between combat, puzzle-solving, and a hint of exploration. Some credit should also be given to the chapter setup. This game is broken up into 14 chapters, and most of them can be completed in 15-20 minutes. You can play for a fairly short amount of time, and still make quite a bit of progress. I prefer this over having something like 5 chapters that take an hour or more to get through.\n\nAs an action game, Enslaved is bound to disappoint. It does work as more of an adventure game though. The world is impressively-realized, the characters (all three of them) are well-done, and for the most part it's a breezy experience that you just take in.\n\nThree characters? Oh right...can't forget about Pigsy.\nThis dude is another reference to Journey to the West. While human, Pigsy is also part...mecha pig. He's a fat slob with an eye for Trip, and he wears socks with his sandals. Unlike his inspiration, this little piggy prefers a sniper rifle over an 11,000 pound rake. In the latter half of the game he's the comic relief, and he ain't too bad at it. He also has his own quest. This was originally DLC in the console version of Enslaved. Pigsy's Perfect 10 follows his misadventures in building a new friend. As I said, Enslaved has three characters, it's a pretty lonely world.\n\nUnlike Monkey, Pigsy isn't very tough, punch or stab him a couple times and he's a goner. In order to survive, you have to sneak around, make your shots count, and take advantage of various gadgets. Unlike the main game, there's actually a bit of creativity and depth that goes into each encounter. Simply blasting everyone is never the answer, but you can distract them, stun them, seduce them(?!) to fight your enemies, or simply destroy them with a bomb. While this quest does run a bit long, I think it does a good job at providing something different from the rest of Enslaved. The similarities to cover-based shooters are apparent, but PP10 does enough to stand out. This is pretty impressive for a DLC adventure.","November 14, 2014","true","11.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was worried coming into it, because I read a lot of reviews and forum comments that said this was a game "on rails", completely linear and therefore, terrible.\n\nWell that's just wrong. Sure, it is a linear game, but I thought there was still enough exploring of the areas you went though that it was open enough. Just because a game isn't an open world/sandbox game, doesn't mean it's bad. As for the game being on rails? I read a review that said the game babied you, showed you exactly where to go and what do the whole time, but in my case at least, that wasn't true. There was a few times in the game I was stuck, and not because of a bug in the game, but because I was stumped. And when I figured out to do, it was a slap to the ol' forehead, but that type of puzzle platforming is good to me.\n\nNow on to combat: There is some criticism to be made, because outside of "boss" battles, there are like 3 or 4 different types of enemies you will fight throughout the game. Once you learn the best way to take each one down, combat becomes easier, but I still died my fair share of times in the game, trying to figure out the right strategy for the certain environment/enamies I was dealing with.\n\nThe combat system is not cut and dry though, even though there are limited combos you can learn in the game. But the different combos come with the upgrade system, as well as many other "perks" that you sometimes find in games like these. Somewhat similar to the Batman Arkham games "perk" system (Only other recently played game that has something like that, so it came to mind).\n\nLast word for combat: It's freaking awesome feeling and looking to finish off a group of mechs, they've got some great animations for the final kill. And that's not to mention the cinematics of the boss fights/finishes.\n\nNow where the game is really great, is the story. That's what got me to buy the game regardless of the negative reviews/comments. I saw a lot of good reviews/comments saying that the story made the game worth it. I honestly didn't think the rest of the game was as bad as people make it out to be, but I will agree that the story is fantasic. It really isn't the best story ever, but it's pretty damm good, and what makes it even better is the feeling you will develop for the characters in the game. I can't even get into that part of it because of spoilers, but if you like a good story with engaging characters that you develop bonds with, then this game is probably one that you will enjoy.","July 15, 2014","true","17.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I read a couple reviews after finishing the game, both claimed the game “never frustrates”, yet that is the defining feature of the game. It ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off many times.\n\nPlatforming is rigid. Like Thief 4 you can only jump in predetermined areas. This means I was rolling around two-three times near ledges before I happened to hit the jump area. Sometimes your character jumps automatically, sometimes you have to press a button. There’s no consistency. At one point you’re told you can’t clamber while carrying Trip, your companion. 30 minutes later you’re required to carry her while clambering in order to progress, without the game prompting you to do so. Button assignments are nonsensical. Sometimes you press A to perform an action, sometimes B. It’s constant button mashing. It’s also glitchy. Several times I was teleported outside the hidden walls, and I had to restart the checkpoint or I died by suddenly flying up in the air. The rigid platforming was intended to make the game smooth and accessible. But instead it’s the worst thing about it. It doesn’t even signpost where you’re supposed to go properly. All platforms you can interact with flash, but because the game is so bright it’s still easy to miss. Despite how controlled the platforming is it’s possible to do buggy jumps, where you fly off past platforms to somewhere you’re not supposed to be. It’s no Tomb Raider, or even Prince of Persia. It’s more like Legacy of Kain.\n\nEven with everything that annoyed me the game is still ok. The story was written by Alex Garland and Andy Serkis, who when they make movies tend to make very nice stuff. The same is true here. The story, setting and characters are great. But because they came from film, the story feels a lot like a movie script. The big important moments are there, but all the stuff around it, the “game” bits, don’t fit naturally into the script. It has several sections which feel like drawn out busywork. I could easily see players get bored in some of the puzzle sections and never finish the game because of it. I’m glad I powered through the slow bits and finished the game. It has its moments, and the ending is good. I’m now more impressed by the quality of Ninja Theory’s work in DmC. They made huge steps forward in that game compared to Enslaved. Unlike SCE Santa Monica who make the same God of War game over and over, Ninja Theory saw what went wrong, and had the ambition to do better next time. Who knows, maybe by their next game they’ll be able to match Platinum Games.","December 10, 2014","true","6.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In short yes, yes i did. Its a really nice game, graphiics are great, clean visuals and a nice style, controls are good and there is a nice balance between platforming and combat It is worth noting that i played using a game pad, as there are a lot of quick time events. The strongest element i felt was the story(apart from the end which i felt was a bit of a missed oppertunity) theres a really nice relationship between the characters and they are excellently voice acted. On a negative note its a bit repetitive and linear, now dont get me wrong, i have nothing against linear games as they are often a great vehicle for telling a story exactly the way it was intended but i see little replay value in this as a result and as the main draw for me is the story once you experience iit you will probably shelve it. In summary great game, well worth a play but as its pretty short and if you are anything like me you will likely play it once, try get it on sale- think i paid 6 bucks for it but its definetly worth a bit more..","February 25, 2015","true","9.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I finally got around to playing it this week, and I'm glad I did.\n\nGameplay-wise it's similar to Uncharted (or games of that ilk) - climbing/platform-y sections interspersed with fights with enemies and the occasional puzzle. The key differences in gameplay are a focus on melee attacks (which I prefer) and your constant escort/partner, Trip. She has a few abilities she can use to help you out (distract enemies, EMP) and she's also the one who can upgrade your abilities (which means if she's not around then you're not upgrading ♥♥♥♥). The gameplay is solid, though not very challenging. The platforming doesn't even let you fail; there are some jumps you have to time correctly, but you can never accidentally jump to your death. The combat, on normal difficulty, never made me feel like I was going to die.\n\nThe setting is pretty cool - it's a post-apocalyptic world not unlike what the previews for Horizon: Zero Dawn look like. Things are reverting back to nature, there are antagonistic mech animals and humanoids, but some technology is still around and kicking. The story is decent, though I didn't quite feel like the concept was explored enough - the story was also written by Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Sunshine, Dredd) which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe protagonist, Monkey (not actually a monkey, it's just his name, but he has some monkey-like characteristics) is pretty great. I like his character design (if I were twice as big as I currently am and all muscle I would probably want to cosplay him), and he's performed perfectly by Andy Serkis. Monkey's partner, Trip, is also pretty great. She's a little damsel-y at times, but I like that they just establish that you each have your own skill sets, and beating up mechs is Monkey's. The chemistry between Trip and Monkey makes the first half of the game fantastic.\n\nThen, halfway through, they introduce a third wheel named Pigsy. He is the worst ♥♥♥♥ing character. He's needlessly crude, hits on Trip in a creepy way, and kind of kills the dynamic. Everything else about the game I love, but Pigsy is an attempt at comedy relief that fell horribly flat.\n\nIn spite of that, I still definitely recommend this game. The third act doesn't quite come together (the presence of Pigsy and an underwhelming plot resolution combine to bring it down a notch or two), but even that isn't enough to put a damper on the overall game (and it only took me 7 hours to get through).","October 10, 2015","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I don't mean the graphics (well, graphically it's beatiful as well), but the atmosphere, the design and the story - they are just BEAUTIFUL. The gameplay is like a lighter Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time with a bit too much climbing, but that's ok. The soundeffects, the music and especially the voice acting are awesome. The only problem this game has is the terrbile controls, the dumbass mouse and camera handling. And they are more frustrating in the Pigsy's Perfect 10 (it's a separate little story where you play as Pigsy - you can find it in the Extras menu).\n\nThe story seems a bit slow, yet it's not boring at all, not even for a sec (at least to me). The dialogs are well-written, they are funny, sad, touching - so there's everything. And the ending... Hard to not spoil it, so I just tell ya it's damn cool, I really like it.\n\nI hate that with full of my heart when a game has bad or worse controls/camera, nevertheless the Enslaved is absolutely worth to play.\n\nAnd one more thing: I don't quite think she did the right thing...","February 3","true","62.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rumsy/recommended/245280/","Rumsy","iTzDope360WaitIMean420","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rumsy/","70 products in account","I have to say this was the best $5 I have ever spent on a game. I kind of wish I had just given the developer $20 toward a sequel.\n\n10/10. Gorgeous art even on this shitbox, fluid combat/movement that is engaging until the end and some future replayability because DLC/awesomeness from everything outside the story/lack of sequel.\n\nFirst, the game plays out sort of like this:\nYou adventure through an area via Assassin's Creed-esque climbing antics. While climbing is not as intense as it is in the AC games, in ENSLAVED it is more streamlined especially early on. I didn't really enjoy the scaling until later in the game when there were more challenges added to it, but I didn't hate it either. One of the things they do really nicely is, the camera angle changes slightly when you climb. At first it was a bit off-putting, but I quickly realized that they were giving really cool angles with their gorgeous backgrounds and art style. It quickly becomes sort of addicting to scale these large beautiful expanses with your every step looking like a screenshot in a gaming magazine.\n\nWhen you aren't reaching new heights, you're fighting mech mobs or mini-bosses. The combat is pretty simplistic and is carried by mechanics being constantly introduced to keep it refreshing. I played through the game on hard first, which made it feel more rewarding as I can't imagine how stale the combat must feel on easy. Once you get in a good rhythym it's easy to overlook the fact that combat consists of spamming X and Y. You can upgrade your dude as you progress and eventually the B button plays a small role too. All the mechs do something different that help you clear the mob if you can take advantage of them. They block and dodge which can be annoying but makes it all the sweeter when you get a slow-motion kill on them. Your dude is pretty much Goku. Seriously, both Dragonball Z and this game are based on the same Chinese story so your guy is pretty much Goku in a different world and setting.\n\nLastly, the story and characters are pretty well done. You play as Monkey (Goku) who has a complex relationship with a highly skilled techno-wiz/hacker named Tripitaka or Trip for short. Without spoiling past the first 5 minutes, the complex part being that in the first few minutes of the game you become enslaved by her. Now you can't get too far away from her or let her die or you die. This actually has more effect on the story than actual combat, but there were a few fights where mechs went after her or I climbed too far from her and ended up dying. I fell in love with both these characters and their interactions, and I think it had to do with the amazing motion capture and the actress/actor used. The beautiful environments, witty dialogue and crazy cinematics helped. The story itself is nothing to write home about. It is pretty much these two just trying to survive while travelling West. What makes the story seem particularly good though is that you genuinely care about these characters pretty quickly and can't wait to see where their adventure takes them next. This is all tied together by a fairly interesting ending to the plot. Again, without spoiling, I think perhaps my final thought process during the ending is telling:\n\n"Oh yeah, there's a plot to this game I guess besides them just travelling. Okay there is kind of a message about the human condition that most post-apocalyptic content has already explored. Well, that was kind of a neat twist to a plot I hadn't thought important while playing, a plot that I thought was just a means to the journey's end. Not exactly an original twist, but a neat spin on it for this context."\n\nThat all being said, the story really benefitting from the character's relationship unfolding makes the ending kind of maddening. I really want this game to have done well so that they would make a sequel. I really love the setting. I really love the main characters and their adventures. There are loose ends left when the game ends when it comes to the characters' story. I guess that is always the case when you want a game to keep going. You want to know what happens to them next. The next game could have picked up where it left off. This game felt like certain aspects such as climbing or combat were really well done but maybe a few tweaks in a sequel could have perfected them. It's glaringly obvious this game was set for a sequel that might never come because of lower than expected sales and that's a shame. A damn shame. A damn crying shame.\n\nEdit: I wouldn't be doing this game justice if I forgot to mention how much of a fox Trip is.","October 11, 2014","true","20.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I dont belive it would hold up well in this generation of games because of how repetitive it is. Over the course of the game you will be climbing to the next area where you will fight more robots and then repeating, excluding the very rare moments it tries to change things up. Combat itself is very repetitive but still somewhat enjoyable later on after a few move upgrades but really.....spamming the heavy attack 3 times on a robot which is the same attack you will use 95% of the game is combat in a nutshell. You do unlock a range attack which one-shots (after upgrades) robots later on but ammo for it is so rare that you have to keep it for when you need it. While in combat the camera is also...not great. it will often pan to a view where you cant see the robots while in combat so it could be better.\n\nOverall the game is "Okay", I liked alot of the story even though it was mostly drawn out alot to stretch the whole game out to be longer though some events made me think "WTF", I wont say what they are because spoilers but consider them plot holes/bad decisions that made me think the story was rushed of somewhat. Its worth getting if you want a simple game to use up your time and its on sale but dont go in expecting something amazing, its still okey..... but not great.\n\nPs. After you meet "Pigsy" I get the feeling some insperation was taken from "Beyond good and evil"...main character fighting with a staff in a futuristic world with a pig-like mechanic as a sidekick","October 15, 2015","true","10.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

A LOT. If you're into the mainly casual hey let's just enjoy the scenery or whatever game, you may or may not see these things, but when you're seconds from a mine near some cash and your turn animation puts you in mine proximity... It happens, trust me.\n\nIn my opinion, this game could have easily been made Co Op, beef up enemies, boom, teamwork required. But it's not, anyhow, as it is and from a glance it appears to be a grueling escort mission as you play the slave, where the entire prologue could have made the title itself seem so real. As you really get treated like dirt only to be... Needed shortly after in the worst of ways.\n\nThe game will surely pull your strings. However, it is not bad at all, but the way the game looks and behaves visually will make you question some of the more simpler things games had. Like being what it is and not slapping you with a kill trap. Though, you do in fact need each other's help a lot in this game, and unlike other look I have a partner, God they're useless games. There is enough there for you to enjoy playing and actually feel like there is some teamwork involved despite it really being mostly if not entirely micro management, followed with some story conversation and a lot of jesting and orders from her... Hopefully she quits or takes that helmet off soon, or there are some EA elements that allow some sort of character growth and choice that really allows a character to bond and not play soldier.\n\nRegardless, it's worth a sale buy, and if you can let go of a few orbs or walk really really REALLY REALLY slow near the mines to get them. (Not exaggerating, at all) You can come to enjoy what this game has to offer rather than repeatedly waste three to five minutes of your life each time tripping the same mine in rapid succession in a stubborn "But I'm good at these" craze.\n\nBut in my humble opinion, if you're looking for a more accurate vision of platforming or even Co op, there are other better more precise or more checkpoint friendly games you could pursue. But as visuals and story experiences go, I think this won't disappoint here. As always, if you are unsure, hit a walkthrough and such.","October 27, 2014","true","7.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Because If I did, I might hold my horse back and wait at least for some time!\n\nThe game was done by Ninja Theory (which is one of my favourite game studios in U.K), it is pretty amazing on graphics and storyline. (I believe they took some inspirations from a famous Chinese fantasy novel which is called “ Journey to the West” due to some pretty obvious elements from the original novel which I found was hilarious.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit different from an AA game we usually play. Your journey is going through with a female NPC who called Trip along your side. But you’re her slave rather than a fair companion, Most of the time, following her orders is the significant part of your objectives, if you don’t do so, she would kill you without a second thought( which I found was not that enjoyable). In addition, this is a very linear game that I need to mention in this review, because some of you might not enjoy it that much.\n\nAnd also, regarding to the gameplay, it takes some time to get use to her, but before it, you might have a lot of unpleasant experience with her around.\n\nThe most terrible part of the game is: The check points are so few, if you die somewhere in a chapter, you would take a big risk to redo the whole chapter again, which I found wasn’t so necessary to an Action & Adventure based-on game. Well, there are few exceptions, but just not that many.\n\n*Warning!! You have to read this below!\n\nOh, boy...This game could be fantastic if only without SO many bugs and laggy issue which torn the game into pieces.\n\nIt has been tested that the game will constantly & randomly freeze and it HAS nothing to do with your machines!\n\nAnd with countless bugs here and there, it severely damages your gameplay experience and might even stop you from your progress!! I said so, because it happened to many gamers including me. With a long term without frequent check points, this just makes the walkthrough even worse. I had experienced fighting bosses and trigging bugs neither could my character die nor could he attack, and I reloaded the last CP but to find I have to do the whole combat sequence all over again!!\n\nOverall, if you can bare all the bugs which could be breathe taking for the gameplay and laggy issue which is very annoying while engaging your enemies, and still not losing your faith on playing it, this is the game for you!\n\nIf you just want to have a trial of it, I strongly recommend you purchase it on the other console like Xbox 360 or PS platform, because the PC console seriously does not look like a finished game, and is way too far waiting to be fixed completely!\n\n\nScarlet’s Score: 8.4/10 (However, for all the bugs, Freeze on random Machine, etc.) = 7.4/10","February 10, 2014","false","15.2"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","26","47","0","2"

It's also one of the most boring games I've ever played. I see it in my Steam queue and I end up wanting to do the dishes instead.\n\nThe combat is cliched borderline button-mash with the pre-requisite unnecessary RPG experience system tied in. So if you want the regeneration perk that breaks the game right off the bat and makes health packs almost unnecessary, start running around for those red-colored experience points! You'll be able to grab it after you collect about 60 of them.\n\nPlatforming is constant, and it's the kind of platforming designed by a really fussy nanny that doesn't tolerate failure. It's almost impossible to fall to your death, and the game only lets you change positions only if you go towards the shiny handhold things. The puzzles are in the style of Quake II, that is that they are actually not puzzles but busywork. Like doing the dishes, then having to take the mashed robots out to the recycling bin.\n\nEven the narrative that the game loves so much isn't great. The fundamentals are fine, except for the part where there's no clear antagonist and the game doesn't go into detail about what's going on. It's still better than usual, but the drive of the game disappears about halfway in when the developers decide it's time to kill the big bad man introduced only really introduced near the end of the game! Woo hoo, I like it when my villains are pop-up targets to shoot in the face! Like Pop Tarts! Pop Tarts shaped like Hitler!\n\nIt's eighty minutes of movie stretched to five hours. And because something's gotta be done with the other three hours and forty minutes, there's undisciplined game design, busywork masquerading as puzzles, and robots that are evil because there's evil robots, evil robots with guns, and sometimes there's evil robots who enslave people.

She sees Monkey's savage power and enslaves him using a headband while he's knocked out, and when he wakes she tells him that if she dies, he dies and that he needs to take her home.\n\nIt's the growing relationship between these two that really makes it all happen.. from the startingly realistic facial expressions to the excellent voice acting to the superlative writing, a lot of what makes their relationship blossom goes unsaid; a nice change from the simplicity of most story-telling these days.\n\nThrow in her Uncle Pigsy later in the game and a whole bunch of simple but entertaining platforming and combat sequences, this game will charm you right up until the stunning epilogue... an epilogue might I add that most reviewers seem to have missed the point of; not every 'boss' needs to be a combat-behemoth.\n\nHighly recommend at its current price, or take a stab when it goes on sales.

Noire. The world with it's fantastic looking backrounds makes you feel involved and part of it, and while the gameplay is fairly straightforward and isn't as exciting as done before in games like 'God of War'  and 'Prince of Persia' titles in recent years, it is entertainning enough if you don't mind casual games. In the end it's the story and performances that really make this title shine.\n\nPerformance wise it's a bit rough on PC (read: rough port), with a few annoying hang-ups here and there, but in all it's a fantastic cinematic adventure. Just be sure to play it with a controller to get the best out of it, while the mouse can come in handy with the shooting parts of the game.","March 10, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquishyFishyFish/recommended/245280/","SquishyFishyFish","Squishiest Fish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SquishyFishyFish/","141 products in account","An incredibly enjoyabe story driven action adventure game. Ninja Theory have done a truly exemplary job of adapting the classic Chinese tale Journey to the West into a post-apocalyptic tale of heartbreak and an ambiguous revenge.\n\nThere are issues with the game - while always satisfying, combat quickly becomes a bit dull and the upgrade system bears no more mention than that its there. Clambouring around as the main character Monkey is good fun, but again the climbing system lacks an real nuance or depth - its a bit of button mashing with a few odd timing challenges thrown in, but thats about it. Avoiding enemies and sneaking around is more or less impossible in most instances - there are fairly regular sections of the game where you simply have to take a few bullets while diving from cover to cover, before eventually reahcing your goal or anhiletaing the bullet drones, making for some linear gameplay.\n\nYou may read that and think that this is a poor game, and in a sense you'd be right. The gameplay itself is nothing new or revolutionary - you could be forgiven for thinking you were playing Jak and Dexter or similar action adventure games of old. The gameplay is, simply put, a bit pedestrian (espcially for 2014, when I purchased it, though not too bad for 2010, its original release).\n\nHowever, where this game really shines is how Ninja Theory have approached the story, characters and world. This a beautifully designed, atmospheric imagining of an America torn up by a long and brutal world war, in which nature is well along its way in recapturing those lands twisted by human toil. The result is a beautiful, lush green world - a far cry from the dull browns that dominate most post-apocalyptic settings. Whats more, our introduction to the world isn't a sad, cliched voiceover explaining the follies of human kind, or a slideshow or any other tired trope; in fact, the little we learn about Enslaveds setting is carefully dolled out through the story and world you move through. Ninja Theory are one of those rare studios that truly lives the "show, don't tell" rule, and in building the setting for Enslaved, they present an arguable master class.\n\nThe characters in this game are probably two of the best I've come across in any video game - our fairly quiet protagonist Monkey and our chatty teenaged heroine Trip are both voiced and, surprisingly, animated with an exceptional amount of depth and nuance. Slight inflections of voice, tilting of head, and stellar mocap work by the venerable Andy Serkis all come together to create cutscense and character animations that you actually look forward to watching. The one let down is that Trip, our constant companion, has clearly not recieved the same amount of attention in the animation department as Moneky - although that comparison might be slightly unfair considering that Monkey was voiced and mocapped by the unreachable Andy Serkis.\n\nWhere this game really starts to shine is in the pacing. While the gameplay has its issues, as alluded to before, they're almost entirely a non-issue because of just how well each element is balanced against the other as the story progresses. You won't find yourself becoming bored or frustrated very often - each successive section of the game offers plenty of variety with very well timed cutscenes, making for an experience that is surprisingly enjoyable, despite its lack of challenge.\n\nOverall, Ninja Theory have created a great story driven game, let down by decidely middle of the road gamplay. However, depsite this, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is probably one of my favourite games of all time due to its excellent characterizations, top notch story telling and beautiful atmosphere. I was bitterly dissapointed to learn that a planned sequel was canned.\n\nA few notes for those interested in buying this game:\n\n- A gamepad is an absolute necessity. Don't even try to play this game with a mouse and keyboard\n- Go to this thread for some great tips on how to make this game as pretty as it deserves to be: http://steamcommunity.com/app/245280/discussions/0/792924952664793625/\n","January 3, 2015","true","9.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even though the general setting and game world design might seem to be a matter of taste (You're fighting 2-3m tall human-like Robots with a staff. yay.), the game still turns out to be well worth being played. It's a single-player story driven game, levels are mostly very linear and unchallenging to play through, which is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nThe graphical design of the game is pretty amazing and quite beyond what I expected after seeing just a little ingame footage. The landscapes are awesomely made, really a game made for screenshots. Animations are top notch, very fluid and natural, character design is really quite good, though a matter of taste nonetheless. For the matter of melee finishing moves, it seems they tried something quite awesome, when killing the last enemy in a group of attackers, the camera changes to a cinematic slow-mo close-up, the actual attack animation doesn't really change but is so well made that, when the killed mech is breaking apart it still really makes for an awesome sight that you wouldn't normally see in regular speed fighting.\nGlow or particle effects are minimal in comparison to other games with a similar style of gameplay which makes it quite easy to actually see very well what's going on in combat, which isn't a common thing.\n\nNow for the only really bad thing I have to say about the game (which is really an awesome result for the game, all things considered) is:\n\nIt's quite hard to play with keyboard and mouse, at least that's what I experienced. Also the keyboard controls CAN NOT be changed, which is something that really really takes a chip out of my like-gem here...\nNone the less, the game was exceptionally nice to play with an X-360 Controller f. Windows. I can really recommend it.\n\nSo, if you'd like to play a game that won't take a hundred hours to actually get somewhere, and still is some fun to play, if you like a storyline progressing in a comfortable pace, beautiful post apocalyptic scenery and a gameplay system that isn't tetris but not too complex neither:\n\nGet it. =)","December 28, 2013","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One of the best games I have played in 2016 (I've only come across the game recently).\n\nIf you tweak the Unreal Engine .ini file, you can play in modern resolution and the graphics are gorgeous even today.\n\nOther pros:\n- engaging storyline\n- nice graphics and setting\n- good music\n- the 2 characters are well developed and very authentic\n- the fights are fun and the gameplay is overall satisfying\n\nCons:\n- the graphics on the PC need ini tweakage before they look acceptable\n- gameplay might be a bit repetitive\n- difficulty might be too easy for some (the plattforming parts are impossible to fail)\n\nOverall I strongly recommend the game. Well worth the money and a beautiful gem that is probably underrated.","May 1","true","16.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/recommended/245280/","MrWoodenSheep","MrWoodenSheep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrWoodenSheep/","2273 products in account","I can't recommend this game more. I played it years ago on Xbox when it came out, adored it, and rebought it instantly when it was released on Steam. I loved it that much. Played the game countless times, and it's definitely up there in my top 10 games of all time.\n\nLet me just start by saying that for anyone that likes the old adventure games we used to have like Ratchet and Clank, Spyro, Beyond good and Evil, Rayman etc. this game is a fantastic way to get yourself into the same world you used to feel when playing those older games. It could also be compared to newer games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted.\n\nStory:\n=====\n\nWithout giving away too much of the discovery on your part, I can say that the world is a very fresh take on the post-apocalyptic setting. The cutscenes and dialogue are very gripping, polished and well spoken. All characters are very likeable, (all 3 of them).\n\nGameplay:\n========\n\nThe gameplay consists of platforming and combat. The platforming is relatively easy, though the difficulty is ramped up during sections where you're running away from something, or you might have the ground and walls collapsing under you. It generally feels very satisfying. The combat is relatively fleshed out. At first you don't exactly have many abilities to use, but you can gain more through a rewarding level-up system. Different enemy types keep you on your feet, forcing you to deal with them differently or use them to your advantage against their allies. There are some sections before actually getting to the enemy, where you'll have to move from cover to cover using decoy abilities and such to get to the enemy before they shoot you to bits, without going into spoilers, I'll just say the boss fights are very fun to play, with intuitive ways of killing them as you implement things you have learned in the game to defeat them. There's also one very fun type of section where you use a gadget I don't want to spoil, so I'll just say it feels veeeery fun and cool to use.\n\nGraphics, Sound and Music:\n====================\n\nAs I said earlier, the game uses an unusual post-apocalyptic setting, in the sense that the environment is all lush, vibrant and filled with nature. The place is overgrown and has nice saturated colours. The Sounds all make sense and are satisfying where they need to be. From collectible-pick-up sounds to smashing-robot-faces-in-with-my-weapon.\nThe soundtrack is great, cueing in at the right moments, upping the emotion in certain scenes.\n\nControls:\n=======\n\nAlthough the keyboard and mouse controls are okay, I would definitely recommend using a gamepad for this game. It benefits the experience by quite a bit.\n\n\nOverall:\n======\n\nThis is a very rare, hidden gem that absolutely doesn't get the credit it deserves. Give it a try, the devs really deserve the money","December 27, 2014","true","20.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

(More in-depth review through the whole post)\n\npros:\n\n+Story - great story, great ending.\n+Gameplay - even tho it gets sturdy, and there aren't many combos you can do, it's still when time comes a fun aspect of the game\n+graphics\n\ncons:\n-voiceacting - was pretty bad, mediocre at best if you want it\n-explosion effects\n-camera - sometimes, it can really annoy you how when you're fighting a boss, it focuses and switches you from one place to the other\n\n\nIt starts of really fast, and you kinda bump into a story. There's no background, there's nothing until you progress a bit through the game. Even then, you will ask yourself few questions, like, how did I get here where I am, what actually happend, but, even those "loop-holes" that exist in the story are minority, and should be ignored. The game picks it up once you go past the first chapter, the combat evolves, and you feel more connection to the characters. For me personaly, the way it was produced, I didn't feel special bond between main character, nor the girl that was with you all the time.\n\nStory is something definitely memorable, and if nothing, you should check the game only for that.\n\nGameplay and graphics are something that are also mediocre I would say. Levels are linear, so there's nothing really to add up to it. Gameplay gets robust after a while, but what's interesting in this game is that there isn't that much of a combat as I thought it would be. There are few puzzles here and there, but that's pretty much it. Graphics are also for a game that came out in 2013 I would say pretty solid. Nothing spectacular, effects when popping up the mechs aren't fabulous, but that doesn't stop this game to excell at what it's best.","June 2, 2014","true","10.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Melee combat with a staff. Staff can stun and shoot plasma. The staff is the main weapon for your character to use. Other weapons can be pick up but with limited uses. Staff can be upgraded. Contain simple puzzle elements. Lots of climbing and jumping similar to Tomb Raider type games.\n\nMap design: Linear.\n\nHow Long To Beat It: Around 9 hours on normal\n\nDifficulties On Normal: Everybody able to beat it on normal without much problems.\n\nKids Rating: Swearing.\n\nBugs: Crashed once. I did not experienced ground breaking bugs but other players did on the Steam Community forums. Solution to these bugs can be found on the same forum.\n\nGame Control: Standard. I used a 360 Xbox controller on my PC to play the game.\n\nSave System: Check Point System only. The check point system is good enough to keep frustration to a minimum.\n\nOption Menu: Very limited on video and audio. To get better graphics you need to edit the config file manually.\n\nRecommend Buying Price: $7.50 or lower for general public. $15 or lower for players that like Tomb Raider style games..\n\n---\nEnslaved is a Tomb Raider (pre 2013) style game. Enslave takes a lot of frustration out of the old Tomb Raider games. It is rare to miss a jump. No ultra hard jump. No ultra hard timing jump. No expert type puzzle. Better check points system.\n\nFrom a scale of 10, 1 being the easiest. Enslaved puzzle rank around 3. That means 5 years old kids can solve it. Pre 2013 Tomb Raider puzzles are rank up to 8 (expert level). So Enslaves puzzles elements are tone down a lot.\n\nJumping and climbing are a lot easier than Pre 2013 Tomb Raider. It is rare you will miss a jump or climb. There are no ultra hard jumps to preform like in the old Tomb Raider games. The climbing and jumping animations are fluid.\n\nVoice acting is decent. Passable.\n\nOverall this is a good game for people that love Tomb Raider style games but hate the high frustration that comes with it. Unlike the old Tomb Raider games, everyone should beat Enslaved on normal.","March 29, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not only is The Last of Us built around a burgeoning relationship between two characters who are with each other throughout their journey, like Enslaved, but The Last of Us also boasts a well-realised art style similar to Enslaved's in that it emphasises light, ruin and lush vegetation. Though also like Enslaved, The Last of Us is somewhat let down by the actual nitty-gritty of its gameplay. While Enslaved's platforming is competent, straightforward and fast, its combat very quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating - it really doesn't seem designed to cope with groups, and believe me, there are a lot of group combat scenarios. It's still absolutely worth playing, though, and while its story doesn't push the envelope in quite the same way as the story in The Last of Us, it's still an enjoyable journey with genuinely interesting characters through a stunning gameworld.

The two have an interesting relationship with one another, and the cutscenes/in-game sequences make playing through Enslaved worthwhile alone.\n\nThe graphics looks great, I played everything on maxed out quality at 1080p without a hitch.

Gameplay mechanics, while function spledidly, can become somewhat repititious, especially during combat.

The characters are awesome and the animation and voice acting are a very big deal. I was way into the story. I would've watched a CGI movie with the story and characters in this game, and sometimes I wish that had been an option, because the game itself sort of suffers.\n\nThe game itself suffers in three ways. First, the !@#@!%! camera has a mind of its own, and sometimes it moves around at the oddest times. Moving around is sometimes trial and error, because sometimes "up" is "left" or "right" is "up". Secondly, there are occassional scenes where you have to catch Trip being carried away by something. These scenes work almost like quick-time events and you have to die until you know which way to bob and weave. Third, the way you increase your abilities has NOTHING to do with the awesome story at all. You just wander around gathering glowing orbs. You need these, so Trip may say "hurry!" and you have to decide not to. You gather orbs no matter what she says, because you need them to buy things FROM HER, but you never mention these orbs and neither does she. This is an immersion breaker.\n\nAll the frustrating lack of elegance in the game play, though, did not keep me from loving the story and the characters. The game was just the right length in that regard, or the frustrating game play might have become old.\n\nNow.... let me say, however, that the grand finale boss fight was absolutely great fun.\n\nI'm sad that there wasn't a sequel, because Trip and Monkey have become friends of mine.

This is at no time really explained, but signs in the environment and off handed bits of conversation suggest that there was a war involving mechs, and we lost.  You play as Monkey, a lone wolf who grew up alone in the wilds of the post-apocalypse.  After being captured by a group of slavers, Monkey is freed in the midst of another prisoner's escape.  After crashing to the ground, Monkey finds himself enslaved - a young woman named Trip (I really hated her for most of the game) has bound Monkey to her will using a control headband, demanding that he help her find her way home.  Monkey's fate is bound to Trip's survival, if she dies, he dies bottom line.\n\nEnslaved is a magnificent looking game, for the most part.  Set in the post-apocalyptic world moving past the end of humanity.  Its character design is also robust and distinctive, some people complained about the character design, it was overly bright, to flashy and so on.  Personally, I enjoyed the Chinese fable/Road Warrior gear and the animalistic mechs that featured prominently through out the game, and Enslaved manage to present destroyed but recognizable landmarks giving a sense of the magnitude of the destruction at hand.\n\nSurprisingly, the relationship between Monkey and Trip does develop midway through the game (I still hated her).  It begins as a deviant take on cooperation as Trip rigs Monkey's headband for command and control, linking her fate to his.  Over time the story allows them to build a relationship that cleverly avoids the easy clichés the setup would typically stumble into, instead allowing something believable and even moving at times.  While the voice acting in Enslaved is excellent, this has just as much to do with some of the best facial animation in a game this generation.  Characters emote convincingly, and allow Enslaved to explore their discovery, loss, and revelation effectively as a result - when you see someone cry, it's not presented by a shiny drop running down their face, it's shown in the way their whole face falls and turns.\n\nAs a reviewer, it’s sometimes hard to assign a number to an experience, and Enslaved presents that challenge. It has flaws for certain, from dodgy controls and limited combat, to a conclusion that feels less like an ending and more like the story just ends, it still manages to hold together.  As a trip through an interesting, beautiful world covering ground that hasn’t been effectively tread in games, with a strong narrative and engaging, believable characters, it provides something unique.  If you can look past its flaws, Enslaved might surprise you as much as it did me.\n","December 29, 2013","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like a game with a brilliantly crafted story (a la Mass Effect, To The Moon etc.) you will love this.\n\nSo, the strongest aspects of Enslaved are the story and acting. Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw do a fantastic job making their characters believable and interesting. The "screenplay" by Andy Garland is excellent and I thought it ended in a very original and interesting fashion. The motion capture is done very well so facial expression really come through to convey emotion. Truly first class work.\n\nThe graphics and ambience are utterly superb too and I loved just spending time looking around at the amazing world Ninja Theory created. I had been playing this concurrently with Dark Souls 2 and it was such a delight to escape into this colourful world having been stuck in the rather miserable (though attractive in its own way) world of Hidetaka Miyazaki.\n\nThe only niggles I have with Enslaved are the camera, which behaves in a wild and frustrating fashion, and the combat which, whilst fun to begin with, becomes somewhat repetitive by the end. Luckily the story was so good that I was more than happy to carry on through even if the gameplay was not quite to my tastes.\n\nI would really love to see this story continue following the intriguing ending but I understand sales were not great. That is a  real shame because It is massively evident this game was made with a lot of love, attention and professionalism, and excels in areas most games are incredibly weak.\n\nA really good experience!","January 19","true","21.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's no challenge, you can't even fall off edges from bad timing, you just push 1 button and the game does the rest. The puzzles are so monotonous and pointless it feels like it's almost a middle school programming project. There's times you have to throw your partner "Trip" up to a handle or something for her to climb to get around. You're always told to find another way, a harder way to push the "platforming". You could, more easily, just go the route Trip takes but that would mean less jumping around like a monkey. It's POORLY implemented.\n- All the graphic options have to be set through an .ini file.

A Colorful Post-Apocalyptic Hack & Slash.Genre: 3rd Person Hack-and-Slash Adventure.\nDeveloped & Published by: Ninja Theory & Bandai Namco\nPlatform: Windows, Xbox 360, Playstation 3.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Preamble\nThe game was sold to me as the Journey to the West story set in the distant future with Andy Serkis voicing a grumpy main protagonist, Monkey. I can't say no to that! If we continue to get these console-based ports over on PC with all released DLC set for a lower price, I’ll stay happy. This is the second game I’ve personally played with that business model and I can’t complain. (Metal Gear Rising being the other).\n\nOverall Story & Gameplay Thoughts\nThe story is great, its well written and well paced, keeping the humor and/or seriousness of the situation at the right level the entire time. There’s plenty of emotional moments between the two main protagonists of Monkey and Tripp as they experience the hardships of the journey. The connection doesn’t feel forced, contrived or stupid. For the most part, it doesn't seem romantically driven either. A refreshing change of pace. Though there are plenty of hints that there’s a deep connection between the two. While Monkey gives off the impression of being a survivor, he still has good humor moments. Tripp is a great character as well both in-game and from the story aspect. She never feels like a hinderance or nuisance….well...when she doesn’t fall through the floor or get stuck on ladders. That happened to me a couple of times when playing the game. But when she isn’t getting bugged up, she’s a compelling character to learn about.\n\nMost of the challenge or antagonism comes come from the environment and machines that were designed for one purpose: to kill humans. The robots have no dialogue and little personality outside of their physical traits. On a quick side note, I wonder what these robots would do if they did succeed in their mission of killing all humans. Would they just self-destruct out of sheer boredom? Or take up knitting as a hobby? I guess we’ll probably never find out, will we. The game features two distinct gameplay areas, one involving combat and other puzzle solving with lots of “easy” platforming interspersed between and throughout the game. Given that the platforming is really hard to fail, I found that I didn't like it all that much. It’s easy though and it does add depth to each area you explore and helps pace the game out so I’ll let it slide. Even if exploration only rewards you with currency to a fairly shallow upgrade system. Keep in mind that while I sound harsh on these points, it’s only because other games have done it better. It’s not bad, it’s just nothing new.\n\nCombat Gameplay\n3rd Person combat that focuses on combos and blocking shots with a few special abilities. Combat is nice and responsive with plenty of weight to each attack and reaction. Dodging is a bit funky to make work especially when you can just use your shield instead to block the shots you need to. You do see a decent number of enemies in the game but the combat ultimately lacks in variety when it’s summed up to: spam the attack button till they blow up. There’s a “dog” boss mid way through the game that is built up as this big bad robot but when the actual fight breaks out? All you do is stun it repeatedly and spam your attacks, repeatedly, until it dies. It’s rather anti-climactic. The challenge usually comes in the form of groups of robots where some will try and stun or knock you back. Still, the combat is decent enough to keep from getting stale (if only barely) throughout the four hour campaign.\n\nBusiness Model & DLC\nI got six hours out of the game, four hours for the main campaign and two out of the included DLC short story. I think that’s just the right amount of content for the asking price. Any longer and the combat or platforming would have gotten stale or dull. Oh, right, I almost forgot to talk about the DLC. A surprising side mission where you control Pigsy, a character you meet in the main campaign, on a journey to find the perfect companion. As his physique is not designed for close up and personal combat, he can’t brawl it out with the robots. Instead, you have to use stealth, a sniper/assault rifle and tricks to get around the obstacles. It adds a different flavor to the game while showing you an enjoyable little side story. It’s a good thing it ends at two hours because the end level starts turning into a twitchy shooter arena which I didn’t find as enjoyable. What I did find more than a little heartwarming was Pigsy’s journey of self-discovery about his actual perfect companion. Kudos to the devs on this one as I enjoyed it quite a bit even after the four hours in the main campaign. It didn’t feel tacked on at all.\n\nPC Settings & Port Report\nPC Port wise, it’s not bad but its not the greatest port from the console. Optimization seems to be decent though I did experience framerate drops at times. The textures are starting to show their age. Additionally, I noticed that the character’s mouth doesn’t always stay synced with the voice acting. If you’re having performance problems and/or shadows are broken, you can go to this wiki article[pcgamingwiki.com] and input the fixes in the Enhancements section. One other irritation I should point out is the camera. The darn thing likes to fight you in the middle of a fight to show you what it thinks you want to see, usually Monkey smashing a machine into tiny pieces. It’s not game breaking but it can be annoying at times. Also, using a controller is highly recommended as the Keyboard + Mouse controls feel like an afterthought. A common problem with console-ported hack and slashes it would seem.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI recommend you pick this up if you’re looking for an overlooked, well crafted 3rd person hack and slash. It’s Sun Wukong in a post-apocalyptic, yet surprisingly colorful & beautiful world fighting robots. While the combat is a bit limited, the journey and characters more than make up for it. I enjoyed the characters, their interactions and the story overall.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","January 23, 2015","true","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes, the gameplay is linear.  Yes, it's a pretty straight console port where they didn't even bother to change the word 'console' to PC.  Yes, the controls are annoying and the camera angles are irritating.\n\nBut...  this game is FUN.  The storyline is interesting enough, but the game really shines through its two main characters--the hulking Monkey and the tech-clever Trip and their journey from a slaver ship to freedom.  The way the characters change and their relationship is charmingly set out, and even though other games have done this sort of pairing better (e.g. Last of Us), it's still a great experience.\n\nThe combat and action sequences are straight out of a big-budget action flick and the best console platforming.  The combat isn't too difficult (if I can get through it, anyone can!) and neither are the platforming puzzles, but there's a joy to this game which is rarely found in gaming these days.  It's just plain, outright fun.  Even the 'filler' missions never get boring, and it's very well paced.\n\nThe graphics are dated, but I think they really push the capabilities of Unreal Engine 3 to deliver a satisfying experience.  This is a post-apocalytpic world, but unlike the grey-brown ruins that most games delivery, this world is gorgeous.  The ruins of the old cities are hauntingly recognisable, but nature is slowly taking them back--this game is simply gorgeous and uses its backdrops and lighting to the best effect.  Even the metal monstrosities that litter its landscapes are interesting and intriguing to look at.\n\nAnd as for the grand finale...  one of the most awesome and explosive action-packed climaxes ever.  It's slightly predictable, but worth playing through--and the ending is quite well done.\n\n10/10 would rip off a mech's arms backwards and shoot it with its own gun again.","December 22, 2015","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The novel is an extended account of a Buddhist Monk named Xuanzang (also known as Tripitaka), as he journeys to the west, fraught with danger and trials - travelling with the protection of three sinners seeking atonement. These three protectors (Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing), each make an appearance in the video game, in one form or another. Enslaved is a creative take on the subject, so expect many unique and interesting variations on the story.\n\nEnslaved: Odyssey to the West's main draw is it's absolutely gorgeous visuals, which are bright, detailed and compelling for such a sombre post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The soundtrack is an ambient masterpiece, full of wistful tones and quirky beats. It meshes into the stories journey almost seamlessly, which really attributes to the games total atmospheric effect. Ambient sound effects bring life (or the sense of abandonment), to the game as well - from birds chirping in the distance, to the sound of the wind rushing through the foliage. The motion capture techniques used are excellent, especially the facial animations. Characters show genuine emotion (and thanks to the absolutely fantastic actor performances), manage to sound genuine as well! Andy Serkis and Lindsey Marie Shaw deserve much praise for their performances!\n\nWith that being said, the mechanics of the game are a fair step down in quality. Gameplay IS entertaining, but lacking in anything new. Combat is enjoyable, although there are not many variations on how to tackle an enemy. Stun shots, power swings, light hits and heavy hits. Shields, wide attacks, counters, etc. It's generic, but secondary in regards to the visuals and story. Platforming in the game is efficient and fast. You essentially spam jump + direction to get to your destination. You can't jump in the wrong direction, nor can you actually fall... so don't expect a platforming experience similiar to Uncharted or Tomb Raider. You don't have to watch where you're going or what you're pressing. The greatest issue as far as I'm concerned, unfortunately, is the poor use of the camera system (especially for the PC). When in combat, or while running around, the camera tends to zoom into a wall here, a ledge there, or a piece of sky over yonder! This game is NOT optimized for keyboard and mouse. Neither are the graphical settings. In order to change any of the settings, you would need to access the actual files for the game to represent any changes in graphics and controls. Nothing can be changed ingame.\n\nNow, while this title has it's fair share of flaws (from it's gameplay mechanics to it being an abysmal port), it still boasts stunning visuals, a fantastic soundtrack, and an excellent story with memorable characters and scenes. I would recommend this game to any fan of the genre, as it's worth the money and the time spent!\n\n","August 20, 2014","true","12.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters are awesome and the animation and voice acting are a very big deal. I was way into the story. I would've watched a CGI movie with the story and characters in this game, and sometimes I wish that had been an option, because the game itself sort of suffers.\n\nThe game itself suffers in three ways. First, the !@#@!%! camera has a mind of its own, and sometimes it moves around at the oddest times. Moving around is sometimes trial and error, because sometimes "up" is "left" or "right" is "up". Secondly, there are occassional scenes where you have to catch Trip being carried away by something. These scenes work almost like quick-time events and you have to die until you know which way to bob and weave. Third, the way you increase your abilities has NOTHING to do with the awesome story at all. You just wander around gathering glowing orbs. You need these, so Trip may say "hurry!" and you have to decide not to. You gather orbs no matter what she says, because you need them to buy things FROM HER, but you never mention these orbs and neither does she. This is an immersion breaker.\n\nAll the frustrating lack of elegance in the game play, though, did not keep me from loving the story and the characters. The game was just the right length in that regard, or the frustrating game play might have become old.\n\nNow.... let me say, however, that the grand finale boss fight was absolutely great fun.\n\nI'm sad that there wasn't a sequel, because Trip and Monkey have become friends of mine.

The gameplay wasn't revolutionary and the level design was very linear (not that that is necessarily bad). The game was pretty easy. There were only a handfull of places I had any difficulty with at all. The game was entertaining for the length of the game, which was around 11 hours with the DLC. The DLC did a nice job of giving more of the game, but changing things around so familiar enemies need to be handled with a whole new set of tools and strategies. It's kind of like playing an interactive summer blockbuster. It's completely forgettable, but its fun while it lasts. The game does look terrific. This is a console port of a game already a few years old, but there is some real eye candy in this game. Very impressive on the visuals front even though there are some really disgusting textures mixed in every now and then. As far as the story goes, it's all really boiler plate stuff, but perhaps there is a deeper message than is on the surface (maybe not).

Please keep in mind that it first came out for consoles in 2010, and I am now reviewing the game in early 2016. Enslaved is an emotional and exciting experience, but is not without its fair share of faults. In this review I'll go over Enslaved's presentation, mechanics, characters, and some final thoughts.\n\nPresentation I have a really hard time conveying how I feel about Enslaved's presentation. The textures are god awful, but the lighting is strikingly beautiful. Some animations make me want to vomit, while others are fluid and very entertaining. The only part of Enslaved's presentation that seems to be balanced is its soundtrack, which manages to be nothing more than decent. All in all Enslaved suffers from one overarching problem, which was the way in which it was ported. The performance is great and most people's hardware should be able to run it, so that's not my complaint. The issue is that it feels utterly like a console game fitted poorly onto the PC platform. It did not evolve at all when jumping to PC, all of its console limitations came with it. Ninja Theory/whoever they hired to port Enslaved essentially just made it run on windows and work (somewhat) with mouse and keyboard. That's it. If you want a direct verdict on Enslaved's presentation, I'd say it's just passable, as long as you keep in mind you are playing a 6 year old game.\n\nMechanics/Gameplay Enslaved is absolutely a mechanically driven game. Much like the presentation, the mechanics, and thus the gameplay, is a bit dodgy. To start off with the most egregious offense of the mechanics, it'd by far be the camera. It's just horrible. It will switch back between two points of focus without you wanting it to, push in far too close or pull out too far away, and simply never seems to be where anyone in their right mind when playing this game would want it to be. In contrast of this, the combat and its progression throughout Enslaved's run time is just straight up enjoyable. When fighting enemies you'll have an abundant array of attacks that makes combat exciting and suspenseful, which is good because that is what you spend most of your time in this game doing; beating up on your adversaries. However, the combat does have a downfall, which is that some of the special moves you can choose to purchase don't seem to be perform-able without a controller of some sort. The final thing to mention about the gameplay and mechanics is the platforming. This is sadly another aspect of Enslaved that goes into the disappointing bin. The platforming is very jerky, and even worse, entirely linear. Its only saving grace is that most of the entertaining animations I mentioned in the presentation section do happen while platforming around. Enslaved very obviously hoped to be a mechanical marvel with tense gameplay, but it stumbled and fell short. Just like Trip does actually, but without Monkey to get her on her feet. Wait, who are they? Well, meet the-\n\nCharacters This may seem like a bit of an odd part of any game to write a section for, as story would tend to be a more appropriate aspect of a game to focus on. Surprisingly though, it's the masterfully written characters that turn Enslaved's narrative into a device to progress their own development and personal appeal. The ONLY three characters in this game are Monkey (you), Tripitaka (I.E. Trip, a teenage girl with mad tech skills), and Pigsy. Pigsy. Pigsy is the best character in Enslaved, and that's all you need to know about him. The characters are the one thing in this game that I have no real criticism of, other than some of Monkey's choices (which you do not control) that don't always reflect his personality, and only seem to be there to unsuccessfully extend a certain narrative driven mechanic. I can't really say much more without spoiling parts of the game, so I'll leave off with this statement. When I finished Enslaved, I didn't miss the gameplay, the design, the story, or any other aspect- other than the wonderful, truly lovable- characters.\n\nFinal Thoughts Enslaved is a 7-8 hour adventure that most gamers are likely to enjoy. If you want it, I'd advise getting Enslaved on sale, as it frequently does so at a $5 price tag. Summing up Enslaved in one sentence, I would say this; Enslaved is a compelling gaming experience plagued by many non-game-breaking flaws. That's why I'm recommending Enslaved, and can do so without much doubt in that choice.\n\nPersonal Rating: 7.5/10\nP.S. While this review does not include any form of criticism of it, this version of Enslaved comes with the 2-3 hour DLC "Pigsy's Perfect Ten." I'd personally extend this piece of DLC the same score I gave the main game, a 7.5/10. You might want to check it out if you enjoyed Pigsy's character.","February 27","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Very detailed background and level designs, fascinating post apocalyptic feeling. Despite being good, though, graphic settings are just few. If you're that hardcore, then enjoy the lack of AA settings for the start. Not only that, you can only set up but few only - Gamma, Quality, Blur, Motion Blur and Vsync. If you have higher res monitor, then you're out of luck... natively. There's a way to set up manually, check here: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Enslaved:_Odyssey_to_the_West\n\nGameplay is similar to DmC Devil May Cry, just less chaotic. Enemies are but few in one battle, you just have to beat them using limited combo and blocking/evading.\n\nStory wise, you will be forced to escort your annoying girl named Trip. She'll tie you down with that headband and forces you to help her. Though, despite being annoying, you can use her helping hands to distract enemies temporarily or to heal you. Some missions require you to explicitly protect her from harm or you'll die if she dies and the story will revolve around that.\n\nOh did I mention the game's very linear? Not open world in the slightest? Overall, no revolutionary mechanic for gameplay and/or story, far below Batman Arkham series or DmC Devil May Cry.\n\nThen there's RPG element. If you gather enough exp, you can upgrade your abilities. Don't expect complex skill trees, but at last there's an alternative for your build and playstyle.\n\nFor playing the game controller's super recommended. Unfortunately Unreal Engine is garbage at picking up older controllers, so most likely you'll see your buttons reversed if it's Dinput. Xinput is doing fine, though. MK/B is... err.. forget it. Just play with controller.\n\nNow here's the catch, progression blockers are everywhere. If you're caught in it, restart your game and try from last checkpoints. Game is saved automatically periodically so you won't lose much progress, it's just the blockers are beyond annoying if it's not solved as fast as possible after restart.\n\nOverall, great game to play, but not worth full price due to rater shallow gameplay mechanic, bugs ridden game and rather poor port. At this moment of writing, it's 75% off and I can fully recommend you at that price.\n\n8/10","December 27, 2014","true","50.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The combat mechanics and the way you can give fun commands to your partner like to use a decoy while you run behind and destroy guards, is all a lot of fun and done well. The only downside is that your main characters are pretty cliche: the main guy acts like a big ret@rded shirtless ape and the other is a hot girl who is inexplicably a master hacker. Like I just so happened to find a really hot girl who is a master computer whiz lol. Even so, I can tell that I am going to have fun with the whole game for sure, I just wish I had known about this game when it first came out a year ago. 8/10","October 15, 2014","true","2.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Playing it (or actually making it work) is a whole different story...\n\nAfter a strong first Act, the story never really picks up and apart from Trip (The sexy tech-savvy redhead) there aren't really that many interesting characters. The Shallow gameplay (combat and plataforming) also make this an extremely repetitive game. Since this is a terrible port you'll also deal with some pretty nasty graphical glitches and a considerable amount of game breaking bugs. And please, don't even think about Alt+Tabbing while playing this. Yeah, it's THAT bad...\n\nThe Add-on content is not that interesting either:\nSome extra skins for Monkey and Trip that you can only use on a New Game +, but since there's really no incentive for you to ever replay this game it's kind of pointless.\nThere's also a side story that gives some much needed depth to one of the secondary characters. Unfortunately the game changes from a simplistic hack and slash to a Heavily scripted 3rd person stealth game.

For some, it likely isn't worth the headache to suffer through the random frame drops, freezing,  and general annoyances after cutscenes. Would only recommend to the patient; otherwise, skip it and play something else, or get it on console.

There are dozens of threads dedicated to working your way through the game's terrible optimization and getting it to be somewhere within the realms of 'playable'.  Furthermore, any review that does not warn of possible issues one might have when attempting to play the game in question, does not quite fit the definition of a review.

The vibrant post-apocalyptic setting serves as the backdrop for an entertaining narrative that is driven by quality dialogue and voice acting. The game also features some really nice facial animation technology which helps capture emotions and bring even more life and believability to the characters. As for the gameplay side of things, combat is a bit simple but the speed, fluidity and flair of it makes it very satisfying nonetheless. It feels Darksiders-esque and I found it improved over time as upgrades and new moves were unlocked to add a little more depth. I enjoyed the hoverboard-style segments that were scattered about to mix things up from time to time, and the boss fights were fun as well (the final boss in particular was a blast).\n\nOn the downside, while the combat is mostly enjoyable, the gameplay as a whole has a tendency to become repetitive. There's a distinct lack of enemy variety and the platforming was a bit too automatic for my liking (a poor man's Prince of Persia, so to speak). The camera work is inconsistent during platforming sections which leads to the occasional uncomfortable camera angle, while the movement controls felt a little too touchy and over-sensitive. I also wasn't very fond of the unskippable cutscenes when replaying through specific sections, although thankfully they aren't all that long or numerous to begin with.\n\nAs for the quality of the port, it's well-optmized and should run fine on even below average hardware while looking sharp and maintaining a high FPS. Unfortuantely, settings like AA and AF aren't adjustable in-game and are instead tucked away in a config file.\n\nOverall, I found Enslaved: Odyssey to the West to be a flawed yet captivating and stylish platformer/brawler where the whole is better than the sum of its parts. Definitely worth playing.","February 17, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The action is satisfying, and the puzzles aren't too annoying. I think a big reason of that is because they don't over punish you for doing it wrong. You get more of a nudge, try it this way, then a well you screwed up go through the whole thing again (which does happen, just not that often.) Realisticly the game is 6 - 8 hours for a playthrough, and it just feels right at that length.\n\nWhat I'd say about the action is that it's satisfying and well balanced. You don't fight so many mechs that you need a break to beat them, and there's little to no omg wtf killed me. All I can say is focus on leveling up your combat skills first, youl'll have a harder time without them mid - late game. This game really reminds me of Beyond Good and Evil, (one of my favorite Gamecube games, which is on steam now.)\n\nIt's nice to see a lush, plants overgrowing structures post-apocalyptic game. Rather than the brown and rust a lot of games go with. The art really nailed it and will hold up well over time. The game is rather linear, but it works just fine. The point is the story, and it builds it up nicely.\n\nAs for the controls, don't bother trying to use a keyboard or mouse, plug a controller in and play it the way it's meant to be played. Some games are just better like that, and this is one of them.\n\n\nTL:DR 8.5/10 would stockholm syndrome again,\nwell worth the price.","October 11, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Either make it so a player is free to jump where and when they want, sometimes leading to failure, but giving the feeling that you're not completely holding the player's hand (most recent example I've played was Alice, but there are many games). The other way is to make it so the player can't jump unless he is on the edge of a rock which is coded to allow jumping (like Zelda games). The latter is fine, unless it's poorly done, and there are several times in the game where getting around becomes an akward dance of psuedo-stutter jumping around different walls to try and find your way around some of the more complicated maps. There was really only 4 or 5 times in an 8 hour playthrough that I got really frustrated with it.\n\nLater in the game there is a cloud system (think hover disk) that changes to the other style, and I personally like it a lot more.\n\nThe story is amazing, though. You kinda get the idea of where it's going to go pretty early, but Pigsy brings in some unexpected humor and the ending was very unexpected.

You get all (or at least most... I never downloaded the DLC for the XBOX 360 copy I sold) of the costumes and the Pigsy DLC with it.\n\nIt will run well, after a few changes to the BaseEngine file. This is completely understandable as the game was never made for PC, and they can't fix everything. Most of the time they just port the game, fix game breaking bugs (and whatever other major ones remain), and release it. Editing the BaseEngine file (See the discussion topics on what to change, like MotionBlur=False) will make this game run quite smoothly. The only noticeable issue I still see is with the cutscenes, but it is understandable. It is not going to run perfect, and I don't care about that. I beat it on xbox, and I'm finally buying a copy on steam because it is $5. That is a great deal. This game is still worth the full $20 (especially if you have a newer gaming pc).\n\nThe story, the characters, and everything are still as I remember and still awesome.\n\nI am still always hoping for another game like this from the game company, or a prequel/sequel... either or. :)","June 19, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw a friend start playing it and I felt the need to ask how was the game. The response was that it's a great game. But, I needed to try it for myself.\nLet me tell you, this is a beautiful and rather charming adaptation of the chinese novel "Journey to the west".\nIt's a wonderful story in a post-apocalyptic world where humans are scarce and hidden, while the robots hunts them by the dozen. One of the strongest points of this game is the voice acting. Andy Serkis, Lindsey Shaw and Richard Ridings, all excelled at their jobs. They played strong, interesting characters with whom you can feel attached to.\nThe Premium Edition includes some outfits DLC for Monkey and Trip and Pigsy's Perfect 10 campaign, which is another story that does not include Monkey and Trip, but instead, you get to play as Pigsy in his quest to build the perfect friend, always with his sidekick, the adorable Truffles.\nThe gameplay is a good old beat 'em up with a mix of Prince of Persia. It's solid an very entertaining, indeed.\nThe graphics are fine, considering that it's a port of a game that came out for consoles in 2010. But, I must highlight the beauty of the different places where you get to visit. The desolated places are absolutely gorgeous (Just like Trip's smile).\nI could buy this game on sale at, I think, 5 bucks. But, even at 50% discount is a pretty good deal.\nWould I recommend this game? Hell, yes. I would give this game a solid 9 out of 10.

The story in engaging and the voice acting lends an incredible sense of immersion. At times, it hard to tell they aren't real people. Even the combat system, which borrows heavily from God of War, is well put together.\n\nWhere it really starts of come off the rails is the platforming elements. The game was developed first for consoles and clumsily ported to the PC. It doesn't play well without a controller since you frequently need to move or interact in a direction between the 8 cardinals. For time-sensitive parts, this causes no end of frustration as you'll be doing the right thing but not QUITE in the right direction and then plunge to your doom or get eaten. Even the instructions on how to use certain abilities reference controller buttons.\n\nWhen the game doesn't lock the camera to a fixed angle, the game is very playable with a mouse and keyboard. Even the bits it borrows from Prince of Persia and Uncharted are incrementally improved. Handholds are rarely difficult to find after a little searching, and paths through the game are usually fairly clear. Even the puzzles are the right mix of difficulty and rewards.\n\nOverall, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a solid game that could have used more love during the port.","June 28, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I must admit my research was minimal but I found that the homage is mainly the three main characters. Their personalities and visual design. The plot doesn't seem to be emulating the novel, other then being a journey in the western direction.\nThe visuals are where the game shines. The post=appocalitic world it depicts is beautifull even it it's utter devestation. Toppled buildings are sprinkled with lush greenery, invading the ruins of man's fallen empire. Billboards, while whetherd with age, still display their colorful messages brightly. And the animation of running, loping, jumping and swinging is just perfectly executed.\n\nThe plot is the standard post appocalyptic sci-fi. Monkey and Trip escape the clutches of a mysterious hostile empire, which uses the technology of the old world to conquer the new. There's a bit more under the surface, but not much.\nThe relationship between Monkey and Trip is relativly interesting. She controls him through a metal headband that compells him to obey her (the same technology used by the antagonists to enslave humanity), echoing the magical thightning crown of the Chinese epic. But slowly they develop genuine friendship and affection. Although there's a bit of a twist there as well.\n\nI liked the game. The gameplay and plot are solid even if they are not particularly inventive and the visual style is trully marvalous.","June 30, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For a game I've never heard of prior to its release on Steam, I've enjoyed my time with it more than most major titles I've purchased here.\n\nI'm unsure of how to phrase this without comparing to other well-known series, but as far as gameplay goes, the movement and combat feels a step up from Assassin's Creed(a game which obviously had a bit of influence on this)'s repetetive combat and oftimes cumbersome parkour aspect. Combat here feels fluid and unpredictable, but more importantly, makes you as the player, feel powerful.\n\nAs far as characters go, Monkey (that's you) and Trip (the redhead) are one hell of a dynamic duo with a great story pushing them forwards. Once again drawing comparisons to other popular games, Trip is Monkey's Elizabeth (ala Bioshock Infinite), with the added bonus that your life is almost literally tied to hers. Upon their meeting in the prologue, Trip enlists Monkey out of desperation using a headband that wires directly into his brain. Along the way, it has its bonuses such as providing him with a HeadsUp Display and forcing him to obey her commands under threat of death.Slowly, but surely the two bond in their journey to return her to her home. Their dynamic is only buffed by the spectacular voice acting for both characters and flawless animations bringing them to life. Elizabeth was a great companion, but if you want a friend you can really grow to care about in your games, play Enslaved.\n\nAlso, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous. Beautiful scenery and character design.\n\nI actually had more to write, but I'll play some more before getting to it.

He used an eastern story and changed it to western and futuristic narration. Yes its action is not that complicated, nor you can argue it’s not as long as some other campaign only games. But for its price it’s definitely worth its length and playability. Also on hardest selection of difficulty it can be a little challenging which I always look for in games. It’s the same extent as much as RPG as other games claim to be... (i get a choice of 9 places to put my skills, that i eventually fill half of). but I just like seeing Andy Serkis at work. And not that hard to get attached to. I'v personally beat it 2.5times on console.\n\ngameplay 7/10\nart          8/10\nstory     9/10\nmusic     6/10\nless then $20... yes worth it","October 7, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The action is satisfying, and the puzzles aren't too annoying. I think a big reason of that is because they don't over punish you for doing it wrong. You get more of a nudge, try it this way, then a well you screwed up go through the whole thing again (which does happen, just not that often.) Realisticly the game is 6 - 8 hours for a playthrough, and it just feels right at that length.\n\nWhat I'd say about the action is that it's satisfying and well balanced. You don't fight so many mechs that you need a break to beat them, and there's little to no omg wtf killed me. All I can say is focus on leveling up your combat skills first, youl'll have a harder time without them mid - late game. This game really reminds me of Beyond Good and Evil, (one of my favorite Gamecube games, which is on steam now.)\n\nIt's nice to see a lush, plants overgrowing structures post-apocalyptic game. Rather than the brown and rust a lot of games go with. The art really nailed it and will hold up well over time. The game is rather linear, but it works just fine. The point is the story, and it builds it up nicely.\n\nAs for the controls, don't bother trying to use a keyboard or mouse, plug a controller in and play it the way it's meant to be played. Some games are just better like that, and this is one of them.\n\n\nTL:DR 8.5/10 would stockholm syndrome again,\nwell worth the price.","October 11, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Either make it so a player is free to jump where and when they want, sometimes leading to failure, but giving the feeling that you're not completely holding the player's hand (most recent example I've played was Alice, but there are many games). The other way is to make it so the player can't jump unless he is on the edge of a rock which is coded to allow jumping (like Zelda games). The latter is fine, unless it's poorly done, and there are several times in the game where getting around becomes an akward dance of psuedo-stutter jumping around different walls to try and find your way around some of the more complicated maps. There was really only 4 or 5 times in an 8 hour playthrough that I got really frustrated with it.\n\nLater in the game there is a cloud system (think hover disk) that changes to the other style, and I personally like it a lot more.\n\nThe story is amazing, though. You kinda get the idea of where it's going to go pretty early, but Pigsy brings in some unexpected humor and the ending was very unexpected.

For me Enslaved: Odyssey to the West happens to be one of those games. This is one of the few games where my first girlfriend and I spent time playing/watching one another on this journey. She barely played many games and I can't even re-call what made her pick this one out. She wanted to watch me play it but I convinced her to play and I do the watching for once. We really bonded even more over this game as story began to lay itself out before us.\n\nAnywho now to the actual review. While the PC port had a few much needed tweaks in it's ini file to make the visuals look better and run at 60+FPS; The game still holds true to what I remember enjoying on it's console debut. That being said I was very surprised this cult classic made it's way to PC as it barely got any recognition on the console front years ago.\n\nOnce tweaked the game looks even more gorgeous than I remembered. The combat is still simplistic but it has enough variety to where you don't get too overly bored with it. There's also 4 skill trees to upgrade Monkey varying from, health, shields, blocking, combat moves, long range shooting moves and more. If you collect as much tech orbs as possible as you play the game upgrading becomes easy but you may miss a few along the way. The platforming is some of the best as it meshes well with enviroments but it doesn't have some of the fine-tuning of critically acclaimed platformers but it gets the job done.\n\nThe story however and the relationship between Trip and Monkey is where this game shines. The story is a re-imagining of the novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en. Unlike the original story that was set in a fantastical version of ancient China, the game is set 150 years in a future post-apocalyptic world following a global war, with only remnants of humanity left, along with the still active war machines left over from the conflict. We begin with Monkey being imprisioned on a Slaver ship as well as Trip. Trip soon escapes and Monkey follows after as she just sabotaged this Slaver ship. Both had similar goals get to the escape pods. Soon after a very ungraceful landing; Monkey wakes to find a Slave headband attached to his head and the girl Trip claiming she fit on to him. Monkey attempts to threaten Trip to remove or else to which she gives a command which causes him a great deal of pain unless he obeys the command she issued. She reveals that she had modified the headband to work with only her voice commands and that if she dies or her heart stops for whatever reason the headband would send out a lethal charge and kill Monkey. Realizing this puts some hesistation in Monkey's demeanor;  She demands Monkey to bring her back home to her village and there she will remove the headband and free him. With no options of being free from Trip; Monkey agrees reluctantly.  As the story flows Monkey and Trip begin to bond and start forming a endearing friendship as their feelings about one another change through the story. No longer will it feel like Monkey is just a disgruntled slave to Trip but a caring guardian. Trip also goes through some pretty interesting changes herself but I can't reveal what without spoiling anything.\n\nFrom there we are greeted with Enslaved's world which is a post-apocalyptic world based on our own. The game never directly tells us how the world ended up in such a poor state of ruins but the enviroments in fact do. Glimpses of a war, a revolution, remamnants of war-like mechs, and much more. As you play the game you can connect these pieces of what the world was like before this in the form of "glitches"/masks that are pretty well hidden. While optional these end up being rather important to a key part of the story but no spoilers on that will be in this review.\n\nEnslaved is definitely one of the few games that I hope many get to experience from last genration as it is a wonderful story that just about everyone should at least experience with one playthrough. Overall it takes about 8 hours to complete the main story, but they've also bundled the dlc in this edition under the extras section which I have yet to start. So what are you waiting for? Give this game a go and tell everyone just what you think of it.\n\nPigsy's Perfect Ten DLC Review: Coming Soon","May 25, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, without game mechanics, you've got to fall back on characters, locations, and story, which is another name for 'a movie'. That's what this game is: a movie interspersed here and there with the usual action-game features. There's a rail-shooter, there's cover mechanics, there's blessedly few quicktime events. There's a few puzzles and quite a bit of platforming, and a few races. The controls are good, but you might end up fighting the cinematic camera more than you'd like. There's also a frustrating lack of affordances in the world -- although wall-grabs are easy to identify, it is impossible to tell which ledge is the one you're supposed to jump off of.  Your character will spend a fair amount of time balking at obvious jumps.\nCombat, when it happens, will mostly devolve into button mashing. There's nothing too complex or new, here, and you won't become frustrated because you can't get the 16-button long sequence of button pushes to get the one move that works.\nInstead, this game is remarkably forgiving, and lets you play along with the story and with the characters. And that's where this otherwise standard game shines.\nAndy Sirkis voices and acts the main character with the unfortunate name. He lends his character a gravitas that sometimes seems missing from games. There's real character growth going on, here.  When you mix that with a world that is beautifully realized, it all pretty much works.  If you are a fan of the old LucasArts adventure games, like The Dig, but want a little more action to go with your story and characters... if you want some better visuals, then this might be the game for you.\n\nSaving happen at save-points, and while there are a few with terrible placement, they're generally pretty good. There's about 10 hours of play in here, but Piggy's add-on is worth another few hours of play and might actually be more fun than the main game.  I think I paid $20 for this, and I feel no regrets at that price, although I can't help thinking it would be a better weekend rental than a purchase.  Also, like most console ports, this is probably best played with an Xbox controller.","June 29, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story in engaging and the voice acting lends an incredible sense of immersion. At times, it hard to tell they aren't real people. Even the combat system, which borrows heavily from God of War, is well put together.\n\nWhere it really starts of come off the rails is the platforming elements. The game was developed first for consoles and clumsily ported to the PC. It doesn't play well without a controller since you frequently need to move or interact in a direction between the 8 cardinals. For time-sensitive parts, this causes no end of frustration as you'll be doing the right thing but not QUITE in the right direction and then plunge to your doom or get eaten. Even the instructions on how to use certain abilities reference controller buttons.\n\nWhen the game doesn't lock the camera to a fixed angle, the game is very playable with a mouse and keyboard. Even the bits it borrows from Prince of Persia and Uncharted are incrementally improved. Handholds are rarely difficult to find after a little searching, and paths through the game are usually fairly clear. Even the puzzles are the right mix of difficulty and rewards.\n\nOverall, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a solid game that could have used more love during the port.","June 28, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I must admit my research was minimal but I found that the homage is mainly the three main characters. Their personalities and visual design. The plot doesn't seem to be emulating the novel, other then being a journey in the western direction.\nThe visuals are where the game shines. The post=appocalitic world it depicts is beautifull even it it's utter devestation. Toppled buildings are sprinkled with lush greenery, invading the ruins of man's fallen empire. Billboards, while whetherd with age, still display their colorful messages brightly. And the animation of running, loping, jumping and swinging is just perfectly executed.\n\nThe plot is the standard post appocalyptic sci-fi. Monkey and Trip escape the clutches of a mysterious hostile empire, which uses the technology of the old world to conquer the new. There's a bit more under the surface, but not much.\nThe relationship between Monkey and Trip is relativly interesting. She controls him through a metal headband that compells him to obey her (the same technology used by the antagonists to enslave humanity), echoing the magical thightning crown of the Chinese epic. But slowly they develop genuine friendship and affection. Although there's a bit of a twist there as well.\n\nI liked the game. The gameplay and plot are solid even if they are not particularly inventive and the visual style is trully marvalous.","June 30, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For a game I've never heard of prior to its release on Steam, I've enjoyed my time with it more than most major titles I've purchased here.\n\nI'm unsure of how to phrase this without comparing to other well-known series, but as far as gameplay goes, the movement and combat feels a step up from Assassin's Creed(a game which obviously had a bit of influence on this)'s repetetive combat and oftimes cumbersome parkour aspect. Combat here feels fluid and unpredictable, but more importantly, makes you as the player, feel powerful.\n\nAs far as characters go, Monkey (that's you) and Trip (the redhead) are one hell of a dynamic duo with a great story pushing them forwards. Once again drawing comparisons to other popular games, Trip is Monkey's Elizabeth (ala Bioshock Infinite), with the added bonus that your life is almost literally tied to hers. Upon their meeting in the prologue, Trip enlists Monkey out of desperation using a headband that wires directly into his brain. Along the way, it has its bonuses such as providing him with a HeadsUp Display and forcing him to obey her commands under threat of death.Slowly, but surely the two bond in their journey to return her to her home. Their dynamic is only buffed by the spectacular voice acting for both characters and flawless animations bringing them to life. Elizabeth was a great companion, but if you want a friend you can really grow to care about in your games, play Enslaved.\n\nAlso, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous. Beautiful scenery and character design.\n\nI actually had more to write, but I'll play some more before getting to it.

I won't go into details about the post apocalyptic world our buffed (why can't i have a sixpack like Monkey's?) hero and beautiful (Trip is a vision) heroine inhabit.\n\nSuffice it to say, the storytelling is second-to-none, with some of the best facial capturing you'll see.

I loved the use of deep contrast colors with a focus on greens and reds.  The voice acting was above average.  The story was well paced and had appropriate highs and lows.  The controls were garbage; the main character moves like he has a dish washer strapped to his forehead.  There are a couple other obvious signs that this is a console port, including the Uncharted-esque prompted jump sequences.  The final boss and epilogue escalate a bit quickly as well, introducing several story driven aspects all at once.

I grew attached to the characters, the world, and was left with a memory of the experience and a bit of an open future to ponder on for the characters and the world they were in. The main things that shine through for me were the acting, characters, and storytelling elements, they are what I was looking for. The combat and traveling elements within the game were entertaining, watching Monkey climb around and do a great deal of acrobatic moves was cool, but if you are expecting the ability to miss a ledge or not make a jump based on your skill as a game player you should look elsewhere. Most of the action elements are there to help allow time for dialog between the two main characters, allow you to invest a bit of time and thought in them to grow attached to them in a sense, and as a way to get from point A to point B while drawing connections to the actual storyline. All of this adds up to an ending where you are attached to the main characters and are supposed to care about their story and survival. It doesn't seem to be getting a sequal due to low sales by the developers standpoint, but that doesn't matter because the story is complete in it's own rite.\n\nI played through the main story and will play through the Pigsy DLC, but may or may not come back to it to play through the story an additional time. I know I would enjoy it again, much like rereading a good book, but since there are other books on my shelf I will probably move on...who's to say though that I may not come back to it again one day, as I feel invested in the characters, and may want to relive the experience again.","September 24, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And all of your enemies are robots. DLC is integrated into the game (only the Premium Edition is on Steam), where you get to play as a side character. The DLC's gameplay is very different from the base game - it's a third person shooter where you get 2 throwable bombs (decoy and EMP stun) as well as 2 remotely-detonated bombs that you drop right next to you (an explosive and a blast that turns anything that it hits into a friendly for a while). Though the play time for the DLC is much shorter than the base game, I thought it was superior to the base game. The story tugged at my heart strings and the gameplay was a lot more varied. Unlike the main base game it didn't overstay it's welcome.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend playing this game with a controller. Using a mouse to navigate menus and changing keybinds is a pain. Certain special combo attacks are also really hard to do with a KB/M setup. I'm also pretty sure that the maximum resolution the game renders at is 720p and you're not going to get graphics that are better than the console version. This console port could use a little more work, fortunately it's very glitch free.\n\nThe girl, Trip, is absolutely beautiful and stunningly sexy.

Set 200 year from now Trip has been kidnapped by slavers and taken on a slave ship where she escapes and gets the unwilling  help of Monkey to find her way home.

One of those games I just purchased on a whim after hearing or reading good reviews, didn't know much about it, so when it came up in a steam sale, just grabbed it and let it sit in my backlog.\n\nNice, short and sweet. Supurb character development and a great story to go with it. I remember watching Monkey as a kid and it didn't click until the names of the characters started to ring a bell and did a bit of research on the story this game is based on.\n\nAnyways, graphically, pretty ok, considering the Unreal 3 engine is starting to look old. I had to tweak the .ini file to no ends to get this running above 20 fps on my decent pc. Problems with some ATI cards apparently, even though it runs games like Witcher 3 above 40fps on higher settings. Just beware, anything in the graphics options arent final, turning on some settings won't do the trick, you'll need to delve a bit deeper to get it running and looking nicer.\n\nSoundwise, meh, a lot of bangs and crashes which sound like people smacking trashcan lids together but I guess that's what beating up mechs is supposed to sound like. Music is actually half decent though.\n\nGameplay. Well, it's good, I mean it's not God of war or Darksiders, heck the combat is nowhere near the fun of the Batman games but it seems to work enough to keep you going through to the end. Use a controller! Though I found the keyboard mouse setup worked well enough for me, some of the button combinations when you upgrade your skills arent exactly clear.\n\nWhat keeps you going through this game? To see what's at the end. This game is all about story. I wouldn't put it on the level of Mass effect epic but it's good.\n\nI didn't play through the Pigsy's perfect 10 DLC, I got the gist of it from watching the Letsplay cutscenes.\n\nOne gripe. The other DLC, Monkey's ninja suit, classic monkey and Sexy trip robot, you can't use them until you complete the game....and you can't use one of monkeys appearances alongside trips sexy robot costume. Which, in my opinion look pretty darn good.\n\nOverall, get it on sale, even the current price tag is pretty good.","November 24, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You care about the two protagonists from the beginning, for no real reason outside of that they're good people in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation, and eventually they begin to care about each other, and it shows. While you play as the fighter, monkey, who protects the "damnsel in distress", trip, you most certainly gather that they are a team. They couldnt progress through their trials without each other, and that idea is developed well. Combat is fun, and just challenging enough in some places, but the forgiving checkpoint system makes toughing through even the hardest sections pretty easy. I will say, this game is almost 100% atmosphere and combat, as there is no real story to speak of. It starts as "I need to get from point A, to point B, and youre going to be the one to get me there", and doesnt develop past that single concept until maybe the last 30 minutes of the game. There are a few hints of intrigue here and there about what happened to make this interesting setting what it is, but just a few. There are literally 0 story developments besides the midway point where you get to the aforementioned "point B", and the veeeerry end after you beat the "final boss" (which is nothing more than a set piece with a few waves of basic enemies, and shooting what totals out to maybe 10 weak points). My biggest gripe with the story, is that they set it up for a sequel, which never happened. You dont leave a cliffhanger ending, when there was no story to be intrigued about until the cliffhanger itself. Overall, its a good enough game, with great atmosphere, protagonists who you really care about almost on an emotional level(the games strongest two points), fun, but repetitive combat and a solid score. The repitition and lack of combat depth and story hold back what could have easily been a classic action adventure title. I'd rate it a 6.5/10. Worth picking up on sale. Low replay value. Not enough challenge, enemy variety, combat depth or collectables to warrant playing again. Took me a month and a half to beat because it has 0 addictive qualities. Can be finished in a day if focused.","December 9, 2015","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/245280/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is the 2010 action-adventure game developed by Ninja Theory (noted for Heavenly Sword and infamous for DmC: Devil May Cry) and published by Namco Bandai, recently re-released for the PC with all the DLC included.\n\nImportant to note: use a gamepad. Most are compatible with PC and easy to set up, it's a worthwhile investment, especially for games like these.\n\nThe majority of the time spent ingame is on a functional if barebones hack n slash combat system and "Uncharted-like" platforming system.\n\nCombat itself is very responsive - the counter will always work, the evade has a nice amount of i-frames, and you never feel like you're working against the game, just with it. It is, predictably, marred heavily by its sheer lack of variation - you will be working with the same moves from beginning to end, bar a few bought "enhancements" that won't affect your actual combos, and enemy variation caps out at 4 with three minibosses.\n\nCombined with the platforming that's completely braindead and nigh automated, and while the game never gets boring it's never in danger of challenging you or demanding anything resembling skill, even starting on Hard. The upgrade system ingame exacerbates this, simply making an already easy affair easier.\n\nDespite the odd novelty shooting segment or "Cloud" platforming section, where you impersonate Tony Hawk in a post-apocalyptic setting (the most fun sections of the game), and the aforementioned minibosses, the game never has any "real" boss battles or sense of climactic moments. The game eventually blends into a continuous slurry, pacing-wise.\n\nA gorgeous slurry at that. Every single environment in Enslaved is eye-candy, with even the more robotic-leaning levels managing to impress and becoming absolutely stunning during the Village levels. Animations are fluid and the camera supports it, with the game taking advantage of its limits. While the story goes from interesting to dull to absolutely stupid, the voice-acting throughout all of it is top-notch.\n\nWorth mentioning is that the included DLC, "Pigsy's Perfect 10", is more than just weirdly good: it's almost as fun as the base game, a 3-hour or so romp playing as "Pigsy" with four gadgets, an unlimited amount of bullets, and more stealth-oriented gameplay. You can access it in "Extras", which is a bit out-of-the-way.\n\nUnfortunately the OST - outside of the DLC's banjo-infested romps which never fail to get old - is boring orchestrated filler and completely forgettable, with a lot of seeming SFX issues on top of it; actions triggering with no sound attached. The game as a whole is almost hilariously glitchy - nothing game-breaking, but I've had to restart at Checkpoints several times with Trip falling through the game world or Monkey doing the monkey dance midair. Forever.\n\nEnslaved, at its best, plays like the likes of "Jak and Daxter" with fast-paced combat and platforming, and at its worst, plays like a dry, dull AAA affair with railroaded platforming, forced cover-based shooting segments and blatant technological problems. Ultimately, it's worth playing and then some, but not without keeping the caveats in mind.\n\nIt's not a game you should be buying for the mechanics, but to look at idly while you skim through it once then forget about it. It doesn't have the depth or the variety to support multiple playthroughs and ultimately ends up a bit of a chore (take it from me). Absolutely no incentive to 100% it either, not so much as a congratulations message. Still a bit sore about that.\n\nKeep it in mind when you see it in a sale, is what Enslaved: Odyssey to the West deserves. It deserves something.","October 16, 2015","true","26.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are plenty of character moments which made the game enjoyable for me, and although I found the female lead boring, the male lead and a 3rd character were great. A lot of funny banter in this game, which made it enjoyable despite the many problems this game has.\n\nIt has a pretty solid upgrade system, varied move patterns, although you won't need most of these since the game is fairly easy, even on the hardest difficulty. Despite the mechs in this game being too similar (there are like only 5 types of enemies), it makes it up with really fun bosses.\n\nIf it's on sale under 5$, I'd recommend this game.

Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a Sci-Fi re-make of the old story, Journey to the West, but with more robots and it's set 150 years after an apocalyptic war probably involving said robots. The main character is a really strong guy who climbs like a monkey, has a staff that gets bigger when you fight with it, and sometimes rides on a "cloud", and also his name is actually Monkey. There are a lot of climbing parts, most of the game is an escort mission (almost all of the parts where your partner is actually in danger is scripted, but it's there), and the fights get a little tedious once you upgrade your abilities enough, but it's a solid game with amazing storytelling and level design, and I think you should probably play it.

I had filed it away as a game "I'd have to try someday" and it stayed there for years. I finally noticed it on a sale, and snagged it up. I can't believe what I had been missing!\n\nTo get the not-so-great stuff out of the way, the combat isn't that amazing or inventive. It works, and it's fun enough that I never got annoyed with it. The leveling system for skills is a nice touch, and adds some customization to the player to fit a play style.\n\nThe graphics are very nice, even for a game that came out quite a while ago. The art style fits the story perfectly, and the character models and animation are top-notch.\n\nThe main draw here though, is the story and voice acting. If these are big selling points to you, get this game now. I loved the story, really pulled me in, and the character interactions felt natural and believable. The incredible voice acting only adds to the wonderful story to help bring it to life. I'll have to add in here about the music again as well. The soundtrack is amazing, and helps to accentuate the rest of the game's high points.\n\n\nTL;DR\nIf you want a game with a great story, amazing voice acting, wonderful music, interesting characters, decent combat and nice pacing, I'd recommend this in a heart beat. It's usually available for pretty cheap now, so it's really one to not miss!\n\n9/10","June 19, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story, acting, and graphics are all top notch. The gameplay gets a little repetitive toward the end, but everything else will keep you engaged.

The story, while not Steinbeck, will keep you engaged and racing to the end. The animation and voice acting are second to none.

Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland overrun by mechs, this story is a Western adaptation on the Chinese story "Journey to the West", you play as Monkey(Wukong) and you are enslaved by Trip(Xuanzang) to go on a journey and bring her back home.Oh and you get to meetPigsy on the way too\n\nPros\nGreat sound effects and music that kept the game exciting\nVoice acting is top-tier and is one of the reasons why the characters are so memorable\nGood level design, every level is huge and always different. They let the player have a rough view of the level using the dragonfly scout\nGame looks gorgeous despite being released in 2010\nCombat animations are extremely well done\nHumorous at times\nCons\nFrustrating camera angles during combat\nNo option to change difficulty during gameplay\nAwful checkpoint system with unskippable cutscenes. I had to restart once because of a crash and once because of a bug where i was in an endless falling animation, had to rewatch the entire cutscene and replay the level.\nPlatforming is FAR TOO EASY as you cannot fail\nClose to no replayablity, they allowed you to unlock skins and extras upon completing the game to try to entice the player to replay the game, but i highly doubt you would want to replay the game as it is an extremely linear game\nBad console port ( Bad menu options, resolution doesn't actually change without editing .ini files)\nOther thoughts\nEditing the .ini file for the game is strongly encouraged as it will solve some bugs like the weird shadow graphic bug as well as make your game look much better\nI did not like Trip at all, she's constantly bossing Monkey around and shows no hesitation in killing him if the player walks too far from her\nOverall i give it a solid 8/10. Despite some technical problems and inconveniences this game does an excellent job of immersing the player into this post apocalyptic world as Monkey, beating and shooting up mechs with your monkey king bar while developing a close bond with Trip.","September 23, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a Sci-Fi re-make of the old story, Journey to the West, but with more robots and it's set 150 years after an apocalyptic war probably involving said robots. The main character is a really strong guy who climbs like a monkey, has a staff that gets bigger when you fight with it, and sometimes rides on a "cloud", and also his name is actually Monkey. There are a lot of climbing parts, most of the game is an escort mission (almost all of the parts where your partner is actually in danger is scripted, but it's there), and the fights get a little tedious once you upgrade your abilities enough, but it's a solid game with amazing storytelling and level design, and I think you should probably play it.

And there's bit of Beyond Good & Evil in there also, consider it the BGE sequel we never had.\n\nI noticed it on sale for five euros and went ahead and bought it. After playing it for some time I'm impressed enough to get it on PS3 as well some day.\n\nThis is one of those games, where the cover art itself is enough to buy for, just to get it in your collection, maybe hanging on your wall. The beauty doesn't stop there, as the graphics in this game are astounding. Where every other modern video game is just different shades of brown, Enslaved is vibrant and colorful. The art style reminds me little of Bulletstorm.\n\nAnd unlike recent waifu-simulators, like Bioshock Infinite, The Last Of Us and Skyrim: Dawnguard add-on, Trip is actually an interesting companion.\n\nHowever the game feels a bit rushed and unpolished.\nThe camera switches between fixed camera angle and free to move camera, which gets annoying.\nThere's little to no freedom in platforming. It's just pointing a direction and then pressing the jump button, everything else is automated. You can't fail.\nAnd the Combat system from the Arkham games is a bit stripped down.\nThis is the only game in existence (that I know of), where I think a bit more quick time events wouldn't hurt.\n\nI like that the game allows multiple playstyles. Aside from beating the crap out of everything, you can sneak past and avoid most battles. So there's a little of replay value (though only a little).","June 13, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I especially enjoyed the ending sequences.  The gameplay was decently fun as well for the most part.\n\nThe but, however, is something you need to take into consideration before buying/playing.  It's a console game, and one that often allows very little control over your camera at that.  Yes, it makes for very interesting views, but whomever was in charge of the camera angles from "shot" to "shot" made some very bad moves, such as having you run one way but, in the next "shot", it flips the camera around completely meaning you are now running the wrong way.  Great for cinimatics, horrible for gameplay.\n\nI also found several times where Monkey would just stand there or take an inordinately long time to "reset" to be usable from stopping motion.  This was rarely an issue but when it happened during boss battles I definitely cursed.\n\nOverall a fun game, and certainly worth a sale price if you aren't maddened by the above type of gameplay issues.","June 29, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enslaved is right up there with games like Beyond Good and Evil and Psychonauts as a game which is simply phenomenal, but unfortunately did not do well commercially.\n\nGameplay is nothing revolutionary, but it's fun with tight controls.

This game is incredibly cinematic, with great art design and color, very likable characters, and great pacing. Enslaved easily feels like you're playing through a movie. And even now, in 2015, Enslaved has some the best, if not *the* best, voice acting and facial motion capture I've ever seen in a game.\n\nAn absolute must play - especially if you enjoy playing games for their stories.\n","August 5, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game brings you in with the amazing story which binds you to the characters and most of all: the world. The achievments in this game not only add some more depht to the difficulty and story since they are made so that you explore the world more and try different combinations of tactics in your attacks or defenses. For me this was a great game! For the its price and especially on sales this is a game that you will not regret buying. BTW its kind of a button masher but once you begin to use the combos and tactics you use more of the controller, especially with the hard difficulty when you must think for tactics rather than charge in and button mash everything to death.\n\nPROS: Amazing story, great characters, deep attack and defend strategies with upgrades\n\nCONS: Bit of a button masher, Does not contain a lapdance from Tripp (jk)\n\n8/10","September 6, 2014","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland overrun by mechs, this story is a Western adaptation on the Chinese story "Journey to the West", you play as Monkey(Wukong) and you are enslaved by Trip(Xuanzang) to go on a journey and bring her back home.Oh and you get to meetPigsy on the way too\n\nPros\nGreat sound effects and music that kept the game exciting\nVoice acting is top-tier and is one of the reasons why the characters are so memorable\nGood level design, every level is huge and always different. They let the player have a rough view of the level using the dragonfly scout\nGame looks gorgeous despite being released in 2010\nCombat animations are extremely well done\nHumorous at times\nCons\nFrustrating camera angles during combat\nNo option to change difficulty during gameplay\nAwful checkpoint system with unskippable cutscenes. I had to restart once because of a crash and once because of a bug where i was in an endless falling animation, had to rewatch the entire cutscene and replay the level.\nPlatforming is FAR TOO EASY as you cannot fail\nClose to no replayablity, they allowed you to unlock skins and extras upon completing the game to try to entice the player to replay the game, but i highly doubt you would want to replay the game as it is an extremely linear game\nBad console port ( Bad menu options, resolution doesn't actually change without editing .ini files)\nOther thoughts\nEditing the .ini file for the game is strongly encouraged as it will solve some bugs like the weird shadow graphic bug as well as make your game look much better\nI did not like Trip at all, she's constantly bossing Monkey around and shows no hesitation in killing him if the player walks too far from her\nOverall i give it a solid 8/10. Despite some technical problems and inconveniences this game does an excellent job of immersing the player into this post apocalyptic world as Monkey, beating and shooting up mechs with your monkey king bar while developing a close bond with Trip.","September 23, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a screen when the game first opens that tells you not to switch the console off when it's saving a checkpoint, and whoever implemented the keyboard and mouse controls needs to be sacked and never allowed to work on a game again.\n\nTip: Only use the letters and numbers on the keyboard - no special keys or the numeric keypad - and the controls will be okay.\n\nOnce you're in the game it is actually pretty good as long as you're not looking for a major skill-based challenge. The Tomb Raider-esque climbing is rather dumbed down - you can't fall off or miss a jump - and the combat is fairly basic. Basic but fun!\n\nThe story is very good, as is the acting (with Andy Serkis voicing Monkey). Overall I'd definitely recommend playing.\n\n\nThe Pigsy's Perfect 10 DLC is also worth playing. It's a separate story in which you play a different character from the main game. The gameplay is somewhat different and there's more of a tactical element to it. The story here is also very good.","December 18, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, while I like the way the story is developing, I can't seem to deal with the way the camera angle changes from time to time. And I'm unable to cope well enough with the camera controls. Use wasd to move avatar, camera is moved using mouse. However, camera is centred in a third person view on the avatar/player character, and will move while you move. Combat has just been me spamming the attack keys while attempting to focus on the enemy mechs. Probably because I'm horrible with the controls.\n\n"And finally - the camera has really narrow FOV, which sometimes caused confiusion for me (it tends to get stuck and perform rapid rotations on it's own), and there is no way to adjust all that." Seems about right. Though this is a console to PC port, eh.\n\nStorywise, it's developing nicely. Playing as an escaped slave, who then gets reslaved by another escaped slave, and forced to help save a community or something. Now I can't be bothered playing anymore since it gives me a headache with the camera controls every 20 minutes.\n\nWill recommend, since a friend recommended it to me.\n","January 11","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's well-made, but somewhat flawed. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot, especially the first half.\n\nThe gameplay is made up of platforming, third-person combat, and some over-the-shoulder shooting. These different aspects of the gameplay are all quite rudimentary on their own, but the game manages to weave them together into a pleasant flow--you are always propelled forward, and you're never stuck. Because of the rudimentary nature of the gameplay, doing any particular thing for long will feel very repetitive, and the game recognizes when that point comes along and switches things up. Although the game was short, I think it would have been less enjoyable if it was any longer.\n\nI really liked the setting and the environment design.  The game definitely has a different take on post-apocalyptic wasteland, with the majority of the game taking place in a lush, jungled version of New York city. It felt like the developers really put a lot of effort into making the world unique and interesting. Though one thing that struck me about the levels was how dated they feel. The game feels to me very much like a game from 2009 with the way it segments off areas.\n\nThe character interaction is probably the highlight of the game for me. The dialogue between the main character Monkey and his companion Trip are well-written and well-acted. Their relationship felt real, and I was invested in its development. On the other hand, I found the over-arching story lacking. The ending was much too abrupt and the game didn't spend any time to establish the villain at all. A bulk of the story was just thrusted at you in the ending. The game ended in a good place in terms of gameplay progression, but not in terms of the story arc. Also, what the hell was with the ending cut scene?\n\nRegarding the game being a retelling of Journey to the West, I don't really agree. The game makes a lot of little references to the novel, such as the names of the characters and weapons, but the story itself felt much more like a Western epic. Even though the characters in Journey to the West do go on a quest, it is not a heroic tale like most Western epics. The game makes no reference to Buddhaism, which is the central part of the novel,  and the relationship between Monkey and Trip is also completely different, among many other differences. The connection between Enslaved and Journey to the West is really quite superficial.\n\nAll in all, this game was a very pleasant surpise for me.

Combat animations are Mo-capped, actually every character animation is Mo-capped.\nI guess that was a given with Andy Serkis as your lead actor, who does a f*cking great job to be totally honest.\nHowever back to combat, I'm not sure if this is really the case, but the animations that run during combat feel disjointed to say the least. Secondly the combat is made more annoying by the fact that our main character doesn't close the distance between enemies when he starts swinging. Causing him to swing thin air how many times you pressed the button. You are required  close the distance manually, which although makes sense, but makes the tense moments a bit annoying, when you just stand there doing your best windmill-impersonation when the enemies wait to shank you.\n\nTertiary point I can summarize with one phrase: F*ck that camera, it's a monster of it's own...\n\n\nAnyway those wide and pointy serrated edges aside, the story that this game tells is pretty nice. I honestly can't say much besides that lest I spoil the whole thing. But I feel that it is a pretty good combination of a generic adventure-film plot with some light comedy towards the end and a rather anticlimactic ending..\n\nSo If you enjoy those generic martial-arts/adventure-film and have the patience to sit through some minor annoyances with it.

Uninspired by post-apocalyptic environments I am fed up with, I picked it up at a budget price for Xbox 360.  Simply put it on to try the first level and was then hooked.\n\nIt's not all fast paced, some chapters do drag mostly because of repetitive Mech battles, but once you level up and learn a few techniques it can speed the game up dramatically.  Despite the combat it's a pacifist game at heart and will appeal to a wider group of people than it probably attracts on first glance.  It has a nice and engaging story with a firm conclusion.\n\nThe graphics and control setup on PC are fine, little bit of tuning required but was nothing too painful.  The DLC is there too, as are the costumes available on console.\n\nIf you're looking for a chapter-at-a-time story-based adventure game with comfortable collectables and combat mechanics, this is a must-try.

You are required  close the distance manually, which although makes sense, but makes the tense moments a bit annoying, when you just stand there doing your best windmill-impersonation when the enemies wait to shank you.\n\nTertiary point I can summarize with one phrase: F*ck that camera, it's a monster of it's own...\n\n\nAnyway those wide and pointy serrated edges aside, the story that this game tells is pretty nice. I honestly can't say much besides that lest I spoil the whole thing. But I feel that it is a pretty good combination of a generic adventure-film plot with some light comedy towards the end and a rather anticlimactic ending..\n\nSo If you enjoy those generic martial-arts/adventure-film and have the patience to sit through some minor annoyances with it. I really could recommend this..\nBut only if you can keep an open mind and can stop yourself from throwing a controller in the first half-an-hour.","January 14","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since they haven't made a good transition from it's original platform release Xbox, som keys that are shown in game are based on their XBOX controller, and not PC keys which cannot be found in options, in game. You will be forced to look it up, easy fix.\nStill very enjoyable with keyboard, controllers are recommended if you are not a true PCMasterRace member.\n\nThe graphics in this game does satisfy, very colourful that makes it feel alive, but at times it goes downhill with glitches here and there, and characters look kinda pixelated in videos (at times), and the camera can be awkward at times aswell.\nThis will all be forgiven since the world look really pretty and has a sort of intriguing story, some decisions in game that can be questionable.\n\nI've played through the game for the first time now and may continue on Hard mode, doubt that it will be a challenge since it is pretty linear. The reviews are pretty much the same, the game has it flaws indeed, but it is easily overlooked.\nRather enjoyable Campaign/SingePlayer story and it's greatly recommended for a cool story and to explore a "different" kind of game. You have to be good at dodging, gotta do it in the right moment.\n\nPS. MY FAVOURITE HOVERBOARD, the "Cloud" that you ride on has something special about it, that just makes it so smooth to ride.\n\nBuy the game to lose some time, it's great fun, go explore!","January 2","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It tells a reasonably complete story without turning it into a grindfest. I suffered none of the performance issues that some have reported.\n\nIt is not without flaws however. While this is not really a complaint. I did at times find their clothing annoying. The were both rather underdressed for their roles as wasteland survivors.  Sometimes the camera seemed to do whatever it wanted at the most critcal of moments, and the target lock would inexplicably switch away from the opponent you most needed to get rid of. The ending did seem like it was meant to lead to a sequel.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABOZ/recommended/245280/","ABOZ","ABOZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ABOZ/","167 products in account","Enslaved has all the wrappings of a decent action game. The particle effects and art direction are pretty good, and overall cinematic kind of feel. This is a *story* game, first and foremost. The game part could have used a little more work.\n\nThe main gripe is that the platforming is extreeeemely straight forward. All you do is pick a direction and a button. These controls are simply not interesting enough, compared to typical platforming aspects, even in this new-age market...\n\nThe exact same criticism can be used on the combat, in which the auto targeting is extremely annoying. The boss fights I've encountered tend to pretty much ignore that you just dodged out of the way, the AI has zero turn radius time, and will auto-target you anyway. Of course, this can be countered by being farther away so the attack uses time to reach you. However, you need to be close up to attack effectively, so it's a toss up.\nI've encountered numerous glitches where the boss AI will run at a wall indefinitely, or even stand completely still for no apparent reason. It's immersion breaking, to be sure.\n\nFinally, it's completely frustrating how the beginning of some huge sequence has an unskippable cut-scene, often between 10-20 seconds in length.\n\nThe only save option is auto-save, which is a very very annoying aspect to include in a game full of collectibles.\n\nI broke the game early on by investing a SINGLE POINT into health regeneration. The game went from absolutely relying on the game giving you health packs, to not caring at all.\n\nMicro managing an extra unit has some interesting interactions - giving the game one of those common puzzle-platformer vibes. However, in combination with the action and "platforming" sequences, it definitely feels as though the developers had too many ideas and not enough time to get it all just perfect. If these gamey parts were developed a bit more, I'd be enjoying myself too much to write a review.\n\nAll the whining aside, the characters have highly talented voice actors. Monkey and Trip are cool characters. Monkey was most definitely inspired by Sun Wukong. Trip is a female technophile, she makes what could be interesting puzzle situations into a stall-for-time situation. Further, it's easy to tell the animators were the most skilled people on the team. If you look past the faults of Enslaved, which I've named pretty much all of them... you can enjoy a decent interactive story and a tolerable gameplay. Just take breaks, ignore your inner voice asking for more trial and error, and I'm sure any gamer can find something of value (fun).\n\n7.2/10","June 5, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It came out just ahead of a bunch of established IPs, and Ninja Theory's biggest thing to date then was Heavenly Sword, so it got passed over by a lot of people. That said, while it was ignored for bigger names, Enslaved is a pretty good game... though not a great game. Still, I bought it on sale for $5 and it was worth every penny, and I'd probably recommend it for $20.\n\nBasically, while it has the usual beat'em up style gameplay and parkour'ing around, it tries to be different. There's now graybrown sludge here, the environments are vivid and bright and colorful. Not every battle needs to be fought--you can skip some. Some of the battles are less beat'em up and more puzzle, as you need to work together with the female lead to get past them. Finally, it has a sense of humor, a good sense of story, and a pleasant twist at the end.\n\nAll in all, while it's nothing revolutionary, and certainly will feel a bit dated by today's standards, it's still worth a look. And at around 10 hours for one playthrough (with some DLC that comes with it and cheevos to farm, adding on time), it won't take you too long.\n\nGive it a try.

Will post more as I play. Does not port over properly as the instructions for Focus Attack are "Press Y+B" which does not exist on the PC version.\n\n\nPROS\n1. Cloud Travel\nLoved the cloud movement levels. High speed, high jumps and lot of room to explore. Boss Hound fight was great too.\n\n2. Combat system\nVery interesting fighting system. Love the power of range weapons and how they function very similarly to reality. Distracting is a new mechanic, simple but it adds a different method of playing.\n\nI was a bit disappointed that the bosses tend to be killed with a similar pattern e.g. Stun, Heavy Attack, Stun, Heavy Attack, Takedown Move, Rinse, Repeat.\n\nYou can't target lock/focus on an enemy making it hard to aim your shields with the lousy camera movements.\n\n3. 2-person puzzle\nIt is interesting but it gets kind of repetitive. E.g. Piggyback, Toss Trip, Open Security Door/Push Blocks, Rinse, Repeat.\n\n4. Dragonfly View\nInteresting but it would be better if you could control and fly the Dragonfly yourself instead of a controlled cutscene. If control was allowed, you could design hidden areas in the map, plant ambushes, plant mines, hide paths and switches etc etc and the player would have to use Dragonfly view to find them. Like hide-and-seek.\n\n5. Puzzles\nQuite fun relative to plain old switches E.g. Drawbridge\n\nCONS\n1. Porting\nDid not port over properly from Playstation. Viewing mode is horrible at certain areas. Worst, they are bugged and you can't reach certain areas.\n\nRefer to my screenshots for more information.\n\n2. Jumping Off/On\nCertain ledges are really silly. While I appreciate not being able to fall off an edge, I really hate having  to find specific ledges just to jump off E.g. Theatre with the hound reaquires you to jump off at the first prop stage in order to reach the stage floor.\n\nJumping off into a 90 degree corner can create a bug where you keep falling infinitely, so you look like you're swimming in mid air.\n\nRefer to my screenshots for more information.\n\nVery linear. There is no wrong pathway to jump to. Just keep pressing an obvious direction key and the jump button to proceed. You just need to be fast.\n\n3. Storyline\nVery meh. It's not exactly engaging. You have Slavers, Earth 200 years in the future, evolutionary robots, etc etc, but they don't come together to form a concrete story. They seem to be modularised instead of being integrated into a complete story.\n\n4. The Staff\nAbsolutely horrible to switch between Plasma and Stun on the PC. You have to Right Click, go into First person mode, then press the Left Arrow and Right Arrow key while holding down Right Click in the middle of battle.\n\n5. Upgrades\nOnly Staff, Combat, Health and Shield to choose from, yet you can't use WASD to choose them. You can't mouseover the correct wheel to choose the specific upgrade properly as there seems to be a bug.","November 12, 2014","false","8.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TOOBxSOCKS/recommended/245280/","TOOBxSOCKS","Toobs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TOOBxSOCKS/","2803 products in account","This game is pretty good. It's not the greatest thing I've ever played, but if i didn't own it anymore and needed to buy it again, i would. It doesnt bring anything new to the table, theres nothing i havent seen or done before in this game but its still fun and feels familiar. It's EXTREMELY good for the price i got it for during the Summer Sale, and would still not be a disappointing purchase if i were to pay full price.\nThe thing that stands out the most to me in the game is the level design, it's absolutely beautiful. The city of New York in a post-apocalyptic state overgrown with trees, vines and bushes. The texturing could REALLY use some work though. It all looks great from afar but once up close things arent quite as good looking, although that takes nothing from the game IMO. Gameplay > graphics no matter how you look at it.\nTheres a LOT of environmental puzzles in a Prince of Persia type of way. Lots of climbing and jumping around on destroyed buildings and other things in the environment. That' one of my favorite aspects of the game, I've always loved that sort of thing. Prince of Persia is one of my favorite game series ever.\nThe storyline in the game is GREAT. I'm really enjoying it. I'm not going to talk about the story though, as i don't want to be the guy dropping spoilers in the reviews, that's always gotten on my nerves when people do that. The writers for this deserve a lot of credit for making this game what it is, because if the story wasnt enjoyable i think i would have already moved on to another game. There is a lot of games with the same style of game mechanics as this one, so a solid story is important in this genre to me.\nThe combat is pretty fulfilling, you have a decent variety of moves and such although it could use a little more. It reminds me a lot of God of Wars combat the way you fight in this game. The combat IS repetitive, though it hasn't felt like it was so far. You have this laser staff type thing, you can use it for melee combat and also to shoot energy projectiles at enemies. So far I've come across two different ammo types, a normal energy charge and then a stun charge but there may be more throughout the game I'm not sure. There is quick time events, but they're not very often and they're usually just a single button to press to finish off an enemy. Speaking of enemies, that's one thing this game could've use, more variety of enemies. You fight the same mechs over and over and over.\nYou collect red orbs which are used to upgrade your health, your shield, your combat abilities and your staff. To me that's always been kind of a generic way to fill in the spaces to give a game more content and another purpose of playing, but the game does not rely too heavily on this so it does not bother me. They are found just layting around in random places and they are dropped by enemies after you defeat them.\nYou have a female character with you at all times that is an integral part of the story, and you have to make use of her abilities to get through some parts of the game. You put her on your back an dcarry her through mine fields, she can create a decoy that attracts gunfire so you can get to places that have turrets watching, you can toss her up to palces you cannot reach for her to help you get where you need to go. Theres also other things you can do with her, but i'll leave that for you to discover.\nTheres whole seperate campaigns in the bonus content section, i thought that was pretty cool. You can assume the role of other characters in the game and play through their stories. A nice addition to an already satisfying game. Would be great if other games did this also.\n\nIf i had to describe this game through comparisons to other games, i would say this is the lovechild of God of War, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed. The game is good enough to be placed next to any of those 3 and stand strong in competition with them, even though this is nowhere near as well known or liked.\n\n\nI havent completely finished the game yet, but i feel I've played enough to give an honest, fair review and right now on a scale of 1 through 10 i would give this game 8.5/10\n\nIf you are a fan of any of three series mentioned above, you shouldnt hesitate to give this one a try.","July 5, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

They added a few bits like the option to turn off motion-blur but apart from that it's the classic "Low, Medium or High".\n\nThe default "high" settings are no AA, x4 AF and pretty much just... awful awful textures.

Enslaved Odyssey to the West does a good job of immersing you in the world, at first. To anyone who has played the demo they may think this is a great game, or will be... but they would be wrong. Constant camera control being taken away from you for 'cinematic sequences', constantly the game slows you down by literally making you walk while characters deliver dialogue that could have easily been given while the player is actually playing the freakin' game. Seriously the freakin girl character literally stops you from doing things, barks out order to you (so you can't solve simple puzzles on your own, the game treats you like an idiot by even placing her there). The camera is wonky, combat is okay but very tedious. Graphics become tedious once you reazlie the yare resycled far too often. Did I mention this game really wants to feel like a movie? Causei f you're into that sort of thing, then you'll LOVE this game... if you want an interactive video game with interactive story telling (true interactive) you won't find it here. You will find a controlled game that is for basic players, it's very hard to screw up in this game. Everything is done for you, auto platforming and all that... it's an insult.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/245280/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Was honestly hoping for a better game. After seeing this game on so many "top 10 most underrated games" and "top 10 games nobody played" lists, I had high hopes. While it wasn't bad, it was really just a little better than average. First off, the good. The story is semi-interesting and the character development and bond between the two characters is fun to watch. The voice and acting is good. The graphics are solid, except for some problems with shadows and shading (had nothing to do with my top of the line comp). The combat could have been much better. You use a light and heavy attack. But unlike god of war or most 3rd person action games, there are no combos. You literally just hit with all light, all heavy, or mix them, but any mixture of the two always comes out the same. You can use a stun attack and a wide attack to move everyone back. You also get a special attack from hitting people, although there is no meter or way to know how it is progressing. You have all that within the first hour. You literally gain nothing else all game. There is an evade attack where you just evade and attack, pretty boring. The game includes a counter ability, but it is the single worst in any game ever. It doesn't even work. You have to be blocking and then press a button at the right time, but the button takes you out of block and gets you hurt. I tried it like 10 times and it never once worked. The upgrade system is boring too. You get increased health, shields, better shooting damage, and thats about it. There is nothing interesting. There are collectible masks but they basically don't do anything besides show a random picture.\n\nThe other biggest problem is the enemies. The entire game you fight like 4 different (but basically same looking) robots. They have no personality, don't talk, and have no incentive or agenda. There is no entity you are fighting against. So the fighting is uninteresting because the enemies never change and you don't care about them. Fighting endless silent robots the entire game just takes away the fun. The game also doesn't describe the world at all. There are 3 total people the entire game, and it is never explained why. Why were there all these robots with no masters, who controls them, where are people, what has happened......none of it explained. There have been positive things said about the post-apocolyptic setting, and its ok. It doesn't feel real or lived in like the last of us. It is a bunch of same looking worn down buildings with green moss on them, thats about it. You are among buildings, in a scrapyard, in a ramshackle town, and in a facility. That's basically it. I didn't find any of them that impressive. The camera zooms in too closely in combat and it is hard to see when people are about to attack you, which is annoying. Another caveat is Trip. Instead of making her like Elle from the last of us, they make here way too feminine and damsel in distress. She needs help all the time, even making you carry her up this tiny ledge she can easily climb. She spends most of the time crying and yelling when enemies attack, even if it is you fighting them and she is nowhere near them, she'll just scream and wail because you are fighting. It gets super annoying and she's so helpless and whiny I felt like she was dakota fanning from War of the Worlds.\n\nThe platforming is kind of fun, but it is super linear. You jump from one shiny rung or foothold to another. You never have to aim or do anything besides just continually hammer jump, its not like "drakes uncharted" where you feel accomplished or like it actually took skill. Sometimes the platforming doesn't work. You will be by the edge and just roll forward against an invisible wall, because you weren't at the perfect spot to trigger the jump sequence, which makes it feel even more linear and hands-off. The game does provide good length though. The DLC is fun and a change of pace, although pigsy is made to be way too slow getting over things, activating abilities, and getting in and out of cover. It does introduce you to the best character of the game, Truffles, who is baller. The ending was sad and the most heartbroken I have been in a game in a while. As for enslaved as a whole, if the upgrade system wasn't boring as hell, the combat had variation or something more than using the same weapon with the same 2 attacks for 8 hours, and weren't fighting the same boring 4 machines with no personality, I would recommend it higher. Right now, 7/10.","April 20, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sure, if you stop and expect some corners of the game, you'll notice a lack of tesselation, textures being on a flat tile, objects not having as many points as they should, but generally, you'll be too busy climbing or fighting to take the microscope to everything. First off, this is no open world game. Like in many climbing games, there is a high degree of linearity, but you don't feel it as much as in Remember Me or, oh shudder, I am Alive. The climbing is fun, the fighting is, for the most part, also fun, and easy mode is actually easy. The world is beautiful (and colorful), the controls are fluid and sufficiently exact (though I'm not sure I appreciate "press A+X" type controls, but you only need those if you buy certain fighting skills), and the voice acting is good. The plot is OK -- or rather, you're too busy playing the game to pay too much attention; in fact, the plot and the backstory are a bit meh and confused, and adding quasi-flashbacks in a completely different visual style was a bad decision that breaks immersion when it happens. Your character isn't the most fleshed out ever, but quite serviceable. (Unfortunately, you only get to play Monkey, the man, not Trip, his companion. There is no multi-player either, so Trip is always AI controlled. At least, she has useful skills and isn't the kind of AI that steps in your line of fire, but where she isn't dangerous due to a lack of artificial intelligence, she is as a function of the story -- she is written to get you in trouble, and while her motives are somewhat understandable, she isn't exactly likeable.)\nIn sum, the game feels very arcady -- big sprites, broad strokes, good fun.\nI bought this at (PC) release, and am not sore for the money.\nDon't buy if you require open worlds / sandboxes to be happy.\n","October 28, 2013","true","25.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

It's mostly dull, though not particularly difficult. The last two levels are particularly aggravating, and feel like they didn't get as much polish as the rest of the game. The final resolution comes out of nowhere, was trite, and left the story feeling pretty unsatisfactory in the end. Add to it Pigsy, the character who starts out as a quirky sidekick and ventures into creepy uncle territory, and you have a game that ends up being mildly aggravating but ultimately forgettable.

You can't jump down edges or leap in a different direction when the game doesnt want you to. You can't even fall from ledges unless you're supposed to. The game insists on holding your hand throughout the game. Despite this, I sometimes found myself in situations of not knowing what to do next, only because the objectives weren't mapped out clearly.\nThese invisible barriers for a game isnt new or that bad actually... In fact, it's a good thing since I won't ever find myself accidentally jumping in the wrong directions and falling into a pool of acid or something but it also means no sense of danger, freedom or thought needed for the player.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are pretty interesting the first few times, then starts getting rather repetitive when you realize this is what you'll have to go through for the rest of the game. Climb this, climb that, deal with conveniently placed turrets, pull some lever and fight mostly the same robot enemies over and over again that you'll encounter throughout the whole game. Unlike what it seems, this is mostly a platformer-puzzle game than it is an action-adventure game.\nNot to say I hate platformer games. I've played games like the Prince of Persia series and enjoyed them, but for a game like Enslaved, all the climbing segments are all too similiar and with all the protective invisible walls in place, there's no challenge to be found in any of it.\n\nThere are thankfully several instances of more fun action such as running from a giant robot dog or fighting a big robot that shoots his balls at you, but these are few and far in between.\nLevels are mostly linear and despite the changes in environment for each chapter, the map designs never really of changes and soon starts to feel way too repetitive.\n\n\n\nBAD PORTING\n\nThere's little reason to roam in the maps apart from collecting bright shiny red floating orbs that you can use for upgrades which are pointless anyway. Because with such shoddy controls for this PC port, I couldn't even be bothered to use half of new movesets I unlock. One particuarly useful attack of Monkey swinging his long pole at multiple enemies (space+left mouse) can't even performed with the keyboard, with Monkey jumping up and down like an hapless dolt more times than when he actually performs the attack successfully. This is the biggest problem I had with the game and I never found a solution to it.\n\nMouse sensitivity is all over place and it took me multiple attempts at tweaking the .ini file and in-game settings to finally settle things down. Even then, I had problems with the aiming controls, trying to aim with projectiles feels like trying to aim with WASD than with my own mouse. People who play on the controller probably wont be affected by all this crap porting issues, but hey, this is a effin' PC game. If they want to port it to PC, then port it right.\n\n\nA COMPELLING STORY\n\nThe story of Enslaved starts off with a half-naked dude, Monkey, being enslaved by a girl called Tripp, thus the title "Enslaved". Many elements are borrowed from Journey to the West, but mostly it's just the characters. Not sure if they were even travelling to the 'West'. The relationship is between Tripp and Monkey is interesting but never fully explored. Their journey spans across a few different unique locations but I honestly couldn't get that feeling of a refresh. Structures and paths are largely the same and having to battle the exact same robot enemies for all these levels made this adventure a tiring slog through.\nI can't give a proper conclusion to the story since I've not reached the last chapter, and it's pretty much the main reason why I, and most people I guess, play the game for. But with the kind of gameplay I have to put up with, I don't think I can be bothered to.\n\n\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nGraphics is pretty okay for 2010 standards, but far too bright and vibrant for my tastes. The excessive bloom washes away texture definition and environment details and the brightness can sometimes be too distracting instead.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEnslaved Odyssey to the West has a potentially good premise in its world that leaves much to be answered but as much as I hate to say this, it just squanders too much repetitiveness, linear level design and gameplay mechanics that makes the game more boring to play than enjoy.\n\nIf you're fine with a very mediocre gameplay experience and prefer playing the game for a story or adventure you might enjoy this game. But personally, as much as I wanted to, I couldn't.\n\n\n2.5/5","May 12","false","8.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","3"

Though I always wait for sales so I'd rarely recommend a full price purchase unless you really want the game and know you'll probably like it.\n\nAbout the limited enemies and platforming elements. I felt they were both decently made but they both also get old somewhat quickly. There aren't many enemy types, mostly you'll fight the same 4 mechs so combat can grow pretty tedious. Also platforming  always stagnates in my opinion, there's only so much you can do with it and the answers paths in this game aren't hard to figure out. Luckily the game switches between fighting and platforming at a decent pace to make both more palatable. Usually a game being short I consider a con since it kind of sucks paying money for something you burn through so easily but it almost helps this game since if it went on for much longer the combat/platforming would probably end up wearing on my patience as I grew more tired of them.\n\nGraphical issues, overall the graphics are fine in my opinion. But the cutscenes had a wierd wave effect while the camera was panning that was pretty annoying, this could just be some setting on my computer I messed up I guess but it never really happened during actual gameplay. Also Tripps hair is like a bundle of wires, they clip with her face and such which I found pretty noticable. They're both very minor cons though.","February 27","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just the right mix for me of jumping, bashing, shooting, surfing, puzzles, and story.  Haven't had this much fun since Beyond Good and Evil, which this game made me nostaligc for with the bo-staff fights, hovercrafts, and pig-styled characters.  That said it's a completely different game and much darker story, but still enjoyable and fun to play.\n\nThe fight style can be tough, to the point of frustrated cursing at times, but it helps break the simple run through of the jump puzzles and co-op puzzles, which are thoughtful enough to add to the game but not mind breaking.  The decoy feature with your partner is handy, even if you get frustrated with the constant "Monkey! Go fetch this!" "Monkey! I can't jump."  "Monkey!  Kill something!"\n\nI also love the characters, Monkey in particular is great and Pigsy is hilarious.  The graphics and detail really bring them to life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/recommended/245280/","droniac","Droniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/","884 products in account","Enslaved: Odyseey to the West is a solid action game held up mostly by its characters and storytelling. In a distant post-apocalyptic future you play Monkey, who escapes from a slave ship only to be enslaved by a fellow escapee: Trip. From that point forward you're trying to keep her alive during various adventures. I can't really go into it any further than that without spoiling things, but suffice it to say the storytelling and character development is interesting, particularly during the first half of the game.\n\nGameplay-wise you're looking at a fairly standard action-platformer. Monkey jumps and climbs around some crazy - and beautifully colorful - environments. And over time he unlocks more spectacular methods of navigating terrain and taking out enemies. There is an element of collecting materials to upgrade and unlock abilities here, so there's a small amount of customization. That sadly doesn't do anything to prevent the combat from being very simplistic throughout. And even the spectacular boss battles are handled by fairly basic, eventually repetitive, means.\n\nEnslaved is an older game, and it shows. The environmental design is beautiful and colorful, but the texturework is frequently hideous and there's not much detail to anything. It looks worse than a game released in 2010 should. Similarly, the audio is far from ideal. There is no separate voice volume slider, which often results in voiceovers being completely drowned out by sound effects. Subtitles are essential.\n\nThe game loses a little of its focus after the halfway point, but picks it up again shortly before the ending. It ends up being a game that's most-of-the-way to being excellent. Yet it falls flat in terms of execution a few too many times to get all the way there. Some sequences are very glitchy and the combat mechanics / enemy variety could've used some more attention, for example.\n\nAll DLC is included with this edition, which is a blessing. The character DLC is largely useless, because it only unlocks after playing the campaign through once, and you're really not going to play through it a second time. But Pigsy's Perfect 10 is an excellent example of how DLC can be done right. It takes the main game's formula, but puts a huge spin on the gameplay mechanics and delivers an excellent 2-3 hour linear stealth & sniping mini-campaign. It even serves as a nice self-contained prequel story ... that's best experienced after playing through the main campaign.\n\nConclusion / TL;DR\nEnslaved: Odyssey to the West is an excellent "experience". Gamers who enjoy interesting stories, strong characters and amazing environments can't go wrong. But those looking for strong action-platforming mechanics first and foremost will be let down.\n\nTechnical Droning\nRequires some ini tweaks to render properly, specifically to fix a Shadow rendering bug and unlock the frame rate.\n120Hz - Yes, with ini tweaks\nBorderless Window - No\nGraphics Options - Decent\nTexture Quality - Poor\nGamepad vs Keyboard - Gamepad, the keyboard controls aren't very good\nAudio Balance - Poor.

You can't jump down edges or leap in a different direction when the game doesnt want you to. You can't even fall from ledges unless you're supposed to. The game insists on holding your hand throughout the game. Despite this, I sometimes found myself in situations of not knowing what to do next, only because the objectives weren't mapped out clearly.\nThese invisible barriers for a game isnt new or that bad actually... In fact, it's a good thing since I won't ever find myself accidentally jumping in the wrong directions and falling into a pool of acid or something but it also means no sense of danger, freedom or thought needed for the player.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are pretty interesting the first few times, then starts getting rather repetitive when you realize this is what you'll have to go through for the rest of the game. Climb this, climb that, deal with conveniently placed turrets, pull some lever and fight mostly the same robot enemies over and over again that you'll encounter throughout the whole game. Unlike what it seems, this is mostly a platformer-puzzle game than it is an action-adventure game.\nNot to say I hate platformer games. I've played games like the Prince of Persia series and enjoyed them, but for a game like Enslaved, all the climbing segments are all too similiar and with all the protective invisible walls in place, there's no challenge to be found in any of it.\n\nThere are thankfully several instances of more fun action such as running from a giant robot dog or fighting a big robot that shoots his balls at you, but these are few and far in between.\nLevels are mostly linear and despite the changes in environment for each chapter, the map designs never really of changes and soon starts to feel way too repetitive.\n\n\n\nBAD PORTING\n\nThere's little reason to roam in the maps apart from collecting bright shiny red floating orbs that you can use for upgrades which are pointless anyway. Because with such shoddy controls for this PC port, I couldn't even be bothered to use half of new movesets I unlock. One particuarly useful attack of Monkey swinging his long pole at multiple enemies (space+left mouse) can't even performed with the keyboard, with Monkey jumping up and down like an hapless dolt more times than when he actually performs the attack successfully. This is the biggest problem I had with the game and I never found a solution to it.\n\nMouse sensitivity is all over place and it took me multiple attempts at tweaking the .ini file and in-game settings to finally settle things down. Even then, I had problems with the aiming controls, trying to aim with projectiles feels like trying to aim with WASD than with my own mouse. People who play on the controller probably wont be affected by all this crap porting issues, but hey, this is a effin' PC game. If they want to port it to PC, then port it right.\n\n\nA COMPELLING STORY\n\nThe story of Enslaved starts off with a half-naked dude, Monkey, being enslaved by a girl called Tripp, thus the title "Enslaved". Many elements are borrowed from Journey to the West, but mostly it's just the characters. Not sure if they were even travelling to the 'West'. The relationship is between Tripp and Monkey is interesting but never fully explored. Their journey spans across a few different unique locations but I honestly couldn't get that feeling of a refresh. Structures and paths are largely the same and having to battle the exact same robot enemies for all these levels made this adventure a tiring slog through.\nI can't give a proper conclusion to the story since I've not reached the last chapter, and it's pretty much the main reason why I, and most people I guess, play the game for. But with the kind of gameplay I have to put up with, I don't think I can be bothered to.\n\n\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nGraphics is pretty okay for 2010 standards, but far too bright and vibrant for my tastes. The excessive bloom washes away texture definition and environment details and the brightness can sometimes be too distracting instead.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEnslaved Odyssey to the West has a potentially good premise in its world that leaves much to be answered but as much as I hate to say this, it just squanders too much repetitiveness, linear level design and gameplay mechanics that makes the game more boring to play than enjoy.\n\nIf you're fine with a very mediocre gameplay experience and prefer playing the game for a story or adventure you might enjoy this game. But personally, as much as I wanted to, I couldn't.\n\n\n2.5/5","May 12","false","8.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","3"

Three presets for graphics options and terrible visuals. Metal gear solid 4 looks like a next gen game compared to this and that is on the ps3. The story... oh god... the story is just a mess. You play as this charecter named Monkey who is enslaved by this young girl named trip by a slave headband. Despite this Monkey and Trip become friends very quickly and even when they do Trip does not take the headband off. There are other things that happen in the story that lack explenation but I would be spoiling the game if I talked about it. I will just end my explanation for the distaste I have for the story by saying that the ending is very lack luster and you will have questions and you will be dissapointed.\n\nBut how is the gameplay? Well its really fun but unfortunatley this is very flawed as well. There are these large enemies that have unblockable attacks that they will sometimes use over and over and over again. I would find myself doing really well when all of a sudden I would be facing two or three of these things and lose a huge portion of health due to the difficulty of dodging their attacks. It feels nice to slam Monkey's staff into the enemies but its just so simplistic with very few options and strange camera placement. All in all it is just repetitive I honestly think that Star Wars The Force Unleashed's combat is more compelling at least I can somewhat change my strategy depending on what I decide to upgrade. The shooting is extremely simple to its not even worth going into detail about.\n\nPlease get this game on sale for 5 bucks like I did. I honestly would not pay more for it.\n\nP.S: I have seen the AI running into things and I had a lot of problems with getting Trip to do something as your commends most of the time do not register.

There are numerous bugs in the PC version unless you set the graphical settings to maximum, including one where you can't actually leave a boss battle because the game uses high graphics settings for object destruction; and on low settings the wall doesn't break.\n\nThe "Gameplay" is highly repetitive. You are either climbing pre-set handholds with no active engagement from you needed (there's no risk of falling or any skill required), or continuously waiting to be able to actually enjoy fighting. The reason I say this is, the entirety of the game is set up to not only prevent you from being able to enjoy any combat, but to ensure the non-combat segments of the game are as long as humanly possible. You will get to "enjoy" mindless climbing, mines, hideously unfair enemy advantages requiring you "strategize" in the form of "hurry up and wait" while they variously stop firing and lose interest so you can run to the next stupidly miniscule amount of cover.\n\nThe most infuriating thing about this game is perhaps how highly it's been rated. I can only conclude the people who enjoy this game so much have no idea what "fun" is, and when given something vaguely in the appearance of fun will gladly sit at traffic lights turning red all day thinking the "gameplay" is to keep track of how many times the light turns green.","August 19, 2015","false","3.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Enslaved is beautiful in graphics only. While the setting of the game is glorious, the story itself is lacking. There are several plot holes, which lack any detailed explanation, and to top it off: it’s consistent use of gender roles is insulting to both men and women. Had there been more thought put into the development of this game, I would recommend it in a heartbeat, but in my opinion it lacks tact and was not at all thought through.\n\nStory: The story is set in a post-apocalyptic future, although what happened to the Earth was never properly analyzed nor explained. While this fault alone can be disregarded, the fact that the entire story revolves around one young womans crusade against slavers by the means of her enslaved “Monkey” man proves more difficult to ignore. Basically, the female protagonist is a huge hypocrite who cannot take care of herself and requires the aid of a big strong man. As if the two main characters horribly written fate isn’t enough, the third character that they add in only accents the fact that the woman is viewed as a piece of incompetent meat.\n\nGameplay: There’s nothing particularly wrong with the gameplay itself, if you are the brawler type. Nor is there anything that is innovated, or outside the box. It is a pretty generic, run of the mill creation. The only bit that is even remotely interesting is the skills distribution, and even then, it’s pretty standard.\n\nControls: The targeting is extremely awkward, which adds an unintended level of difficulty. Apart from that, the controls are also rather generic, and there’s nothing more to say about them.\n\nGraphics: Phenomenal. In all honesty, the aesthetics of this game are pretty much its strongest selling point. It is an absolutely visually stunning game, with scenery that is worth taking in. Props for an awesome immersive setting.\n\nSound: Unremarkable, but no complaints or compliments.\n\nReplay Value: Close to none, unless you really, REALLY enjoy looking at aesthetics. There is new content after beating the game that is opened to you. In my opinion, however, it’s really not exceptionally worth a second playthrough. I can name several games (from the same genre) in my library that will get more attention.","April 2, 2015","false","11.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","7"

I doubt it.\n\nIf you're prone to motion sickness, you might want to look away from my review because you might get queasy just reading about it here...it is THAT bad.  The camera fights you all the time.  Each time you get close to the edge of the 40 foot wide corridor, it yanks you back and tries to force you back to the center.  1920x1080 is the max resolution which is awesome for those with big monitors.  I know some of the settings can be changed via the .ini files:  motion blur can be disabled, AA can be turned on, VSYNC etc but the studios need to put a bit more effort into the PC port.  This is barely a usable PC port.\n\nThe game itself is at best a 2D+ platformer with open 3D combat areas, the rails I mentioned earlier are so narrow that you might as well be on a side scroller. There appears to be only 1 real way to do any of the "puzzles".  I hesitate to call them that because at each handhold, the next jump location is highlighted so you can't miss it.  As you jump, camera control is taken from you and rotated so many times during the climb/jump sequences that it is beyond annoying.\n\nThe climbing platform sections require 0 (ZERO) ability and are just an exercise in button mashing.  That huge fall below you is actually not a problem because falling wasn't programmed in, you'll just hang on the side of a burning, exploding ship while you make a sandwich...seriously.\n\nBut you're a crazy hopping climbing monkey right, that's cool - when chicky gets ahead of you up some stairs, you can just jump and catch up!  NOPE.  You have to run around and WALK UP THE FRAKKING  STAIRS.  You're not allowed to jump unless they say you're allowed to jump.  WTF.  That's the silliest thing I encountered, you can't even jump when you want to on a jumping monkey character.\n\nYou'll also be doing plenty of jumping with chicky riding on your back.  Yes, it's teenage wish fulfillment hour:  the helpless girl climbs onboard while you save her.  The sheer number of rearend screenshots I just encountered while looking at other reviews is just sad.

There are moments early on that make you feel resentful for being forced into a caretaker roll on an "escort mission," but that is an important part of the story telling.\n\nAs the game progresses you start to forget that you are a slave, you become attached to the one who holds your life in their hands, you are afraid of harm beffaling the one person who has taken your freedom, and you choose to be the guardian. This is organic story telling that to some gamers not having choises or playing a linier game takes away the feeling of exploration and freedom.\n\nWhile being a linear game, it does lead one event to another in a fluid and imersive progression.  I would place this game high on a pedastal for the concept alone, and the concept came together in a perfectly voice acted, immersive engrosing story with some of the most mature content in any game I have ever played. This game tells a story of genocide, slavery, the cost of freedome, the fear of isolation, and Stockholm syndrom.\n\nIt is by far the most original game that has come out in a very long time, and that made so many gamers over look a game that should be in every gamers library.","October 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After near 6hrs of playing though, I'm sooooo bored with it and sick, too (literally, camera movements in this game made me sick. Like I physically wanted to throw up, not metaphorically). But let's begin from the top:\n\nENSLAVED has beautiful graphics, maybe tiny bit too colorful, but still beautiful. Scenery looks awesome, made me stop at times and just look around. That's judging from moments when I had a chance to actually look at it, before camera made me sick by defying me.\n\nI like game music, but not from this game. I really pay attention to BGM, when I watch anime or movie or play a game. When some real thing goes on out there, I think to myself "boy, I've got to get this OST". But i REALLY don't have anything to say about music in this game. Like it doesn't exist. No memory of it whatsoever. Doesn't stand out at all, all i remember is that it was there. Maybe it's all got to do with me getting sick after 10 minutes into every game session.\n\nGameplay is boring. BOOOORING. I'm actually amazed I put up with it for 6 hours. I just ran around half the time or jumped around the other half - and from one "jump spot" to another. All jump points are pre-determined, so you can't catually choose where to jump. You can jump back or forth or sometimes out of the way to collect one of these tech orbs. BTW, wth is a tech orb? Is it edible?!? I understand money is of no value in a post-apocalyptic world, but I could be made to collect food or soda cans for the girl so she could pump up our muscles (or reflexes, or stick), out of gratitude, or something along those lines. But not tech orbs. How does she do that "upgrading", by the way, is beyond me.\n\nThis is probably good time to write what actually made me sick. One of two things is, when I ran around, sometimes camera got pinned to the wall, instead of being 3 meters off my back, and when I got close to the point, where it was pinned, it moved uncontrollably and made the world spin. Fast. And randomly. The other thing is, when I climbed up or down, camera didn't let me observe environment, even the immediate vicinity. I moved it left and released controller, and it would brutally, with donkey's stubborness reposition itself, centered on my character's butt. It's as it would say "NO, YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S AROUND YOU, THAT'S IRRELEVANT, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS NEXT JUMP POINT INSTEAD SO YOU WON'T FALL, I WILL MAKE ALL OF THEM BLINK SO EVEN MORE OF REALISM IS GONE". I'm used to RPG's, where I go anywhere I want, I'm used to FPP's where I point camera wherever I want, so this repeated deprivation of camera control is just plain ANNOYING! And it makes me sick. Really. People with epilepsy should never play this game. No one should, actually, but maybe that's just my irritation speaking.\n\nOh, and there's fights. They're easy. REALLY. All those bots are just minor obstacle to another set of running or jumping or climbing or maybe gliding on that glowing thing, occasionally. When some bot charges at me, I just charge at it too, and I strike first, 90% of the time. Sometimes there were mini-bossess I needed to put down in a different manner, meaning repeat some sequence of actions 3 or more times until it's down. That's all. It's just tedious. Felt like I put down 10 or 15 normal bots in a row.\n\nThere's also many weap..... wait... no, there isn't. Just fists and stick, 6 hours into the game, and judging by options the Trip Shop has, there aren't any more than this. So you run around, pick up TECH POINTS and somehow your reflexes, stick power or health or other things get better, when you buy their respective upgrades from the girl (GOD, she's almost almighty, isn't she). Shop is also bugged and reeks of console, but that's just minor annoyance I could catually live with.\n\nAnyway, all your running and jumping is interluded by neat cutscenes, which made me think of something:\nThis game should be made a movie. Seriously. I mean, instead of being the game. Make it a movie, like PIXAR. Or 12-episodes-long anime series. Remove running around for TECH ORBS (because that's silly, frankly), throw in some mini-boss battles, instead of having players bludgeoning them with a stick, and that's it. I'd be first to buy the BD disc.\n\nAll in all, it's one of these games that made me not care how it ends. Big disappointment. I bought it on a discount, so I'm not really feeling ripped off. Maybe I will have my nephew beat it in my stead, when he gets older. Mind you, I've played only 6 hours (by my standards this is really long, for a game that has only visuals as its PROS).","November 18, 2014","false","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It isn't even remotely optimized for PC, which causes quite a lot of stuttering/freezing/etc. On top of this, there are some show-stopping bugs as a result of poor implementation.\n\nFor example, there's a wall in Chapter 3 that is supposed to broken by an enemy to allow you to proceed through the passage after defeating it, but if you happen to be playing on Low graphical settings, the wall won't break because the physics are turned off on that graphics setting. Seriously. You have to change the settings and reload the game (which forces you to lose progress due to the checkpoint system) in order to proceed! The only reason I even knew about the workaround was because I googled it after restarting the game a few times to no avail.\n\nIn addition, the mouse support is pretty terrible. Half the time, clicking things in menus doesn't do anything. You'll definitely want to use a gamepad, which the game actually supports quite well.\n\nBottom Line: Do yourself a huge favor and pick up the console version, even if it's cheaper on Steam. You'll be SO glad you did, because this game is well worth playing as it was intended.

There were two key issues.\n1) The camera kept switching from a trailing 3rd person perspective like most FPS's, to odd angles at other times, which often made it difficult to control where the character was going, when you are trying to move forward, but suddenly the camera angle snaps 130 degrees, and you are going left.\n\n2) You are typically locked to a single path you can take, But the level appears to have many paths.  Sections of the terrain that your character *should* be able to use, are not usable.  This also makes it confusing when it should be an easy path to your goal, but you can't get there because you can't use your normal abilities here.

You basically mash buttons until your enemy dies.\n- The story made me want to keep playing, but towards the ending it becomes a bit predictable.\n- Upgrades don't have much variety, if you don't pick the combat and health ones, you're doing it wrong\n- Very little character growth throughout the story, there's a supposed love developing between the characters but there's never any payoff\n\n\nIn depth:\nI actually started out liking this game, but as I played it began to wear on me.\n\nI am not a fan of story driven games that makes you explore to find power-ups, it not only slows things down, but it also kills any sense of immersion that was developing.  Exciting things were happening in game, and I was constantly behind them because I was still looking for power-ups.  A player should be encouraged to role-play while they game, not to climb every ♥♥♥♥ing cliff to find a glowy sphere.  If you need to put that ♥♥♥♥ in the game, have a section of the game where the action stops, and the player is encouraged to explore an area for an in-game reason.  Most of the time I can forgive this type of thing, however, this game had a ridiculous amount of spheres that could be easily seen and climbed to as you progressed.  As the game went on, I found myself annoyed because I was climbing some wall to get a sphere while my companion was yelling for help or taking cover even though she was in no real danger.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was the character arcs.  The relationship between the protagonist and his captor did not really go anywhere (at least not on screen).  You get the sense that they cared for each other, but nothing ever really came of it.\n\nI will say, however, there were some very good looking scenery pieces that made me stop and admire.  The setting, landscapes, and feel of the post-apocalyptic wasteland is probably the best feature of this game.\n\nOverall, there are better action/adventure games than this one.  I would stay clear of this one unless it's on-sale for really cheap.  But even then, I didn't finish the game with a satisfied feeling.  I could have overlooked the sub-par gameplay if the story elements had played out better.  I understand why the game never got any sequels.","December 3, 2014","false","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have spent more time editing the .ini files than playing the game (which isn't much time, really) and am now giving up trying to make it functional.  At one point I was asked to press and hold a button which does not work (middle mouse button); went to change the binding in the options menu so that I could comply and discovered that bindings cannot be changed during gameplay, only from the main menu.  This prompted the loss of about fifteen minutes of gameplay which is unfortunate, but fine if it means I can have a good gameplay experience.  It happens.

You basically mash buttons until your enemy dies.\n- The story made me want to keep playing, but towards the ending it becomes a bit predictable.\n- Upgrades don't have much variety, if you don't pick the combat and health ones, you're doing it wrong\n- Very little character growth throughout the story, there's a supposed love developing between the characters but there's never any payoff\n\n\nIn depth:\nI actually started out liking this game, but as I played it began to wear on me.\n\nI am not a fan of story driven games that makes you explore to find power-ups, it not only slows things down, but it also kills any sense of immersion that was developing.  Exciting things were happening in game, and I was constantly behind them because I was still looking for power-ups.  A player should be encouraged to role-play while they game, not to climb every ♥♥♥♥ing cliff to find a glowy sphere.  If you need to put that ♥♥♥♥ in the game, have a section of the game where the action stops, and the player is encouraged to explore an area for an in-game reason.  Most of the time I can forgive this type of thing, however, this game had a ridiculous amount of spheres that could be easily seen and climbed to as you progressed.  As the game went on, I found myself annoyed because I was climbing some wall to get a sphere while my companion was yelling for help or taking cover even though she was in no real danger.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me was the character arcs.  The relationship between the protagonist and his captor did not really go anywhere (at least not on screen).  You get the sense that they cared for each other, but nothing ever really came of it.\n\nI will say, however, there were some very good looking scenery pieces that made me stop and admire.  The setting, landscapes, and feel of the post-apocalyptic wasteland is probably the best feature of this game.\n\nOverall, there are better action/adventure games than this one.  I would stay clear of this one unless it's on-sale for really cheap.  But even then, I didn't finish the game with a satisfied feeling.  I could have overlooked the sub-par gameplay if the story elements had played out better.  I understand why the game never got any sequels.","December 3, 2014","false","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The storyline is exciting, the graphics are beautiful, the voice acting (particularly that by Andy Serkis, but yes, in general) is fantastic. It's also exciting to know that I'm playing as a character who was mocapped by Andy Serkis. However.\n\nThis is the one of the worst, and laziest, PC ports imaginable. There are game-breaking bugs throughout the game, the kind that require a walkthrough to find a workaround; and I'm not even to the end of it yet. If you can get it for console instead of PC, I strongly recommend that. However, I would not spend more than five dollars on the PC port. Video handling is atrocious, graphics are much too tightly bound to the same system as controls, and throughout the game, you will face no greater enemy than the freakin' camera angle. It felt worse than DIstrict 9. There were cases where Monkey (that's your hero) would attack at angles that had nothing to do with anything, exposing you to getting torn to shreds by a bunch of otherwise-trivial robots. There were cases in which the camera angle rotated literally 180 degrees, and it took me thirty seconds to figure out how to cross an otherwise insignificant bridge because he kept turning around halfway. There are controller instructions that make zero sense for a mouse and keyboard (I'm still trying to figure out where "X" and "B" are.) Perhaps most obnoxiously, whoever did game-camera direction seemed to think they were making a major motion picture instead of a game, because a lot of the angles serve literally no purpose other than trying to make you look cool. (While dying, evidently.)\n\nAnd let's not forget the on-again-off-again problems with the scripted AI. There are many occasions in which a plot-essential event won't occur because a character has stopped in the middle of the floor, instead of completing their scripted action. The game's save mechanism is pretty much identical to Price of Persia's, except I'm not aware of any cue that appears when I get to a checkpoint. (If you've played "Ghostbusters" by Terminal Reality, think of that system.) So, when one of these disasters occurs, which might relate to something as tangential as your screen resolution, you have to reset to the last checkpoint and do everything again. Additionally, it's worth noting that the cut scenes cannot be skipped with the keyboard, to my knowledge.\n\nSerkis deserves better than this.\n\nIt takes a lot to make me recommend a console over PC, but in this case, it is your better bet. I recommend at least having a controller around, and I do not recommend picking it up for the list price of $20.00; this product is unfinished. Wait to get it on sale, or grab the older version for Playstation. I have little faith that the releaser is making any further updates to the port.","November 16, 2014","false","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZergCerebrate/recommended/245280/","ZergCerebrate","ZCerebrate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZergCerebrate/","352 products in account","I gave this game a really good swing and found it a lackluster flyball in comparison to the all too positive reviews posted for it.  Nitpickingly - it's a console port to PC and there is noticable clunkiness due to that which I'll get into later (outside of displaying prompts as B or Y when the pc hotkeys would be E or F respectly).\n\nThe storyline is extremely linear and little can be said about the basis which is heavily inspired by another work (The Monkey King and Journey to the east), the character voice acting and animations (especially facial cues) were pretty spot on but overall each one left me very little to grow attached to.  I could see the obvious portryal of tropes but I found the main character too much of a masked Marty Stu which went against the backdrop of the "badass" character.  The Extras side option from the main menu called Pigsy's perfect 10 actually found more personality in the main character albeit a bit disgusting but at least humorous one than from the main protagonist.\n\nThe female protaganist Trip went to almost Navi levels of annoying at times with her nagging but overall not too bad of a partner to have through the long escort mission that is this game due to having some abilities.... but that's where gameplay comes in.\n\nThere were so many missed opportunities to do something actually interesting with this partnership dynamic that is the center of this story that the few interactions you do get to do (sticking a syringe in my neck to heal me or using holographic decoy) were far outshadowed by the problematic issues of having the funsucking job of babysitting.  Some of the clunkiness comes out in sections where you have to "throw" your partner to a platform only to have her scrambling from the ledge due to an inadequate throw - and you having to jump across on a timer in order to haul her up and save her (consequently saving you).  The problem from that example comes when the character refuses to jump in the direction of the platform which is OBVIOUS because you are playing on a keyboard without an analog stick thus having to replay sections just to do the same nonsensical event over again.  This happened throughout the playthrough at least 3x at different sections, which is why it stuck with me at all and also showed itself on time wasting "platforming" where you basically push a direction and spam the spacebar.  The last 2(?) levels out of the 14 actually started adding in "timing" for these jumps but for the majority of this game it is a complete waste of time and adds no challenge, content or fun to the game outside of padding hours played.  One of my biggest peeves "WHY CAN YOU NOT SKIP CUTSCENES OF CINEMATICS IN THIS GAME?" It's not like this was impossible to do technically in the game since you "can" skip the epilogue by clicking by mistake and bringing yo uto the then "unskippable" credit reel.  Nothing is more annoying than continuing your progress in this game the next day to be subject to the same 4 minute cinematic or if you experience a cheap death or bug (which also happened where Trip wouldn't activate a console to progress the gameplay) that you have to watch the entire cinematic over again... WHY?\n\nCombat has some positives - it's reactive there are quite a varied amount of abilities to use but it feels overtly easy at the beginning and progressively annoying at later stages.  The mechs are most annoying when shield types swarm you while you need to complete a specific objective quickly (namely the 12th, 13th and 14th stages) especially if they don't conveniently give you a "special" tactical mech in order to exploit (such as an explosive or electrical one).  This only ramps up the difficulty of the game in an unsatisfying way as you sit there repeating the "cheapest" of combos in order to overcome these encounters and stifles creativity in the encounters.  Which is what the game comes down to - the combat becomes very very repetitive as you push through it and rarely alleviated by sections where you use a cool "hover cloud" (nimbus tee hee) but as enemies and even bosses become repeated over and over again the levels all start meshing together into one "blah" experience.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the game at the start - somewhere through the game I felt extremely uninterested by what the game had to offer and found myself wandering away to other games.  I basically forced myself to finish it once I realized the general length of the game was fairly short when I saw the achievement list - and cannot find myself recommending it for the 2014 gamer.","November 19, 2014","false","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is interesting and engaging.

The game is linear - the only choices you get are in the "chasing mechs sequences" where you can take 1 out of the 2 paths (no effect on story). Everything else in the game is linear - there is only one way to progress through the level. There are some questionable mechanics - the controls are always camera based (pressing A makes Monkey run left in relation to the camera, not the actual left of the character). This wouldn't be a problem, except the game sometimes "takes over" the camera by locking it somewhere in the corner of a room etc. It's a little annoying, but not game breaking. The controls in menu or upgrade menu are not very good, if you're using a mouse and keyboard.\n\nConclusions: I still recommend the game, but I would recommend using a controller with this one.

It looks pretty and the controls are ok. Although it can be a bit clunky at times. Gameplay would be smooth if it wasn't for the haunting of the console that seems ever still present in Enslaved. There are times when it just seems like you've graduated without learning anything, or rather take on a big "boss" without any thoughts or hints on how to gain the advantage. The game will occasionally mention how to use the controls but it wont hold your hand. It's left me to guess work at times (lots of trial & error, mind you).

This is a perfect example of what developers should not do in a game.  The most powerful enemy in this game is the camera angle.  Good luck trying to get a decent view of the action or a view of the screen that doesn't completely disorient you.   And the sidekick in the game, is a huge pain in the butt.  She doesn't do anything except ask you to help her get across various obstacles and then she holds you up from completing levels.  She is like the anti-Elizabeth in BIoshock Infinite.   She will get in your way and make you hate the entire dev team for not figuring out a better way to make both of these characters act in concert.\n\nPlus, if you do buy this game, I highly suggest turning off motion blur.

I generally like to play games once they've sort of fizzled out their popularity, but I'm not sure this one was ever received well enough to be defined as popular.\n\nMy first impression, prior to playing, was that this would be a post-apocalyptic, linear exploration game. I wasn't too far off from my expectations, which would be a good thing if the game was any fun. It ends up being a poorly scripted, hack-n-slash, with bad fighting controls and an anticlimactic ending.\n\nThe graphics were decent, for the time it was released, but the cartoony and oddly shaped character designs make the realistic set pieces feel odd and out-of-place.\n\nI should mention that Andy Serkis makes a physical appearace throughout the game, and by physical, I mean "non-computer-generated", which also feels weird and out-of-place. He also does the voice of the main protagonist, "Monkey", although you'd never know it unless you check IMDb like I did. But, overall, the voice talent is pretty good, and to be honest, was enough to keep me playing.\n\nStory:\nThe story starts with some sort of large ship transporting slave-filled pods in the sky. Then the main supporting character, and love interest, breaks out of one of the pods and begins wreaking havok all over the ship by pushing buttons on computer consoles and whatnot. Then Monkey breaks out, and we have some pretty fun gameplay of him working his way through the ship in an attempt to catch up with her. The slave ship crashes into New York City and our two heroes make a narrow escape. I enjoyed this first 10-15 mins of the game. Then it gets boring and repetitive. The story takes a few odd twists that don't make sense, but for the most part is kinda straight forward. The only issues I had with the story, was that the character motivations often made no sense, and the ending was pretty lame.\n\nGameplay:\nLike I said before, the first few mins of the game are pretty fun. But overall, the gameplay turns into a weird combination of stealth & hack-n-slash, and becomes incredibly repetitive and boring.\n\nControls:\nThe controls weren't terrible. The game is definitely playable. But the issue I had with controls was 2 things: fighting and navigating (whch is the whole game).\nThe fighting controls were so simplistic. They didn't even bother to include some sort of combo system. There're upgrades you can purchase, but they don't improve anything noticible, and I ended up using all of mine to make my health last longer.\nThe navigating would get pretty frustrating, especially when trying to move quickly. There's a weird "sweet-spot" you have to find when approaching ladders, and ledges, for some reason.\n\nOverall:\nSo overall, I would not recommend this game, simply because it's not very much fun. I suppose if you were to play it over long stretches of time, for example: you play for an hour and then come back to it a week later and play another hour (rinse, repeat), I suppose it wouldn't feel so monotonous. But if one were to do that, they'd have a hard time remembering what their characters were doing, and why, when they return to the game. So, unfortunately, this game falls short in the fun catagory. But, it might be worth checking out if you're an Andy Serkis fan or something, because the acting is decent.","August 19, 2015","false","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's mainly conveyed in cutscenes. Pigsy was the cringiest character of all time and Trip was little more than a sex object.

The company didn't bother to even change a splash screen about the autosave to read "Please don't turn off the console when you see this symbol". I purchased it in a humble bundle and that is probably the only way I would recomend this to someone. In order to edit the graphic settings you have to go into an ini file and set it to read only to counteract horrible shadow banding in the cut scenes.\n\nOverall the game looks and runs nicely, I did run into some issues however since I was using the mouse controls. There was this one point in the tutorial where it freezes the screen and gives instructions on how to use a move, if you are using a keyboard and mouse (at least for me) it pops your mouse out and renders you unable to do the combo to unfreeze the game. I got around this by setting up DS3 and using a PS3 controller, I am sure you could probably get around this by setting your keys off your mouse or something. For the graphics after some ini editing the game starts to look amazing and you can tell the devs put a lot of effort into it. However the cut scenes in the game are probably the worst garbage I have ever seen, they look worse than the gameplay and are horribly pixelated. I had heard that it is because of some of the limitations for the XBox One... they are really bad.\n\nThe story was nice, Pigsy was awesome! The one thing that I found very annoying though was the trip lock scenes (where the camera would just focus on her). When you boost her to places you don't need to see her little booty bump when she stands up, just keep the camera on monkey and the gameplay seemless. The Trip "Let me scan this" real quick is completely over-used, it should have been introduced and then just have a live update while you are playing the game saying "I found some mechs!". The last annoying thing was when the mechs call for re-enforcements, they give a cutscene for that however it interupts what you are doing (say blocking) and allows the mechs to finish their action, in other words you can die in this cutscene which is completely un-needed.\n\nThe game was fairly easy with the hardest part in the game not being a boss, but this part with the windmill where you defend wave after wave which was a bit confusing. Defending the leg power things later in the game too HAD to be bugged, they were literally ignoring me which allowed me to kill them REALLY fast even when they had shields because I could just walk behind them.\n\nOverall though I would say get it on console if you have a choice, if not wait for it to be dirt cheap and pick it up.","August 12, 2015","false","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Andy Serkis had a big part in the voice acting and motion capture performance, and you can really see it. But when it comes to actual gameplay, it's not that great.\nThe enemies are very repetitive and the controls on the PC are really wonky. You can tell the controls are meant to be used on a console and the PC port wasn't super smooth. There was one move that I leveled up and couldn't use because the instructions for it were for an XBOX controller. .\nGetting around consists a lot of jumping from ledge to ledge, which is cool in the beginning but it gets old. you can only jump off specific ledges, and plenty of times you can't jump off a simple small ledge because you can only jump from certain spots. The exception to this is the "cloud" which is like an air surfing thingimajig, and it's pretty cool, but you only use it in certain spots, and also it's hard to use.\nHonestly, this is a really beautiful-looking game. If you just want to play it for the art, I recommend just playing it on easy. There's no real point in challenging yourself with this game. Personally, what kept me going was that I wanted to see what happened in the end, and mostly I just wanted to get it over with.","December 30, 2015","false","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfbeast71/recommended/245280/","wolfbeast71","Wolfbeast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfbeast71/","149 products in account","Kind of a mixed bag in this game. On the plus side: it looks nice, it's atmospheric and has good acting. On the negative side: the story is kind of thin, the controls are really awkward (very, very much to blame there is the fact it's a direct console port, with no regard for PC controls).\n\nWhat breaks everything for me though is constantly having to fight the camera. Sure, having certain angles makes things more "cinematic" like but it really isn't conducive to smooth gameplay if you are at the mercy of odd, switching camera angles that can hit you often at the most inopportune moments. I've lost progress several times just because of that - having to play through the same part of the story (without being able to skip cutscenes) just because the gamemakers decided to sharply rotate (requiring directional adjustment) or completely swap camera angle in high-action spots ruins the game. It's a common mistake made in these kinds of games, unfortunately.\n\nOverall? A mediocre, linear platformer with awkward controls, not offset enough by a story but with nice visuals makes this a game that could be enjoyable to watch someone else play (who already knows what to expect) but not to play yourself. It's a decent buy if you can get a big discount on it and don't mind some frustration, but certainly not being worth the full price.","November 12, 2014","false","3.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vhmz/recommended/245280/","vhmz","#FAIAA EMBUREM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vhmz/","526 products in account","Enslaved is a mostly overlooked game by the developer Ninja Theory, the same guys who later went on to make the controversial reimagining of the Devil May Cry franchice "DmC".\n\nIt takes its inspiration from a classic Chinese novel, but places it in a post apocalyptic American setting. The premise is certainly intriguing, but the game is in my opinion held back by its weird gameplay decisions and annoying AI characters.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix between Gears of War style cover based shooting and Prince of Persia style platforming sections. It also has some melee combat for good measure. Enslaved pretty much mixes and matches different elements from different inspirations, but these elements really lack dept. Combat boils down to tapping a few different attack buttons and rolling away, while the platforming sections work with a context sensitive "platforming" button. You can complete pretty much 90% of all the platforming by just pressing up on the analog stick and mashing the platforming button. Probably the most refined thing is the cover based shooter mechanic, but it is also the one that feels the most out of place for this type of game.\n\nThe game is also totally relient on your AI partner characters, and the experience is very much on rails. You always have a partner character yelling instructions at you. This really makes the game feel like you are just a dumb monkey following instructions rather than figuring out stuff for yourself, which is ironic, because in the story you actually are ENSLAVED (get it!?!) by another person and have to follow his orders.\n\nA lot of the game areas are decayed versions of actual American landmarks, and that might be memorable if you are American and patriotic or just generally like cool looking video game levels, but I kind of just breezed through all that not giving it much thought. The visuals of the game are very good and especially the character animations during combat look impactful. It looks like a decent PS3/XB360 era game. I had some minor problems with the shadows, but they might have been caused by some graphics card driver incompatibility rather than the game itself.\n\nIn the end I would probably not recommend Enslaved. It's an interesting game, but more so in a bad way. It has some bizzare gameplay elements that really don't work together and the AI character nagging and the blatant linearity of the game is annoying in an interesting fashion. If you really want to see Prince of Persia and Gears of War come together in an interesting game setting you might want to give this a shot, but the probability of anyone wanting that is quite low.","July 1, 2014","false","8.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

If you haven't guessed by the oringinal names the two main characters of Enslaved don't have much going on in the personallity department. I can agree with some of the reviews who say the color palet in this game is  colorful, but the boring enviroments in Enslaved overshadow any pretty paint. The combat in this game is bad, and add to that the one dimesnsional chatacter(yes this isn't me leaving out an s) you get a game that is a real misery to play. Now lets get to some of the annoying mechanics of this game. First is the constant orders from Trip after you are already doing what is require to progress. In additon Monkey can only jump off platforms on occasion, and only from very specific spot, so if you make a mistake you usually have to take the long way around instead of being able to jump back down. I also find it pretty nice how you will be running or walking and get stuck on an invisible objects in a wide clear path.

It is an amazing science fiction romp with great graphics, acting, music and a fantastic plot. Unforntunately, what kills it for me is the fact when climbing with Monkey, you get stuck a LOT on the "corner pipes", not being able to simply jump to the next pipe within reach right on the other side of the bend. This has happened to me countless times. Yes, after several playthroughs, sitting through cutscenes, battling multiple enemies, and other monotany and to get stuck and having to restart multiple times until the glitch lets up and finally lets you jump to the next pipe in order to progress, it gets extremely tedious. They should have fixed this issue a long time ago, and according to the forums, it happens to a LOT of people. Such a damn shame, because the game is so damn good besides this, but for this one simple glitch that could have been remedied, causing multiple restarts and sometimes nearly hours of setbacks rather than progessing because of a stupid jump to another pipe, I can't recommend it. FYI, I have tried getting past these points both with and without a controller, and it has made no difference for me, it will only jump when the game mysteriously "allows" it. I will change this review if it is ever fixed.","August 18, 2014","false","5.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I really did. However, I've never come across a port which makes a game so frustratingly unplayable.\n\nAt first it had everything I'd normally love in a game - Breaktaking visuals, a gripping plot from the beginning and a feeling of freedom and fluidity in the movement and combat which is great (despite linear pathing and encounters). Also some of the best voice acting I've come across from a game in a while. The thing that lets it down is the actual 'game' part of it.\n\nAs many people here have mentioned, this is a port from the xbox. After half an hour of playing around with the mouse sensitivity controls, I accepted that it didn't have a setting which made it usable. A slight twitch and you're aiming the other side of the area, but somehow the mechs still run faster than your deaccelerated aim mode, making the turret sections frustratingly difficult. Further than this, the camera controls have a life of their own and you'll be fighting for control the entire time while being ripped apart by the enemies. Combine this with long checkpoint respawns and having to run around to the ends of the map every time to collect the tech orbs for an ultimate grind.\n\nOn top of this the port has a number of unpatched bugs, which left me stranded on a pole on the side of the building, unable to jump around a corner no matter what I try or how many times I reloaded (still not sure how I made it past after 30 minutes). The developers didn't even update the control guidelines for the PC, so every time I learned I new move, I had to minimise the game to google the equivilent PC controls.\n\nConclusion:\nSeems like it could be a great game on the xbox. However, worst port of any game I've ever come across onto PC, making the game unplayable, frustrating and hindered by gamebreaking bugs.

It does not have any options for Key or Mouse bindings, and as such if your Input device doesn't have, say a Middle-Mouse button for instance, you simply cannot play.\n\nOn top of that, the game assumes that you have an Analog stick to constantly reorient the camera. There are no camera controls for K+M or other Input devices. As such, the camera gets stuck at a weird angle making platform jumping and combat difficult at best, and at worst makes you nauesous as it constantly spins around.\n\nI shouldn't have expected anything more than a sub-par Console port from Namco Bandai (they are as bad as Capcom). The Japanese are so rigid (and outdated) in their thinking that PC gaming nothing more than an afterthought, and simply cannot fathom why anyone would play a game with something other than a Console controller even when their business depends upon it.\n\nIf you game with a Console controller then Y.M.M.V.","January 4, 2015","false","6.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It just sad that it didn't find it's way to the spotlight, and therefor a sequel seems an impossibility. I'm so glad it made it's way to PC.\n\nWith brilliant motion capture from actors like Andy Serkis (Gollum - Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit Trilogies), the emotions from the characters are very believable, and make your actions that much more meaningful. Great visuals and a fantastic soundtrack add to the story even moreso. The gameplay is great fun, with acrobatic elements and teamwork between Monkey and Trip, meaning a good blend between action and environmental puzzles, which can also come into play during combat, which is a great stress reliever with epic finishing moves and great sound engineering to enhance those "smashy" sounds.\n\nThe only place that the game fell short for me was the staff's "aim and fire" feature, although this is only required in a few points of the game, so you won't have to rely on it. That, and sometimes the game would have trouble realising which object to whilst making use of acrobatics; although almost every game with this kind of "play" has this issue, so it's quick to learn how to minimalise it with certain camera angling and/or stick pushing.\n\nA unique and moving game I strongly recommend to those who love a good story, but still like to smash some robots in the face.","August 9, 2015","true","6.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is one of my favorite games.......on the PS3 that is!  The story is great.  The characters are great.  This game was really developed for the PS3, not the PC.  You can tell they put very little effort into the PC version.  For the PC, the camera is terrible, the controls are terrible, the screen will jump all over the place, etc.  I really do not recommend the PC version of this game.  I do, however, highly recommend the PS3 version of this game.  Also, in the early part of Chapter 2, you will get stuck. Trip will lower a bridge but the other side is stuck.  Monkey climbs around to the other side, however, there is one part where he needs to jump from a pipe to a wall and it just doesn't happen.  I've tried everything, from exiting and restarting, to replaying the chapter many times, to exploring first before climbing, and I always get stuck at the same place and just can't go any further.  So, no, I would definitely not recommend the PC version of this game but if you have a PS3 then absolutely get it!","June 13, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The pair agree a deal to work together to reunite Trip with her people which while forming part of most of the beginning levels is just a rue for yet another AI romance forged through hardship and toil.\n\nAs for the game aspect their is none, its all go their do this, do that and repeat, repeat, repeat. You get to collect orbs along the way for upgrade purposes but sadly they feel nothing more than a downgrading of skill level rather than a souping up of arsenal which isnt that diverse to begin with.\n\nAll in all i was unimpressed and find it hard to recommend this game on any point, even when going cheap in a steam sale so its a thumbs down for me this time","September 14, 2014","false","16.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

The aiming... , thank god the aiming reticule goes red when I am on target, because otherwise I would be lining every shot up for 20 minutes.\n\nThe most memorable part of the game was the first chase scene, because I died a lot - A LOT! and I did not even know you could skip the long cutscene that immideatly follows the previous checkpoint. Apparently they never felt the need to tell us you can skip cutscenes. BACKSPACE is the key that allows you to SKIP CUTSCENES folks. That combined with some bad decisions in the upgrade tree from my part (went everything into armor thinking it would keep me alive longer) made combat a nightmare made me curse out loud I closed the game because it made me angry and filled me with regret for buying this game, so I can't really reccomend this to other people.\n\nDon't buy it - unless you like console ports and have massochistic tendencies - if you do buy it - play on the easiest difficult and upgrade your stun capabilities.","July 5, 2014","false","9.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It's an unplayable game for PC version if you're a left handed. It was difficulty to configure key bindings, because its' screen kept moving and blinking lights to distract you, and you couldn't point to certain keys in the configuration, so you had to move mouse further up to point them. Even arrow keys didn't work in the configuration. I did keyboard somersault or almost trial and error to get it configured. Then you were ready for game, you had to watch a movie, once it was done, then you could play, but you found you can't jump. It said you need to use MouseY (I still have no idea what it is) to jump. I did experiment everything on my mouse, nothing worked. I went back to option, but key bindings wasn't there, so you had to go to main menu to lose saving progress. I repeated configuring, watching the same movie, it kept scrambling my key bindings. I found that some people have the same problems. I think it originally was designed for XBox or PS3 or both, not PC, they didn't bother much to fix for PC version. We need PC police to inspect games before they can sell.","July 18, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Yes the game looks good for the most part, but the story is pretty weak as 80% of the game is jumping from predetermined spots doing acrobatic tricks, that you really cant fail. You spend your time watching your character jump around than anything else, when your not doing that your watching cut scenes, then small fight here and there.

It was a really refreshing and fun experience. The gameplay isn't anything really new or exciting, but the story and scenery make up for it. I have always liked post-apocalyptic themes, and this game really gets it right. Some people have complained about it's last-generation graphics, but for me it didn't really have a factor in how cool the setting is. I didn't actually realize that the graphics were outdated until someone pointed it out in the community hub. I was interested through the entire game, and there are several really exciting boss battles. I felt like a total badass destroying gigantic war mechs with just a staff. Nobody I know has played, or even heard of this game, which is kind of sad considering the high quality of it. It took my 7 hours to complete the game. I played with controller, I didn't try keyboard/mouse controls. Thumbs up.","November 21, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dialogue and interactions between Monkey and Trip as their friendship/enslavedment progresses is entertaining and well written with not a lot of cheesy cringeworthy ENGRISH dialogue or moments.\n\nThere's a decent amount of variety in combat, enemies, level design and puzzles to keep you entertained for a while throughout the action packed story. Voice acting is top notch as are Monkey's movement and animations, however most of this kinda goes downhill and stale towards the last 2 hours of the game and the lackluster ending.\n\nThe game will sometimes confuse you with its fixed camera angles during certain moments while you climb in order to force a certain perspective or view of the scenery which is quite nice, however this can be a little jarring for the player when they're trying to execute certain jumps in a certain direction. Luckily the climbing and movement for the most part is relatively easy and smooth, with little option to drop to your death.\n\nFiring and combat mechanics do get a little repetitive after a while throughout the game, but every once in a while a puzzle or action sequence is introduced to keep things interesting.\n\nAs I said, the final 2 hours of the game and the ending are somewhat lackluster, predictable and practically open ended considering the ride you just went through.\n\nBut all things considered, 7.5/10.","December 1, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It happened to me four times. Fortunately, it crashes *after* saving your chapter completion. But it's still annoying.\n\nSo why did I like it ? The visual are real nice. The post-apo world has its own identity, the feeling of having survivors tracked by relentless mechs, slavers. I actually enjoyed the two main characters. They are cute on their own, strange way.\nThe game is built like you would watch an action movie. The story unfolds, you are going through it. Objectives on timer are probably the most entertaining because you have to do it fast. Combat against bosses is also entertaining because you never have to simply bash through a bag of hitpoints (you actually can't defeat them that way), there is always something to defeat them, strengthening the "action movie" aspect.\n\nThe story is finally well summarized by the title : a journey to the west. Which is a promise to find answer, or to get revenge, to give sense to all of this.\n\nIt's good entertainment while not stellar. If you can grab it at a low price, on sale, it's worthy.","July 8, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really have no idea why this game  performed poorly sales wise. The only thing I can think of is that it was inadequately promoted – Namco Bandai pretty much acknowledge that too.\n\nAnyway don't let the fact that you heard little about it put you off - I can tell you it really is a great game - one of the best games I have ever played IMHO.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=278516371\n\nThe game was loosely based on a Chinese Novel but differs from the the original story which set a fantasy version of ancient China, to a post-apocalyptic world some 150 years in the future where human existence is sparse and hard. Only scattered residues of humanity remain but left over war-mechs roam the land, still active from the previous global conflict. The plot revolves around Trip (Tripitaka) a captured slave (and tech wizard) who forces the help and protection of a warrior type 'Monkey', who himself is enslaved. They both escape a sabotaged slaver air-ship and 'Monkey' the protagonist you play as, quickly finds himself at the mercy and control of Trip. Incidentally 'Monkey' is excellently voiced and performed by Andy Serkis (of Gollum fame) who was also Performance Director on the project. In fact all characters in this game are outstandingly portrayed and consequently very believable, this adds to the immersion of the game and story.\n\nAnyhow, you discover Trip is wanting to return to her remote community and requires nay needs Monkey's help to get her there. There's an important twist here, as Monkey, you have little choice in the matter - you can discover the detail of why for yourself – and you are tied to her in an interesting way. You find that you often have to piggy back her to difficult to reach places and physically throw her to ledges and across gaps. Its sounds strange but its actually a neat mechanic. My small beef was there ought to have been even more requirement to control and this would have enhanced the experience and tightened the relationship you have with them as characters. I would also have preferred that you could have had an extended command structure both ways but like I said it is a minor niggle.\n\nThe fight mechanism is quite extensive and there were many ways I found to complete tasks and defeat enemies and the overall feel was rewarding and that goes for the Boss Fights too. While the story and scope to explore is limited it never really felt that way as in certain areas you had quite a bit of freedom to do things in your own style. Anyway visually, its great to look at too and all movement and animations are solid and fluid. For me, after only a short while you easily get to grow to like these characters and there's a real affinity you get for each of the characters plight.\n\nI highly recommend this game and if you happen to see it in Steam Sales, I suggest you get it. I'm sure you wont be disappointed!","November 11, 2014","true","75.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a console port, so there was some .ini editing (resolution, shadow, AA, Aniso and such either not available in menus or don't stick when set) and PC trickery to be done (D3DOverrider for Vsync), but once that's done, it's a beautiful, brilliantly crafted game.

And sometimes the controls not responsive. Sometimes i would be in a fight and try to run and my analogue\nstick ( i use a xbox controller ) would not respond for a second.\n\nMy other problem, is more with the climbing, which this game relies on heavily, they do highlight the polls, and some climbable objects,\nbut not all of them. They also do not highlight them too well, its a shiny effect type of thing from the original uncharted. I wish they would\nhave used a eagal vision type of thing.\n\nMy third, very minor, nit pick problems are the camera angles change your controls sometimes, this also happens in DmC: Devil May Cry, which i\nsee as a more analogue comparison, seeing as Ninja theory made both. The pre-rendered cutsenes look like they were made with 3d software from 1999, and\nrendered to a gif. Also sometimes the animations arnt very smooth, this isn't usually a problem until the game makes you zoom into your 'AI partner' ( not really\nan AI partner, more of a highly scripted partner ) and you see the animations up close.\n\nWhat i like about it...\n\nThis game has deep characters, which i think Ninja Theory actually dose very well. Their seems to be a character arch, but seeing as im\nonly on chapter 9, i cant tell you how it ends.\n\nThe world they created is interesting, and i want to find out where it ends. As much as they chalk up to 'Video Games' AKA a magic hoverboard that only works sometimes,\nit all works within the story, and they are very good at propositioning my questions, such as 'why dose that only work here'.\n\nThe Story is good, no spoilers.\n\nOverall, I usually don't finish games, I actually might finish this one.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter finishing this game at 8 hours, i want to say, i still agree, with my earler review, the boss fights can be frustrating when they make you jump around, and the story is OMG worth it.","June 28, 2014","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spectacular cinematics, most beautiful environment ever encountered in a game, breathtaking (literally!) acrobatics, instantly likeable and believable characters, stunning acting and voiceovers - everything about this game is amazing, stunning and awesometastic :D I was impressed so much that I actually bought a hardcopy collector's edition *after* I played the steam version, it's THAT good.\n\nThe only minor drawback is the issue with some cameras fighting you for the best viewing angle, but it is not happening often, and never in vital points. Autosave does a great job in letting you restart the failed bit right where you dropped it, cut scenes are letting the story flow very naturally, autoplatforming does its job, you are here to aid Monkey in his awesome jumping and climbing, not in figuring out where to place your hands next, most of the times. How many times have you encountered a game in which the characters are out of breath and panting when speak right after fighting off a hoard of mechs or jumping their way over an abyss almost falling down while doing so?\n\n10/10 in my book, would totally play a sequel/prequel/spinoff, just put Monkey in it and let me watch him swing from one ledge to another for another 15 hours or so, the longer the better.

In fact, it's what kept me playing even when the rest started to become a little tedious. The post-apocalyptic setting is well done with some nice locales mixed in.\n\nUnfortunately, those were the only outstanding aspects to me. The rest was just mediocre. The combat, while moderately challenging on hard, is very barebones. It has a very basic moveset that doesn't get expanded upon very much. That means that you're stuck with the same 3 attacks (light, heavy, aoe) for the most part. It could've used a more fleshed out skill progression system where you actually unlock new stuff to do. What makes the combat worse is the lack of enemy variety. There are 4 enemy types that get thrown at you and that's pretty much it. The 2 bosses that get recycled over and over again throughout the game don't help much either. It's not like there wasn't enough room to be creative, since the enemy are supposed to be mechs of all kinds and sizes.\n\nThe "platforming", while cool to look at, didn't contribute much to the gameplay. It's basically climbing and parkour stuff along a very streamlined path with 0 danger of failure. I didn't mind this very much, but it could definitely have been more.\n\nI still recommend this since I enjoyed the overall experience, but only at a discount (picked it up for 5€).","November 15, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At €5 that's like 1 euro per hour, you dont get that kind price per hour per entertainment from a dvd even.\nThe story alone is worth it, the gameplay itself is little more than azura's wrath-style 'press-the-button-when-we-tell-you-to" but this post-apocalyptic visually stunning  story-drive interactive animated movie with strong and well-designed characters dint bore me for a second. A very heroic hero, a sexy 29 year old pretending to be a teenage girl. Self-sacrifice, love, violence.... what more would one want.

Pros involved an interesting plot, fascinating translation of setting (compared to the original material), nuanced characters and very, VERY good performance acting (voice and motion included). The combat is repetitive, but I found it to be acceptable. My one complaint about the game would be that the world and action is far too often interrupted by small unskippable cutscenes to further the puzzle/platforming in the areas. Normal, pre-rendered or plot-based cutscenes were fine, but continually halting my gameplay just to show me where an obvious switch was or the path I needed to take to progress was got to be a bit disappointing when I was trying to enjoy the game and immerse myself.\n\nThat small negative aside, the game truly is a hidden gem. It's soulful, has a lot of heart, and will grab you within the first 10min of gameplay (if it doesn't, then maybe it isn't the game for you). Purchased this with zero expectations since I had never heard of it and was absolutely blown away by the quality of writing, production, and entertainment. While there has been multiple confirmations that there is likely to be no sequel, I strongly hope that the cult following the game has garnered might help revive the effort. Your purchase of this product will help show (hopefully) that this critically acclaimed (but commercially unsuccessful) game has not gone unnoticed, and definitely not unloved.","November 15, 2014","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is easily overlooked becasue of it's gameplay. It's a simple game with not very many mechanics, but this game takes simplicity and turns it into an adventure. As you scale walls by the handholds and hammer your way through mech after mech, you can see a world. A beautiful world with gorgeous scenery, and characters that seem almost real, they interact with each other, and develop smoothly. And that is what makes this game what it is. Moving on to the actual gameplay, the main caracter Monkey has serious acrobatic skills, which can lead to very intruiging scenes that can have your heart pounding, and combat that seems similar to Batman with some really flashy finishers for simple enemies. So to wrap it up, this game is surely worth checking out. And I highly recommend you do so.","November 15, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atrusnex/recommended/245280/","atrusnex","Noctus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atrusnex/","70 products in account","A good game. The story is pretty interesting and the characters are memorable. The world is visually attractive. The gameplay reminds me of a cross between Uncharted, meets God of War, meets the Last of Us, with a fairly timing oriented hack and slash melee combat. The climbing mechanics look almost identical to an Uncharted game, which is a good thing in my opinion. You have an upgrade system which adds a little more replayability to the game. The premium edition comes with a whole seperate story-line with completely different game mechanics to really change things up as well as some unlockable buffs to the main story.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game, would be that the controls don't seem very optimized for mouse and keyboard. They're perfectly functional as I played the entire game using only the mouse and keyboard, however the mouse acceleration is a little funky and the some of the game's context menus on give button combinations in terms of an Xbox controller rather than mouse and keyboard. If you're ok with using a controller, then you'll have no complaints however. The camera angles were the second biggest issue, with some scene forcing you into somewhat awkward camera angles which could make doing certai nthings difficult. 95% of the game however, most of the camera angles were fine in my opinion.","November 14, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lord-zor/recommended/245280/","lord-zor","Zor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lord-zor/","463 products in account","Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a nice game, and it is worth getting if you can get it, and its DLC, on sale.\n\nEnslaved is a above average game, it isn't going to change your views on action adventure, or make you obsess with the source material (it is a reimaging of Journey to the West). But it is a fun experience that is easy to get into.  The main thing holding this title back is that for everything that it does right, it also kind of does it wrong.\n\nStarting off the story for the game is a mix bag. On the positive side you have fun characters that play off each other fairly well. They have playful banter and the audio for them is good. On the negative the overall story is thin and never really explored. At best you'll have a vague idea of what is going on, why you are doing something, or what the point is. Which is a shame, since it seems like the story might have been interesting if they had bother to explain it.\n\nNext the combat for the game is enjoyable, but very simple. You have two attack buttons and two ammo types for your staff gun thingy. And after the 3rd or 4th level, you pretty much know everything that you need to know about combat in the game. That isn't to imply that there aren't specialty moves like countering, but for 95% of the encounters in the game, you can get through them with a minimal amount of effort.\n\nThe game's environments looks nice, but most levels feel too long, like the developers were trying to increase the game's length without factoring in what they would do to it quality.  This is a common problem that a lot of games have, since pacing is hard to do.  What makes this noticeable worst is the lack of challenge on most levels. With a simple combat system, and a very simple platforming system (you push jump to pretty much do everything, and there only one correct path, so can just mindlessly push jump towards the next platform most of the time) eventually enemies and puzzles become annoyances that just slow you down.\n\nIn the end, if it was only the main game, I wouldn't recommend this title to others. But what pushes it up, is one of the original DLC pieces, Pigsy's Perfect 10, which comes standard in the steam version, so I am factoring it into the review (since it is now part of the base experience).  This DLC is several hours long and focuses on the side character Pigsy. It has different gameplay (3rd person shooter), an unique story (takes place during the main game events, but before the main cast meets Pigsy), and a different overall theme from the main game (Friendship, loneness, and lost). And while the last level in it goes on for way too long, I would argue that overall it is better than the main game, and makes the ending to the main game more significant and meaningful.\n\nEnslaved: Odyssey to the West is a nice game that does some things right and some things wrong. I wouldn't say it a must play title, but if you can pick it up on sale for cheap, then you should. The overall experience from the main game and the DLC is fun, and who doesn't like having fun.","November 14, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or perhaps the story and visuals more than anything else.  The camera sucks, and fighting can get repetative but the story, the growing relationship between Monkey and Trip, the artwork...Its adictive.  I havent felt so compelled to finish a game in a long time.  I even like Monkeys acrobatics a lot.  Its pretty fun(although fairly easy) to find a way to jump, swing, and climb around all the obstacles in your path.  The game is also linear but, like I said, the story and its very fleshed out, realistic characters more than make up for any drawbacks.  There are a couple of bugs in the game but none that I didnt easily figure out how to deal with on my own.  For example, the wrecker mek in the fish tank area hit a wall and just kept running against the wall and you cannot progress until you beat him.  Easity fixed by taunting said mek before he ran for the wall.  A lot of it has to do with timing.  Anyway, I overwhelmingly recomend this game.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. Has a very likable hero, voiced by the sensational Andy Serkis. The main girl in the game is Trip, voiced by Lindsey Shaw, who is a very despicable character, but only because she's scared. In the end she does realize her flaws, and I guess Monkey forgives her because he finds he fricken attractive as hell. It's not a very long game, which is good for me since I don't have a buttload of time to keep track of a 20+ hour story in a game. The game was well made considering Ninja Theory's team on it. Some scenes feel a little empty, but all of the gameplay is lush and full of beauty. The puzzles are not overly complicated. The flaw that bugs me the most is that game holds your hand almost the whole way through, which can get a little annoying if you just want to get moving, it makes you feel a little helpless just standing there, but better than not knowing where to go/what to do. This game has the best edge grapple/jump gameplay I've ever seen. The main issues with games like Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed is that the player would randomly jump off a ledge I didn't want them to, or storm into a random direction. Enslaved is so finely programmed that I have not run into a situation where the controls were either unresponsive, or the hero went where I didn't want him to go, or jump higher/lower than I wanted him to. The combat is very fine. Unlocking abilities simply takes resources and not levels or anything. You pick up orbs to gain resources. I thought they'd feel out of place, but in game you're more focused on finding them than realizing if they ruin the scene or not.\nFor those seeking adventure and a hint of romance in a post apocalyptic paradise, look no further.\n8/10","November 16, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of those games that somehow slipped between the cracks and fell into obscurity . The main story is based on a Chinese tale and retold in a post apocalyptic setting the characters and setting are well done, not your typical brown and grey world most games of this type are set in, this one has life, you see nature retaking the world man has left behind.\n\nThe game is not without its issues though, the main one being the camera has a bad habit of not being in the best spot with no way to adjust it can become a pain. Its a minor gripe in my book but not one that was game breaking. Combat can be a bit repetitive but not to the point where it bothered me much, the interesting story is what hooked me in and kept me playing.

A lot of guides available for it. Other than that, it's a standard 3rd person brawler with an above-average story. I got it on sale for very cheap and recommend that a purchase comes under $10. Once you get past those qualms, this game can be a next-gen looking game with the right hardware, and it has a ton of fun levels. The fighting has a good amount of depth to keep it from getting boring and the enemy types and platforming sections keep it varied. The pacing is all there and the characters are well-written. I had no idea that Andy Serkis (guy that did like every CGI character since Gollum) played the main character until the end, and that makes a lot of sense.","September 2, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have a controller and mess with the game files, then there is a decent game here that’s worth playing, especially for the asking price (if these issues were fixed, then add a few points on to the final score). As it stands,  Enslaved doesn't possess the kind of polish or user interface expected from today’s games and therefore scores less than its console cousin. The cool gameplay moments and neat storytelling on offer are simply overshadowed by the negatives, and if you are stuck with the headache inducing motion blur , it's likely you'll switch the game off way before the story gathers any pace.\n\nScore 4.5/10 - Review by Robert Cram","November 26, 2013","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a minor gripe in my book but not one that was game breaking.

I mean for the scenario that I feel these things with the masks and the real pictures that look kind of a bad photocopy of matrix concept and the end disapointed me. Otherwise, execellent game.","April 10, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like uncharted but you're a Sun Wukong-type dude jumping around post-apocalyptic New York. My only issue with it is you have to mess with the settings for a bit to get it not to freeze constantly.","December 27, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing that exciting, nonetheless playable.\nCombat is fun, but the missions sometimes can feel repetitive.\nOne thing I would say is that the jumping around on walls and other objects is very Prince of Persia alike. It also has some puzzles in some parts.\nGraphics look amazing and the game scenery and design is just gorgeous.\n\nOverall I would recommend to pick this game up, if you have some bucks to spare.\nI would say it's a fun game to play while bored, but definitely not the best I've played either. I guess it's up to you to decide.","July 19, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The acting is great and has some great humor in it. Most of the combat is fairly challenging and the animation is top notch. The only problem that I had is the game console to PC control porting it’s not a very good job. There are times you hit “D” to go right it goes forward depending on which way your character is facing. The camera angles very odd also and swing in every direction and at times you can’t really tell in which way you’re going because that side is out of view, so there are time you have to do a  W, A, S, D in a circle to tell which way you’re going.","July 20, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Total play through took me 8ish hours which is good for a $5 special. I played with a controller which I'd recommend.","June 21, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, this tag says it all.\n\nInterestingly enough, the addon (free of charge) Pigsy's perfect 10 is even cooler than main game itself! There is a cool stealth/shooter mechanic, plus Pigsy has more soul than the generic a-la Gears of War guy in the main game.\n\nJust dont get me wrong - main campaign is also almost breathtaking! Again - like with Remember Me - i honestly don't see where the marketing have missed and why it is not a successful franchise in 2 or even 3 parts...","July 25, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
