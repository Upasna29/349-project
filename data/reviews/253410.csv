This game feels unfinished/unpolished and is exactly the kind of stuff that gives mobile games their bad name. Basically, it seems to be a pseudo-ElderScrolls rip-off with a slightly upgraded combatsystem (dodgerolls!). The problem is, it feels like a working alpha of something that they somehow never bothered with completing. I mean, the original Elder Scrolls: Arena had more going on than this - the plot is (even considering that the majority of fantasy RPGs have very bad stories) incredibly dull. Some big foozle wants to take over the lands from his shadowy demon-dimension... yadda-yadda. You are "the chosen one" who needs to find and wield some sort of legendary sword that can kill demons. As simplistic as this premise is, with a bit of lore here and there and some developed characters this still could have worked. The devs did not bother though, you hero has no personality whatsoever and the NPCs all have about 2 lines of dialogue - but aren't having any characteristics or personality either and only serve as generic placeholders, fulfilling a certain function like questgiver or vendor. And don't expect them to have some sort of "life" they will be frozen in place day and night, just waiting for you to interact with them in the most basic way imagainable. I have seen quite a bit of openworld-games that were lacking in the story/character-department - but this game is literally devoid of anything even remotely resembling "writing".\n\nUnfortunately, that is only the tip of the iceberg - as the gameplay is just as underwhelming. If you manage to find a quest (you don't exactly see who is a questgiver and who is not, so you go running around town talking to everybody and feel like you will never get those minutes of wasted life back) you can go about getting X, killing X or talking to X. Which is hardly entertaining nor exciting especially when there is basically no motivation besides gold or XP. Questing as a whole feels utterly pointless (that is why I did about three missions in the entire game and simply didn't bother anymore). The mainquest isn't much better off, you basically run as far as you can to all four cardinal points, find a dungeon, get a stone and return.\n\nThe rest of the time you spend hacking and slaying various beasts and enjoying the scenery. But even here the game manages to fail, as the vast areas are strangely barren. Feeling a lot like early MMORPGs with mobs just sprinkled over the landscape without much rhyme or reason - then again, all the enemies either just stand around waiting to be killed or roam a very tiny area so it doesn't look too static when you can see them from far away. Which is another low-point - you spend way too much time running through empty areas, there is nothing happening and not much to explore despite the vastness of the maps.\n\nIf you finally manage to get locked into combat with one of the beasts it is mostly a "click 'em to death"-afair without much finesse. Sure, you can block, dodgeroll or cast some spells from magic runes - but there is no punch to any of that, no "gamefeel" whatsoever. And it is ultimately pointless as you will sooner or later be either dead because you get caught in a loop of weird hitstun (getting clobbered to death in the process) or dealing one-shots to all who oppose you.\n\nAs a game, it is a failure - horribly unfinished, at times feeling like a fangame or a mod to something. The only things I kind of enjoyed were the visuals and the music - which is overly dramatic considering that nothing really "epic" happens and suffers from the loops not being long enough, thus becoming somewhat repetitive. While the visuals, which are not exactly state of the art, have that early 2000-charme to them. Some of the monster-models are looking actually pretty cool and at times there are even nice details on creatures, like the saliva dripping from the jaws of some of the bigger dinosaurs you encounter. Some of the beasts you fight are pretty huge too, which was kinda fun and again reminded me of some olden MMORPG-shenanigans.\n\nFinally, the UI is pretty bad - sorting stuff or selling items to vendors feels clunky. There is NO gamepad support, eventhough I think this game could work pretty good with a controller. And you just can tell from clicking around the status screens that this was ment to be on a touch-enabled screen, which is less than optimal on a machine that has proper input-technology attached to it.\n\nI think it is worth a laugh or two if on sale, as it is hilariously crappy and underwhelming (and I actually did finish it!) but since you can get almost every other noteworthy and/or modern Openworld-RPG on PC here on Steam, there is NO reason to get this other than ♥♥♥♥♥ & giggles.","January 19, 2014","false","5.1"," 78 of 103 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","78","103","0","0"

This is because they're usually saturated in heavy microtransactions, which are very common on the smartphone marketplace. Rarely do we see a port and not see microtransactions, Ravensword: Shadowlands is one of these examples.\n\nThe PC Port itself is a mixed bag; it improves its graphical fidelity with improved textures and post effects, re-bindable keys and an improved control scheme which is vastly superior to its smartphone counterpart. That’s where things end; the UI cannot be customised and is very clunky as it's made to be used with limited screen space. Everything in the menus can only be done through mouse clicks, leading to frustrations after continued use.\n\nAnimations are clunky, actions feel unresponsive, combat and movement inputs override each other causing unrealistic actions, such as performing an attack followed up by a roll which shows a standing attack animation but you move as if you’re rolling. The RPG elements are very basic, all the talents, stats and gear are simple increase X or Y with no real flare to them, there are no tough options and it’s hard to see your character truly progress.\n\nFor $15 it’s a hard sell, its smartphone equivalent is $7.50 and I think that price should carry over to the PC platform. While it does change and improve on its smartphone build, it falls a little short at its current price.\n\nThough it's currently on sale so it may be just what you're looking for even with all its faults. Play for a couple hours, have a laugh or two and move on.","December 12, 2013","false","3.0"," 147 of 217 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","147","217","2","0"

A heroic raven with sword-like tallons darkens the lands with his terrifying shadow!\n\nRavensword: Shadowlands\nNote: The exact events have been slightly altered for the sake of sarcasm.\n\nThe games starts with a cut scene, "A great war has been raging in the north lands for centuries."  [Very long awkward pause while the camera drifts over the landscape.] "The dark elves have retreated to their last remaining fortress."  [Another pause with the camera looking at a tower within a fortress.] "The great mage summons his army to battle." [A guy with a staff stands on a tower.  Super awkward pause.  More standing... A breeze makes the guy's cape slightly billow.  End of scene.]\n\nA soldier with a sword appears and I'm a bird [could it be a raven?!] flying over his right shoulder telling him what to do.  [Actually no, I'm not a bird.  I'm a flying camera.  The options are first person or awkward-over-the-shoulder first person.]  I enter the battle with sword swinging.  [Wow, combat is really clunky.  How do I hit things?  The elf has to be directly in front of me?  What's going on?!  Thankfully these 3 NPC soldiers can kill stuff.]  A big ugly troll enters the battle.  [These graphics a pretty ugly given how detailed they are... and it's not just the troll.]  I run away because I can't see what I'm doing ... The tower explodes in a small puff of fire and the cut scene tells me everyone is dead except one person.  [I wonder who that could be...]\n\nI awake in a room.  [Look it's me!]  There's a woman near the fireplace.  The scene goes exactly like every other scene where you awake with a woman in an RPG, which is notably different from the version seen in movies. [Wow, this woman is hideous!]  "Clean yourself up."  [I start fiddling with my face... like my hair, beard, jaw size and eye color.  I didn't see the plastic surgeon but he's got to be here somewhere.  Too bad he's not a very good one.  I can be super ugly or slightly more ugly with a painted on mullet and beard.  I choose the bald, shaven look.] I am now a member of their guild, which, with the addition of me, has 3 members in it. [So... this lady finds a random dude in a pile of dead bodies, brings him home, cares for him while he's unconscious and fills in his guild membership form noting his main attribute to be "Not completely dead."  I don't think I want to be in this guild.]\n\nI visit the guild leader, who is even more ugly... "Blah, blah, go visit blacksmith."\n\nI walk around the town talking to people who try to sell me things I can't afford.  At least the blacksmith is attractive, and by that I mean normal-looking.\n\nI'm sent off to visit a wizard in a cabin.\n\nI shoot a few boars by constantly running backwards and waiting for the boar to be right in front of me.\n\nI enter the cabin to find a tiny guy in a glass bottle with a stopper in it.  I'm amazed that he's a great wizard.  [This is evidenced by what must have transpired:  1) the dude shrunk himself, 2) he teleported inside a bottle that clearly has a neck too narrow for him, 3) he levitated a cork into the top of the bottle, and 4) he waited around in the bottle hoping someone would stop by to help him.]  He asks for my help to get him out of the bottle by collecting something from a nearby cave.\n\nQuit.\nExit.\nUninstall.","May 24, 2014","false","0.7"," 58 of 76 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","58","76","10","3"

I hope anyone scrolling through will realise that buying this game is a bad idea, let me explain why...\n\nFirst off, the game seems to have a nice charm to it. I got it in a humble bundle (April 2014) and got some suprisingly bad games with it, although some were ok. It reminded me of games I used to play when I was a child with its slightly poor graphics and mediocre AI, so starting off was a nice experience. The feeling was stripped from underneath me though however when the quests started. The quests don't tell you enough on how to get round and where to go, I ended up lost and confused. A lot of the time I would go into a place that was way too high of a level for a starting character, so in my genius, I googled what I had to do. But what came up shocked me. As I said previously, I bought this game on humble bundle so didn't buy this game individually or sit through the most arrogant of trailers. Because it turns out this game is a mobile port. Things began to make sense; This explained everything. I thought about reviewing this game for what it was before realising that it was not a mobile game: It was a steam game, so I shall review it as a steam game.\n\nThe second thing that decided to creep out from its bug infested rock was the head bobbing. When holding nothing in your hand, to to auto holstering after time or unequiping the actual weapon, there is absolutely no head bobbing. However when you get a weapon out your head decided to go crazy, as if the character is headbanging with a anvil cellotaped to his head. When you draw an arrow the crosshair moves around steadily but still weirdly enough for it to be off putting. None of this is the case though on horseback. You can run about as you please without any bobbing and have perfect aim. Not a great start.\n\nThis paragraph will be kindly donated to all the bugs I found after 2 hours of playtime, let's see, shall we?\n\n1. The title screen will sometimes not load any buttons\n2. Arrows will sometimes stick to the bow and decide never to fire\n3. Axes and swords will stick sideways in the hand\n4. Arrows will clip through objects\n5. The sky will sometimes go completely black\n6. With a shiled equiped, It sometimes doesn't want to appear/ be usable\n7. Sometimes sounds will forget to play when using weapons\n8. Sometimes animations forget to play\n9. Sometimes runes don't do anything\n10. Some small obsticles cannot be jumped over although in third person it shows them going higher\n11. Some obsticles can be walked though completely (Trees, big rocks etc.)\n12. The shadow only shows the arms and weapons\n13. The loading screen plays bow sound effects\n14. With a bow equiped, after a loading screen your bow appears to be drawn but isn't\n15. Enemies can get stuck on small objects until you look away from them\n\nNot sure if these are bugs...\n1. Blunderbuss will have a fiery sound effect whilst reloading\n2. Blunderbuss also creates a fireball whilst reloading\n3. NPCs will only speak their first line of dialogue and use text for the rest\n4. The axes hit range is crazily high\n5. The character cannot move for around a second after they are hit whereas the enemies can\n6. When swimming, third person shows your head below water, first person shows it above\n7. The fire rune has shown no difference to using nothing to me\n8. The head bobbing I spoke about earlier\n9. ALL THE FLAGS WAVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS\n10. Some chimneys have fire coming out of the top\n11. Teleporting to a place on the map will sometimes take you to the other side of the place that you clicked\n12. The only way of a horse is to change the camera view and then the horse disappears\n\nThe game seems to be copying greatly of Skyrim and I want to judge it against that because Skyrim basically owns this market anyway. I will some up everything about. Graphically it is okay and i am sure it could benefit from a HD graphics mod but I am still okay with the graphics. The sound, despite buggy, was quite nice. Grinding for XP and money was way to easy but levels didn't make enemies any easier to fight. After 15 minutes I had the highest level armour I could find (Despite the trailer showing better) and also the best bow and axe I could find, but my newly aquired levels didn't change much.\n\nOverall I am going to give this game 3.5/10 as It really didn't uphold any of my interest for long enough to see it get any better. I got this game and others for 60p but it is shocking a mobile port would ask for £12.","April 17, 2014","false","9.9"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","30","34","0","0"

Ravensword is generic, contains mostly empty non-detailed areas, boring fights and a lot of grinding - feels like a mmo without other players. Hidden extras, secrets and puzzles are non-existent (beside maybe a small cave or two). Exploring the landscape is ultimatively pointless. The music is ok, graphics are ugly. Open-world though you have to grind first to survive the higher-tier areas. Gameplay is absurd - you slay trolls and giants but the tiny crabs completely own you. Story and characters are forgettable. You're some male looking for a sword to slay a demon.\nRather buy or play some more Skyrim (or Fallout or Baldur's Gate or Witcher or Isaac or Terraria or or or) and if you hate Skyrim you'll hate this game anyway.

You'll only get frustrated, or bored. And life is too short to be either.\n\nRavensword: Shadowlands is a simple game, with simple aspirations. The world is built with thick, not too careful brush strokes, and the story follows the same pattern. Still, it works, and that's as much as you can ask of it. The gameplay is kind of barebones for an RPG, with a small skill tree where most branches aren't really needed. Also, you'll find places where difficulty spikes are big, seemingly to encourage longer playtimes.\n\nHowever, there are interesting ideas in the package. And the game is pretty optimized for a casual audience. The quests aren't overly long and can be easily followed, inventory management is reduced to a minimal expression (only weight can give you some problems from time to time) and the world is attractive enough to keep you engaged for the relatively modest amount of hours you need to dedicate to the game.\n\nI am recommending the game based on the premise at the beginning, and also because, for me, it filled a very simple place in my library: a simple distraction from more complicated games. Sometimes, that's exactly what's needed.","May 1","true","19.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","2"

However, seeing as this is a very serious attempt by Crescent Moon Games to break into the PC gaming enterprise, I have to give an honest review of the title, which is that this is the by far the most generic RPG I've ever played.\n\n-Gameplay & Controls-\nThe gameplay is by far the area of the game with which I have the most qualms. Ravensword is essentially a hack and slash RPG, a tried and true formula, except in this iteration the hacking and slashing makes absolutely no sense as far as hit points go. While your first attack might take off 25% of a wild boar's health, your next strike will bring your foe down to zero, a skill for which I'm sure Robert Baratheon would have been most grateful. Yet all the clever Game of Thrones references in Westoros couldn't excuse just how imbalanced a fighting system exists in this game. Another aspect of the combat is the sneak system, which allows the player to get close to hostiles without disturbing them in order to land an attack for bonus damage or to steal items from enemies. However, the sneak system seemingly absorbs your character's energy at random; since energy is required for attacking and dodging, becoming invisible (oh, did I fail to mention that you inexplicably become invisible when sneaking?) might leave you questioning just what you can actually do now that you're hidden. Also, sneaks sometimes fail out of nowhere, disturbing your quarry and causing them to attack, and the best part is that the criteria that have to be met to cause this to happen aren't explained at all. So...thanks for that, Crescent Moon. I could also swear I've played about every quest in the story so far in one form or another in the other RPGs which reside in my library, which again brings up the issue of just how generic this game remains.\n\n-Graphics & Visuals-\nFor the most part, the game looks like an oddly rendered MMO from the early 2000s, so if you're into playing that sort of thing solo and can handle the color pallet consistent with the rest of the series, you might actually enjoy Ravensword. Despite having improved textures when compared to its mobile counterpart, they don't provide an appealing atmosphere for a PC game; the outlandish and somewhat cartoonish buildings worked for its predecessors, but they don't work here. Also, I'm fairly certain the majority, if not all, of the NPCs are white. You're able to design your character's face, which allows for limited customization, although there are no feminine options so don't expect to play as a woman. You can give yourself Deadpool eyes for some reason, however, which I guess Crescent Moon thought was the next best thing.\n\n-Music & Audio-\nAh, yes, the audio. Let's talk about the sound effects prevalent throughout Ravensword. The Prologue remains my favorite quest so far, as you start in the middle of a battlefield consisting of about ten people while the sounds of hundreds of screaming men and the clanging barrage of clashing steel assault your ears. That and the bizarre, almost comical grunt the player character makes when he jumps sum up the awaited audial experience rather nicely.\n\n-Final Thoughts-\nAs my girlfriend pointed out, there's a squiggly line between raven and word, and the title could really be either Raven Sword or Ravens Word. That's honestly the only thing that interests me about this game.","May 26, 2014","false","0.6"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","27","37","0","0"

Yes. A turd. In it's mouth.\n\nI started this game thinking, well okay. It has mixed reviews but the few good reviews it DOES have, paint it in a decent light.  The first thing I notice is that the game refuses to play at the resolution my monitor has... and freezes up my entire system forcing me to force shutdown the desktop. Now, being the forgiving type when it comes to games, try this game again after I restart. This time it lets me play at the resolution that I want.\n\nAt this point, you'll notice that I've played less than an hour, as that was enough for me to deduce that every two or three minutes some form of profanity would be leaving my lips if I tried to play any further. Therefore my review will be based on the 40 or so minutes that I spent wanting to slam my head into my desk while trying to kill wild boars and goblins. You'll also notice I said "trying to kill" and that is because the controls in this game are so laggy that I spent half the time swinging a sword into nothing even though I was aiming at the enemies.\n\nThe NPCs in this game start off as voiced characters, which would have been a plus to me, had the voice actors not quit mid dialogue, forcing you to read their walls of text. I assume they quit, as the only other scenario I could think of is that they had a sneak peak at the combat in this game and slit their wrists in defiance, refusing to be part of this monstrosity. I should also add, that while the graphics were somewhat decent, and the bodies for female npcs were worthy of a ten second glance... once you got up to their face it reminded you of someone who has been hit in the face with a hot cast iron skillet... multiple times. The male faces? Not much better... nor their bodies for that matter.. and yes, I looked.\n\nThe storyline, from what I saw, is incredibly dull, consisting of "you could be the key to blah blah blah, go find this person and do what he wants you to do so he can send you off to this other person so he can do the same thing" Only I never got that far because I fell out of my seat laughing at the first guy... claiming to be a powerful wizard, yet trapped inside a bottle. By a spell gone bad. Yup.. the mighty wizard's spell backfired and trapped him in a bottle.\n\nThis all being said, there WAS one good thing about this game... I got it for free. I'd only recommend this to people who had masochistic traits.\n\n","November 8, 2015","false","0.8"," 34 of 51 people (67%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","67","34","51","19","3"

All in all it is a fun game for spending a few mindless hours after a hard day in work.\n\nThat being said, there is probably a reason why a lot of people feel being ripped off. I would blame it especially on the features list on the store page - richly detailed world? I would say that about Planescape Torment, not this. Hundreds of items? I don't think I have used more than a hundred during the game. Lockpicking and pick pocketing has practically no use in the game. Decision based, multi-part quests?

Story: There is pretty much zero story for an adventure game. Well this is pretty much okay if the goal of the developer is to make players assume their own roles and weave their own story, but truth to the matter is, there isn't much to work on your own story anyways. The only interesting part was one particular quest in the beginning where  you were ambushed in a store after a woman persuaded you in and thats about it. The main storyline is cliche and straightforward that creates no memorable experience whatsoever (as far along my playthrough)\n\n2. Gameplay: Wobbly and out of proportion bad. Skyrim was bad as you could just smash things and that is pretty much the only strategy. Suffice it to say that it is even worse here.\n\n3. Exploration: Starting out the world seems pretty vast and lush, however that starts to prove itself wrong as you discover that it wasn't as expansive as it was supposed to be nor was there much freedom to explore. There were only few sidequests, which was to be expected out of an adventure game, but it felt mediocre.\n\nI've played bad games and forced myself to finish it.

Give me a break.  This is a game somewhere between Baldur's gate and Dragon Age.  Keep in mind, those games new on a PC were $40-$50.    The graphics in Ravensword are not cutting edge 21st century, and there aren't hours of audio and video cut scenes.   Having put all that down, for $14 on Steam int's a very fun and utterly playable game with a very large world to explore.  It feels a lot like WoW without the idiots, I mean, other players, LOLS.   I find it funny that guys who are bragging about their gaming rigs being so up to date, and I assume, expensive can be so boorish when reviewing a relative bargain.\n\nAlso, I find the fight dynamics pretty cool.  You have to carefully time your striking and parying attacks to best defend yourself while dealing out maximum damage to the enemy.  Much more dynamic than games where you just hold down the "kill" button and hope the enemy's HP gives out before yours does or turn based RPG's.  It's fun, it's enjoyable, it plays well on modern CPU's with not so modern graphics cards.

Skyrim is better but it's rated M by ESRB so some people may  not be able to play it and it's more expensive... well not really anymore, just buy skyrim when it's on sale if it's otherwise to pricey.\nRavensword is a fun game, it;s more creative than Skyrim, but overall a much lower quality game. It takes a bit of grinding here and there, some of the game mechanics are a little glichy and     the story, well the story is half decent but by no means original.\n\nSo at the end of the day, I f there is a reason you cannot play skyim, whether you can't play M game or you computer is not good enough, then yea I would recomend this game.

Combat  is a chore as the hitboxes are often dreadful, requiring you to massively overlevel and grind for gold so that you can finally win a fight by being completely and totally immune to the damage your enemies output. The game itself is poorly optimized for PC, running far worse in certain areas than games of much higher quality and detail ever would, and also looks rather poorly to boot. The art is about 5-6 years out of date for the genre, and honestly gave me the impression that it had been made in that time period rather than December of last year. Quests often leave you wondering what it is you're actually meant to do and the quest markers are often incredibly useless as they only indicate the (massive) general direction in which you should be heading to eventually reach your destination. On top of that, the quest log often leaves out important details, such as what it is you are actually meant to do.\n\nThe story is sub-par at best, being incredibly cliche and not very fulfilling whatsoever, and is even less logical for about 80-90% of it. On top of that, the main story is basically all there is to do in the game, there are no side quests continued outside of a few that will last for about 30 minutes total. Combine all of this and you get a game with a poor story, out-of-date graphics, an INCREDIBLY short play time, high difficulty curve, (as a result of bad hitboxes and many, MANY combat bugs that commonly appear and make it so that your weapons do not work for a varying amount of time) that is crippled even further by the fact that very little to no play-testing seems to have been done, as the game is riddled by bug after bug continuing through every area and very rarely not requiring a load up of the last save, which, without any form of auto-save function, could easily put you back a frustrating amount of time.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a score of 2/10.","May 25, 2014","false","8.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

One of the main selling points was "an enormous environment", but there's one city, a couple of fields, a few mountains and a marsh, basically. The main storyline (to skip a few details) was horrendous - you spend 90% of the game looking for a sword that's less than a minute away from where you start the first bit after the tutorial, because it's the "only weapon that can kill the final boss" - and then when you DO fight the final boss you don't actually need the sword (I killed it literally using just the fire spell).\n\nThe character writing was just as bad as the questline, but what really got me was the seemingly random inclusion of voiceovers. If all the characters had voices, fair enough. If none had voices, fair enough. If the ones in the main questline did but everyone else didn't, fair enough. What actually happened was that most characters will mumble "hello good sir" at you, and then some characters, completely at random would have one line mid-conversation which did have a voiceover, and the majority of the dialogue is just subtitles. The sidequests basically aren't worth doing either - there's no REAL benefit to them, and the reputation system seems entirely meaningless because it affects nothing.\n\nEven the gameplay was poor - melée weapons are fairly standard but a couple of hits from any weapon will basically kill you. Ranged weapons are far more powerful, but the aiming system's not brilliant, and the spells mostly feel useless apart from the one or two quest-related instances where you need them. The game feels unfinished too - there are LOADs of bugs that have just been left in - there's a lot of falling through the floor, occasionally a weapon will "jam" and not let you hit with it until you save, exit and re-enter the game, enemies get stuck on all sorts of items.\n\nAgain, on the whole it really falls flat. There's definitely potential for it to have been a good game, but it feels totally unfinished. The major positive part of the game is that there are inexpicably dinosaurs roaming about a couple of areas (I'm not even going to try and justify them being there) and you get to ride one of them, but even then the controls are clunky.\n\ntldr; don't bother with this. Play something from The Elder Scrolls, or The Witcher, or Fable, or even a Lord of the Rings game instead. There is no aspect of this game that can't be topped by one of them.","April 17, 2014","false","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, when you port something like this to PC, you invite comparison to all the other open-world 3D RPGs available on the platform (Elder Scrolls, Witcher, etc.), and in that regard there's nothing this game does that you can't find being done better somewhere else. The $15 price tag is a bit much for what's offered here, as well. Still, it kept my interest long enough that I completed the main and side quests, I didn't encounter any bugs or crashes, the combat is fun (if a little too simple) and it has moments where, even with the lower-res textures, the game still manages to look pretty. Plus one quest lets you ride dinosaurs, which should count for something. I can only recommend this if you can get it on sale/in a bundle and you can't get enough RPGs.","February 6, 2014","false","6.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You play as the lone human survivor in a war between the humans and dark elves. After a few quests early on you are informed that your destiny is to obtain the runestones that will unlock the ravensword and use that to save the world from eternal darkness.  The plot is nothing special and unfortunately the gameplay doesn’t fair much better. You can fight with various weapons both ranged and melee as well as spells later on. Each attribute and weapon increase in their properties as you use them (for example armor attributes increase when hit). The weapons are all different and have pros and cons to each. The hammer may deal the most damage but it is slow and leaves you open. The combat itself consist of hitting the enemy and hoping you hit harder than they hit you. If you do die there is no penalty except for loading you last save but you can save at any time. Leveling up is rewarding because you can spend points on passive abilities as well as base abilities. The games length is decent being around 8-12 hours depending on if you want to do all of the quests and has some fun moment most involving slaying giant beast. Considering it is an indie game and is an overall good experience I would recommend this to anyone who wants some fantasy and questing. Just don’t expect it to be Skyrim.","January 22, 2014","true","11.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It was fun from start to finish. The story isn't really exciting but the beautiful enviorments and dinosaur riding make up for that. The game itself is a quick playthrough maybe 5-10 hours, depending on if you want to do the few side missions.\nAfter beating the game (and fiding out how to get out of the map) I still would recomend the game.\nOnly downside is I wish there was some replay value.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an amazing game! After playing it for a while you can tell it has been influenced by The Elder Scrolls series. The graphics themselves are amazing and remind me very much of an Oblivion like game. You can steal like in TES (the elder scrolls) but there isn't as much things to take. You get to customize your character but it isn't nearly as in depth as Skyrim. Same goes for the upgrade/stats/abilities. The game has a difficulty meter so you can make it easy or extremely hard depending on your skill level. Also there is a very good diversity of enemies and things to kill. I recomend this game to anyone looking for a fun and great looking RPG. Also this game was made for smartphones and transfered onto the PC with a few additions.","April 2, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has been out for a year already, and was primarily developed as a mobile game for Android and iOS devices. That didn’t stop Crescent Moon Games from porting it over to Steam via the Greenlight program. Boasting improved visuals and a new control scheme, Ravensword Shadowlands should serve as an improvement, right?\n\nWell, I wouldn’t necessarily say that. Let me get this out of the way: Ravensword: Shadowlands isn’t a terrible game. It’s playable, and in some instances, enjoyable. It’s just not a very well developed game at this point in time, and many of it’s core mechanics are very clunky. There are some very large design and technical flaws within the game that need adjusted in order for a more enjoyable experience. I’m sure that most of these issues stem from the fact that Ravensword: Shadowlands started out as a mobile game with the PC support being more of an afterthought.\n\nThe premise isn’t too revolutionary or enthralling. You fought in an epic battle between what amounts to humans and elves, when suddenly every soul on the battlefield perishes except for you. Confused and injured, you are taken in by a local town to start questioning why you’re still alive, and what’s going on in this crazy world. It’s not really revolutionary, but it serves as a way to get you to explore the game world. There are several side quests as well, but none of these are really worth mentioning.\n\nRavensword is also a very short game. You could run through this game in probably 5 hours on your first run through, and still see most of what it has to offer. The areas claim to be large and open, and while that is true, they’re also mostly empty with the occasional enemy scattered throughout. The enemies, however, are extremely well designed and varied. There are what look like giant Javan Rhinos in one of the starting areas which sort of confused me, but was impressive nonetheless. Later on, you’ll find yourself surrounded by dinosaurs such as raptors and pterasaurs, and maybe even on the back of one. While it’s strange that you go from fighting goblins to endangered rhinos to extinct animals, dinosaurs are pretty cool and it’s nice to see them represented.\n\nThe combat is extremely basic. Melee combat is difficult because of awkward and inconsistent animations, while ranged combat fares much better. I spent most of my time with a strangely overpowered crossbow that outdamages even the strongest sword in the game. The nice thing about the combat, though, is that the skill system is reminiscent of Elder Scrolls. You’ll get better with weapons the more you use them, and you’ll be able to upgrade different attributes of your character among leveling up. While not nearly as in-depth as a dedicated PC game, it would be a nice touch on a mobile device.\n\nThe biggest problem for Ravensword, however, is the amount of technical glitches and overall lack of polish. It’s hard to recommend a game when animations will stop for no reason, interrupting the flow of combat. Or when you accidently double tap one of your directional keys, causing you to roll to your death. Sometimes the sky will turn dark on me, or my crossbow would stop working until I reset the game. Situations like this happen very frequently in Ravensword, but many times they are more entertaining than detrimental. I was very amused when I noticed that enemies will walk right off the edge of a cliff if I can coax them toward me, or that enemies will walk right into water, and then follow me as I float above them. Even the user interface takes some getting used to as many of it’s windows and objects are obtrusive and ungainly; obviously from Ravenswords mobile development.\n\nIn terms of presentation, it doesn’t look exactly terrible. Some animations are rough, but the environments are pleasant and colorful, if not a tad empty for my tastes. The lighting is impressive for it’s engine, yet it’s not advanced enough that it will make low-end machines struggle too much. The sound, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. Many of the voices sound as though they were recorded in a closet with a paper bag over the microphone. Some soundtracks are much too loud and dramatic for their areas, while others do a good job at conveying the large, open areas. The sound effects are grating, and you’ll hear too many grunts, squeals, and clangs should you decide to play Ravensword.\n\nRavensword: Shadowlands is a mobile game stuck on the PC, and that is precisely the problem. Many of the issues stem from the fact that Ravensword seems to be a mobile game first, and a PC game second. While some aspects of the game are admirable, the short length, glitches, and simple gameplay drag the experience down.","March 10, 2014","false","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyway the graphics need improving, and might is suggest adding some voice actors or audible dialogue.\n\nI would say the game is a 1/5 if I wanted to be mean, but I'll be fair, SO it gets a 3/5, or 60%, or 6/10, or D-.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/veryon/recommended/253410/","veryon","V E R Y O N","http://steamcommunity.com/id/veryon/","262 products in account","Ravensword: Shadowlands, a full review\n\nFirst off, sorry if you find any typos in this review. It's late, arround 2/3pm and I've spent quite some time playing this extrodinary game.\n\nI did not bought the game, I won a giveway and I was rather skeptical at first. Screenshots seemed generic, dated graphics even for a 2 year old game (review written in 2015)... overall a generic and dull game.\nIf you reconsider playing this game, you must know that  Crescent Moon made this game. And if you googled it CM produces Android games. So yes, this is a Android oriented game although with some minor changes. You can feel that while looking around with your caracther, the sensitivity is very low. Even if you play with a mouse (that you shouldn't) you have to go the settings and change the sensitivity to the maximum. Even so, it feels slaggyish (smooth but slow). But no biggie.\n\nStory\nHeavily inspired in Elder Scrolls. Not a rip-off, but it is those kind of RPG's that you must go looking for person X then X tells you he's only going to give what you want if you do some hard work and turns out you some out-of-the-league champ that survived a war where everyone died except you and now you must follow a profecy because you a chosen one thingy. Resemblences? But it has his funny moments. There is lot of references from Elder Scrolls in dialogues, very funny.\nI felt lost after my first quest but i got around within minutes. Those who never played RPG's before may feel confusing.\n\nGraphics\nWell it's a Android oriented game, right? Don't expect much it's a mobile game.\nI bet my AGP nVidia FX 5200 can run this. Don't expect Skyrim graphics...expect Morrowind look-a-like graphics.\n\nGameplay\nBesides the fighting system I don't have anything wrong against the gameplay. It's clumsy and need to be perfected. The map seems a little small but hey, mobile game right? Cities seems okay but there is some parts of the map that is mostly wide open.\nRuns smooth, there is a caracther creator, perk system, you can ride a horse, lot of weapons, you can be a mage, "karma"/reputation system... I can carry on with this list...\n\nMusic\nIt's not bad! I personaly enjoyed! Very climatic.\n\nWhy it has so many dislikes, should I be worried?\nNo not at all. This game IS fun. People thought this would be somekind a new Elder Scrolls competitor-look-a-like-but-with-small-prices game. You pay what you get for.\nIt is normal people complain and downvoted this game. We are PC players we demand better and more each game. But some games don't starve for that need. Some are just indies making a life for it. Like this one.\nThink of Hotline Miami with their 2D'd graphics and his sucess.\n\nOverall\nSimplistic, enterteining and amusing. Good bargain, need some minor improvements of course but I hope you guys out there buy this game and support the creators so they can make another one even better and complex. Babysteps!

Frankly, I probably enjoy it more than I do Skyrim: the interface is actually reasonably competent on PC, there aren't slow-mo kills slowing down the action needlessly, the lore is kept to a minimum, and its content is actually well-paced and isn't overused excessively. It's certainly not a perfect game -- it has a LOT of flaws -- but at its core lies a competently executed fast-paced slash-em-up RPG, and I can honestly recommend picking it up (at the right price).","April 3, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's great if you're still stuck in the 2000's. The graphics aren't that good. Graphics aren't important, but playing a game like this requires at least a little bit of good graphics. Some of the enemies will just stare at you, and for the big beasts they're health is very low, and it took me approx 10-15 seconds to kill it. They need to be a little harder.\n\nIt's a great game if you don't have enough money to purchase TES: Skyrim, but I don't think that this game is worth $14.99, I got this game in a bundle for $1.00 so it was a great deal and I couldn't pass the opportunity.

Also; dinosaurs? Are they for real?\nHonestly, I wouldn't mind if they succeeded making an oblivion ripoff with skyrim graphics, but it's not. Not even close. Not even a bit like close. Far away is too close too.\n\nIf you watched the trailer, that's not really how the game looks. The game controls are much fooped up so now and then and  well, the graphics aren't right.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHamma/recommended/253410/","TheHamma","Hammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHamma/","267 products in account","Awful. Boring story, boring dialogue, very little voice acting and even the voice acting itself was bad, no replayability, no care for any of the characters. I played the main quest from start to finish, beat a bunch of sidequests and I'm pretty sure I have endgame gear too. This game was devoid of any roleplay or engrossing world, it felt like an alpha. I know this was a phone game ported to the PC, but my god, this was just horrible.\n\n\nOn the plus side, I really liked the mounts (FLYING MOUNTS, WOOHOO) and the skill system idea was great! The problem is, at around level 24+ nothing can stand against you, at all. That is bad, because after the main quest you can keep playing... but why would you do that? The side quests are boring and mostly unrewarding (except for the one where I got a flying mount). There are no further challenges I can even find in the game, everything I sneeze at dies. Very short game, the world is very dead with little people to converse with meaningfully.\n\n\nI feel nothing for any of the characters that I met, that either lived or died. There were no choices, there was no roleplay. Not even the reputation matters, nothing changes when you max it. It was just a short grind to get accustomed to using all manners of weaponry, then everything fell when I hit it just once. Oh, and the whole dodging thing? Bad, especially the fact that you can't turn it off. I died many times by double tapping one of the strafe keys. So yeah, thanks for that.\n\n\nThis game could be improved so much. Better dialogue, better voice acting, more content beyond endgame that actually serves as a challenge, more gear/spells... it was just really, really short. I have no desire to replay this game, I really hope the developers will learn from this porting, and get a feel for what is commonly expected of from RPGs. Just a little more care in crafting the world and story, especially dialogue, would have improved this game a lot. It felt awkward playing through this, and I can't recommend anyone buy this game. People are giving this game away in fact, so if you MUST play this, you can probably get it in that manner. I really wanted to like this game, and I almost did at the beginning, but playing it killed me inside.\n\n\n\nWARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, and the final boss? What a PUSHOVER! Us gamers want to be CHALLENGED, and a wimpy imp-like boss is our challenge? I beat him in less than 30 SECONDS. Bad, very very bad.\n\nP.S: Might want to fire your level designers. I found multiple holes in areas where I could fall through the world and die. One such area is that shadowrealm near endgame, two holes where you can meet your end.","April 4, 2014","false","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In mid fight if you hit  2xW  or any other movement key you roll in that direction, so if you just wanted to flank an enemy or two of them you roll over and got delay (when you roll you need half a second to  stand up and half to orient your self to see where you are facing) during witch enemys hit you hard like there is no tomorow.\nThe camera is the worst. You can chose to play first person but if you cary a shield you cant see half of the screen. If you play "3rd person" your charter is on far left side of the screen and it makes fighting hard. You need to predict where enemy will be to be able to hit the enemy.\nThe description of items is laughable. There is none. No tutorial what so ever. Only on begining you get basic the movoment and camera setting.\nMap is beyond bad. It is so confusing. If you press M and then press inventory the map disapears. If you press loot it disapears.\nWay to many texture in game.  You cant pass thru a giant gap in marketplaces to loot a chest.\n\nThe only good thing is lockpick.

I would have kept playing but the controls are the clunkiest I've ever used, sensitivity changes on the mouse seem to have next to no effect (fast then slow then fast then slow; seemly randomly) and the collision detection is awful, I had arrows stopping in midair for no reason at all. The part that really kills the flow of the game is the fact that you can't just use keys to go through menus and are stuck clicking on everything (with the mouse that can't seem to figure out how fast it has to go) which is slow going to say the least. The graphics were alright, nothing great but not the worst and easily overlooked by comparison to the control issues.

Not in this game, in fact the only interactable loot objects are stuff you can steal from people's houses...which is pretty much limited to silverware. And while yes, you can technically steal from people's houses, don't think you can build a roguish character, that will keep you busy for all of 5 minutes, and make you want to shoot yourself because it's that bad.\n\nThe spell system is so bad that you pretty much can't be a mage, you get a grand total of about 5 or 6 different spells, powered by runes, which are underpowered.\n\nIf you are looking for a hack and slash RPG, you might not mind this game, the combat isn't anything innovative, but if all you want to do is kill bad guys, it might keep you entertained for a few hours...just do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS IT GOES ON SALE!","February 14, 2014","false","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

The world is fairly small, but the trailer leads you to think otherwise. The graphics are VERY outdated, and they should at least create a patch to enhance the graphics. I've already beaten 3 quarters of the game in about 12 hours, which isn't very much gameplay at all. I would only, ever, recommend this game to someone if they wanted Skyrim but their PC couldn't run it, and they couldn't afford it, which even that is highly unlikely since Skyrim is only $20.00 and you can get it on other consoles. The voice acting is terrible, and the combat sucks. They try make the trailer look good, but they couldn't even pull that off, since they show the terrible graphics in the trailer. There isn,t a whole lot of customization options in the game, except for choosing what armor you want to wear. The story is not at all good, and all in all, this game is just a wanna-be Skyrim ported from iphone to the PC. I recommend you use your $6.00 on something else.","September 6, 2015","false","12.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I did alot of considering and i have decided. I recommend this game. I do! its a fun game, and intresting. I wanted to make sure i finished it and had a full valid opinion. And i sunk more hours into the game then i had first wanted. Its a little bit addicting (like good rpgs should). Ok lets just look at the reasons i did this, and my connections with it.\nTHINGS THAT IT DID RIGHT:\nif you're reading this review you probally have a general idea of this game that'd be easier, but if you dont its an open world RPG- similiar to the elder scrolls series, which it gets compared to alot.(ill talk more on that later) So here is somethings i thought they did right:\n-big and diverse enviroments. I say big because its not HUGE but its not small. Its a small open world, you can wander around exploring and find a bunch of things! probally a good 2-3hours if you wanted to WALK the whole way. If you're new and just started playing, play for bit and you will get nice sense of scale. Each area of the map is very diverse from the next.\n-varierty of enemies. as i said up there; its alot of areas to explore in Ravensword, each different area has a different certain type of enemy to correspond with. The massive mountains of the Ice Lands Harbors a diverse Ice Giant Race. I stumbled upon a dinosaur infested jungle and even a crypt full of skeletons.\n-Orignal Engine, and a nice feel. Very true it feels like a elder scrolls game (there is even a super ridiculous skyrim easter egg too) but it has its own feel and you will get adjusted to it fast. You'll be upgrading your 20+ skills you have at your disposal, Changing from the many, many of the standerd weapons (axe,sword,bow,halberd,great axe, etc) and throwing spells in no time.\n-Story was very generic.BUT ! THE REASON THIS IS ON THE RIGHT LIST is because i thought about. it was the usual you're the only one who can save the world, so go save it type deal. But at least i understood it. I knew what i was doing, i knew what going to do what quest would yield, i knew who was who (no matter how flat and dull they were). Sadly some games dont even convey that, they just push useless characters and a story on you; you cant even understand. At least i actually understood and had an idea. I even caught myself looking for more lore to explore, and even thinking about in-game events\nfor hours on end. So i guess theres that.\n-Predictibility. it had to be said. this game is laughable predictible. this could be a huge downside, but the predictibiliy is actually a great comic relief.(not that the game takes it self TOO seriously) but you can honestly guess an entire quests storyline as you play it< or even before you play it. I found that i at least guessed CORRECTLY the outcome of like 6 quests before even playing them. im not even going to count the number i guessed while playing them. You can literally tell when someone about to betray you, or if something a setup, or if its and immediate fetch quest(ill talk much about that later). But when you just want a game that you can sit down and play on a saturday and wont have to ride a emotional, stressful, roller coaster game(like heavy rain or something like that) then this is nice. a nice relaxing rpg experience\n- All around it was just fun! RPGs get me in the first place. I just love leveling up, getting stronger, and stuff in that regard. And this game delivered that. If im not laughing at the god-awful voice acting, then im out sneaking in goblin fortresses and getting new gear,( CRIMSON VEST IN THE FORT 2nd BEST ARMOR IN THE GAME SPOILERS), or collecting more magic, or doing many of the side quests which help alot in growing and segways to the next area nicely and smoothly. I found my self at some late game areas early, and got some really nice levels from it, which really helped me at a boss fight.  And i found myself coming back after-school really wanting to play this game. and i put alot of hours in.\nbut its time, lets look at all the bad things. . . oh boy\n\nTHINGS THAT IT DID WRONG:\nalot . . . a much alot\n\n-The Voice Acting. Lets get this out the way first please. RIGHT AWAY after you finally get in the game you can tell you're in for a treat. The first few people you talk sound like they recorded this on a busy freeway in Chicago. Its complete ♥♥♥. And they even game a few people the exact same sound clips, SOME DONT EVEN TALK AT ALL (for the better?) its laughable, maybe even annoying, but the good part is, you dont have to listen to any of it! (except for when your in 1 of 7 cutscenes in the game) you can just skip it all and still understand wtf is going on, because my good friends. . . Predictibility\n-Horribly weak carma system. i would've liked it better if they just didn't include it. You have Reputation. Which goes up and down depending on what activites you participate in. your rep is normal when its at 300 or something like that. doing bad things takes that number down to the negatives. so if you steal a Dechanter (which are everywhere) your rep would be something like 165. they have titles too, like 300rep is normal, 100rep is like crimnal, 600rep is like knight, stuff like that. BUT IT DOSEN'T AFFECT ANY OF THE GAME! THE REP DOSEN'T MEAN A THING. BECAUSE the only rep you can actually be, is normal, or higher (300 or higher) because let me tell you. there are an abundance of things you can do to lower your rep, give ♥♥♥♥ responses, beat up the wrong people, STEAL ANYTHING AND EVERYONE'S EVERYTHING (there is a high chance you will get caught but if you dont you rep wont go down). and the second your rep goes to crimnal, every knight in town (which there are 983 around every corner) gets a amber alert and come charging for you. when they catch you they throw you in jail. which you must sit and wait for your rep to go up; it goes up by 50 like every 30 seconds; you must wait till your rep goes back to 300. im sure you can see when this gets troublesome. If your playing through the game like a badguy and your rep is about -600 . you'll be waiting for OVER 12 MINIUTES in jail! AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. they will take your hard(?) earned rep and you cant do a thing. if your in the main town you WILL get caught by a gaurd, and he will send you to jail. WHICH YOU CANNOT LEAVE FROM UNTIL YOUR TIME IS SERVED. punish players with in-game obscurites, not TIME! i dont want to wait in jail in VIDEO GAME. THATS NOT FUN. THAT REALITY. real-life punishments in a video is unacceptble. BUT, there is an easy fix. just play through the game with normal it dosen't mean sht anyways.\n-Exploits. Im not gonna list them because its kinda OP. but ill say this one, you can JUMP over anything. like you can go to any wall, and hold foward and keep jumping and parkour over EVERYTHING. not gonna lie it saved me alot, helped me alot in the hard areas, but i had to make this a bad point because i used it moderately. but i can imagine people beating the game in like 3 hours because of this.\n\n-Name. what name? YOUR NAMELESS IN A TEXT RPG. YOUR NAMELESS? WHAT? at least give us a set name, so we know who we are! OR AT LEAST LET US CHOOSE OUR NAME IN A TEXT RPG! YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE IM SOME SUPER IMPORTAN HERO; THE ONLY ONE TO SAVE THE WORLD, AND YOU DONT EVEN KNOW MY NAME? its really weird and really unengauging.\n-The ending, the final hours of the game? completely terrible. and unacceptable. you leave for the last area only when you get there to fight endless annoying ♥♥♥ foes, your at THE WORST POSSIBLE MAP IN THE GAME, you have no sense of direction,i dont even know if i beat it legit, i wondered around untill i fought someone who looked important, then i beat him, then you get teleported back home. the ending was bad,THEY DONT EVEN SHOW A CREDIT SCRENE!ending was bad, arrupt, and all around left a bad taste in my mouth. just like this review's ending;\n\ni recommend this game its fun, dumb, and like a cheap blend of Skyrim-Darksouls","May 13, 2014","true","27.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

Read Below:\n\nWell, it's enjoyable if you go in knowing that it was ported from mobile.\nI played this on my tablet, so I knew that it was quite good and offers the best "Skyrim"-like experience on the mobile market. It was ported to the PC rather competantly but the settings left a lot to be desired. I'd have loved to have seen many more options. But hey at least you can change resolution and key binds.\nVery rarely does this game drop below 60 FPS for me and playing with keyboard and mouse is SO much better than the touchscreen.\nIt's like playing Dead Trigger 2 on PC, it just plays, runs and feels better on PC despite being designed primarily for mobile users. But never really shakes that "mobile" feel.\nSo again, do I recommend the game? Yeah, it's enjoyable and good to sink a good few hours into, so you definitely get your moneys worth.\nBut do I recommend BUYING the game? Yes. For £5 you can do a LOT worse and this game offers more hours of enjoyment than most other games of it's type and price.\nCresent Moon Games, keep making great games and please, please, PLEASE add keyboard(and partial mouse support) and gamepad support to future games on mobile devices.

Though I usually don't base games on their graphics or sound effects; I do have to say they were quite poor for an MMO/RPG game. Of course I wouldn't be to critical on that, considering it was made with Unity. However, I was expecting better from the game for the price, though it is not really expensive. The game experience as far as the combat was acctually quite enjoyable because you acctually get to dodge attacks and aim at your target, unlike games where combat is only clicking spells or weapons. The "spells" in the game were unfortunatly not really spells, but were in fact rune stones that must be equiped by the player to use. I was also disappointed by the fact that the fire rune stone was extremely weak and drains your character's power far to quickly. Though the quests themselves were moderatly entertaining; I felt they could have been made better. Some quests are also to an extent, irritating to accoplish because they are not always visible on the in game map. There are also many other bugs in the game that I found such as my crossbow stopped working and I could no longer use it because of the bug. I tried buying a new bow and various other things, but it did not work. Clearly there are many things in this game that require improvement and is unfortunally not a game I would recommend to play.","April 13, 2015","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is supposed to play something like Skyrim or Risen. The controls are clunky, the animations stiff, the graphics extremly poor for a game made in 2013. Yes it is an indie title. The textures aren't bad on characters but are awful on terrain, and somehow the lighting doesn't work correctly, causing everything to have that early playstation glow to it.\n\nMenu options are limited to resolution, graphical settings of high, medium, and, low, and a check box for fullscreen. It seems odd that the developrs would chose to restrict control over the graphical settings when they felt compelled to include a limited character customization at the start of the game. It quickly becomes apparent just how independent the development of this title was when you select a hairstyle that has a headband, and the hair color slider changes the color of the headband as well.\n\nIt is no wonder than this title came bundled.\n\nWhen starting a new game, you're imediately greeted by a set of unskippable in engine cutscenes complete with bad dialogue and voice acting. The narrator tells you a short snippet about the world you're dumped into, which falls into the standard fantasy trope of humans vs [insert generic fantasy race/villian here] and you are immediately thrust into a battle against some "dark elves" who looked like humans but in red armor instead of your silver armor.\n\nCombat consists of left mouse to attack, right mouse to block, doing either of which will make your character grunt and stiffly wave his arm at the enemy. Shockingly, if you should block an enemy attack, your chracter will be knocked back about 4 feet and have his stamina reduced. You guessed it, your character can only block for a limited number of hits before having to lower his shield and let it recharge. A strange option to say the least, considering you one hit kill everything in the tutuorial, but consequently get one hit killed just out of it (by giant rats of all things).\n\nI couldn't actually finish this game, I had to stop after only 11 minutes of play it was so bad. Everything about this game is just unpleasant to experience, so sadly I can't attest to it's length. what I can say is don't bother buying this, or if you do, gift it to that family member who games but you don't like very much.\n\nGraphics: 4/10\nGameplay: 4/10\nSound: 4/10\nPlot: 3/10\nLength: -\n\nOverall: 4/10","April 25, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It came with one of the many Humble Bundles I purchased.  When I saw that there was no controller support, I immediately dismissed it (I play with my laptop hooked up to my TV, so it is much more convienant for me to use a gamepad).  It also looked to me like a bad Elder Scrolls, Gothic, the Witcher, or Two Worlds ripoff.  Today I decided to go ahead and give it a shot, and I am actually glad that I did.  The art style is a little bit different than Oblivion or Skyrim, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It grew on me rather quickly.  Again, having next to no great expectations (and that COULD be why things turned out as they did), I was actually impressed with things from the start.  The combat is just a notch above hack and slash, but with a bit of (somewhat picky) Elder Scrolls thrown in.  It can seem sluggesh, but once you get the hang of it then it is pretty satisfying.  I have only begun, so I cannot judge the story or dialogue so harshly yet, but it isn't terrible so far.  The more I play it, the more I see things that I like about it.\n\nConsidering I had no intention of buying this might factor into my impressions (again, I have not played for very long at all--I did see enough to know that I want to see more that it has to offer, and that is actually saying something compaired to most things I have played lately.  My review may change as I progress, but as for now, I recommend this game.  There is something about it, despite how I know it looks, that is compelling.  Even though I was irritated by not being able to use my xbox controller, once I got over it, the controls really weren't all that bad.  I had to switch "use" with "jump" but hey, at least it let me do that.  :D  Surprisingly, a lot of the games I have been playing recently don't give you the option to, but that might be because I have been playing a lot of Early Access games.\n\nTo conclude, give this game some thought and research before you immediately dismiss it.  I'm not sure offhand what the price of it is, but I don't recall it being  all that high.\n\n[edit: At the time of writing this, it is $6.99, and that isn't on sale or anything.  I haven't a clue as to the length of the game, but even if it ends up being rather short, that seems like a generously low price.]","February 9, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't see what all the bad reviews are about. It's a basic RPG you level different skills like swords or bows or magic by using them. You spend points on attributes and things like silent hunter for stealth or a walking faster skill which is nice. Basic normal rpg stuff. The typical side quests like find my missing brother or bring me 8 bear hides. The main quest is pretty generic so far hunt down pieces of a magic sword to I'm assuming eventually put it together and kill the big bad guy at the end and save the world.\n\nHonestly it's a fun little old school no surprises rpg that you can kill an afternoon with and for $1.74 that I spent on it it's perfectly fine.","April 22, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Read Below:\n\nWell, it's enjoyable if you go in knowing that it was ported from mobile.\nI played this on my tablet, so I knew that it was quite good and offers the best "Skyrim"-like experience on the mobile market. It was ported to the PC rather competantly but the settings left a lot to be desired. I'd have loved to have seen many more options. But hey at least you can change resolution and key binds.\nVery rarely does this game drop below 60 FPS for me and playing with keyboard and mouse is SO much better than the touchscreen.\nIt's like playing Dead Trigger 2 on PC, it just plays, runs and feels better on PC despite being designed primarily for mobile users. But never really shakes that "mobile" feel.\nSo again, do I recommend the game? Yeah, it's enjoyable and good to sink a good few hours into, so you definitely get your moneys worth.\nBut do I recommend BUYING the game? Yes. For £5 you can do a LOT worse and this game offers more hours of enjoyment than most other games of it's type and price.\nCresent Moon Games, keep making great games and please, please, PLEASE add keyboard(and partial mouse support) and gamepad support to future games on mobile devices.

So, why do I recomend it? Becasue it's actually a good game with a good story. True, it's very slow and you have to force yourself through the beginning, but, it has a lot of potential and I could see it turning into its own series of two or three games at least.
