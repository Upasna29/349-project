It's two games in one, a hoarde survival and a plane flying game. The higher you score in survival, the more weapons you unlock. In survival, you'll fight wave after wave of zombies (that I guess parachute their way in) some that can be destroyed quite easily, others that take loads of damage and some that even after they have not legs, arms, or head can still damage you! Then there are those pesky buggers that clip through the floor and some are even dogs! Yes folks, who knows how they are getting onboard, but who cares, they're after you!\n\nThe flying mode is quirky, yet hillarious at the same time. You are now in control of the plane and must shake off those pesky zombies from destroying parts of your plane. This is quite simple to do, fly it into the ocean! There are 3 skins of planes to choose from as well so you can enjoy crashing all of them.\n\nThe animations are bad, it runs at a solid 60 frames per second, there's no lag, the graphics are sub-par. It's stupid, it's ugly, there's nothing to do, and it's overpriced by $15. Recomened only for those that have an absolute fetish for Z-Rated games, (Z-rated, below B-Movie standards, far below.)","March 25","false","0.4"," 306 of 352 people (87%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","87","306","352","79","1"

But not Zombies done like before these zombies can keep going without limbs but also they can go without a head. Causing the issue of making all zombie feel bullet sponges and taking the sensation of mowing down zombies through "skill" in case makes the game feel like how quickly can you press the shoot button.\nThe game offers 3 characters straight off (with at least one hidden behind DLC?? yeah day one dlc??) but there is no different between the characters and gun unlocking is done during each game based upon how many points you get. Again taking out any decision making for the gamer again as you cant even pick character progression in anyway.\nThe guns feel floating, the zombies don't react well to being shot meaning loss of immersion again.\n2 levels, 2 game types, all the same as not much can is done with the level design, progression is only learboard based.\n\n2nd game is based around flying a plane as you spin it to shake off the Zombies, but as zombie can stay attached when upside down it just seems to boil down to spin around as much as possible and hope again.\n\nALL MISS not even worth keeping on an eye on, move on people.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zS9Yfl8ibvs","March 27","false","0.4"," 150 of 186 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","150","186","15","6"

Intensity was slowed down, some. Headless-legless-armless super zombies have been toned down. Zombies still love to chew on airplane parts -- and while better, it's not a good experience.\n\nFasten your seatbelts this is one ugly and bumpy ride...Full Site Review (Click for more detail)[gonewiththewin.com]\n\nIt pains me to not recommend a game I WANTED to recommend. This should have been stupid-fun. This should have been mindless zombie splattering. This should have been comical. Newcomer developer Shangi-La Game Studios has worked hard to improve on the prerelease copy I tested for 2 weeks. Even with this update, there is still a lot to be desired but the game HAS improved.\n\nEnemies AI and abilities are flat out ludicrous. Animations are horrible. Its premise and enclosed zombie action SHOULD have made it a fantastic little indie shooter in the same vein as Dead Effect. Which is a far from perfect mobile port, but entertaining. Thanks to the release day update, this game is more so. Flight mode maps to 360 controllers well, and on screen prompts will have you shaking off waves of zombies into the sea in no time. Survive the Horde is enjoyable, and the challenges for the wave FPS modes are more manageable. There is still much room for improvement. But at a budget price this game could fill a niche for zombie FPS action junkies. Currently this game is a hard sell for with serious gameplay mechanic flaws.\n\nPROs- Survive the Horde mode is decent.\n- Decent use of particle effects at times.\n- Flight modes offer a nice change of pace from mindless shooting.\n- Wave challenges are manageable, and offer a decent challenge.\n\nCONs- Animations are terrible\n- Wave modes are still cumbersome, and frustrating. Can only play in short bursts.\n- Following the update the game was slowed down, now it might be too slow.\n- Highly illogical game. Not enough fun for replayability.","March 25","false","12.0"," 168 of 222 people (76%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","76","168","222","17","11"

You and endless hordes of undead ridiculous looking assets will glitch and awkwardly maneuver about in a war of comic utter failure!  Fight inside the plane!  Fight on top of plane!  Even take control of the plane!  Weeeeee!\n\nSee my First Play and Review video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=142KpSqlbuE\n\nI think the developers behind this game have been studying the same "How To Make A Steam Game And Get Rich in 30 Days" training courses as the infamous Digital Homicide developers behind the Slaughtering Grounds.  And all their hard work shows when you play this masterful game... masterfully awful!  Awful controls, Morbid awful mechanics, and God awful physics make this game qualify for one of the best ways to waste your money this year!\n\nYou'll swear this game is a joke.  Like you'll be hoping that at anytime as you awkwardly fumble around with this catastrophe and fight horrid controls that a screen will pop up and say "Just Kidding!" and then start an actual decent game...   But no!  This is real people.  This is really a game that's asking nearly $20, and that's just for the base game!   They already have add on content available on launch day that will serve only to increase the amount of refund dollars Steam has to issue for as long as this game is available here.\n\nYou can choose which ridiculous hero you want to control from three when you first start the game should you choose to battle the zombies.  Imagine the Slaughtering Grounds in (or on top of) a plane speeding through the air.  But this game has an added perk in which you can also choose from the main menu to control the plane to either try and shake off zombies as you fly.. or just fly in a free fly mode admiring all the puffy clouds popping in the sky instantly like popcorn all around you!  Yay!\n\nWhile this game is slightly better then the Slaughtering Grounds I compared it to, this game looks like something Digital Homicide would release.  Knowing this is the first product by Shangri-La Game Studios offers some level of hope.  This is their start, right?  Everybody has to start "somewhere", and they can only improve from here!  While I gave this game an 8% score, I look at these developers with confidence and hope that their next game scores at least a 20%.  I know it's a lot to hope for, but I believe dammit!  :-)","March 26","false","0.7"," 86 of 128 people (67%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","67","86","128","18","3"

Of course, after crash all progress is lost, not steam achievements, though\n- game can't detect that I own Helicopter DLC like half of times I tried to use it in flight mode, so I had to restart game until I managed to use it\n- game granted me achievement of 50x combo when I did 25x, not a big issue, but still\n- game doesn't seem to be really good optimized, sometimes I have fps drops when like 3 zombies near me, but when there are like 20 - it's ok.\n- you will ALWAYS be attacked by some zombie, when everything seems fine, and you won't be able to see where is he, but surprise, look directly under your feet - there's crawling zombie! yay?\n- you'll have to find proper camera mode in flight mode before you can actually play it (3rd looked ok for me, that was the only reason I couldn't survive 10 waves earlier)\n- getting a trap power up while you shoot-off zombies is REALLY annoying, like you shoot incoming crowd, then suddenly your weapon disappears and you have a trap in your hands to use (also I couldn't figure if it's any useful)\n- defending and repairing passenger doors makes no sense, I stopped doing it at wave 7, went straight to cockpit door to defend, it didn't make game any harder, maybe even easier, since I didn't have to run anymore\n\nNow to the good part:\n+ game idea is actually interesting\n+ different modes\n+ game process is addicting\n+ views in flight mode are awesome (especially thunderstorm!)\n+ nice graphics and sound\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Please fix freezing/crashing and optimize game (at least a little bit)\n2. Consider adding co-op after fixing game issues itself (would be pretty cool 3-man coop, (1) shoots off zombies inside of plane, (2) shoots zombies on plane, (3) controls plane)\n3. Crawling zombie should be a bit further from character's legs, now it looks like you simply stand on him\n4. Make trap power-up just be another weapon, so you can switch to it whenever you want\n5. Consider possible relation between passenger doors and amount of zombies in wave for (10% per door might be ok, like if you have all doors - 50 zombies in wave, 5 doors destroyed - 75 zombies in the same wave)\n6. Consider adding more heavy zombies in late waves, now they start to appear even in waves 2-3, but wave 10 still has majority of weak zombies\n\nRecommending this, because it actually seems to be a nice game, and if developers manage to fix at least crash issue - it would be pretty nice.","June 4","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

NO. It's not worth buying on full price, not even at any kind of sales. It's fine to run it once and never again.

The most funny thing is probably translation from google - so if you see your language on that list it was mostly poorly translated using google translate. The game alone gets boring really fast and if you managed to run it twice or more times: you probably don't have better things to do or don't have anything more interesting to play.

The first thing I played was the horde type mode where you have to kill waves of zombies (I suggest 3rd person view to see everything around you) and you will get different types of weapons with the more zombies you kill. The next two are similar which have you repairing the plane on the inside or outside with waves of zombies trying to eat your face. The last mode was by far my favorite and is actually flying the aircraft and trying to shake the zombies off. Each time I played I tried different techniques to get the zombies off the plane and finally found the best scheme to have them plummeting to their deaths. With each mode I kept going back trying to beat my last score and reach the final wave.

That helps a lot :D\n\nThe outside mode and the plane mode was the best for me, this too isn't hard, really enjoyable, and no obstacles you can stuck when you try to escape from the zombies.\n\nPros    Lots of mode you can play\nLots of stuff you can unlock\nI would say only 1 achievement is hard, so its a good achievement hunter game\nhas cardz!!!\nCons    No melee fighting  or I just didnt find it\nThe moving is sometimes a little hard  jumping on outside mode, moving backwards on survival mode\nTL,DRIts not that bad what other say, totally enjoyable, Mostly easy achievements, fun to play. Ckeck it out!","April 19","true","3.8"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","4","16","0","0"

It's not aiming to be the best game ever, but it's a good zombie shooter that provides the mental stimulation and challenge one has come to expect from the genre. Shooting the heads off zombies, pulverising zombies with shotgun shots up-close and cutting them up with the chainsaw (you unlock this after getting 50,000 points) is really rewarding. The game saves your stats for you to beat later and there's a leaderboard to see who's the best. The game is innovative in many areas and I like 'Defend the Cockpit' mode which is where you have to defend the pilot's door from zombies. I haven't played the plane modes much but they seem fun and good for a break from shooting here and there. Play the game for yourself and make your own mind up as it's not as bad as some of these guys have made out.","March 26","true","1.6"," 31 of 433 people (7%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","7","31","433","31","18"

The plane mode takes time to get used to but is fun nevertheless - probably best not to turn the camera while flying. Good graphics with lots of characters and planes to choose from. Buy if you like zombie games!","March 26","true","0.9"," 19 of 445 people (4%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","4","19","445","36","24"
