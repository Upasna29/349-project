If only there was somebody with a camera to capture the look on my face whenever I died. I guarantee that I never made the same expression twice. A lot of 2D shooters, even brilliant ones like Radiant Silvergun, never really grasp just how horrifying and beautiful it can be. This is strange, since these deaths represent everything about the genre. When a plane or a jet or a psychic teenager is lost in a hail of neon-colored bullets, dozens of questions and emotions wash over the player. It's subtle, and if viewed from a distance, the only thought that can cross one's mind is "oh, well that stinks." But to me, every death in a shmup creates a void, and it us up to the player to reach into that void, and pull out something great. This is just one of the many reasons why I like DELTAZEAL, it values one of the most important elements of the genre.\n\nTo understand the significance of death, we must first understand life. In this game you start with three lives, and once they're gone, they're gone. The last two shooters I played were Eschatos, which handed out extra lives like candy, and Shoot1UP, which handed them out like oxygen. This game doesn't give you any extends, nor are there any hidden lives to discover. The impact that comes from every loss of life is soul-crushing, and it either makes you work that much harder to protect whatever remains, or you completely fall apart. The difficulty of this game is well-balanced, so the meager number of lives will last you a long time, provided you know what to do with them.\n\nPart of what sets this game apart from similar titles in the genre, are the branching paths. There are 9 stages, but a play-through consists of 7. Stages 3 and 5 have two paths: a & b. From my experience, I tend to have more trouble with stages 3b and 5a. That's why I'm thankful for the rest of the stages remaining the same. This sense of familiarity helps in practicing sections where I'm weak at, and focusing on more efficient scoring where I'm not. If you accomplish certain tasks - such as destroying particular enemies quickly - the route within the stage will change. Stage 1 practically triples in length depending on your performance at the very beginning. More opportunities for a high-score run hand-in-hand with worse chances for survival, but that's how it goes.\n\nParadoxically, the better you play a shmup, the more often you're liable to die. Despite learning enemy behaviors and their bullet patterns, you'll make things harder on yourself by looking for more scoring opportunities. In DELTAZEAL, there's a medal-chaining system. While developing your route, you'll start questioning which enemies should be destroyed. In order to maintain the large medal bonuses, you might have to leave a few enemies un-touched, because they're just too far away. Keep in mind also that medals drop at a high frequency. It doesn't take very long to rebuild a good chain (IIRC they cap at 1,000 points each). The other benefit to having a high bonus is that it makes boss-fights very profitable. Your special ability is a vortex that charges over the course of the game. When used, the vortex converts bullets into medals. Of course, you still have to manage the chain, while avoiding danger, and find the right moment during boss-fights to cash in.\n\nThe weapon-system further complicates your chances at scoring and survival. Perhaps "chance" isn't the best word, since it implies RNG had a hand in your demise and/or failure to beat your hi-score. Nevertheless, the constantly revolving weapon system is another factor to account for. Three are three flavors of power-ups: red, blue, and green. Along the bottom of the screen, there are ten slots that can be filled with weapons. Basically, if you grab all reds, you'll have a very powerful spreadshot. On the other hand, the piercing ability and raw power of a laser is important, plus we need to improve our score a bit, so let's grab some blues. Unfortunately, when you grab greens (homing missiles) it's probably on accident, because they're not very good for most situations. Due to the constant rate of power-ups, you can cycle through your weapons several times over. It's something to consider, but can also be distracting in the chaos of bullets & medals. You also get bombs, but they aren't very effective as panic buttons. Enemy bullets tend to move a little too fast for that. They're best used in addition to your regular weapon, so you can obliterate bosses very quickly.\n\nThe Raiden Fighters series readily comes to mind while playing DELTAZEAL. I've always had a fondness for those games, due to their intense pacing. The stages are a little on the shorter side, there is always huge scoring potential, and your lack of lives are balanced out by a shortage of prolonged boss-fights. All of the bosses have multiple parts and sections, all with their own weapons. There's a nice dynamic aspect to everything, so you're not just focusing a giant laser on a huge target, while threading a needle through thousands of pink death-globs. However, I will say that this game also shares Raiden Fighters' affinity for bullets that can blend in with the background. It sounds like more of a huge deal than it actually is, and you develop a sixth sense with practice. A couple of stages in DELTAZEAL run a little long, and a roster of playable ships would have been nice, but otherwise this game is a great love-letter to a classic series.\n\nBut really I just can't get over how impressively deaths are handled in this game.  Triangle Service gives you just enough time to feel the shock, the anger, the frustration, the teetering on the precipice into confusion and failure, and it's an amazing feeling. Call me pretentious but this is part of the reason why I enjoy shmups so much. They're a great challenge in of themselves, but what really sets them apart is that they allow players to challenge their greatest rival: themselves. Although I've dabbled in competitive games (mostly FPS), I think that there are too many factors that go into winning and/or getting a high K/D ratio. When I beat a hi-score, or a final boss without continuing, or other smaller victories, I'm doing something my past-self couldn't accomplish. I'm reaching beyond my abilities to attain a new level. Alternatively, when I fail, that means I have to go back, think about what went wrong, and form new strategies. It's a constant process but the triumphs are worth more than any of my other gaming accomplishments.\n\nSo before going any further off-track, do I recommend DELTAZEAL? Yes, most definitely. It's a superb game that consistently rewards skill-ful play, and the difficulty never becomes overbearing; although the jump from the normal to the harder settings is a little surprising. It also would have been nice if the last boss didn't have seemingly a dozen forms. It's one of those final battles where it probably should have been a stage unto itself, but I guess it comes with the territory. Regardless, this game is a class-act, and deserves a place in any 2D Shooter fan's library.\n\nDisclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 16, 2015","true","6.7"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","43","49","3","0"

No convoluted scoring systems or complex fighting mechanics here, you shoot to kill and evade to survive. Occasionally you drop a screenclearing smartbomb or fire a bullet-eating black hole and that is it.\n\nIt's not without innovation though, weapon upgrades are interesting as they have a DIY-quality - you can mix and match the three available weapon-types (homing, spread and straight up LASER) to get a bit of everything or you can try to pick the same type to get a super-version. Depending on how you are doing and which routes you pick (some of them unlock over time, REPLAY VALUEEEE!), this super-version can already happen in Stage 1 and result in MASSIVE POINTS. It's like a step up from Raiden, but still has that mecha/fighter-craft military flavor that I love so much in shmups - dismantling massive warmachines through superior firepower never gets old.\n\nUnfortunately, this game has one minor and one major flaw. At times, things can get rather busy and it's easy to fly straight into enemy bullets (though I managed to get into the final stage on a 1CC - so it's definitely doable if you pick the short routes and pick the right fights) - it can be frustrating and in some of the alternate stages that really put the pressure on with a ton of enemies it can also easily mean game over. The real problem for lesser shmuppers like me, is the fact that the final stage is B-R-U-T-A-L-L-Y difficult. And unnecessarily so, they simply do not allow you to credit-feed through the whole thing and you are expected to survive an epic onslaught of fightercraft and tanks just to meet up with a final boss that has multiple phases and decides to go bullet-hell on your ♥♥♥. Talk about a difficulty spike. It is a damn shame, because the rest of the game just so perfectly fits my taste and preferred shmup-style but Stage 7 can just go ♥♥♥♥ itself. That poor design decision doesn't kill DELTAZEAL and the rest is really fun (if you like things more classical) but it needs to be mentioned, because finishing the game even when you unlocked multiple credits is a serious challenge.\n\nStill, if you crave brilliant pixelart, Raiden-like military designs and some oldschool vertical shooting you just pop this game in and IT IS ON.

Whilst there is nothing to really dislike about the game there is nothing to excite me either. I'm afraid I can't in all honesty recommend.\n\nLong Review\nLet me say straight away that this is not a genre I play often which is a double edged sword in that one one hand it requires a pretty exceptional game to keep my attention but on the other hand I can't nit pick comparing with a lot of other games I have played.\n\nMy initial impression of the game was not favourable as my preference is to play games with keyboard and mouse and I found this game practically unusable in its default state accessing via this method. However, once I plugged in my Xbox controller for the PC the experience got much better and I was able to configure the keyboard to use the WSAD navigation keys, although to be fair I did end up using the controller to play the game anyway.\n\nAs far as I can tell there is no tutorial. It's in at the deep end and learn by experience with this game.\n\nThe gameplay is OK, just that. It's a vertical scroller where you control a ship that can move in all four directions, enemy ships appear, you fire at them, they fire at you and if either of you gets hit enough you die. You can change the main type of weapon you use, have a number of bombs (area effect weapon) and can pick up bonus items that are dropped. You start with three lives and the game ends when you haveno more lives left.\n\nThe graphics, for me, are below par as is the sound track. Nothing wrong with them; they just didn't excite me. I can't fault the scrolling and the reaction the input device - this was all seemless. One criticism I have for a lot of these types of games is that I struggle to tell the difference between objects on the screen I need to collect and those that kill me and this one was no different. I appreciate that as you play a game more you get to know this - it's just I didn't feel urge to actually play on and find out :(\n\nIn many ways this game reminded me a lot of the type of shooters I used to play back in the late 80s/early 90s on my Atari ST.\n\nProsThe scrolling and reaction to the input devices were seemlessConsI found the game to be practically unusable without a controller in its vanilla state\nRe-mapping the keys was clunky as it kept taking single key presses twice, mapping the same key to different controls.\nActual playing area only uses part of the screen availableMarks Out Of 5\n5) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this\n4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase\n3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted\n2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away free\n\nWhere I got the game from\nI won this game at Steam Gifts[www.steamgifts.com]\n\nPlatform Played On\nIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Steelseries MERC keyboard/XBox Controller For PC.
