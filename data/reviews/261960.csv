You begin your quest mostly without direction. You interact with other cubes and surface-dwellers. You start to color in the environments. You meet a tiny thing and discover there may be more to them to meet the eye. It all seems like something very clever is beneath the surface, but as the hours went by, I couldn't find it. Like the other reviews say, achievements are broken. Even after you decode the language of the tiny things, not much is revealed other than cryptic laments.\n\nAs you collect currency and stars and such relics, you eventually feel the grind and pointlessness of your quest. You can spend hours coloring in the world...but when you figure out how to open the map and figure out how the big world is....you release you could easily spend another large quantity of hours filling in all the empty spaces. And for what? The tediousness of my journey weighs heavily on my cube-like shoulders, and it is with much regret that I finally ceased to roll across the plains.\n\nCube and Star feels like it aspires to something great but then maddeningly keeps it forever out of reach of the player.","June 21, 2014","false","4.6"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","40","48","0","3"

Instead of just leaving it at that though, I'll try to put what I feel in words. This game seems like it was developed to be the ulitmate abstract expression of both the 90's "collect-a-thon" platformers and the modern open-world "sandbox" games.  It's minimalistic aesthetic serves well the feeling of exploration and the occasional bits of story you recieve from journal pieces and conversations are tantalizing enough to entice you to find them all and piece together the entirety of the narrative.\n\nWhile the gameplay so far has never diversed from "roll around, color, collect, talk" I don't think it needs to, it's a testament to the philosophy that simplicity is key and sometimes overthought in the game design process isn't required. In addition to the of the world beng a clever mechanic, it also lends a hand to the relaxing nature of the game and imparts a sense of ownership as no two worlds will be the same and you can feel proud of your coloring as you traverse your world.\n\nThere really isn't much negative to say about the game, but one should be informed the game has no save mechanic. This is by design and I really don't think it needs to have saving, but definitely make sure to make time for this game because all of your work will be lost upon closing. (edit: ive been informed this is no longer the case and the game saves on exit. YAY!)\n\nThat's really all I have to say about Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love. I don't think this will win over some gamers but I would encourage everyone to at least try it. What's here is something that to the best of my knowledge hasn't been done before, and the results come together in a delightful and fascinating way.","February 15, 2014","true","0.5"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","2"

At the time of this review, the game came out five days ago.\n\nFirstly, this game needs a patch.  Secondly, if you read the other reviews you'll notice that they all talk about how colorful and/or pretty the game is.  Yes... this game is both colorful and pretty.  But that's it.\n\nThe game offers nothing in the way of plot, gives you no motivation to explore other than to complete your map, and has very little in the way of interaction between you and the environment.\n\nThere is no options menu, the game forgets your music settings and always launches with music "on", I found three different bugs, experienced one crash, and most importantly lost some of my interface because I can't change the graphics settings (because there ARE NO GRAPHICS SETTINGS) and the HUD icons fall off the right side of my screen.\n\nThe three bugs I found were a missing "congratulations panel" when you find all the lore icons, I went invisible while "talking" with one of the NPC critters, and I have found several dozen "invisible trees" where they are there but not displayed.\n\nThe cryptography puzzle was laughably easy and solved in under four minutes.\n\nThis game's fatal flaw: filling in 100% of the map is almost impossible because the creatures that paint the world in their own right don't count toward your "fill" percentage and yet they have painted the tile so you can't visually tell which tiles you have missed.  I got to 91.30% map completion in six hours and getting the last 8.7% is not going to happen because I'm done with this game.","February 19, 2014","false","8.4"," 44 of 70 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","44","70","0","0"

I bought it solo on IndieGameStand for $1 because it looked great.\nThis interactive screensaver (**not game) is tolerable for $2-3. $5 is too much\n\nThis application is like an alpha concept demo.  LIke wandering through a 1st person shooter with no bullets or melee, you get a good sense of feel of the presentation without any game mechanics implemented.\n\nThe gameplay is missing.  Like a small developer who had a beautiful project envisioned which he never had time to finish.  Rather than junk all the work, he/she releases the incomplete alpha app (avoiding the word 'game').  I get it. Developing a game is tough; life moves forward; the author must eat; other priorities overshadow this project.  I think it is a beautiful project.  Sell the Alpha for $1 maybe and perhaps finish it at a later date.\n\nIf the author were to finish the game, I envision a bear eating berries and having a transformative effect on the environment.  Or a bee or collection of bees pollinating the neighborhood and effecting change on the makeup of the flora.  (The dev is like a bee--he works very hard, and we gamers come expecting delicious honey for next to nothing $$ and do not care whether the worker starves for his hard work.  I actually applaud what the author started here.)\n\nHowever, again, there is NO real game mechanic.  I read the reviews that say this app was meant to behave as a tranquil zen sandbox--No, that is a cop-out excuse for a demo released before it had a game built around the concept.\n\nI have extra time on my hands, so I can drop my 12 hours into this game for even Zen foolishness.  Most of you cannot--play 15-30 minutes of this, then Uninstall.  The app is like painting your house with a trimming brush and full set of watercolors.  It takes forever but you end up with a nice kaleidoscope result.  That is all that happens.\n\nThe app even mocks you with fake/useless collectibles and makes parallel references to the futility of life.  Why not take this beautiful app as the pollen/seed spreader and tack on a few simple game mechanics.  (ex: Cultivate this red plant in the NE side of the garden.  The Blue plants and ladybugs and animals flourish as you succeed.)  Something weak and simple but producing/accomplishing a small goal.  Rinse and repeat for a few dozen challenges.  The sandbox all works mostly the same, but gives some reason to play or some bother to polinate/transfer/spread each plant color.\n\nInstead, there are no instructions--nothing accomplished--All the plants, bushes and trees have their own inherent colors that do not change.  Your only action is to paint a hue to the ground/grass beneath them by picking nearby color from a unchangeable plant.  As you paint, there are 100 other bugs slowly painting the areas that you have brought to life--so you have no real control of color.\n\nInstead, you paint the world with a tiny trim brush. Do a little--then do a lot until you see that it is not getting any better but the world is incomplete, so one might grind for the futility of a full color completion.  The world needs to be 5 to 10 times smaller because it takes too damn long for no better finished result.\n\nPursuit of Achievements is a silly set of badges in many games.  There are a plethora of nonsensical achievements.  "Make a swollen and fertile world" 0/50 What?! How would any of this be accomplished? "Sprinkle a modest joy over the world" 0/20. It wants you to cover 20% of the world with Yellow.  Over half of the areas are painted by bugs with a semi-permanent color which the player cannot change.  So, how would I get 20% of the world yellow?  Most of the achievements revolve around a find-a-needle-in-a-haystack subgame.  After walking the whole world around and making small interactions--you will quickly accomplish quite a few nonsense achievement. (Bump into 1 beetle.)\n\nThe only controls are WASD (configurable + controller)    Remember I have the luxury of doing nothing but wander for hours WASD, redipping the paintbrush every few feet,  After revealing color to the world 6 hours later, I was about to uninstall the app.  4 of the needles-needles-in-the-haystack are colored runes that go into the useless stacks of Zen sayings, Zen history, Zen coins, Zen jewels, Zen artifacts.  All useless.\n\nSPOILER ALERT that should have been put in the nonexistant instructions/tutorial:\n6 hours done, ready to uninstall, it turns out, that if you click the 4 Runes while standing still 6 times, your paintbrush will drop a few paintballs which will bounce around and change a small to medium area around you.  It is random--so you have a new tool which just introduces more randomness into the world.  Not a means to guide the color development.  Now there is a population of little people that walk around with their paintbrushes too.  So, instead of competing with the 300 bugs, you now also compete with 100s of "LittleThings" that also shift the colors of the environment.  No control.  Just beautiful paints wandering the canvas--with your tiny ability to shift the localized colors a bit.  The rest of the world shifts as it wants.\n\nKeep doing that for hours instead crafting the look of the gardens, or making honey, or scaring a competing hive out of the neighborhood, or stinging the brutish humans who trample the gardens.  All of these mechanics are missing.\n\nBeautiful interactive screensaver game though. 4/10.","March 24, 2015","false","25.8"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","16","21","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbszine/recommended/261960/","sbszine","sbszine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sbszine/","492 products in account","Like Noby Noby Boy and Mountain, this is a toy more than a game. It's a constantly changing environment to interact with, where your cube bumps into stranger and stranger things as you explore the world further. You can influence the world in various ways, but it's a subtle, slow influence, especially compared to the industrious gardening of the game's other characters. So it's a zen game, something to switch off and relax with, an antidote to hours of SpaceChem brainburn. On another level, it's also a commentary on the psychology of achievements. Why collect coins that can never be spent? In a game about spreading colour and life, does it make sense to burn and kill things to unlock one achievement among a hundred?\n\nI think this is going to to have limited appeal. In particular, if you absolutely need action, or character progression, or puzzles, or a story -- any of the things that constitute a game -- then look elsewhere. But in its best moments, Cube & Star goes beyond all that to capture the feeling of ambling along the shore, picking up shells and bits of wrack.","November 18, 2014","true","2.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The game has multiple kinds of collectibles, most of which only show up after you've colored in random tiles. Unfortunately, once you've started coloring in the map, all the activity going on makes it hard to find the rest of them, so I was never able to finish the Diary or the History collectables to read the full story,\n\nI don't know if the game is worth $5, and I definitely wouldn't recommend trying to 100% this unless you REALLY want to meticulously color in the MASSIVE map to get each of the collectibles.\n\nBut if you just want a chill coloring game to relax to, and have some spare time, you will enjoy this.\n\n","June 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

You start out knowing nothing. It tells you to move with the arrow keys and that's it. Awesome! So I go exploring and see little foreign cubes and pyramids and wormy things. Awesome! I approach one and see four little stats or something appear above it, with little symbols by each stats. I don't know what those mean, but great! More mystery! Some of the little cubes speak a different language. I find out I can collect little foreign sentences, which will help me decode the language. Great concept! I wanted to find all the sentences!\n\nBut then I found a coin. Great! What's this do? I see a menu appear on the right of the screen. 1/100 next to a coin picture... Oh. Well. That's a lot of coins. What do they do? Then I find a relic. 1/250 or some high number like that. What?? A gem: 1/75. What is this? I don't care about any of that. But that's the majority of the game. Explore new areas (they all look the same: grey until you get there and add color) and collect useless stuff. I never could understand the foreign cubes (the translation tool was crap; a programmer needs to sit down for a week and make the interface more usable).

You start play plunked down on a gray world full of trees, and are functionally tasked with making it a colorful world by bumping colored trees, rolling over their colorful fruits, and then spreading that color to other trees. Your color fades to gray after a dozen or so moves, so you have to bump another tree.  Rinse and repeat.  And repeat. And repeat. And repeat for hours on end...\n\nAs you roll around, you collect random collectables that you collect because you get an achievement for collecting them all.  (Unless they disappear because some random critter activated the object outside your sight range, and then you can never collect 100%.)\n\nThe game world is huge, which is something of a negative, because, with gameplay from start to finish basically consisting of just bumping trees and spreading color, I ran out of interest in the game before I could cover the world in color or get any of my completion.  There's a "mystery" to uncover by collecting journal bits, but it just doesn't have enough suspense or reason for players to care to carry the player to the finish line.  Unlike a lot of other reviewers, I actually managed to decypher the language... and was not particularly impressed by the results.

Now, if you 're familair with my tastes in games, you know it's a genre I appreciate: I can't sing enough praises for "Papers, Please", and I really liked "Flowers", for example.\n\nCube & Star is nothing like those. It's a pretentious mess that mistakes random word juxtaposition for poetry. You're a cube and your goal is to... what? color the world? collect useless junk? It's never quite clear. The only marks of your progress are the collectibles you gather. These show up every x steps. With x being random.

What purpose does it serve? Probably none.\n\nI suppose you begin to see a pattern: there's nothing that makes sense, there is no challenge, no reward, no loving craft that was used to shape the world.

However it is still a fine work of art that can hold its own in the world of games.","October 13, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is a very simple yet complex game.  The controls are few and guidance is absent which leaves most players lost looking for the point.  I was drawn to Cube & Star by the beautiful design and the colors; I played because I enjoyed spreading the color.  The question this game brings up is "What is the point?"  Cube & Star is similar to life, the search for meaning.  As I spread color, I discovered the purpose of the tiles that I collected- they create life.  Originally, I only payed attention to my effect on the landscape but soon found out that the game is more widespread than that.  Now I watch as each action my cube takes affects the entire realm of the game from changing simple colors to creating life that changes the face of the map in their own way.  This is a game for people who enjoy the search for purpose.","October 1, 2014","true","14.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Its a sandbox where your free to color the world however you see fit!  At its core the mechanics involve collecting which are your way of interacting with a living, breathing, highly abstract world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/261960/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Cube & Star: An Arbitrary Love is more of a sandbox than a traditional game. And this sandbox can also be seen as a metaphor for life. Which is a weird thing, and sets it as a very ambitious game from the very start.\n\nNow, whether or not this is my type of game, or I enjoyed its execution, let there be no doubt that this is certainly unique, and has its head on its shoulders.\nIf you're looking for a good, traditional game, this is definitely not for you. On the other hand, if you like playing interesting games, with unique concepts, regardless of a flawless execution, then give this one a try.\n\nI decided to give a conclusion right at the start, because I honestly don't know if I should recommend the game. As a result, there you have the disclaimer. If you're still interested in reading my more in-depth thoughts about the game, go right ahead.\n\n\n\nFrom an audio-visual standpoint, Cube & Star is a very minimalistic game, with a very relaxing feel to it. There's no tension, no horror, no fast-paced action. You take thing as they come, and just hopefully enjoy the ride.\nThere are no visual settings or anything, but from how the game looks, I don't think there's any need for it. It doesn't have crazy lighting and particles effects or anything of the sort. But it works, and I thought it looked pretty cool, specially seeing the world fading away in the horizon.\n\nIf I have one complaint, is that the colors can be a bit blurred at night, making it hard to distinguish between them. But again, that's how night time is.\n\nDespite being very simple, I was satisfied about how it looked and sounded.\n\n\n\nGameplay is a weird one for me. You're thrown into a very cryptic world with no goals, no enemies, no friends, no direction at all. The sky is the limit, they say. Oh, and you're a Cube.\n\nThe first apparent objective for the player is to try and color the whole world. By hitting trees, they can drop either stars, or color "seeds". If you pick them up, your cube changes color, and spreads it as you walk by, progressively getting weaker, until it fades away and you need to pick more seeds. And I'll try to keep it more or less spoiler free.\nOn the world, there are other creatures, each of them with their own purpose. Some are trying to carve colored paths, others are trying to erase the world of all color.\n\nYou can talk to each creature, and they'll give you simple phrases about their purpose in life. Mostly flavor text, but it's a nice detail, and well written.\n\nBesides, there are also lots of collectibles in the form of history pages about the world's previous civilization, coins, gems, trophies, and each of them reflects on an arbitrary aspect of life, regarding work, greed, lack of purpose, etc.\nThese collectibles appear when you color the respective square on the ground. So, as you're coloring the world, you'll get these. Why? I don't know. Do you? Must there be a purpose?\nAnd I think these are the question that serve as pillars to this game.\n\n\nAside from these collectibles, you'll also get 4 powers. These powers essentially make you a God, and let you shape the world as you will. Along with this, there's a "shore list", or an "achievement list", to give you some purpose, if you need it. It guides you in playing a game in certain way, and it's a good thing, if you don't like being completely lost all the time.\n\nYou're a God. A purpose-less one, but a God nonetheless. You can create civilizations, you can burn them, you can just let the game play out and feel happy to be a passive observer. And that can be relaxing.\nIf you like the sound of this concept, you might enjoy the game.\n\n\nBut it was not very much to my taste, to be honest, and there's why.\nThe world is pretty huge, which can make it a bit too time consuming to walk from one point to another. As you color it, there's a map, with colored and grey zones. This is supposed to send you in a direction if you're missing something. But, since there are creatures undoing your work (in a very minimal way), you can never be sure where exactly you need to go, after a certain point, and there are a lot of people getting stuck at 90% of the world, and the sort.\nThe same goes with the collectibles. If you don't know what's left to color, you don't know where the rest of the collectibles are.\nAnd, since the game is mostly about collectibles and coloring the whole world, it can feel like a shore.\n\nNow, it only feels like a shore if this is not your type of game, of course. I can see this being a very good game for some people. It has a lot to do, many interactions with the living world, with the colors, with everything. There's a lot that can be done!\nBut I feel like this appeals to a very niche market.\n\nFor everyone else, once you figure out more of less what to do, the game loses a bit of its compelling nature, since it's simply too laborious to achieve its purposes, once you set them.\nThis is a game to play without purpose, honestly. It's a game for you to be immersed in, relax, and go in and out of it at will. Just enjoying your stay. And that's fine. I think it works for some people, just not for me.\n\nThe game feels too big for what it is, and it can at times feel a bit empty. The map is very messy, as I stated. Besides, most of the achievements do not trigger outside of the game, which can be disencouraging for some people, so take that in mind.\n\nAlso, note this, as I think it might be important: Most of the positive reviews have a very small amount of time into the game. These people have most likely appreciated for what it is for a short time, but rapidly moved on into something else.\n\n\n\nSo yeah. Be careful if you feel like picking it up. The game has a very unique and interesting concept, but it is definitely not for everyone, and definitely not for me. If this feels like you cup of tea, go right ahead. There's a lot that can be done, and you can get a huge amount of time for your money, if you want to do everything there is to do.\nOtherwise, I don't think I'd recommend it. I enjoyed going through it, it was interesting, and refreshing. But I doubt that I'll play it again, and I certainly have left tons of content unseen.\n\n\n","April 26, 2014","true","5.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Nudge trees slowly, collect the colour that falls from them, and paint the world until the colour runs out.  Repeat.  It is the very definition of grinding, only with no real goal in sight.\n\nThere are some redeeming qualities: it is pretty, and the music is tranquil, fitting with the zen-like feel.  Unfortunately that wears thin quickly as there is precious little actual game-play.  The little bits of text you unlock are simply small statements designed perhaps to evoke deeper thought, but there really isn't much to them and they don't add much to the experience.\n\nSome would say it is art, but to me it is a game without actual gameplay.  Evocative statements and abstract graphics cannot make up for the fact that there is simply little to do, and what there is is so drawn out you would need to grind for hours and hours just to see it.  It simply tries too hard.\n\nThe trailer shows all sorts of interesting parts of the game that I suspect are many hours away.  Getting there is simply not that interesting, and takes too long.","May 30, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is definitely a casual game, and it's very telling that most of the people who don't recommend this game have more playtime on it than the ones who do.\n\nThe piece is quite abstract, featuring generic solids with a pastel color pallete.   The gameplay is completely open world, with the vague goal of making the grey grid of squares a little less depressing, and no particular end to that.\n\nThroughout the game, you're peppered with little bits of backstory written in a simple substitution cypher, and a ton of incredibly generic but nearly universally applicable bits of life-advice, generally aimed at convincing you to be less boring.\n\nI don't recommend this game.  It's an experience that is surpassed in nearly every way by reading a self-help book under a tree in the park.\n\nHowever, if you've watched the trailer, and the idea of moving the cube around is more appealing to you than a cheap sandwich, you'll definitely get your money's worth.","March 8","false","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
