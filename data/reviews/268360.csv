The player in the lead creates the track as they drive. When the time limit is up, the finish line is created and first car there gets a point. Then you race the track you just built in reverse... first car to the previous start gets a point and you keep going to build more race track in that direction. This repeats a few times, so the track gets longer each round. The trick is trying to remember the layout so that you can fly between sections of the track and skip over huge chunks.","March 31, 2014","true","1.4"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","37","42","0","0"

I'll hand it to them; they gave the great impression of a game that promises high speed racing with the allure that, if you fly off the track, you can gracefully fly like a bird and reclaim victory from the jaws of defeat.\n\nLies.\n\nLies and deciet.\n\nStarting out the game, I headed to singleplayer; I heard multiplayer was basically non-existant, and I wanted get a grip on the controls, see how the mechanics worked.\n\n...The controls are GARBAGE. Your car is not a car; it is a block of ice with a motor and it is HORRIBLY unbalanced in the air (one errant twitch, not going perfectly straight? Your straight rise up becomes a tumble).\n\nThe first few levels try to teach you about how the car controls; turns and junk, have you pass through checkpoints. It'd be great if the car's turning wasn't ABYSMAL. Don't even think about using the brake, either; you just try to stop on a dime, and going fast and trying to make sharp turns with a that block of ice and a brake? You spin (like a record). You spin out, skid, stop. There goes your medal. Reset level.\n\nI had the patience to go an hour into the single player levels, and I didn't even get any flying action; it was awful turning with painfully slow acceleration (don't even get me started on boost pads coupled with tight turns; WHOOPS, THERE'S THE ENDLESS ABYSS) and a horribly slow restart back into the game.\n\nSuper Meat Kart this is not; you have to pause. Hit reset. Go back to the start of the level, wait five seconds to start again, go with your slow start...and inevitably, crash and burn, time and time again.\n\nI was stuck on one level, a seemingly simple thing: bunch of boosts up a ramp, platform on the other side. You'd think they'd get THAT right.\n\n...10 minutes. A sixth of my playtime. Dedicated to slowly accelerating to the boosts up, boosting up, rising...\n\nAnd hitting the tiny grey support platform in front of it, falling back down into the abyss, yet again. For ten minutes.\n\nI can finally see why people are skeptical about Early Access. You don't know what you're getting into, especially when a large percent of the reviews for this game are positive.\n\n...I dove into the abyss, and came out a bitter, angry man.\n\nI'll think of giving this game another shot when things aren't awful, but for now, for those reading this that're skeptical?\n\nBuy it. See for yourself. And after you're done, give the dev a pat on the back and show him how to do things better.\n\nMake something better than...this.","September 30, 2015","false","1.0"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","25","39","6","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/squidbulb/recommended/268360/","squidbulb","Cliff Excellent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/squidbulb/","396 products in account","Krautscape is a racing game in which you build the track as you drive. Also, your car can fly. It's a neat idea, but it's so terrible in practice. The physics are the worst I've ever seen in a racing game. When you're flying your carplane will veer off in the wrong direction for no apparent reason. I can't tell if it's just buggy or if the game is supposed to be simulating wind, and doing a very poor job of it. Even on land the car controls like a giant icecube with a steering wheel attached. The trailer shows the car flying gracefully into the air like a bird, and doing sweet drifts to send the track exactly where they want it to go. None of this ever happens in the game. Attempting to drive around a corner is a horrible experience. And if you fall off the track (you will) you get sent right to the back. Not behind the last racer, right at the start of the track. The track does disappear when you drive over it, but if you're in the air, this doesn't happen. So if you attempt to skip a section of track by flying over it and you mess it up... you're gonna have to do it all again.\n\nI should explain how the the track building works. It chooses the next piece based on which part of the track the leader is driving on. If they drive on the left, the track curves to the left. But there's absolutely no reason to do this, it only makes your opponents more likely to overtake you. If you curve the track, you're gonna have to slow down to make the turn without falling off, giving your more reckless opponents a chance to zoom past you. Or you can risk falling off and waiting for your car to slowly respawn. Plus, it's probably just going to put your section of track closer to previous sections, making it easier for other racers to fly over and catch up. If you just drive in a straight line without curving at all, there's nothing the other racers can do to overtake you. There are no items or boosts that might help even things out. All you can do is keep driving and hope they somehow ♥♥♥♥ up. But because the leader never has to fly or make unexpected turns, their chance of ♥♥♥♥ing up is much lower than yours. When someone gets in the lead, they tend to stay in the lead.\n\nAnd then the final nail in the coffin: the multiplayer is dead. I have never seen a multiplayer game this dead. I could only find two people playing it, and they were just repeating the same mode over and over again. And of course there's no map variation to keep things interesting. There's a single player, but no AI racers. All you can do is drive the tracks on your own. Not much fun.\n\nI played for less than 2 hours so I could get a refund, but I could tell my opinion wasn't going to change. Great idea let down by terrible execution.","April 5","false","0.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

This is a racing game (with flying cars, I might add) where you have no speed indicator and the controls essentially prohibit precision braking, accelerating, and turning, making it extraordinarily difficult to stay on a track that has a lot of tight corners.\n\nThe track is created by the player currently in first in this racing game.  That player can create sharp or gradual turns, straight track, and occasionally loops or jumps.  I expected the lead player to have some extra controls to cycle through track choices for the next leg, but instead the track is generated based on where the player drives on the course.  If you drive on the far left, you create a sharp left turn.  If you drive slightly left of center, you create a gradual left turn.  This is  pretty much the worst way you could possibly build track, because anyone who has ever played a racing game knows you start sharp turns from the opposite side, so the lead player has no incentive to ever make the track turn because it would cause him to crash into the wall!\n\nThis horrendous oversight in game mechanics all assumes you could even play a multiplayer game.  I have sat for over 30 minutes on the  “Waiting for Players” screen and only once got a multiplayer game going, but the player dropped out of the race shortly after it began.  This is probably because the stupid controls are unmanageable and the cars are all identical, thus there is no way to catch up when you inevitably fall behind unless the other player also makes a grievous mistake.  There are no power ups, no speed boosts, no anything that could give you an advantage or help even the race.  I’m guessing multiplayer would be a lot more fun than solo, but it seems this game isn’t nearly enjoyable enough to keep enough players interested in joining multiplayer sessions.  Perhaps it might be fun if you and 3 of your closest friends collectively waste $$ on this game, but probably not.\n\nThe solo levels are also garbage.  The game forces you to earn a medal on a level before the next one opens up.  This means that sooner rather than later you will get stuck and be unable to progress.\n\nThe Cars-with-wings aspect is kind of cool, but flying slows you down to about half normal speed, so you have no reason to ever fly unless there is a jump in the course.  Also, the car constantly veers in a completely unexpected direction when you attempt to steer while flying, so that sucks too.","June 5","false","0.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The flying is awful, you basically turn into a brick with minimal gliding functionality.\n\nNot really any way I'm aware of to connect to specific people i.e. friends, just queue up for game types, and often enough nobody else queueing up anyway.

The track generation is just so fun to play with, and it's a blast to see what crazy world willl be generated. And then to just fly across it, finding your own "secret shortcuts" is just amazing and fun.\n\nRight now, it's better to play with friends than online, as being in early access, you'll only encounter the same players over and over, being stuck against people who constantly win. Worse yet, you often find every other game type is empty while one has the only players playing. This is a fault of early access and should be remidied in the future as the game progresses and gains more players, but it is something to note at this time.\n\nEdit: Currently, NOBODY plays this game. Which is sad. It's very hard to find anyone to play with at all.\n\nThere is no single player, so you'll always be playing online unless you've got a joypad and a friend, so be prepared for that.\nIf you can get past all that, the game is great in this state, and I can see it getting better as the game gets updated as well as gets more players.","April 6, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyTerabyte/recommended/268360/","CrazyTerabyte","Denilson Sá","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyTerabyte/","919 products in account","You have two main vehicles: a car, and a car with wings.\n\nYou drive an abstract vehicle on an abstract track floating on an empty abstract world.\n\nHowever, for a racing game, this game has several flaws:\n- No HUD for the target times (gold/silver/bronze). The times are only shown AFTER you complete the race. So, there is no way to see if you are doing well or if you should restart the track early. In other words, the game forces the player to waste time.\n- No HUD for the current speed. I can't know for sure if my strategy is better or worse, nor can I know if I am too fast for the next turn, just because I have no way to measure it. This quickly becomes a blind trial-and-error, wasting your time.\n- Upon the start of the race, or after hitting the RESTART button after finishing a race, there is a 5-second waiting time until you can move. Again, this is the game forcing you to waste time. Fortunately, if you hit Backspace (or gamepad Y) while racing, you get a "fast restart", where there is only a much more reasonable 1-second delay.\n- You have to beat the Bronze time in order to progress. However, the times are pretty tight, so most (casual?) players won't ever beat those times.\n- The wings of the car, when retracted, fold up, obscuring some essential portions of the view area.\n- Although the game can be controlled with an analog input device, the control itself is digital. It doesn't matter if you slightly turn your analog stick (or racing wheel), the car will either go straight or fully turn the wheels.\n- The settings screen only has the predefined Unity settings. No way to fine-tune the graphics.\n\nI want to support indie devs, but I must be honest: I didn't like this game.\n\nOverall, my feeling while playing it was: "Why am I playing this inferior game? I should be playing TrackMania instead."\n\nSure, TrackMania doesn't have a flying car, but it is a much more enjoyable, much more polished, and a much better experience. Go play TrackMania instead of Krautscape.","May 23","false","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.\n2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).\n\nPrepare the cookie dough layer:\n3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).\n4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces. Keep brownies slices covered and chilled until ready to serve.","August 13, 2015","true","3.1"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","54","14","26","18","0"

It's like a heavily modified trackmania, but lacks some of the most vital parts for this kind of game to really work out.\n\nOk let's dive in shall we??\n\nIs it like trackmania?\nYou bet your sweet ♥♥♥ it is. Well, at least its got all those big windey tracks and sick loops that it has. the driving is more like a copy and paste script that you can easily find on the Unity3D Forums. the turning is for ♥♥♥♥, and the driving is all around arcade-like, so thats no fun.\n\nbut wait? Isnt this a driving game?\nYEAH! and thats whats so frustrating. I firmly believe that in order to make an effective driving game, you have to include more than stop, go, and shift. Unfortunately for you, there is barely a brake to even use. Either youre going 120 mph or youre dead stopped and turned around 180 degress.\n\nBut wait! Theres more!\nIndeed! Theres a flying aspect to it! Sounds neat, but I havent gotten around to that so I'll keep you posted.\n\nOk so thats neat-o. So like, can you make your own tracks and stuff?\n"Hell nah, son. I havent been able to find a Copy-paste script on the Unity3D forums yet. But when I do...."\nI really wouldnt consider this a game, as much as I would a project for your 3d Game Development 101 final. It's something that should have been ported over to Iphone because there are obtainable medals, and there is so little content that the only thing you will find in this game is premade tracks, some driving mechanics, and a setting page that includes all of the Unity3D preset settings. Classy.\n\nNow I'm not totally filled with disgust for this game. I can be a happy guy.\nMr. Mario von Rickenbach was so kind enough to include a multiplayer option, where you can both either go head to head, or race other people, and do a derby maybe??? I actually dont know because there isnt a single soul who is online in the game.\n\nPlus, there is enough track to keep you happy for 3 hours at the least. thats just below the threshold to refund the game.\n\nJust dont let these screenshots fool you, because this is blatently a game from a guy who just jumped out of a long twitter battle with one of his #indiedev buddies and won the battle by using justunfollow.me to DM blast everyone to rate this game on greenlight.\n\nNow I could be wrong, I could be right, but heres what you should know:\nIf I missed anything (In which I'm damn sure I did) let me know.

The controls are good, though i preferred the xbox controller to the keyboard.  Audio is good and gameplay gradually builds so you are challenged but not overwhelmingly so.  I just played a few of the flying tracks and found that to be quite fun as well.  This is much better than your average indiegala first tier game, or 2nd tier for that matter.

Krautscape is an action-packed racing game with bird-like flying cars, focused on competitive multiplayer gameplay. The leading player actively builds the racetrack while the chasing players can take shortcuts by flying off the track to overcome obstacles. But the track is needed to score and to get speed – the vehicles don't have any thrusters to accelerate while flying. The three multiplayer game modes are designed to support nonlinear gameplay and intelligent movement instead of forcing you to drive perfectly. - Recommended!","November 27, 2015","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game simply does not control well at all. You can't feel the road at all and it feels as through you are sliding around on ice most of the time. A racing game needs to have tight controls that help you feel the road. This game does not. Add to the list of cons a progression system that forces you to replay annoying tracks over and over again until you hit a set time before you can progress onto the next track. If it played as good as it looked, there would be a lot to like here. Unfortunately the controls leave me disappointed.","September 16, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

If your not into checkpoint races or multi-player and thus like me then do not get this game as that is all the single player really is. I have no idea if the multi-player is alright or not, but what little of the single player I did play was killed for me by having to meet near impossible time trial goals for medals to unlock the next levels. The difficulty with meeting said goals lies with steering the damnable car itslef, which turns a little better then I imagine a lead brick might. Overall I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they really like simple but incredibly frustrating (challenging) control scemes. Also the flying isn't really flying, at best it's gliding with style and only really usuable on tracks where you are meant to use it and only when you are meant to use it. That said my experience only involves the first 1st or 2nd levels of each type of game mode as I just literally could not get passed them so I can't claim any sort of deep knowledge here but perhaps that speaks for itself in a way.\n","March 2","false","0.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"

Good idea of race tracks. Gives off a new kind of high.\n\nDislikes: Needs to improve on building tracks (like the tutorial needs to teach players how to finish tracks, I couldn't finish nor save any tracks), there needs to be different types of racing vehicles, It felt like a mix between FWD and AWD, but turning mechanics was awkward. I would enter a corner like a FWD, but exit like an AWD. Also, I wanted to know whether or not the wings had any effect on turning, wind resistance, drag coefficients, and downforce. There should be a menu on types of vehicles to choose and characteristics, like different style wings (concentrating more on mid air speed, turning speed, road speed, etc) mainly for individual racing benefits and disadvantages, this would make players think twice before choosing the best type of settings for the race. Building race tracks need more improvement for versatility, I ended up with bunch of turns that I didn't want, instead i wanted loops, jumps, etc. This would be excellent if it could incorporate building tracks like "Trackmania," it gives more control over how a track can be created, deleted, modified. Also, I felt some major lag while turning. Like, as the game went on, the memory started to stack upwards, then the turning would delay, maybe because it had to save, and build up memory while racing. I played this on highest graphic settings. I would love to see updates to improve on this. Also, I would like to see "key bindings" in options, because it took me a while to find out what "C" button did. Also, sound settings need improvement, like sound vs. bgm music. I turned off sound but i kept hearing acceleration sounds, beeping sounds, etc. If the game allowed drifting, even in midair.

I mean, really, really fun.\n- The play modes are all quite different from each other. With ping-pong in particular it's easy for the lead to change often, which is good.\n- Playtime can be short and still satisfying. I find it hard to find a game I really like that doesn't take hours for a good session, so this is a valuable trait in my book.\n\nAs others have said, it would be nice to have a bigger community playing online. I played it with a game partner at home and the LAN was a bit funky (he could join my game but I couldn't join his for some reason); I'm sure they'll get that sorted, though. I recommend without reservation.","October 10, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The multiplayer isn't too populated right now, but nonetheless it is very easy to get in a game with someone else.\n\nMy favorite part about this game is the local co-op/multiplayer. If you're looking for a game to play with friends and enjoy any type of racing game, I highly recommend picking up Krautscape. It's simple, easy to get into, rewarding to master, and really fun.\n\nI'm excited to see what the devs do for the future.","November 4, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
