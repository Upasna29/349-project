I have spent at least 200 hours playing this game by myself/ when I was younger and I instantly bought this game on steam.\n\nThere's an insane number of weapons to buy, you can level them up, you can purchase upgrades for your ship, pick a combination of weapons you like depending on your playstyle. There's also a good selection of bombs and missiles.\n\nThe music is amazing ( 30+ soundtracks from Machinae Supremacy, an amazing Sid Metal band, ) the replayability is good, they added achievements, trading cards, some tweaks and it works on 1920x1080 resolution. I recommend buying this game in a heartbeat if you liked any kind of space shooters because it's always been my favorite one and you will definately like it.\n\nAfter playing for an hour or so, I can tell it's just as good as I remember it, but, I also used to play on easy and I just tried hard, way too hard for me, normal offers me a fair challenge and the game is very enjoyable. :)","February 5, 2014","true","102.6"," 197 of 220 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","197","220","0","13"

Almost every level you beat will unlock another gun, missile or bomb to try out! All the weapons can be upgraded to do more damage, have a larger spread and just look more awesome! There are space missions, missions where bombs are a must to clear out land enemies, missions where you fly in a jetpack with 2 giant guns strapped to it... lol\n\nThere are secret ships, levels and weapons to find too!\n\nA lot of the ships have different powerups they can get and weapon slots... for example one ship might have 3 forward weapon slots and a bomb slot whereas another ship might have 2 forward slots, one rear slot and missile AND bomb slot. All ships have different hull integrity, heat sink and agility so that further sets them a part!

Well that would have to be this old runt of a shooter game.\n\nThis game is the closest equivalent of giving a shotgun to a hobo with crooked teeth and thinking it's a great idea. It stinks, it's ugly but damn it's awesome at the same time.\n\nWhat to expect when you fire this game up: Weird practice area where you can test gun setups. then a crappy looking shop that got a TV-Shop like selection of guns.\n\nSo grab some guns, test them if you like and go do some missions. Early missions will be hard as hell and the difficulty level will be kept quite high for quite some time - until you either read from guides what you should concentrate on - or buy and test guns until you find the ones that match your style.  Difficulty actualy goes down as go further into the game and kit your new ships better and learn the ropes. New challenging bosses come to yank the difficulty up but you are prepared. Or should be. Did i mention this game is quite hard - but fair if you do your testing/homework on the testing arena.\n\nStill have not completed the game but i do seem to be 2/3 trough at this time and it's been an awesome ride. I also expect to re-play this game at some point with different approach to loadouts.\n\nBest things last: this game is dirt cheap, is often discounted or found in the bundles. If you like shumps you really do MUST have this game in your library.  It really is that good that i will from now on use this game as a reference when comparing games.","November 20, 2014","true","11.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"

Don't believe me? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6oAcZ93hNY\n\nAs a sidescrolling shmup you're gonna see a lot of bullets but it's ok, your ship has tons of hp so being hit isn't instant death.\n\nThat's right you can get hit, and it's not that big a deal--as long as it isn't another ship ramming into you, if that happens you die in a frustrating instant.\n\nAs you progress you upgrade and swap your ship--you start rockin a little harder with each level. There's always more things to kill than your ship can fire at and to make things worse you end up juggling weapon cooldown. Lame.\n\nThe difficulty in this game stems from brief sections where the game floods you with tons of ships and bullets at the same time. You want to dodge the bullets but the only direction you can fly is into another ship, which will kill you faster than the bullets.\n\nOh and one more thing. There's a delay in pressing any directional button, frustrating imprecision I'd expect from an ice level in a shoddy platformer, not the super precise power genre of shmup games. Fix it or I'm calling a lawyer.","January 30, 2015","true","11.2"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","2"

Remember : there is no penalty in selling weapons (no money lost).

Oh, and just about the raddest and baddest soundtrack you'll ever hear for a videogame.\n\nJets N Guns Gold has by far more content and challenge to offer than just about any shooter before it, with a campaign that took me at least a year to complete on Normal.  This is a game you'll want to play multiple times, and upgrades/weapons carry over, so beating it on Easy is only the beginning.\n\nThe challenge is there in full force but without being too impossible for newcomers thanks to a hugely robust weapon catalogue and upgrade system, all it takes is a little tinkering and you'll be on your way to becoming a Jets N Guns master!","February 17, 2014","true","7.4"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","2"

There's also an occasional boss you'll have to fight, as well as several unique levels where you zip around in your spacesuit instead of being in your ship. Also like in Tyrian and Raptor, you have a rather ample supply of armor (and repair options), so it's quite a bit more comfortable to play than the Japanese-type 1-hit-and-you-dead shoot'em-ups.\n\nThe story is wacky and rather nonsensical, as are the weapon, level and enemy designs (there's a gun that literally shoots Superman clones, you pick up secret duckies along the way, and there's the borg-like alien race which is literally beer) and the game doesn't really take itself very seriously, but it creates a strangely interesting atmosphere which I really liked.\n\nIt's hard as nails, too! Don't expect any hand-holding, and expect to die and restart levels- or even the entire game, because you CAN screw up your ship build and it WILL turn out to be impossible to complete later levels if you don't know what you're doing. I recommend playing on a lower difficulty level to begin with and get familiar with the game mechanics (which boil down to "kill as many things as you can because you really need all the money you can get").\n\nI'm really glad this game found its way on Steam- it has my full recommendation!","December 25, 2015","true","15.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

If you like side-scrolling shoot em ups, or just crazy shooting mayhem in general, you really can't go wrong with it. Fair warning, it's damn hard! Play on easy if you can't take the challenge, but normal is just enormous fun. When you die, you're back in the action within a couple of seconds, and you'll thank the devs for that because you'll die a lot. The gameplay is complete madness, everything is trying to kill you, and when you shoot down anything or blow up any ground installation, the guys manning it stream out or fall to their deaths, and you can smear them across your windscreen or riddle them with plasma as you wish. Sounds gory, and it is, but it's pretty mild cartoon violence unless red pixels horrify you. Before long (ie. 5 seconds onto the start of the level) there are bullets, bodies and pixel blood spots flying everywhere, explosions and crashing planes triggering more explosions, all set to a rockin' heavy metal / chip soundtrack that still sounds great. If that doesn't appeal to you, you should probably seek therapy! Gameplay wise, each level begins with a shop where you can buy, sell or upgrade your weapons and a selection of fun components that do everything from highlight wanted bounty hunters to earning you millions by streaming your exploits to a TV show (!). More mundane components do things like improve your hull or heat dissipation. The varied selection of weapons, bombs and ships is essential to understand if you want to progress in the game, particularly on the harder difficulties, because specific ship / weapon setups are much better than others at handling certain levels, the fun lies in trying different combos. Can't get past that bit on level 2? Go back to the shop and try another combination. I suppose the only downside is due to the age of the game it doesn't support multiple resolutions, although you can play it windowed at native res or full screen at whatever resolution you're using. Frankly it looks fine, the art holds up well, and once the chaos begins you'll hardly notice.\n\nSo yeah, it's just about the most fun you can have while scrolling to the right. Highly recommended if you're remotely into this genre.","February 6, 2014","true","3.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It was the first game for me in this genre,\nwhich came close to the gameplay, atmosphere and sheer fun playing, without being\npunishing, since X-Out in 1989. And it is still the only one since then. There have\nbeen sidescrolling shooters in the last years, some lackluster, some quiet good.\n\nBut Jets'n'Guns just has the right parts, put together with a lot of heart, good design\nand an overall direction that lets it stand out.\n\nWith its beautiful 2d art it even stands the test of time and manages to still look\nbeautiful in 2014 on a resulation of 1900x1200. I even dare say, it looks better\nthan some titles in the genre of the last years.\n\nJets'n'Guns will keep you on your toes and lets you forget the time. With all\nthe customization and choices you have, you won't feel grim when you don't\nget it right the first time. It is one of the games, where you will try it\n'Just one more time'.\n\nThe soundtrack, composed by Machinae Supremacy, is another integral\npart that adds to the atmosphere and is also available free to download.","February 7, 2014","true","29.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Where do i begin?\n\nSoundtrack by Machinae Supremacy is absolutely a "must hear". Game is hard in beginnings (gets even harder in GOLD edition), but gets much easier and fur more rewarding later when you get access to top weapons (S.T.Y.X, Omnigun NT2, Tsunami generator...). Sometimes i catch myself just holding the fire button, randomly crashing in everything that is on the screen knowing it won't hurt me anyway and feasting upon an image of ultimate destruction and chaos - this is how i imagine apocalypse.\n\nNevertheless, I personally like the original version more, as it was a bit easier (didn't have to buy Mig and got it on the third level + get access to top weapons before finishing the game was nice). New levels in GOLD edition are not bad, they are just not as much fun. There are exceptions, of course, but mostly - it just prolongs the game time. I love new weapons, which, sadly, appear after you finish the game at least once, however their pricing is way - WAY - too high. You will find out, that in order to fully equip your ship with, for example hydra machinegun, you are going to have to finish the game like four times, which is absurd, since the power of that weapon doesn't get anywhere close to Tsunami beta, which is much cheaper. That said - there are some ubalanced things that need to be corrected.","December 13, 2014","true","20.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Great graphic style and music still hold up to this day, although some things are a tad dated (I'm looking at you, resolution).\n\nThe game has a fairly steep learning curve, with 3 starting difficulties (I went with hard and the first few levels were brutal until I got the hang of the game).  Shooting down ships earns the player precious credits, so depending on how OCD the player is, this may lead to an easy or difficult late game, although I think the game generally tends towards being slightly easier (especially leading up to the brutal last boss fight); if you're really stuck the game also lets you cheat fairly easily for the price of being branded a cheat and presumably disabling steam achievements.\n\nFor most of my hard mode playthrough, difficulty rose at an appropriate level to keep me challenged without being unfairly difficult, although some weapons are noticably better/worse than their counterparts.   You could take this as a positive or negative thing depending on your outlook; most weapons have a clear use for at least one difficulty setting/level and beyond that player can intentionally downgrade to flashier (and weaker) gun as a handicap or the cool factor.\n\nIt can be difficult to see enemy projectiles at times, but this is only really an issue when the player has lots of flashy weapons shooting at the same time, which I only really found a problem on the second playthrough, at which point you're pretty much invincible anyway.\n\nFor me, the game only stopped being enjoyable when it became too easy and I had time to be bored; this really only happened in my second playthrough where I cleared the hard waves instantly and then had nothing to do or dodge until the next wave spawned.  For this reason I'd suggest trying the game on at least normal or hard difficulty for maximum enjoyment and replay value.\n\nOverall I'd recommend this game if you're seeking a fun shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously and (mostly) challenges you in a fair way.","April 5","true","30.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You are unemployed, down on your luck, and left with no choice but to be a hired gun for the scum you were fighting against not so long ago.\nYour ship, if you can call it that, is all but falling apart. You have barely enough money for lunch, let alone a better gun... but if there is one thing this cesspit of a galaxy always needs, its a mercenary.\n\nSo off you go, doing what you can to get by, only to stumble upon a threat so huge it will literally destroy reality itself. Not only that, but it just so happens to be masterminded by the one target that got away from you and your Federal Hero allies all that time ago. Its time to go hunting.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nJnG is a sidescrolling 2D shoot 'em up, kinda like MetalSlug, but you are a spaceship, so... you can go anywhere on the screen. The screen itself will always be moving, except for a few boss fights.\nThe soundtrack of this game was pretty much entirely done by the awesome metal band "Machinae Supremacy", and is pulse pounding from start to finish.\nThe BRRRT, and ZZZZZTTT of the guns & the BTOOM, and KRAKOOM of the explosions are spot on.\nThe crazy light show you will be offered by your gigantic arsenal of weapons is beautiful in its own twisted way.\nThe universe you are thrown into is bizzare, but feels plausable. It is diverse and insane. One minute you are fighting your way out of a Dogman starport, the next you are busting through an insane perfectionist's persoanl spacestation/wardrobe, then you are jetting over a magma spewing fireplanet.\n\nAs you progress through the missions and even the playthroughs of the game (it auto puts you into a newgame+, you keep all your weapons/upgrades/etc) you unlock more and more tools of mass destruction, almost all of which can be upgraded in some way, from adding more barrels to your chaingun, to adding additional energy shielding to your ship, and many more inbetween.\n\nThis is the perfect game to blow off some steam, and to make you feel like an absolute badass.","September 9, 2014","true","19.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Choose a body, load it up with guns and fly out. ALSO, the game allows you to sell your stuff for the same price you bought it for, so go nuts and play around with the loadout to your hearts content. That alone made it a standout game and something to recommend to anyone new to shoot-em-ups.\n\nIf you’re a beginner, or just aren’t good at these types of games, start on “Too fat to die” so you can build currency. Every time you beat the game the game goes up a difficulty level and a good deal of them you can only access on beating the game through additional playthroughs and certain guns you can only get by playing on higher difficulties. ALSO your currency carries over in each playthrough.\n\nA word to the wise. Their are several segments where you’ll be asked to leave your ride for another one. While some can be annoying, others can be enjoyable and help break up the monotony. Also, aftr going through one that drove you nuts makes getting back to shooting everything in your own ship of choice that much sweeter.\n\nThe only complaint I have with the game is that once these segments are over, you need to retweak your ship and the fact that you cannot save loadouts. Its annoying, but not enough for me to turn people away from it.\n\nIts an old game, but its an old game that hold up VERY WELL. If you call yourself a fan of the shoot-em-up genre you are doing yourself a disservices by passing this up.","November 26, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For me it's the best Shoot 'em up released in the last decade. Ship and weapons are highly customizable and come in big numbers. Also, there are a lot of added game mechanics like hacking things with a device or opening cargo crates in a small mini game. Playing the game feels extremely rewarding for me, part of it comes surely from being able to splat tiny pixel people into pixel blood. The humour is pretty much tongue-in-cheek, but somehow manages it to not get too silly.\n\nAnd not to forget: the great soundtrack by Machinae Supremacy. Anyone loving chiptunes and/or metal should give this game a try for this soundtrack alone.\n\nOne thing I have to remark though is the high difficulty. This game is certainly not for the easily frustrated. But it never gets unfair and I always managed to beat the levels if I just played them enough. That's not common these days, but it was perfectly normal back in the days.\n\nBottom line: hard but rewarding horizontal shoot 'em up with great soundtrack.","February 15, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And sense of humor. And lots of blood, and dozens of levels, and metric ****ton of weapons, and space hot-dog as a possible ship (horrible, actually), and secret level where you can kill spammers. Basically, the best and last of its kind, I haven't seen a better one since JnG original release 9 years ago. A word of advice, don't flatter yourself and start the game on easy or normal, you'll have a chance to replay the higher difficulties (and then the hardest difficulties) as NewGame+ and the game can be brutal in the start. Don't be afraid to experiment with ships and loadouts (and don't forget you can and should upgrade the ship's systems), you can always sell everything at the same price you bought it - a simple mechanic that surprisingly few games uses right - and at least several levels need specific loadouts for you to be effective.\n\nThe negative side is that the game was released 9 years ago. The gameplay has aged very well, the graphics - not so. I strongly suggest to play it in window mode so you won't have to look at blurred 800x600 graphics in full screen. The game graphics itself are beautiful, but the scaling to higher resolutions could be better.\n\nLast thing: ok, I pirated this. About 8 years ago, I think, cause I've never seen the official game as a physical copy and I didn't have a credit/debit card for a long time. And it was one of the few games I actually felt terrible about, because I wanted to do everything I can to raise the chance of JnG2 happening. So now I'm finally buying this, and buying some copies for my friends (many of which have already played and loved it back then), and writing this review, and will actually spam some people about buying it. Just make a sequel and you'll have my money.","February 8, 2014","true","25.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have completed the game at least 20 times (over 120 hour playtime) and still enjoying.\nThis game is a side scrolling shoot them up game with lots of weapons, upgrades, enemies lots of hidden secrets en much more. What makes this shump so good? I will sum it up for you.\n\nGraphics/sounds/music:\nI love them all. Explosions are satisfying. Music are made from a real band!\n\nEnemies:\nA great variety of enemies. From tiny troops that you can kill by “touching” them with your ship to a horrific boss. During the game you will face pirates, aliens, mutants and even zombies! Ohh, zombies I really love them. There is a map with tons of them. They throw brains to you lol. Anyways in that map, you are willing to buy a tool “TV show cast” (can’t remember its name exactly). That tool will stream your killing action to the world as entertainment. For you as player, you will earn a  very nice amount of money for every multi kill. It goes from multikill (5 kills at once) to massacre (a lot of kills at once) to annihilation (name says all).\n\nWeapons:\nThe amount of different weapons is massive. At some point, you can buy weapons that the bosses has used against you.  How amazing is that? Those weapons can be upgraded. Some weapons can be upgraded 3 times, other more than 6 times.  What I love in this game is, you will never lose your money. Every weapons/upgrades you bought, you can sell it back for the price you have bought.  It means, you can try any combo infinitely. Believe me, you will need it on normal difficulty already.\nWeapons has four categories: Front, rear, bombs and missile\n\nShips:\nThese are really important. Different ships has different pros and cons. Some ships allows you to buy special tools, like ship repair, better shields, a time vortex to slow down the game on demand in hectic situation etc. Other ships allows you to carry more weapons from different weapon category (front, rear, and missile). Every ship has different amount of health/shield/heat sink.\n\nSecrets:\nThere are many different secrets in this game to be discovered. There are secret maps, no spoiler on this. There are secret weapons. I love the tomato shooter and the baseball stick. Both awesome and useless at the same time. However, there are strong secret weapons ingame. Secret weapons cannot be bought. You can only get them by finding them on specific missions. If you want x times of a secret weapon, you need to complete game x times. Secret ship models, gotta love it. if you ever wanted to fly in a ship like one of the bosses you have faced. I wish you good hunting to this secret.\n\nOther nice things:\nIn game, you can collect cargo that is locked. When you have finished the mission. You are willing to unlock these cargos. In order to unlock, you need to buy a Hacking tool. It is like a simplified mastermind game. Another nice thing is bounty hunter. You might catch a criminal. When you finished the game, you can do 2 things with him. Delivering him to the cops and claim the money prize or let the criminal bribe you. When you allow him to bribe you, you can get nothing or up to twice the money the cops are offering. Choose wisely…\nAlmost finished.\n\nReplay value:\nYou might be wondering why I completed the game more than 20 times and still playing.\nThere are three things that increase the replay value.\n1) Every time you have completed a game, you will continue at mission 1 with a higher difficulty. You have read it right, you will CONTINUE. It means that you keep everything that you have unlocked/bought. That is nice, you can test if your strongest weapon can handle the normal difficulty.\n2) Even more powerful  weapons will only be unlocked when you play the game for the second time. These weapons are strong, but it comes with a price. You need to complete the game several times to get enough money to buy x times of it + fully upgrade them. This will keep you busy for a while.\n3) Did you found all secret maps, ships and weapons? You want x times of that secret weapon? Then you need to complete the game x times.\n\nOverall, this shump is highly customizable. Very nice replay value with many secrets that keeps you busy.  Something I really like.\nGl hf\nNote: When you play this for the first time, I highly recommend easy difficulty.\n","February 5, 2014","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its style is reminiscent of western-style Amiga and DOS shmups - which may or may not be something you might be looking for if you are old enough to remember titles like X-Out, Project X, Tyrian, Star Gunner or Raptor.\n\nUnfortunately, JnGG has not improved upon those old games flaws which ment they were never quite reaching the quality of the japanese competetion in arcades and on consoles. JnGG is extremely hard to "read" - you can barely tell what is hitting you or if you are hitting things correctly. Enemy bullets are often very small and blend in with the busy backgrounds and enemies tend to soak up too much damage, which makes the early stages really frustrating. The focus of the game is also less about actual shooting gameplay, but more about amassing cash in order to buy weapons that do a lot of damage. Balancing is all over the place, and you should be well aware of and willing to experiment with tons of weapons and loadouts and not hestitate to reload if you wasted hard earned cash on a useless piece of kit. Seeing your ship "grow" stronger feels almost RPG-like, but I feel that a proper shmup should give you all tools from the get go and it is you that grows stronger and proficient in using the tools the game provides you with. I know the way JnGG handles things might be appealing to some, but as far as I am concerned I consider it a design flaw.\n\nI also do not care for the variety and would have prefered a limited set of weapons that have obvious uses - something along the lines of Hellfire, Thunderforce or Gradius. In the end it boils down to grinding money and overcoming a DMG-threshold in order to make it through the levels. Due to the vast amounts of weapons and loadouts, the stages and enemy attack patterns are simplistic and dull - we are talking Silkworm here, with particles like there is no tomorrow.\n\nA lot of the stages also take forever to complete and feel way too drawn out for what is essentially one of four types of levels that repeat like 10 times. Catchy tunes and explosions aside, the game itself is an incredibly boring shmup. And the focus on all kinds of gimmicks does not please me enough to overlook the glaring problems of JnGG that actually hurt its playability.\n\nIf you want to blow up stuff for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles JnGG has got you covered, but don't expect to find a competent shmup here (go and grab Crimzon Clover or Wolflame instead).","February 21, 2015","false","6.2"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","22","42","0","5"

Basicly what you need to do is to kill and destroy all enemies that fly at you. This is probably very usual in sidescrolling spaceadventure -games. Well what makes Jets'n'Guns stick out from the mass?\n\nWell in my opinion it's many things. Wide weapon arsenal, you've got many kinds of bombs, missiles, guns (even those are divided into smaller "groups", they aren't all just laser 1, laser 2...). You have different ships to choose from, you can collect new weapons and ships from the levels. You have "secrets" and secret levels ready for "picking up" scattered across the standard levels. You have several gadgets that you can use on your ship. Oh, and you can also upgrade almost everything you have purchased. I have probably missed some things here but that's my overall view on this, even though I haven't finished this game yet. One more thing I'd like to add - last but surely not least - when you buy something you can sell it back for FULL price. What this means is that you can test many sets of weapons and find the best for that particular level. ONE MORE! The music is just absolutely TERRIFIC! Same goes with the "graphics" or textures or what is it called. And the ingame jokes that are fitted in the "background" of the levels.\n\nWell, for the negative sides there are almost none. When I really push myself and try to come up with cons I mainly think of the fact that you can't choose the level you want to play like "I want to play level 24, it had cool graphics and a fun boss."\n\nThat's about it folks.

Sometimes it outright kicks you out of your spaceship to buzz around with a jetpack and two guns bigger than you are.\n\nThis thing got rejected from both Steam and GoG before for some reason.\n\nIt's also in my top three eye-searingly colorful games next to Cargo and Warframe.\n\nEDIT: OH YEAH, START ON EASY.

This game reminds me of when I was a kid and side scrollers were hard and fast and if you messed up. You restarted. This game is no less of that. Its hard and fast, but it has this curve that is very fun to beat. When you complete a mission in this game your rewarded with money and new stuff to slap on your junker of a ship. It blends RPG with a classic hectic side scroller and honestly, its fantastic. If your into old style hard action games, this is for you.

Great visual details, never boring variety and maximum action. I don't remember how many hours I spent with this but I finished it at least three times over.

It is an amazing cathartic destructive shmup with reasonably well writting humor and, my favorite part, a vast array of mechanized ways to tear a hole in the universe. including a gun that fires miniature universes! The game is incredibally fun and is damn near perfect in my opinion, however it has one crippling flaw, terrible gimmick levels that limit your gear, make you super weak, or even force you to do a race with absolutely no shooting where missing a single goalpost fails you and to win you have to memorize the pattern which you see for seconds at a time. Luckily those gimmick levels are few and far between and aside from the smirch they leave on the constantly exploding perfection of this game they are otherwise tedious but ignorable.

It does look somewhat out of date with a fixed resolution and no widescreen, but otherwise functions spiffingly, seems to map itself to Xinput controllers just fine, and most importantly, is still one of the most amazingly cathartic "blow ♥♥♥♥ up" scrolling shooters with an incredible soundtrack by Machinae Supremacy.\n\nThe game's central mechanic is flying from left to right and shooting stuff. Make no mistake though, it is BALLS hard and even the first couple levels will seriously test your mettle. The upgrades system is very smartly designed, letting you sell off anything you don't need for full price, so you're always free to strip yourself down and try an entirely different loadout, which I strongly recommend if you don't feel like you're properly equipped for a level. If you're just dying repeatedly out of the gate, remember: enemy bullets are bad, colliding with stuff is EXTREMELY BAD.\n\nI only have a few real complaints. It's sometimes hard to tell foreground from background, which is especially critical because COLLIDING WITH STUFF IS BAD. There isn't much meaningful feedback for what's causing you the most damage (hint: it's usually colliding with stuff, that you may or may not notice), and a few of the more gimmicky stages are pretty aggravating. That said, I still love it.","February 5, 2014","true","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Why?\n\nBecause shooting up stuff is just so damned satisfying! Not only do you shoot enemy ships, when you shoot them down the pilots will parachute out, and you can shoot or just ram them! There are enemy soldiers on the ground, and you can shoot (or ram) them, too! Or shoot down a ship so it crashes on them and explodes and they all die in a blazing inferno of fire, screaming for their lives! You can shoot up enemy buildings, and they'll explode, too (again: soldiers, fire, screams)! You can shoot up enemy cows! MOO *splort*! EVERYTHING EXPLODES! And then you do, too! Because it does get close to bullet hell levels of, um, challenging at points. But that's awesome, too!\n\nAlso, the music seriously rocks. SERIOUSLY. Look it up on Youtube. Or watch the trailer on Steam, or download the soundtrack from Machinae Supremacy's site, or whatever.\n\nYou also get to customize your ship and its weaponry and equipment to an extent rarely seen in shooters - the only thing that really compares, I think, is good old Tyrian 2000, and maybe some much newer stuff like Strike Vector.","February 10, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Tell you what, let me see if I can list all the bad things about this game. The graphics are kind of dated and low-res, but still inoffensive. The interface may take a little bit of learning. You can sometimes lose track of yourself in all the explosions and carnage you'll be causing, colliding with things hurts way harder than bullets, lasers or bombs for some reason, and the difficulty, like ye autoscroll shooters of olde, is hard as crud. And the English is a grade below mediocre, which isn't even important.\n\nThat's about it. There's an asston of weapons and you have a lot of freedom to configure them, and you don't even have to worry at all about spending because you can just put any of your equips right back. Machinae Supremacy graced the game with an extensive and absolutely bangin' soundtrack. All of the action is hilariously explosive and visceral. Most of the game's other humor is rather on-point as well, and the story makes just the right kind of space bravado unsense to be awesome. It's even quite long, and has a new game+. It all gels together in one old-school package that is just plain fun, especially for the price.

Maneuver the fire and survive, this game is about style, you will get variety of options to select from, do you worry about health recovery and surviving or shooting with massive power weapons in short times because the heater won't take it, or do you prefer to keep shooting all the time and try your best to dodge. Do you want your airplane to shoot on one side or do you like to rotate your weapons. you will find in the game when you play it that there is more than one way to destroy the enemy, sometimes firepower is not everything ... it is about firing at the right time, but the choice is yours if you just wana focus blindly on fire power and keep ur focus on better things like Survive ... or just wana play it risky and try to do smart moves and than find out if was smart or not. Do you care about getting as much cash as possible in every level or you just want to do the objective and save your skin ? the game give you some options to increase your cash. Each choice has its own cons and pros.\n\nEvery mission you will get a chance to buy\sell\upgrade your weapons\bombs\tools and the best thing if you don't like them you don't have to worry, you can sell them any time or downgrade your items any time with the same price without troubling you about money, so you can change your style from now and then and try new things. And you could test your airplane before you start the mission just click on the red button with T below your airplane to see if the cooling system is satisfying and if your firepower is good enough for you.\n\nThe game play is balance and the control is more than fine. In the game dialog between the levels they will give you part of the story and some tips about control and the game, it will show you how the game works slowly without boring you to death by forcing you to play a tutorial map before you could try the game.\n\nThe game is quite hard specially in the advance levels, don't expect to kill all enemies or collect all bonuses from the first game run, actually in some levels you will be lucky if you could pass them from the first time, learn about the levels than abort the map and adjust your style to fit, experience with the game and it will amaze you with the plants of options that gives you to play this game. Latter on after you finish the game they will let you start it over with all our upgrades and money in that time you could do whatever you want ... Finish all the level with one weapon with 0 damage, or whatever but if you just start it just try to survive I guess.\n\nStory:\nyes story, actually most of these games don't have a story but this one is quite amazing, it start slow at first and it just introduce you to the theme of the story and how things works in the game universe but it become more interesting in the advance. I know a lot of players ignore the story completely in those games but I don't advise that in here.\n\nMusic:\nohh my god, the music, one of the things that make this game an epic is the music mixed with the actions, I just love it. It always fit the theme of the level.\n\nBasically what I am saying this game really worth anyone time and it is fun, don't get scared when i said it is difficult you could put it easy if you are not a big fun of watching a screen with 100 bullets and play it on easy, the diffculty choice is yours but i advise you guys to try it on hard first, this game needs good eyes for watching not only the bullets, but what is going on as well, how enemys are dying and keep an eye for secreats and strange thigns too ... they are plenty of them in here.\n\nI am surprised why did steam put this low price on it, I would buy it even for 20 dollars it just worth that price.","February 5, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is brutally intense, the game is still pretty freaking hard and im no child anymore. The music is fantastic, sometimes i feel like this is a soundtrack with a wicked sweet game attached to it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenAngelEyes/recommended/262260/","FallenAngelEyes","FAE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenAngelEyes/","847 products in account","If you are a fan of old school style shmups with weapon/ship upgrades, GET THIS GAME. If you are a fan of Machinae Supremacy's music, GET THIS GAME. Even if you're not super into either of these things, GET THIS GAME. It is so, so worth it for the price because it's just that fun. I originally purchased this game back in 2006 when when the Jets'nGuns Gold edition came out.  I'm a huge fan of Machinae Supremacy's music and their metal+chiptune sound is perfect for this game. You can download the complete soundtrack for free on their website (http://www.machinaesupremacy.com/downloads/) and in fact, they did the music for the original game completely for free as well. I think it's a shame that they're not listed in the official Steam description here, so I thought it important to mention them. If you've played Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams, they contributed to that soundtrack along with Giana Sisters' original composer.\n\nThere are a ton of levels, weapons, and upgrades in the game, and a new game+ mechanic where it automatically bumps you up to the next difficulty after you finish the game. This allows you to use all the shiny stuff that you picked up and destroy things even more. There are some great mechanics in this game, like when you shoot down enemies, they will destroy things on the ground when you crash into them (and everything you destroy gives you money), and the store lets you sell things back and will refund you their full price (even after they're upgraded!) so you can feel free to switch out weapons at will. It also has a "test level" which you access from the store that has floating items with HP labels to kill, so you can approximate how much damage you're doing. Don't be afraid to experiment! The game isn't a cakewalk and can definitely be challenging, so you have to be flexible about your loadout in order to succeed.\n\nWhile the game only has partial controller support, I can confirm that the 360 controller works fine for flying/regular gameplay. It'll even control the cursor in the menus, though it's quicker to use the mouse for that. You can configure the flying controls for it as well, as they're not hard-coded. The maximum resolution is pretty small, but if you set the game to fullscreen, it upscales well and doesn't change your entire desktop to its own resolution (which is handy for me, as I run dual monitors).\n\nThere are secrets and collectibles to find, as well as achievements for the game that track progress and even when you die, progress towards stuff like the number of troops you have killed will save even when you die. The game is also really funny, as there are many jokes and cultural references in the game (though they may seem a bit dated, as the original game released 10 years ago, but still). One of the reasons Rake In Grass chose to do a sidescrolling shooter was so the player could have some time to read some of the jokes they inserted into the game.\n\nWay back in the day, I had problems with my save and posted on the RIG forums about it. The developers responded, asked that I send my save file to them, I did, and they returned it to me with the problem fixed. I was so thrilled about it and was really happy that they were so involved with their community. I didn't realize the game was on Greenlight, and if I had, I would have supported it then, but I'm so happy that this game is available on Steam now so I can give the devs more support. I heartily encourage you to give this game a chance and check it out, as there's so many hours of fun gameplay to be had for the price.","February 6, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the graphics are not Sine Mora beautiful it still looks very well giving its age. But what it may lack in graphical prowess it makes up in spades in the content, gameplay and sound departments.\n\nWhile it invokes the feeling of classic side scrolling shooters it also brings its own ideas to the table. Your ship, weapons and special attachments are customizable and upgradeable before each mission. So you get a sense of progress and it also adds a strategical layer to the game.\n\nThe soundtrack is really outstanding and for 3 bucks on sale it alone deserves a buy even if its not your genre.\n\nIt is not an easy game but what it does best is to invoke this "just on more try" feeling. And so you do and you wonder where the time went.\n\nThe Linux version I played worked flawlessly with a current open source graphics stack. I assume it will as well with the proprietary drivers.","February 6, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Inspired by Tyrian 2000, Project-X, Walker, R-Type, and Darius, this old school side-scrolling shooter offers wicked difficulty as well as wicked charm.\n\nInstead of collecting weapons akin to R-Type, this game takes a page from Tyrian where you have the option of buying weapons after you complete each level. And trust me you are going to need to upgrade as soon as possible because each level gets progressively more and more difficult. Gamers looking for a breeze need not apply because it is not easy.\n\nThe graphics to J'n'G are reminiscent of an old 2D side-scrolling shooter. Nothing to hold in high acclaim, but still very nice to look at. Has kind of computer 90s feel. J'nG Gold also offers a comic book intro and outro to each level(or at least during the first few levels, I haven't gotten too far into it), which is also very nice.\n\nOh and the music? Fantastic!  Machinae Supremacy and its sister production company, Hubnester Industries does a fantastic job at providing a heavy metal and chiptune atmosphere. Trust me, the music definitely adds a lot to already great game.\n\nIf you like great side-scrolling shooters, please buy this game. It's $3 right now, but even if it is $6.99 J'nG is still worth the price.","February 6, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The amount of silly weapons and ships you unlock is amazing. I'm not kidding. In later playthroughs you literally can't see your ship from all the explosions and bullets you'll be shooting on the screen. It's quite a sight to behold.

It's utterly ridiculous that this is a thing, but any dev that takes the time to, you know, code in the proper control support, gets a giant thumbs up IMO.\n\nI do have a minor niggling complaint though, in that I would have liked some resolution options besides 4:3 with stretching (and scaling, as you can window mode it and stretch it to whatever size you want), as a stretched 4:3, just looks squashed rather than being a proper 16:9, but that's honestly barely a complaint, as it's fully playable as is.\n\nI got this in a bundle, and I kind of wish I'd paid full price, as these devs clearly deserve the money.  It's really kind of sad that most devs can't be bothered to properly support the basic, fundamental control scheme on PC, and opting to just be lazy ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nBuy it fruitcake.\n","February 17, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Asside from the music the art is a great mix between retro and modern styles. Each level is filled with something new to see and something new to kill you in the most violent way possible.\n\nDodging bullets is about 80% of the game while you retaliate with an arsenal of upgrades for your ships and weapons. If you play this game enough you may notice the secrets found here and there to access secret levels filled with rage inducing baddies and face-palm inducing jokes. Just remember to pick up the stranded astronaughts instead of shooting them, but hey what's stopping you?\n\nOverall with little to no bugs that I've seen the $7 price tag is a deal if I've ever seen one. 10/10 recommended.","November 16, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Beautiful visual effects... missiles on top of lasers on top of bombs on top of fireballs on top of smoke on top of debris. The skill based scrolling shooter is also a wonderful thing. Learning patterns and avoiding death by knowledge and reflex is satisfying once executed to perfection. This game combines the two into an off-putting mush. It's incredibly difficult to determine what will and won't instantly kill you behind all those pretty visuals. The result is that often times you die and are not sure why. Combine this with infrequent checkpoints and it's the recipe for frustration.\n\nPushing the difficulty down from Normal to Easy is a necessity. It substantially reduces the number of things that will instagib you, but not so much that you won't still end up playing the same five minute segments a half dozen times before completing them. Jets'n'Guns fails the Super R-Type test... meaning you'd be better of playing Super R-Type. Here's a free to play browser version: http://www.snesfun.com/game.php?id=1224\n\nThe upgrade system is compelling. The humor is compelling. The B-movie sci-fi Di ck Tracy story presentation between levels is compelling. The gameplay is fatally flawed. If instant or sub-second death is a feature, then the threats must be clear, and the checkpoints must be frequent.

At times yes..... but overall no not really. Because of the price I will reccommend it but any more expensive and I wouldnt. This is due to the worst weapon balancing ive ever seen in a game, youre weapons become so overpowered that the enemy ships cant even make it on screen without being obliterated. If you start the game on Hard the game is alot more how it should be but considering the achievements and one needing you to reach the 10th time of playthru you need to start on easy. You then get new game + keeping all weapons and money. Ive been playing for 70+ hours now, on about the 8-9th play thru....... and im still after 4 achievments which just so you know are the most grinding acheevs ever. hours apon hours of jus holding your button down n blowing everything up..... oh how I wish for a autopilot. Overall this game wouldve been so much better with this problem balanced out. On a different note the graphics are pleasing, I love the explosions n blood, and the ships and everythingelse is able to be upgraded. Theres also secrets to find thruout. A small Tetris game was added aswell which was fun to play.

In terms of overall quality it is by far one of the best small-team Indie games. And yes, there's replay value! The story isn't really worth talking about much but it's about the loadout, becoming more and more powerful (with more flamboyant particle effects as you progress).\n\nAnd I'm gonna call it... Yes I'm gonna call it...\nI'm calling it!\nGONNA DO IT!\nThis game has one of the top 3 best soundtracks in an Indie game, ever!\n\nPros:\n+Variety and visuals. This game is full of interesting eye-candy, ranging from particle effects to distinctive and creative ship and world designs! The pre-rendered 3D visuals are awesome, if a bit low resolution now.\n+Soundtrack: It's huge, each track is distinctive, and you can find it freely.\n+Performance: This game will run on almost ANYTHING. For the record, I played this game mostly an on iBook Clamshell laptop from 2001 using an ATI Rage 128. Perfect for having on a laptop and playing on the go.\n\nCons:\n-Difficulty curve: Starts out extremely difficult. Will get extremely easy in subsequent playthroughs.\n-Resolution: It has aged better in some ways than others, and it is in dire need of an HD remake or sequel. This will show if you play it on a monitor bigger than 17".\n\nGripes:\n-No editors whatsoever.\n-Could use some kind of touch screen support for tablets.\n\nVerdict: Get it!

It has the old school feel of games such as G-Darius or Zero Wing, plus it adds an awesome feature of customising your battle ship. Customize with a capital C. You start off with a few pea shooters and as you progress you get access to lasers, frag guns, missiles, bombs and new ships. Every weapon also has several levels of upgrades, including fire rate, damage and special effects like penetration or shrapnel rounds. The campaign is fairly long, spanning through various environments such as outer space (duh), jungles and even underwater. Some of the bosses will give a run for your money and defeating them comes with a sense of accomplishment. Replayability is also high, after clearing the final boss battle you start the campaign from the beginning on a higher difficulty.

Well at least on your first playthrough, because after you beat the game once, you get to keep all the money and weapons you bought, and that's where the fun begins!\nEven though the game is 10 years old, it doesn't feel so, even considering the graphics.

It has great replayability, huge selection of weapons, and it's really funny ;) The weapons you can choose from make you more than a one-man army, it makes you give real bullet hell to your enemies, instead of other way around. And even considering that, it's not that easy. Well at least on your first playthrough, because after you beat the game once, you get to keep all the money and weapons you bought, and that's where the fun begins!\nEven though the game is 10 years old, it doesn't feel so, even considering the graphics.

The game is hard but awesome, and the music is probably the best I've ever heard in a game before. Some parts can be difficult to figure out or hard to beat, but it's usually just the amount of effort put in by the players.\n\nAlso, Jetpack has more coolant than actual ship? . - .\n\nHoping for another game!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI like J&G, but there are some flaws that I saw with it. Keep in mind, these are things that I see in ANY other kind of shtmup like this, such as the Raiden Series.\n\n#1. Side Scoller shooters like this are supposed to let you shooot around like crasy, but the weapon cooldown sort of ruins this aspect. It also can make gameplay frustrating at points.\n\n#2. Sometimes, enemies will come out from behind you. There is no way to predict on your own where they will come from, and there isen't a short "warning!" arrow, either. When you're trying to destroy an enemy that has high health in front of you, it's hard to focus on avoiding crashing into one of these "backstabbers", especially when crshing does such high damage.\n\n#3. the high amount of bullets aren't the problem with this one, it's how fast or how advanced these bullets are. On some ground levels, like the second one, there are so many ground forces shooting, that it's impossible to leave the firefight with barely a scratch! The Blue homing rockets, as well, are a bit to fast for a shtmup's standard homing projectiles.\n\n#4. At checkpoints, the game not only saves your point in the game, but it also saves what percentage your health's at. this doesn't make ny sense to me. Usually, at a checkpoint in these games, it respawns you at full health, allowing youto figure out what you did wrong and correct it. IF you ht a checkpoint at such low health, then get to a boss fight, it makes it all the more difficult.\n\nMost of these things are what I would consider being in the harder difficulties, but being one that likes to complete the game on a more story-wise level, having all of this in the easiest difficulty just seems . . . absurd! But, if you can deal with these things in such games, then I would recommend this!","February 22, 2014","true","33.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Loud, crazy, brash, with plenty of enemies, guns, and weiredness, it's an extremely satisfying shooter.\n\nYou play as . . . well the plot gets kind of bizarre, but sort of a soldier turned mercinary, who goes out to save the universe by blowing up spaceships, trucks, troops, building, jets, monsters, and everything else.  As you play you earn money, unlock equipment, find hidden weapons, and far, far more.  Eventually you're customizing your own spacecraft with all sorts of crazy weaponry as you find new ways to defeat your enemies.\n\nCustomization and gameplay is a big part of this.  Pick the right loadout in order to survive, pick your battles, and react fast to survive.  The wrong loadout or bad tactics can kill you - and you may need to replay a level and/or recustomize your ship to get things right.  Fortunately, anything you buy can be traded in for full price, encouraging all sorts of combos.\n\nPretty much a must-pick up for a side scroller/bullet hell player.  But a few caveats:\n1) The bullet hell aspect is also based around enduring attacks and being willing to take hits.\n2) At times the game screen can get crowded if you build your own bullet-spewing monstrosity, so don't just think a big loadout saves the day - you might not even be able to see your ship in all the chaos.\n3) The plot is utterly bizarre and it's hard to tell how much is parody, throwaway jokes, actual humor, or just plain craziness.  There's also some elements that may be parodies of sexist tropes, but the plots are so crazy it's hard to know.\n\n","March 14, 2014","true","15.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was finding it easier just to upgrade my basic gun than to upgrade to a more powerful version. Sometimes I do like a challenge but not the one this one was giving me.

They do that for a reason, a reason that obviously never occured to the developer of this game. Enemy fire is almost contantly obscured by explosions, random bits of scenery and even your own weapons. When there isn't something hiding the enemy bullets they tend to blend into the background anyway. Skill becomes secondary to grinding through the same areas trying desperately to figure out what is hitting you in the hope of being able to avoid it next time.\n\nWith so many great shmups on the market I find myself unable to recommend this one for any reason whatsoever.

In the original release you did the missions earned your money and spent many hours at the shop improving your ship and there was this balance where you could put together a fine enough ship finding that middle ground of weapon temperature, firing duration and power, the game was still challenging enough and you perished many times but you actually felt as if you were dealing some damage and with a little patience and effort you made progress through the game but now it feels as if the game is making you progress the way it wants giving you just enough to get a new weapon but no upgrades so your just able to scratch the paintwork and it goes on and on like this ♥♥♥♥ weapons again and again and very little money to do anything with.\n\nUnfortunatly now the difficulty is a joke im playing it on medium and im dying again and again mainly due in part to the fact my ship likes to just damage itself for no reason, all of a sudden im reading critical hull damage but have not been shot or colided with anything.  Next the enemies just ram you again and again doing immense damage but you dont even scratch their paintwork during this little encounter not even the slightest dent on their hull, being rammed and blown up is annoying but would be a little sweeter if you were able to take the tosser that colided with you down aswell sort of a last payback deal.\n\nLastly what is with all these quickly glued together new levels that have been added annoying boss fight after boss fight like i said before you have weapons but nothing decent enough to actually feel as if your dealing any damage, the level i hate the most has to be Comfort 2065 Perfect City.... the background is a bright white the buildings are white the enemy ships are all their own colours however the bullets and shells they fire are either white or a very light blue add to the formula you are flying with underpowered ♥♥♥♥ weapons and you have a massacre on your hands and most of the time you cannot see what has just destroyed you and if that wasn't enough their is a boss at the end of that god forsaken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a level.\n\nThe fun has been lost from this game all that remains is an arcade feeling mess that like the machines of old kills you again and again and demands more money.","February 15, 2014","false","7.5"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","10","26","0","0"

I'm not going to sit here and try to prove why I should have gone further; this is a review, not a chest beating exercise. However, even on easy, the game simply gets more unplayable the deeper you get in. The save points on a level seem to be set completly by the developer's whim, and your current stats (for that level) are saved with you. For example, if you happen to cross a checkpoint with 5% of your health remaining, you better either find more health fast (which isn't usually the case, health pickups for the first 6 levels can ba counted on 1 hand), beat some boss, or restart from when I happened to save last- excluding the checkpoint. I'm not going to poke at the 3rd grade fart jokes that qualify as this game's plotline, I think that the mechanics alone make this an unattainable attempt at gaming gratification.\n\nEDIT:\n\npros:   A bullet hell space game with upgrades\n\ncons: lack of upgrades\nlousy storyline\nflawed leveling system\noverall shallow gameplay","March 3, 2014","false","3.5"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

The weapons are horribly underpowered, the enemies lack any of the rhythm that often defines the genre, and most of the time your screen winds up obscured by smoke or unnecessary debris from whatever you blew up, making it impossible, combined with the enemy firing rate and general blurriness of the graphics, to discern what is and is not a bullet.\n\nYeah, it's challenging, but unlike other games, you never learn from your death, and it always feels like you're unaware of why exactly you died.  Some scenery can be fired through, some inexplicably cant (but enemies can).  Some of it will damage you, some of it may not.  Bullets are so small and obscure looking that picking them out of the other effects is often impossible to do.  On top of that, controller and graphics options are a joke, and the responsiveness of the controls is pretty horrible.\n\nThe only bright spot is the music, which is fantastic.

In all 3 control methods (yes, even the mouse) you either don't move at all or you move at one unchangeable speed. Moving the mouse slowly simply results in you not moving at all, making it unresponsive and unintuitive. And no, you can't configure the deadzone. If using a controller, you also can't map the triggers to anything, so you'll need another program such as joy2key or qjoypad unless you want to be holding down a button for the whole game. Basically, the controls could not possibly be made any worse than they are right now.\n\nIn addition to the crappy controls, there's no visual indication whatsoever when you take damage. The bullets were also kind of hard to see when something exploding sends harmless particles and rubble flying around obscuring the things that actually do damage.\n\nThe interface is also pretty annoying.

The score didn't even go up, nothing moved, I never got any damage.","December 14, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 12 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","12","0","3"

I thought putting it on easy would be better, but it was just as hard. Some may say it's dumb i rate this game "bad", just because it's hard for me, but it was one of the main reason I disliked it. Too complicated and hard.\n\nSo well...I started using codes, especially the one that won't let your weapons overheat. Overheat is a stupid thing in this game anyway. I typed that code for every single level until I was through the game.\n\nWell because of the difficulty of the game, the heating annoyance, I started using codes in every single level, and most of the time I was flying up and down while keeping the shooting button in at all times.\n\nI got excited by the history, I liked the animations and monsters, but in the end I was just sitting there firing my weapons, and just wanted the game to end asap. Sitting there thinking about the game to end shouldn't be a positive thing, and the reason I am not recommending it.\n\nI have listened to Machinae Supremacy for years, and it's a good band. However, if I wanna be able to listen to the music in the game over the roaring of the sound of the weapons, I need to turn down almost all the sfx sound. You can't really hear much of it over the guns.\n\nIt's a nice game, well made, but it gets kinda boring because of the way it is set up. The creators of the game have tried to make up for this by making tons of cool weapons. Yeah, they are really cool, and so many, but I don't really see any reason to keep the old weapons when progressing through the next levels. Still I sit there keeping my shooting button in, no matter how cool the weapons are.\n\nWell. To cut it off here. In other games I have played that are like this, I have liked it because it has not been so damn complicated. You are a ship, you got guns...and you get upgrades along the way, but all this happends ingame, and not as a side menu. Should be more RNG in this game, because as soon as you die, you have to do the same stuff all over again.","November 12, 2014","false","6.3"," 0 of 23 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","23","0","0"

Up until the racetrack stage, the game is tough, but doable, then afterwards it is nearly impossible to avoid getting stuck on very unamusing boss fights and beer levels that are more frustrating than fun.  Spending money on upgrades has barely any effect on damage and survivability, and in fact, I found some cheats that enabled permanent quad damage and max money, and still managed to somehow die (though I could place part of the blame on suboptimal weapon loadout).\n\nPeople compare this game to other shooters on the PC, but the difference is in those games I had fun upgrading my ship, finding (interesting!) secrets and, you know, beating the game.  This one?  It tries too hard to be funny and difficult and soon stops being enjoyable.

I had never heard of it beforehand so this is a strictly no-nostalgia-goggles review.\n\nTo put it simply, Jets'n'Guns is the MOST western, gross looking, and FUN SHMUP I have ever played on PC. I say western because it is the polar opposite of a eastern bullet hell anime Touhoufest. The game is very enjoyable for casual SHMUP players like me who really sucks at SHMUPS, though I had to kick it down to Easy mode the first time through. The game's design is gross... but that's not bad... it makes you feel like you're playing what it is: a Windows 98 game that doesn't give a crap about what it looks like. YES, you WILL see Comic Sans. YES, you WILL not care because you're having so much fun. ALSO: The music is pretty great... prog metal with a chiptune backdrop.\n\nGameplay all about throwing as much firepower as possible at the enemy ships. You do this by collecting cash from every kill and using it on upgrades between each level. By the end of the game you will have SOOO MANY UPGRADES you won't know what to do with them. Make sure to experiment as much as possible with different combinations: I was not aware it didn't charge you more for selling back weapons for a while.\n\nTL;DR: Get this if you want a gross looking but satisfying SHMUP with a huge upgrade system.","March 10, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has some of the finest side-scrolling, platforming, shmup action that I have played and I go back to the Jungle Hunt years. There is no lack of challenge and once you think it starting to get easier, you get hit with the wake up call that forces you to completely change your strategy. I found myself playing this one again after I beat it on normal, just so I could blow everything up with overly powerful weapons to find out that there is even more content than I thought. I'm currently on my 3rd go though playing it on hard for a new challenge. This game has way more replayability than I expected. The one thing that bugged me about this game is that a few levels had some really cheesy enemies as well as few lame weapons but these a minimal in contrast to the rest of the game. What made this even more character along with the explosions and violence was the humor and found myself chuckling in the middle of battle a few times. There is no shortage of levels, enemies, weapons, secrets and customizable ships. The controls seemed a little sensative at first but easy to overcome in a very short amount of time. Sounds were good with the 80's hair band music that seemed to fit the style of gameplay. The graphics get insane at times and I was amazed at how quickly the screen could fill up with weapon shots, enemies, explosions, etc... that you can easily get lost in the madness. I would highly recommend this to anyone and a definate picker-upper. I give this a 9 out of 10. -1 for the few levels that you are going to say "ooooh gawd, really?"","March 1, 2014","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are ''retro'' but so is the game...it's like 10 years old. I've red some of the positive AND negative reviews and saw that most of the bad ones talk about slow speeds, bad inertion of the plane, weak guns and so on...to that I say...just play a little longer dam it (you'll be clearing stages 100% very soon). It's like I sed, an old game and thus has a slow start. Sure they cud have remade it for the steam release to make it more ''modern fast paced'' but that would just kill the gameplay.\n\nDown side is the controls are still bad. Playing with a mouse is NOT RECOMENDED, use a keyboard or, if you have the patience like me, set up a gamepad (it takes a while).\n\nMusic...oh my the music...best in any game to date. It's just so good and well implemented to each stage.\n\nFor the low price of 6€ for a game like this is a definite recommend from me. I played 100+ hours then and it's still the game i come back to for some mindless fun (the ways you blow up some of the soldiers is just so dam funny).\n\nI recommend to play it on easy for the first time (but just the first time) just so you can get the first GOOD jet like the ZZ-Rolls or the TMiG-226 so you can fully appreciate the work that went into all those jets and guns.\n\nBut if you want a challenge...start of on hard and you'll need to really find balances in gun overheat, jet speed, jet armor and firepower for each stage all the while listening to some epic shop music.","February 19, 2014","true","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is not so much about the shmup but about working out the ultimate loadout and then laying waste to the levels. It's sort of like a bullet hell game but you're the end boss wiping eveything out. Different ships have different speeds which makes mouse feel extremely laggy so I recomend keyboard only or a controller. Controller is best. Tonnes of customizability, secrets, hidden weapons and different ways to tackle a level. Game is designed to be played many times over, you'll start out feeling underpowered but eventually turn into a complete beast.

Yet not since 1989 have you encountered anything as head-banging and gamepad-smashing as this new indie side-scrolling shoot 'em up; Jets'n'Guns Gold.\n\nThe developer, Rake in Grass, has poured an incredible amount of design and detail into this little gem of Genesis-style flashback romp. Loaded with masses of enemies, a stellar array of graphic goodies, a handful of customization options and some serious silliness, this game's easily-dismissed flaws lie in it's dated conceptual design. But even then, what is dated to one player is fresh and bold to another. This is standard old-school arcade with Steam-age design (see what I did there).\n\nYou play a mercenary pilot flying a space worthy fighter ship in glorious 32-bit colors. You take on 43 different missions from the standard 'defend' and 'destroy' type all the way through to the more bizarre, 'prevent alien perverts from ravaging sexy scientists' type. Environments range from space and cloudy blue skies to war torn deserts, to dense jungles and even underwater realms. As you progress, you earn more money and unlock new ships, weapons and special items.\n\nAll of this would be pretty standard and even a slice of boring if not for the charming dose of 'crazy' liberally blended in. Crazy like 'flying a hot-dog truck, shooting down predatory sperm aliens, defending against zombies hurling their detached limbs at you, as you steal a super tanker of home-brewed draft away from Borg-like, self-aware beer determined to intoxicate you,' crazy. Seriously. And the game designers don't stop at mere randomness. They are very willing to poke fun at themselves as developers and even use in-game text to criticize themselves for occasionally boring graphics. (Look for the Lame Secret Spot Marking Developers Indicator.)\n\nAs mentioned above, the dated core design adds some irritation. Some levels are just insanely impossible especially when some ship designs are larger than certain narrow openings that the player is required to fly through. And while blasting flying beer bottle and sperm fighters is immensely satisfying, the game does suffer a lack of replay-ability. Defeating a level rarely provides more than some extra money that you can't use until you unlock the next higher ship or find new weapons... neither of which have clearly identified goals. I kept playing with the same ship for more than 7 missions before I was offered a new choice. And while you can test your weapon upgrades and layouts before starting a level, most weapons are little more than cosmetic changes to the effects.\n\nBut for a game that lets you blast millions of enemy ships, decapitate their pilots in mid-air, and blow apart 1950's Cadillacs all to some old school arcade music, you have a fun and funny waste of a Friday night. Just be sure to shower thoroughly on Saturday morning to wash the retro away.","February 17, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As maybe several others here, I already played the game a while back (about 10 years). And still today it is just a pleasure to play.\nTons of weapons, ships and levels. Beside aerial fight, you can also bomb the ground with a variety of bomb types.\nAnd believe me it is fun to see the lemming sized figures get blown to pieces - besides all the explosions and utter destruction.\nThere is so much detail to this game. An hilarious amount of enemy tpyes, damage models on bigger enemies, explosives, gas tanks, gun emplacements, tanks and buildings. Hell even if an airship gets shot down it crushes down hitting, killing and mostly destroying everything it falls on.\nForget about Sine Mora (yikes) or any other Shoot 'em Up you played for PC, this is the best. This is in league with games like R-Type Delta on PS1 back then. Everybody who likes this genre and does not instantly buy this game, simply makes a mistake.\nThe music of the game is a special thing, as it was contributed by Machinae Supremacy. A Swedish band, that mixed MOD tunes with rock / metal. This is not just average old school MOD music but something much more interesting.

The graphics are ''retro'' but so is the game...it's like 10 years old. I've red some of the positive AND negative reviews and saw that most of the bad ones talk about slow speeds, bad inertion of the plane, weak guns and so on...to that I say...just play a little longer dam it (you'll be clearing stages 100% very soon). It's like I sed, an old game and thus has a slow start. Sure they cud have remade it for the steam release to make it more ''modern fast paced'' but that would just kill the gameplay.\n\nDown side is the controls are still bad. Playing with a mouse is NOT RECOMENDED, use a keyboard or, if you have the patience like me, set up a gamepad (it takes a while).\n\nMusic...oh my the music...best in any game to date. It's just so good and well implemented to each stage.\n\nFor the low price of 6€ for a game like this is a definite recommend from me. I played 100+ hours then and it's still the game i come back to for some mindless fun (the ways you blow up some of the soldiers is just so dam funny).\n\nI recommend to play it on easy for the first time (but just the first time) just so you can get the first GOOD jet like the ZZ-Rolls or the TMiG-226 so you can fully appreciate the work that went into all those jets and guns.\n\nBut if you want a challenge...start of on hard and you'll need to really find balances in gun overheat, jet speed, jet armor and firepower for each stage all the while listening to some epic shop music.","February 19, 2014","true","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yet not since 1989 have you encountered anything as head-banging and gamepad-smashing as this new indie side-scrolling shoot 'em up; Jets'n'Guns Gold.\n\nThe developer, Rake in Grass, has poured an incredible amount of design and detail into this little gem of Genesis-style flashback romp. Loaded with masses of enemies, a stellar array of graphic goodies, a handful of customization options and some serious silliness, this game's easily-dismissed flaws lie in it's dated conceptual design. But even then, what is dated to one player is fresh and bold to another. This is standard old-school arcade with Steam-age design (see what I did there).\n\nYou play a mercenary pilot flying a space worthy fighter ship in glorious 32-bit colors. You take on 43 different missions from the standard 'defend' and 'destroy' type all the way through to the more bizarre, 'prevent alien perverts from ravaging sexy scientists' type. Environments range from space and cloudy blue skies to war torn deserts, to dense jungles and even underwater realms. As you progress, you earn more money and unlock new ships, weapons and special items.\n\nAll of this would be pretty standard and even a slice of boring if not for the charming dose of 'crazy' liberally blended in. Crazy like 'flying a hot-dog truck, shooting down predatory sperm aliens, defending against zombies hurling their detached limbs at you, as you steal a super tanker of home-brewed draft away from Borg-like, self-aware beer determined to intoxicate you,' crazy. Seriously. And the game designers don't stop at mere randomness. They are very willing to poke fun at themselves as developers and even use in-game text to criticize themselves for occasionally boring graphics. (Look for the Lame Secret Spot Marking Developers Indicator.)\n\nAs mentioned above, the dated core design adds some irritation. Some levels are just insanely impossible especially when some ship designs are larger than certain narrow openings that the player is required to fly through. And while blasting flying beer bottle and sperm fighters is immensely satisfying, the game does suffer a lack of replay-ability. Defeating a level rarely provides more than some extra money that you can't use until you unlock the next higher ship or find new weapons... neither of which have clearly identified goals. I kept playing with the same ship for more than 7 missions before I was offered a new choice. And while you can test your weapon upgrades and layouts before starting a level, most weapons are little more than cosmetic changes to the effects.\n\nBut for a game that lets you blast millions of enemy ships, decapitate their pilots in mid-air, and blow apart 1950's Cadillacs all to some old school arcade music, you have a fun and funny waste of a Friday night. Just be sure to shower thoroughly on Saturday morning to wash the retro away.","February 17, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Jets 'n' Guns is just that.\nA fast paced game full of explosions and some fun humour on the side. The soundtrack is great and there is a lot of action. It's a game you can play for 10 minutes or 10 hours (if you're really hardcore), which Iove. Often, I don't have much time but want to play a quick game. This is the game I pick up!\nThe game is hard! It's easier to play with keyboard (or even mouse) than with a controller.\n\nThere is room for improvement with controller support (menu navigation can be tricky.)\n\nOtherwise I can only thank and congratulate the developers for making a great game that I really enjoy playing.","February 23, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ra De or the likes and felt that they were too challenging?\nLooking for a sweet spot in there between?\n\nLook no further, that sweet spot is Jets'n'Guns! :) <3\n\nThis is the best side-scrolling Shoot 'em Up ever to be made. In addition, having a soundtrack provided solely by Machinae Supremacy, the atmosphere couldn't be better. The story is somewhat absurd in its humor-style, as are some of the enemies too. One of the greatest ideas is not putting the player through all that painful economical management, as all which is bought, can be sold at the same price! This reduces significantly the pressure of really strict money management.\n\nThere are no lives, so every level can be retried until the player beats it. There are checkpoint inside levels, but forfeiting the current try sends the player back to the start of the current level.\n\nA big pro considering the previous release is that the devs added joystick support to menus! So the cursor can be comfortably controlled with the players weapon of choice. :)\n\nEvery play-through adds a small amount of content, so replayability is great. And this game has that "oldskool hook" that there are a lot of secrets and hidden content to be found (think of the 3rd / 4th gen. video games) so it makes the player want to play it again and again with the thought "maybe this time I'll find that thing" in mind.\n\nShoot 'em Up fans will not be disappointed. 11 / 10","November 9, 2015","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a casual player, I prefer this over so called "bullet hell" shmups. So, yeah, short review:\n\nPros:\n+artstyle (old, but still appealing in some way);\n+focuses on weapon-combining. Lots of different combos and ships;\n+tracks are very well made;\n+explosions;\n+B-movie-type story;\n\nCons:\n-it is hard to recognise what is in front of the ship and what object are in the background;\n-level are too long (and there are no in-game ability to speed up levels). At later playthroughs (7 and later) there are moments, when just pressing one button and waiting for level to end. Pretty stupid game design and me for playing this beyond PL4;\n-balance at later playthroughs made my eyeroll - enemy damage output increases slightly, but their collision damage increases significantly, so from those 43 levels only several challenged me (level without my ship). Oh, but you could say, KM, just play it without best weapons, to those peolpe I say without powerful gear this game is as lame as Borderlands playthrough with level 1 weapons.\n-weapon variety is impressive, BUT at the end, only few most effective stay in play - Tsunami "beyblade" Beta (great idea,  aggressive playstyle/close distance required), Chronic Whatever (pierces every object in the game) and Armagedonattor (big a** blast, relatively long cooldown).\n\nBtw, top negative comments give some really good points about the game, I agree with most of them, however, if you are like me - "filthy casual" - and have some cash to burn, I recommend you JnGGold. I advise playing it for up to 3 playthroughs and move on. Bought it on sale, did not regret.\n\nAnd don't search for "Punisher". Just.

The story and writing are silly, parodying most sci-fi, space operas, but it's still well written and entertaining to follow. And the music is one of the big standouts of the game. Created by Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy, it's probably one of the best soundtracks for an indie action game I've ever heard, crafting a professional, well produced metal and electronic soundtrack. If you're a shoot em up fan and you haven't given Jets N Guns a try, you're missing out on a truly classic indie gem.","December 28, 2015","true","32.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay wise is also perfect, so what does that mean? It means its a must buy. Another classic that should not be missed.","December 27, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ground game, which is foreign to most gradius/rtype games adds a wrinkle to the gameplay and you definitely have a variety of upgradeable bombs and guns to deal with them, the ships are all unique(some even quirky, hotdog vans in space)even though their overall strength progression is relatively linear, they all have different loadouts and equipment, which is also upgradeable.  Ships that generate alot of heat via laser or other heat generating weapons will have to upgrade cooling systems... other upgrades are, repair bots, armor, engines, time-dilation etc.    ...depending on ship\n\nthe visual design is original and fits in well, and the music is exceptional(rock/metal themed, sourced from a real band "machine supremacy") the level design is also great, and has alot of variety in combination with the various biomes and their unique enemies....the weakest aspect is probably the storyline, its presented in comic strips between each mission and after one...its not bad its acceptable, even though it is a lil corny, it has some comical references to other sci-fi games/shows/movies...\n\nit ca be a pretty difficult game if you have not ever played an intense, side/top-scrolling shootemup, i would recommend the easiest difficulty for beginners","February 5","true","52.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, that's the tagline. In truth it's a 2d side scrollin shmup with average graphics and awesome soundtrack.\n\nPlaying this for the first time on normal difficulty reminded me of Dark Souls - you died, you died, you died, you... I know. Holy crap the game is punishing. The graphics, nice as it is, helps your enemies by hiding their bullets more often than not. Still, it's fun. You pilot one of several airplanes slash starships, fit it with guns, rockets, bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. Then you go and kill everything that moves in more than 40 levels of mayhem.\n\nMurdering everything took me about 15hrs, at the end the explosions from my guns covered the whole screen and there was no way in hell to discern what's going on. It was cool. There is NG+ where you can start all over with upgraded stuff. For the first half of the game everything dies by just looking at you. This time you died mutha♥♥♥♥az!\n\nI liked:\n* soundtrack\n* lots of weapons\n* shooting stuff\n* the fact that you could skip story panels (haven't read one, i was so eager for shooty shooty bang bang)\n\nI disliked:\n* first part is hard as nails, while the end is almost easy mode\n* sometimes, and nerer the end quite often, you have no idea what's going on due to all the flashy bang bangs\n\nGet this:\n* if you like shmups\n\nDon't get this:\n* if you need your shmups to have cutting edge graphics\n* if you cannot handle the difficulty (well, I guess you could always play on easy)","January 17","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Koala In The Spider's Web" might be my favorite track, it's either that or "Flight of the Toyota"\n\nThe game is a fairly fun sidescrolling shoot-'em-up/SHMUP, with explosions, rubber duckies, blood (I think this can be turned off in a preference menu), and beer.  It gets a little dull if/when you get stuck, since you wind up repeating the same section over and over again, but that might just be happening because I haven't been trying to maximize my income.  The game's solid, just slightly on the difficult side for what I expected from a side-scrolling arcade-esque game like this.","May 13","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This title is worthy of its pounding, energetic soundtrack.\n\nVisuals may be low-res and 2D, but effects still look great and the amount of things going on at the same time on the screen is very impressive. Needless to say, this game runs on almost any machine made within the last fifteen years.\n\nGameplay\nJets'n'Guns is a very challenging game (even on easy), but thanks to the upgrade system being remarkably flexible and allowing for many different play styles, you can overcome its sometimes punishingly hard levels - you can just sell any item, weapon or upgrade without being financially punished and experiment with a new configuration. Incredibly tight controls, no matter if you're using keyboard, mouse, gamepad or joystick, also alleviate some of the difficulty. Level and enemy design are more creative and varied than anything you've ever seen (except for somewhat disappointing boss fights) and everything is neatly tied together by a completely insane story (but in a good way - the ending alone is ingenious).\n\nConclusion\nJets'n'Guns is cheap, 100% bad ♥♥♥, yet intelligent, has plenty of replay value and will forever be one of my favorite games.","May 16","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
