I came from the year 2036 to stop a dystopia and a potential WW3. Basically, by 2019, little 8 yr olds are pretendind to be "MLG" players. This lead to the U.S. making a "War on Squeakers" which made any FPS gamers that are older than 15 to enlist in the Gaming Army called the "MLG Squad". By 2021, the MLG Squad and the squeakers were having a full out war on each other. It became so bad, the U.S. and to ally themselves with Russia, China, and North Korea to nuke the Squeakers. However, the nuke didn`t just wipe out just the squeakers but in fact everyone else. By 2023, the whole world was devasted by the Nuclear War caused by the 8 yr olds.

The first game I played had an explotier flying around, great first impressions after coming from the beta. So much for "Un-Breakable Anti-Cheat" I'd also like to mention my firewall even said this wasn't good. Every server has a bunch of d'ckbag 9 Y/O "Mlg" kids with overpowered snipers and weapons. There are 2 types of currency in this game\nTokens and f'ckpoints.\nTokens are the p2w currency of this game, put about 20 dollars into this game and you've pretty much won.\nF'ckpoints are earned for playing, and to get the good weapons (Most of which are token only) you have to get about a nice 10,000 f'ckpoints. Sounds okay right? Well with about 10 kills you can get a whole.... 357 f'ckpoints.\nYeah, f'ck that.\nThen there are the "Mlg pro xx_sniper_xx 360 noscope" Class of kids that stole their mum credit card and rushed 100 dollars into this game, They have maxed out sniper rifles with all of the armor points they could shove onto their Gucci Golden Pants Helmets, shirts, poiton packs (More on that later) shoes, socks, belts, backpacks, condoms whatever these d'ckwads could find.\nAnd go "rekt" when they have a maxed snake while all you have is the starting machine gun.\nNow to the "Powerups" (Cheap potions, if you have the packs it regenerates faster)\nTheres the running shoes (Just double tap W assh'le) Healing potion and many many more OP and OP (Overpowered and Overpriced) items.\nThen.... There is the premium, Back in the day the heavy brickgun was free for all.

No...\n\nOkay let me tell you a story I only downloaded this game because other people were so bothered by it.\nNormally, a bad game is JUST bad. No nightmares, no hauntings, no therapy. No, this game seems like it was forged in the deepest level in hell with Satan's own boiling blood. Before playing this game, I recommend:\n\n-Vodka\n-Kevlar vest\n-Hiding your family\n-More Vodka\n-A locked door\n-Some scotch to take the edge off the vodka\n-Weed ( as a downer )\n-Cocaine ( To wake you back up )\n-Morphine ( To maybe actually enjoy the game, you're going to need ALOT of morphine. )\n-Not dying\n-Burning down your house afterwards with a mix of 2/3 Naplam and 1/3 Thermite\n-MORE ALCOHOL\n-A rusty knife to remove your eyes once you're done.\n\nOnce your done:\n\n-Go for a relaxing jog to walk that ♥♥♥♥ off.\n-Die.\n-Haunt the creators of the game with your spirit to creat a game  that doesn't double as a WMD.\n-Go to Hell.\n-Ask Satan why he did this.\n-Accidently invoke painful memories in Satan.\n-Leave.\n-Revive yourself.\n-Write a review about drinking, killing yourself, and resurrecting yourself.\n-Smile because you survived the impossible.\n\nHave a nice day.","August 21, 2015","true","0.1"," 488 of 595 people (82%) found this review helpful 779 people found this review funny","82","488","595","779","15"

I liked what I saw, it was the first FPS I ever really played and you know, I had fun. But one day I stopped playing (probably the day I discovered TF2) and didn't return to it ever again. But then one parculiar day in 2015, three years later, I see the game has had a Steam release. I decided this was the time to give it a second chance.\n\nNow before I continue, I'd like to point out that I've played Team Fortress 2 A LOT. 2,072 hours and continuing to climb. I am fully aware that this is not a class-based shooter and therefore won't compare Brick Force's structure to TF2's Structure because class based gameplay is not what this game is going for. It's going for something comparable to CoD (oh lord...) thrown in a rusty blender with Minecraft.\n\nStory:\nWhat's that? There isn't one?   ...ok then... Allow me to make up some bullsh*t for you:\nBrick Mannly stole Sir Brickenstein's lawnmower one day so Brickenstein gathered some friends to go to kick Mannly's ♥♥♥ and take back the lawnmower. In retaliation, Mannly gathered his friends to go kick Brickenstein's ♥♥♥ even harder and keep his prized lawnmower. This developed into a global war because this world's population is are a bunch of overzealous dunces.\n\nGameplay:\nOh sweet lord the gameplay, Back on track with my story.\nI started up the game to be greeted by a message to make a Brick-Force profile... "Hmm" I asked myself. "Why can't I just use my Steam profile?" I asked again. I did as told and proceeded to a mandatory tutorial. It was here I started noticing somewhat problematic issues. My feild of view (FOV) was set to what, 30? I wanted to change it. I was shocked to find that I couldn't. In a first person shooter, that's a huge red flag. I continued without many issues regarding control. The game didn't crash at all either, something I see others mention alot. I must just be lucky.\n\nAnyway, Once done, I jumped into a game on a map featuring floating islands. The blue base situated on a lonely floating island where as red base was a castle turret. You see the issue right? Map balance seems non existant here. In team deathmatch, this gives red a huge defense advantage over blue. So much is wrong with that kind of map design, Any TF2 player will tell you that map designers. Onwards with the story, I left blue spawn to find red mercilessly camping our one and only tiny exit door. I facepalm hard enough to leave a mark on my forehead and leave the game. I join another, on a bridge map of some description. The map balance was much better here though. Both sides looked roughly the same. Delighted, I carried on towards horrendous death. I foundmyself blindsighted one too many times however. Oh boy, isn't this FOV just WONDERFUL?\n\nI spent a bit of time before remembering one thing about this game. The ♥♥♥♥ing pay-to-win model. The stock weapons you have are a horrendous AK-47 and a crappy little peashooter that looks like a pistol. At this point the game says: "Oh do you not like my very balanced stock weapons? You want better things? Well why not buy them from the store with real money!" The realisation came fast and I was appauled. This game was pay-to-win. Various clothing you can buy exists as well in a manor something like TF2. But unlike that certain good game, These things gave you advantages over the competition. I simply shook my head, closed the game and uninstalled it.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks alright enough but one key issue was that some pinhead on the dev team cranked the gamma level up way too high. The game is a visual eyesore with no actual lighting. Like Minecraft Indev except... ♥♥♥♥♥ier.\n\nSound:\nAs far as I'm aware the game has no music. If it does it didn't work for me. As for actual sound direction the weapons make good enough sounds when using them. But there's no hitsound. That is a standard thing for this genre. To know when you've hit someone and how much damage you did is crucial to planning your moves. Even CoD has a hitsound. And for the record, TF2 might not START with a hitsound but you can head into the advanced options and turn it on at least.\nOne last thing. Whenever you get a kill, you hear the most obnoxious little sounds these guys call voice acting.\n\nThe Verdict:\nStay far away from this game. There are so many other, better games both in the FPS genre and  in the sandbox genre. I'd say only poke this game with your ten foot pole when you require a dead horse to beat. Even then, Internet Explorer is better for dead-horse beating.","December 27, 2014","false","0.2"," 132 of 170 people (78%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","78","132","170","22","3"

This game is very unique and surprising, in my opinion!\n\nThe size of the game was around 500MB, so I was like "I could install this in 2 minutes with my new internet!", so I did. When I finished installing, I decided to run it right off the bat! I was greeted with a lovely outside-login screen. Then it crashed. And crashed. Annnd crashed.\n\nAfter 8 attempts to get onto the login screen, I finally did it! I couldn't wait to see the epic community, and the creativity within everyones worlds! --Until I realized I had to register.\n\nSo I decided to register. I have 7 e-mail addresses, but for some reason 3 of the 7 of them were used for registration and I don't know why. I managed to get my 4th e-mail, hotguy69@hotmail[com] to work and I finally loaded up the game.\n\nUpon joining the game, I was happily greeted by many DLC's for the most basic of objects. Now, since I am a hot, rich, male pr-stitute, I decided to buy EVERY SINGLE DLC! YEAAYY!\n\nI joined a world, and noticed a good amount of people shooting eachother and a pink d[1]ck hanging from a ceiling. There was a dancing naked dude in the house and 9 year olds screaming "LEEEROOOY JEENEKKINNSSS" , "YOOOLLOO",  and some other disrespective chants--I mean, slangs, in the game. I quickly joined along; as it was very fun! We partied until the 7yr old police came to the house and shot everyone to death. I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥. :(\n\nI quit the gaem because iot wsa stupid1 and i ende duop  doig all tsorts of things that werwe nto the bedst of things. lets just say that i wrote this review to saysd fhtat this game is the most motehr fcmfering stufpid game ui sin the fieraking weortld im going to blow up their ♥♥♥♥gni -headjhquiteratters\n\nAnd then I uninstalled it with my fast internet. <3\n\nIt was a great game, 10/10!","May 3, 2015","true","0.3"," 121 of 165 people (73%) found this review helpful 142 people found this review funny","73","121","165","142","2"

I haven't even played this game for that long but I'm almost certain that there are hidden microtransactions somewhere.\n\nHow can the developers be proud to have a game like this available to the public?\nThe fact is that they just don't care. They only care about the money in their pockets.\nWe already have one Electronic Arts™ and we most certainly do not need another.\nIf this game wasn't just a poor attempt at getting money from the Call of Duty x Minecraft hype then Exe Games Inc. might've actually developed something decent.\n\nThis game doesn't even come close to Minecraft or Call of Duty. In fact the only way that this game could be considered a "baby" of CoD and MC is if that baby was dropped on it's head, mentally unstable, and possibly in-bred.\n\nI don't recommend this game to anyone except for little children who can't play decent games. Let those kids reside here, and not ruin people's experiences in other, more enjoyable games, such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.","February 3","false","0.1"," 61 of 75 people (81%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","81","61","75","34","0"

I'm Derpy, but you can call me Dick♥♥♥♥♥♥1337!\n\nI must say, this game was Fan-♥♥♥♥ing-Tastic.\nIt has everything you need to satisfy any human sheeple out there!\nIt has guns, blocks, zombies, and even bad fps!\nWith it's truly uninspirational design, I've had so many ideas on how I could make my own game!  How should I make my own game, you ask? Simple!\nYou need to follow these simple steps:\n1. Put in plenty of completely orignal ideas people will like! Eg. Call of Duty x Minecraft. That's creative, eh?\n2. Add overpriced DLC along with just pointless microtransactions nobody will buy!\n3. An ingame store, which costs a second currency, which you need to buy with real money!\n4. Have the items you just bought only last a week!\n5. Make the game use ♥♥♥♥ tons of ram, and still lag like ♥♥♥♥ and run at approximately 20 fps!\n6. Never update the game since release!\n7. Make sure there are no Australian, Asian, or African servers! That'd be a ♥♥♥♥ing waste of money, even though it does cost $50 to get 1000 in game credits! As if $50 would be enough to keep even a simple server going.\nand last, but not least,\n8. Have the most ♥♥♥♥ing input lag you could imagine into the game. Perhaps, a second or two of input lag. Mix that in a brew with 20fps, and you've got yourself a darn fine optimization scheme there.\n\nAll 8 of these are crucial when it comes to game design. But there are a few things I didn't mention. For example, a really bad colour scheme between friendlies and enemies, and another thing which is important, make sure the graphics make no sense with the type of game you're trying to make.\n\nMix all 8 of those things, and you'll be sure to rake in plenty of dough in no time! Thanks for reading.

It really built suspense for the game and heightened my excitement. Too many games nowadays just blaze through the load screen and it just kills the game for me.\n\nI found the tutorial to be very helpful and necessary. Other computer games I play use a similar WASD configuration, but it feels *really* different for some reason on this game and was very worthy of explanation. It was also really important that the tutorial told us that the space key was jump - it would have taken me forever to figure that out. No other game that I've ever played uses the space key for jumping for some reason, even though it is a very large and very hittable key and it just feels really intuitive, so I hope other game developers take note.\n\nSeveral times during the tutorial, I found myself being randomly disconnected on the server. This is by far the best feature in the game. Other games, like Team Fortress 2, waste several seconds waiting and determining if you are disconnected from the server. The problem though is I'm not a patient gamer - if there is even a nanosecond when I am not actually connected to the server, I want to know about it, and I want to be kicked off immediately. I don't want to give the enemy the satisfaction of being able to shoot me while I can't get away. Better yet, while in the tutorial, a disconnect from server meant re-starting the whole game. Who doesn't like starting fresh?\n\nI feel so honored to be able to play with 10-year old MLGs. Its not everyday you come across so many people who have so much skill at such a young age. And my weapons? Its great that they disappear so quickly... I always hated cleaning out my TF2 backpack. Now I can spend loads of time earning money to spend on weapons only to have them disappear on me - I love it.\n\nMaybe one thing I didn't really like about the game was how easy it was to accidentally hit the uninstall button. If this issue is fixed, I will give you the rating you deserve.*\n\n*Warning: No numeric value currently known to mankind can accurately represent how *great* this game is.","June 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 91 of 129 people (71%) found this review helpful 141 people found this review funny","71","91","129","141","2"

Heck, I reach less than 30 FPS sometimes.\n-Mouse lag: Self-explainatory, not sure if this is related to the FPS issue, but most of the times the mouse will stutter. A lot.\n-Bad netcode and hitboxes: Players-teleporting-around-and-killing-you and Shooting-someone-in-the-head-30-times-without-headshots galore. I have no idea how many times I am certain that I shoot someone in the head and I don't get a headshot.\n-Building mode is non-intuitive: For a game that is supposed to encourage people to build, the build mode is a mess, and brick-placement is as slow as it gets. And as buggy as well, a placed block can sometimes take up to 1 seconds to even show up.\n-No server filters: This may be something I have genuinely missed, but I haven't seen any server filters outside of organizing servers based on Player Count, Map and Gamemode.\n-No such thing as skill involved: See someone, shoot the heck out of him. Whoever has the least lag and best weapon wins. Reaction time is not a variable in here as the damage system is as broken as it gets, in relation to the hitboxes and lag issues.\n-Very bad weapon textures: The blocks have a better texture than the weapons, which look like ♥♥♥ in first person.\n-Extremely bad movement system: Double-tap a key to sprint while there were so many other useful keys like, I don't know, SHIFT, since nobody walks anyway. Additionally jumping is bad as well, horizontal movement while jumping being extremely limited. You jump the same length wether you are walking, running, or sprinting.\n-No coherency between original version and Steam version - If you played Brick-Force before Steam, bad luck, you can't use your account here. Nor make a new one with the same name and e-mail.\n\nARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING HAPPY","December 13, 2014","false","6.5"," 54 of 78 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","54","78","5","6"

I read all the reviews as of tonight, I saw the negativity. I wondered, is it really THAT bad?\nOH ♥♥♥♥ YES IT IS.\nThe first person view is way too wide and close to your in game self, the motion tracking when you look around is clunky, weapons that appear to be average and balanced end up wrecking you when someone else is holding it...\nAlso this game is full of false advertising. I click the Play button at the center, it takes me to the store. No, I am NOT trying to go to the store. In the description of the game, "...fast-paced PvP matches!" Uh, no. They are not fast. I can sprint and move the exact same speed as walking. That's not fast. Plus you die nearly seconds after respawning because someone sees you before you've got your bearings from respawning. Every, single, time.\nI don't normally review games. But this is one I have to unanimously agree with along with the others that have reviewed this. This is not worth playing, at the moment. It needs a strong overhaul on gameplay, control, and programming.","March 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","20","21","7","0"

Back then it was in its closed beta form, and looked very promising. I received my key to enter the game and I couldn't wait to play! I had an amazing time on BF and for a very long time it was the only game I played consistently day-to-day. I actually still have the playlist on Spotify that I used to listen to while playing BF. I play it sometimes just for the nostalgia.\n\nDon't get me wrong, beta-BF had its problems, mainly lack of content and rented guns. The biggest deal for me was the complete lack of 'pay to win' in the game. The lack of content was no biggy (it was closed beta, so it was to be expected). If one played often getting guns was no issue at all. I believe that guns were rented on a weekly or monthly basis, with monthly being a better deal. I personally don't have an issue with guns being rented out, as it makes testing a gun before buying it long-term a much easier task.\n\nSo, I played BF and had a good time, then beta ended. The update came immediately after. This update cast a dark shadow over the citizens of BF. It brought forth a cash shop with weapons purchasable only with premium currency. These weapons were so ridiculously overpowered that even the most talented players on the game, including myself, couldn't compete. You cannot simply kill someone that has a rocket or a grenade launcher when you only have a rifle.\n\nTL;DR Brick-Force was a balanced game with a friendly community before the final release, which turned it into a steaming pile of garbage.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I haven't played this game since witnessing the pay to win model I saw at final release. From the other reviews I've read I don't think it's changed much.","April 23, 2015","false","0.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","17","18","5","0"

This game had potential, it really did.\n\nBut this is how it happened.\n\nThis is how the brick force died.\n\nMy experience:\nI saw this game on steam, and it reminded me of a game i had already played before, so I decided to try.\nBEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER:\nI should warn you, I don't have a gaming pc, I have a store bought laptop, and its pretty good for gaming, but you couldn't run something like Arkham Knight on there (even thoough no one really could)\n\nSo, I load up the game, and what happens?\nCrash.\nLoad again?\nCrash.\nSo, now I get into the tutorial, after 8 tries, and what happens? It tells me to pick up  a weapon. The weapon doesn't load where its supposed to. Game freezes.\nCrash.\nSo, I re open it, and it takes me 5 more tries to actually LOAD the game since all it does it:\nCrash.\nI couldn't even beat the tutorial, and during my experience, for a comupter that can run Team Fortress 2, and Watch Dogs (not on steam), at 60 frames, there is no reason this "game" should be running at 20 fps.\n\nSo, to finish this review off:\nPros: good concept\n\nCons"\n-Framerate\n-Crashes\n-Based on what I have heard, kids thinking there mlg and and ruining the game.\n-Too many bugs\n\nMy opinion: they should have patched everything before releasing it on steam, or put it in Early Accsess\n\nIF YOU HAD HOPES FOR THIS GAME:\nJforce games released a game a LOOOOOONG time before this, and this was the game that Brick Force reminded me of.\nThe game is called Murder Miners, and is similar except that\n1.

For a while I was just avoiding the DLC in the menu and trying to find something to satrt the actual game. Of course the thing that looks like an advertisement is the start button. It takes forever to even load the tutorial up. The tutorial is unnecesary at first, but then becomes impossible because a lack of dialouge. There are ads promoting THE GAME IM IN for DLC. I don't want to buy DLC. I got this game for free, I thought. Also I don't know what someone "invited" me meant! A screen just poped up! And then, I press accept and I get a loading screen. A REALLY LONG loading screen. I waited for 10 minutes.","February 22, 2015","false","0.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","14","15","9","1"

That is a pay to win player, everything from weapons to cosmetics and even small boost items like gems, auto reload, radar and health potions can be brought from the cash shop.\nA few of these cash shop items can be brought for in-game cash but here is the trick, every item being pay to win or earned is timed, so if you wish to stay as non paying player you will find you're self in a constant race against time, because you will "not" use the free permanent weapons that comes with every created account cause they will literally make your enemies feel like sponges as they slowly turn around and kill you with a couple of bullets.\n\nPS: You can buy permanent weapons and cosmetics cheap if you pay money,\nif you wish to stay as a non-paying player you will need huge amounts of in game cash.\n\nVerdict:\nFun semi addictive game that tries to appeal to a younger audience who want's to shot and have fun.\nIt however fails at much more like the heavy pay to win features and the somehow backwards mechanics working against the game and players, as in if you create a map (content for the game) you also have to pay in order to publish that map, just imagine all the great maps that will never see the day of light because of this feature.","December 21, 2014","false","8.0"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","33","51","2","0"

Let's list some of the highlights you can expect to encounter if you play this game:\n\n\n-Brick-Force EU is filled with people who have googled hacks and will fly around the map with god mode and aim bots using an external client, so on the rare case they do get banned, they can just make another account without any consequences. There is no admin control for these people, the only way to get them out of your game is via a kick vote Brick-Force players will be too stupid to press, then when the vote fails these players will continue to hack with no possibility of being removed from the game.\n\n-The game is extremely P2W. Money will buy you weapons that are statistically better than anything that is obtainable through other means, money will also obtain you extra armor, and armor in general which basically translates to "extra hit points that other players wont have."\n\n-Players will buy consumables that stop them from dying in a fight. At higher levels, expect to run into people who are not only fully geared out with the above advantages, but also players who when you get their health down press a button and heal themselves to stop you from killing them. They will do this again and again and again and they will continuously top the score board.\n\n-This game has no skill to its combat. Everyone moves extremely slowly, has a ridiculously large hit box, and a fight is determined by whoever held down the trigger first on the most P2W assault rifle. In these encounters there is nothing you can do to avoid losing, no tactical use of cover since taking shots will slow you down, no maneuvers or alternative gear to counter spray and pray tactics, just two people with assault rifles holding the trigger. Thats it. Thats all you can do.\n\n-This game doesn't even have air control. When you jump or get launched by a jump pad your movement is fixated in the direction you were moving when you travelled through the air.\n\n-Support is notoriously bad. Recently Infernum shut down their US servers because they killed off their player base so every US player had to have their items transferred to the EU servers with higher ping and hacker problems. Players were only allowed to choose 3 items in their inventory to transfer over along with a compensatory amount of premium currency because Infernum are lazy and dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about their consumers. I got one of the faster responses which took them almost a month to transfer 3 guns to a new account, which had no XP so goodbye exclusive items and the ability to re-obtain gear I previously owned. Meanwhile I have friends who sent their support a message regarding the transfer who almost a month down the line still haven't recieved a response.\n\nOn any other issue they are even worse, they rarely check the forums, especially the one on their own website, and feedback is rarely ever implemented into the game. Even on occasions where a community manager or a developer has contacted me to say they would fix an issue (which almost never happens) it hasn't happened. So if you have a problem with the billions of hackers that populate every server amongst any of the other issues you will face, expect them not to care.\n\n\nTL;DR, Money and time would be better spent on a lobotomy as the effects of playing this for prolonged periods of time are probably worse on your mental health.","March 8, 2015","false","7.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","12","13","4","0"

But in this game, you have to pay your armor, and almost everything. It's not Free 2 Play or Pay 2 Win. It's litteraly Pay 2 Play, you cannot play without paying stuff. The developers ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on they keyboard and this game has appeared, nothing is enjoyable, the graphics, even if they're cube style, they're ugly. There are mechanics missing that any video games had like 10 years ago. It's just sad to see that games like this today just... exists. This game made was only created to make money. Conclusion: Play this game like 5 minutes, just to see what really a BAD game is, and stop calling games you don't really enjoy, like Skyrim a bad game.

If you expect to play this game without spending money then you can expect to die from all other players who do spend money.

Time for my real review this game makes me feel many things including nausea.  To begin one HUGE problem i had with this game is that the overall idea of this game is totally not original , but if they did take the concept of minecraft and Call of Duty smushing them together and did it well like Murder Miners.  Brick-Force also has another neat....ahem excuse me anoying as hell concept which is pay-to-win , which we all know the type so I digress to my next point.My first impressions of this game was it throwing me immediatly into a totorial giving me information i already knew like how to move and shoot ( any pc gamer should know this ) , and giving me no feedback on anything I did.  No other game has made me feel more frustrated with the setting before , because there arent any that physically can function 'well'.  Theres no setting for FOV and your FOV default is probably 50.  The graphic setting arent any better because you have a slide bar that doesnt even effect how the game looks less of improves gamplay quality or speed.  While on the topic of settings , apparently theres a voice setting which I dont even know what voices their ( game creators ) talking about because the only sound there is , is static footsteps and gunfire.  I primarily complain about this because the default voice it korean which I have nothing against those people or how they sound , but why not rural english or somthing we americans are familar with.  The overall game mechanics and gameplay werent any better.  When I say this Im making a rough estiment that my laptop can hadle a crappy low graphic game like this one but the amount of lag and FPS drops I expierienced was unbelieveble ( just to add my laptop can fluidly run games like skyrim on decant graphics) .  As I said earlier in my review this game gives me Nausea , this is because of the 3rd person view for looking at other players is stationary so looking at them from a bird eyes view is bad.  Sadly there are plenty more games just like this one saturating the market of steam and other video game providers , I did this one specifically because it looked and felt so bad it had to be done.  On my rating scale I give this a 0.5/10","February 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","0"

You might even spend up to a few hours on this game. You then slowly discover that only half the blocks are available until you earn enough credits to unlock them (unless you want to hand over money. Then you realise that most of your fun so far has been griefing 7 year olds (sorry 7 year old mlg pro gamers) who are somehow addicted to this hellish mess of a game. You might purchase your first gun, and then discover its magically gone after three days (when will developers understand that renting guns is not a mechanic people like). You might also buy the wrong item for example a block placer might be called the best one but doesnt take into account another one. Finally having chosen you enjoy this game (if you do), the game will bug out, the security provider x-trap (useless software) will decide it cant function properly and the poorely manufactured game will simply break, normally by crashing on start up. Any developer support or help? No\n\noverall if you are 7 years old, consider yourself a MLG superpro gamer who can 420 blaze it 360 noscope like a ninja and you are too hardcore to care about bugs, this is the game for you.\n\n(for everything else theres mastercard.)","March 11, 2015","false","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Only your money. I loved this game, I was able to overcome the paying players with hours of grinding and effort only for it to be taken away. And you get no compensation whatsoever for your hard work.\n\nThey shut down the Original & US-Servers and screwed everyone over that played for free, if you play the game and earned all your gear, you get nothing. They give you the middle finger and say no, only if you spend money do you get compensation. I already put a support ticket through once weeks ago, no response. I put another through today. They take away your levels and all your weapons and hours of commitment, and smile.\n\nThe proof is in their own post. I listed below the review.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone that likes to play for fun and for free. As the game is far from fun as you hit Veteran, just people grinding the same map. Over and over, I used to do it too, it wasn't fun. Pay to win players with the best gear cheezing everything, it sucked but with time and effort I was able to fight back.\n\nNot anymore, they took everything away. Everything I worked for is gone, oh but they'll help you if you spent money. They'll "Compensate" you if you spent money. I'm done with this game, probably never gonna touch it again.\n\nI'm gonna go back to plaing Warframe, a good Free To Play game with a great model.\n\nGood luck all of you that plan to continue playing after being wiped, I salute you. I cannot go on.\n\n\n\n\n"What does it entail for North-American server players?\n\nIf you are currently in possession of a Brick-Force account on the US Server, please be informed of the following:\n\nWe unfortunately can't offer existing US server players a transfer of their account from the US server to the European server. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nHowever, we will offer as much compensation as we can for your loss: you can contact our customer support and get reimbursed in Tokens for the value of any existing Tokens, gear, items or improvements you had bought on your US Server account.\n\nBrick-Force US on Steam will close down as well. We are currently working on expanding territorial access of the Brick-Force EU Steam version to North-American residents in the near future."\n\nTL;DR: Screw you if you spent no money and played for free, but we'll help if you spent money.

The only way to get a new weapon (The first weapons suck) as far as I know, is buying it. Now that I think about it, it also seems to try to be CS:GO and Team Fortress 2 in the way you can buy more items for MONEY. However, TF2 does it the right way: you also get random items as you play through the game, but this attrocity? Nope. The only way to really see how bad this game is is by watching it or playing it - both are very unpleasant - because explaining this is just beyond my vocabulary... so WATCH IT.

I like the colorful look to this, but this is passable.\n-Sounds. Sounds like ear ♥♥♥♥ making me play Rockman World II GB Making that sound like an orchestra. I rather listen to GBA Sonic Genesis.

Some weapons are permanent but they cost way to much for what they are worth as the player base is too limited and the game mode's don't really feel like anything special.\n\n2/10\n\nThe Review:\n\nThe game has a number of game modes (Deathmatch, Team deathmatch, Capture the flag, Freefall which plays like Minecraft's "Spleef", Defend Which is a kind of PvE Tower Defence ish game mode, Wanted, Zombie and Build 'n' Destroy). None of these game modes are anything new though and with the weapon's system just feels imbalanced and clunky.\n\nThe game has an overarching Free 2 Play model. You spend real world currency to buy 'Tokens' or you earn P points from playing matches. The weapons range in costs and cosmetic items generally are only buyable with tokens. The real kick to it though is almost everything has as timer when you purchase it, for example a gun could cost 6k p points for 7 days or 600 tokens for 7 days. This just creates a stupid paywall and inevitable money leech for some of the 'best' guns. Especially since some of the higher shotguns/rifles I saw are 16k p points...\n\nThe build mode also featured in the game isn't really anything to truly praise, it's not bad and it works for the most part but it's just a multiplayer map editor essentially. Which I guess can be interesting but if I were playing it for the building aspect I'd prefer to play something else.\n\nOverall I just can't really recommend it to anybody, there are better block builders out there, there are better building games out there and there are better 'arena' style shooters out there. So I fail to really see who this is aimed at or what it is trying to be...","May 3, 2015","false","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First of all, there's an unproven conspiracy (which based on the evidence seems to be likely true) that 100% of people that write negative reviews are being paid by Valve to do so that this "magnificant" gem of a game DOES NOT overthrow TF2. Naughty!\n\nThis game has it ALL!\n- Intense drama & story\n- Wide set of characters to play from\n- Intense 3D graphics\n- Overall fair combat system (not that great at the game, don't worry! You just need money)\n- "intentional" performance issues such as lag & crashes just to make sure people with better systems/ISP don't get an upper hand (again, quite overall fair combat system)\n- Hats! Seriously, what kind of genious thought to put hats in a FPS. Hilarious & original ♪\n- 複数の言語をサポートしています！最後に、私は日本の良い昔ながらの方法を学ぶ取得し、 ... Animuの子供たちは、今日使用しているこのラメのようではありません！\n- Virtually no one plays it!

Naturally kids will persuade their parents to do this. Also, it crashes for almost everyone I have seen who has written a review. Honestly, why does this game even exist? It steals money by claiming to be free when in fact you need to pay to have anything useful permanently, the "community" is a bunch of 9 year olds who think they are MLG and just insult you, "trolls" that troll you when building a map and everything else is terrible.\n\nI have not personally played, but from seing other reviews, i don't need to. Also, I do not want to contract cancer from playing this. The only reason this game is even allowed to be on my computer for even a minute is so that I can at least try to save anyone else from playing this CoD/Minecraft abomination.\n\nAlso, the fact that the guy who made this uses a negative review that could be mistaken for a posotive review unless you see it in the reviews section, which shows how desperate he is to make people think his game is quite good.\n\nCons:\n\n-The terrible "community"\n-Crashes every time\n-Can only rent weapons unless you pay ridiculous money\n-Claims to be free, have to pay to enjoy or even play\n-The fact that people can troll you when your building\n-Terrible audio\n-Bad graphics\n-Promotes suicide to any who plays this just so that they can forget that they have played it\n\nWorst things:\n\n-Anyone that plays this and enjoys it - I have lost all respect for you as a human being\n-The person who created this\n-The fact that it exists\n\nPros:\n\n-The uninstall button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n\nBest things:\n\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!\n-The install button\n-IT WORKS!!!!","March 31, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I see alot of joke reviews, negative reviews in the positive reviews etc. And i was like "Why not join the bagwagon of lulz?" NO! I will make a serious review and my thoughts on the game, Why? because when i was playing this it was fantastic!\n\nNow back when brick force was in closed beta, me and my bro got a beta key and go in and it was not pay to win! Daily Drops, You could buy weapons through in game cash or by leveling up the same thing with the cosmetics.  We knew this game had a future until the fire nation attacke- I mean, the company  itself got mostly really greedy and once  closed beta  ended all accounts were wiped and we were given reskins, They change the prices for everything to real money so it turned into a sh*tfest like you see today. But do not lose hope the game is still 50% playable, The daily has a chance to give you permanents or as you level up you can unlock parts to win a chance so it's not so hard on you, Espiecially even if all the items and even the build mode is payed wall if you play alot and  grab  a few friends you will earn alot of money to get this kind of things, Yes i'm that kind of guy who enjoys games people don't like because of how my perspective is on each game or try out.  Like neverwinter and Echoe Of Souls all those other games people think were pay to win and boring, look at them now people have ignored they're flaws and played it because of it's gameplay and dungeons, community etc. so if you atleast try the game for a hour or more and ignore the flaws without leaving after 5 minutes of gameplay to write some negative joke review, you can see that the game is not so bad after all and the game is still playable once this game is gone once more you will regret never giving it a chance (It's happen to me so many times trust me.)","August 18, 2015","true","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Even though the most reviews are negative, I do not agree. It's actually a pretty okay game. Devs are not too pushy to make you donate into the game, you can play it pretty well without paying a dime, if you wish so... With "Force Tokens" or something like that, the thing that they give you for... Like... Playing the game. Just keep playing the game, get stuff, use stuff, get more powerfull stuff if you want, man. If you wish, you could donate a buck or 2, no one is forcing you to do so in order to unlock uber-op-exclusive items that will make you a killing machine and it's a good FTP marketing strategy in my book.\n\nAnd the game itself is pretty fun. Yeah, it may look a bit like it's made for kids. Probably it is. There is no blood and minimal violence. Curses are censored in chat. And, there is a classic deathmatch experience, more tactical CS-Like bomb defuse mode, zombies game mode, creative for all your building needs, creative/action maps when you build first and defend later. I dunno why this game is getting so much negative reviews, it's not that bad, guys. And it's a fun to play. The only downside I've seen so far is the fact that the negative score affects players auditory, there aren't that much players. But still, there are plenty and yet again, it's free. So, it's not exactly the best FTP game there is on steam, but it's a decent game. I do recommend it.","September 22, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"
