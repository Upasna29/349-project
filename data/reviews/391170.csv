Somekind of mixture of Space Invaders, Galaga, Centipede and Frogger. You shoot through tons of aliens with power upgrades + levelups + skins. There are also Steam leaderboards and an Endless mode. The epileptic warning in the beginning is totally justified. Aliens explode in white flashes. Beat all challenging 30 levels in medium and hard. Just to die 50 times seems really really hard.","February 12","true","4.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Then there's the selection between gamemodes being:Level Mode: Play through 30 different levels with a slight level of passive experience-based progression between levels. (data is autosaved)\nEndless Mode: Mow your way through a procedurally generated neverending (hence the name) stream of enemies in the hopes of beating your high score.\nWave Mode: The same as Endless Mode, but in a rotation of waves (duh) that are all manually designed.Jumping into it i admit that i saw nothing but a weak space ship in a take on the classic coin-eating Space Invaders, but it didn't differ from the original enough to keep me interested. That was until it started borrowing some of Galaga's complexity, and classic shmup elements and pacing from the bullet hells such as CRIMZON CLOVER. And that is basically what this is, classic arcade Space Invaders/Galaga with shmup elements thrown into it.\nBut somehow, Void Invaders succeeds in not feeling like another one of these unoriginal ripoffs as instead of blending different existing games together, it does that and adds more to it. They added a lot of new enemies and bosses with original patterns and also new shmup-like temporary upgrade pick ups with not only "more bullets in a wider range", but besides that also a handful of unique upgrades that cause different playstyles and pacing, much like Bit Blaster XL.\nWhat also differs Void Invaders from other Space Invaders clones is that the general amount of ♥♥♥♥ happening on the screen is not inserted merely for the sake of eyerape. It actually adds to the aesthetic of the game. The way the particles are thrown on the screen is what many refer to as "artistically cohesive" in the sense that all of the explosion effects, the background and the unique screen tilt while moving actually fit together quite nicely. I'd say Void Invaders should switch places in reputation with Bit Blaster XL.\n\nDon't see stuff that should be here or vice versa? I'm open to constructive criticism.","May 16","true","3.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/391170/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","This is the kind of game that I call a "bargain bin purchase", these are games that wind up selling for incredibly cheap costs and can often turn out to be real gems, Void Invaders was another great find in the Steam sale for a measly £0.49.\n\nVoid Invaders is a homage to retro space shooters such as Galaga, Galaxian, Space Invaders etc. so you should know exactly what to expect based on the trailer and screenshots provided, however, I just wanted to write up this quick review to inform you that it is definitely worth the money and that it turned out to be a huge amount of fun.\n\nThis game features retro arcade-like gameplay with a brilliant unique soundtrack to go along with it, complete up to 30 singleplayer levels (including bossfights) or play in endless or wave modes to really test yourself and compete in the Steam leaderboards.\n\nSomething important to note however is that after a while the game can really strain your eyes. If you have played Beat Hazard before, then it's easiest to compare the explosions and bright flashes in Void Invaders to those used there too, except Beat Hazard has the option to tone it down, Void Invaders does not. Heed the warnings about photosensitive epilepsy, they are there for a good reason.","February 8","true","4.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Oh yeah a controller support would be nice. At least XBox360 controllers.\n\nOther than that, it's good, fun, enjoyable and strangely... somewhat relaxing.\n\nWorth the asking price.\n\nUpdate 08/22/2015\n\nDev added controller support, options for screen scaling and option to turn on/off wobble effect!

It offers amazing, colorful and flashing graphics, it has cool powerups for your ship, it offers the possibility for your ship to level up so it becomes stronger.\nThis game offers two modes: Endless mode and a mode where you have to complete levels, to move to the next level. In endless mode you can sit back, relax and enjoy while playing the game without a lot of pressure.\nIn the mode where you'll have to complete levels, you are trying over and over, finding the best way to complete the level and the tactic to beat the boss.\n\nOverall, certainly worth the low price of 3 €.","September 9, 2015","true","4.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

You collect power-ups, get XP to level up your ship (increased health, fire rate, etc.) and fight waves of enemies that move in different patterns. My only gripe so far is that there's no controller support; I really feel like a game like this would play better with a controller rather than a keyboard. And in case you can't tell from the screenshots, there are lots of flashing colors and lights in this game, so avoid this game if you can't handle such light shows.","August 14, 2015","true","4.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

A feeling where you know you only have a sliver of health left and a single mistake will cost you.  Void Invaders has brought me back to the arcade days of old like RaidanX and Galaga.  Oh and the boss battle will bring out everything you have.\n\nWith great music, and fantastic colours, and flashing lights I recommend everyone get this game (unless you have eplipsy or sensitive to flashing lights).","May 7","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keirnoth/recommended/391170/","Keirnoth","Iie-Kyo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keirnoth/","1246 products in account","A gem among indie games.\n\nYou ever played one of those games where you feel like the devs got to make the game they wanted to make?\n\nThis is one of those games.  The premise is simple, it's basically Space Invaders on crack and it's absolutely awesome.\n\nThe game has three modes - level mode, where you fight fixed spawns (and also fixed weapon powerups) that never change but get progressively harder as you go up in levels.  You have a fixed box fight every 5 levels for a total of 30 levels.  This will be a good 2-3 hours of gameplay as the later stages get very challenging.\n\nEndless Mode, which speaks for itself.  Enemies come at you nonstop in very random fashions.  All types of enemies with different flying patterns.  Later on during the mode it becomes absolute chaos as you try to manage staying alive before the next powerup.  Lots of fun!\n\nWave Mode, which is similar to Endless Mode but the enemies come at you in Galaxian-style "waves" all clumped up together.  You can get powerups in this mode but only if you kill the entire line (or wave) of enemies.  Otherwise it's just staying alive as long as possible and going for the highest score.\n\nThe game has a variety of interesting powerups, from a double, triple and quadruple shot.  A double attack that doubles your current shots and can stack with the previous powerups I mentioned, extra health, a clone that replicates any shots you do (including powered up shots), a "wave" shot similar to the semi-controllable laser in the Raiden series, a tornado powerup, which is essentially a wave powerup but fires in a sine/cosine wave without you needing to adjust it, and lastly, the rotating shotgun, which makes your "ship" (which is a little space invader itself) fire in all directions.\n\nYou do not die in one hit in this game.  You have an HP bar and a very limited XP bar, which you gain as you progress through Level Mode which allows you to do more damage and take more hits.  You'll understand in the later levels why an HP bar is needed rather than dying in one hit like most other hardcore shmups, as the bullet patterns in this game are very random and can be tricky to dodge.\n\nThe game has Steam leaderboards for its Endless Mode and basic X360 controller support.  Options are limited, but the game can practically run on a toaster because of how simple its graphics are.  There is no story whatsoever to speak of.  Just like the games of yesteryear, your focus is to shoot down the flying alien bad guys.\n\nOh, one more thing, the music for this game is AWESOME.  Seems to be SoundTrekker style instruments in the form of EDM, or electronic dance music.  If you're a fan of that genre you're going to absolutely LOVE the tracks that this game has.  Sound effects are old school style chips, boops, and blarps.  This game is definitely a love letter to the oldies out there.\n\nI picked this up on a sale for $0.49 and I feel like I ripped these guys off.  Even at full price (which is less than the price of a snack!) it's a lot of fun.  If you see this on sale during the Steam sale, this is an absolute *no brainer*.  Get it.  You won't regret it.","March 9","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You face off against a horde of aliens with your… um… own alien? Yeah, you also control an alien – I don’t know, maybe he turned rebel or something. Whatever.\n\nAnyway, that’s pretty much all there is to it. There’s aliens, alien bosses, powerups, as well as a few modes to keep you occupied. It’s not too difficult to complete the game (in level mode at least); which is kind of refreshing actually, since most shoot ‘em ups are utterly manic in the difficulty department. Definitely recommended for the casual gamer at least.\n\nOverall, Void Invaders is more of a pleasant experience than it is a super hardcore shoot em up extravaganza. It won’t last too long, but there’s enough there to keep you entertained for a while.\n\nOverall 70/100.\n","December 6, 2015","true","6.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Where are you?\n\nYou would figure that with all the arcade remakes ever to be made in this history of the world wide web, we can find a Galaga $15.00 rip-off with pretty colors remake on steam, but we don't live in that future just yet. We, in the modern era of the computerphone technology, live in arcade remakes of Space Invaders, not Galaga.\n\nWe have not progressed this far as a civilization to remake an amazing arcade game and continue to rely on the models of the old, conventional alternative (Space Invaders). This is like how we end institutional racism and deem racism socially unacceptable, but racism still persists in our culture in many different facets and never goes away. Space Invaders reboots are everywhere (persist in our culture) and come in many different aspects.\n\nVoid Invaders is not Galaga. It is 15% Galaga and 85% Space Invaders with pretty colors and/or seizures. While it is an 85% Space Invaders remake, Void Invaders has three different modes to the game: endless, wave (true arcade), and 'level', which is almost a storyline mode but with a level up system which doesn't really amount to anything. The level system also relies on power-ups to beat the level as the game gets tougher, but it doesn't detract from the experience (fun). Just because there's a clone-power up doesn't mean this game is Galaga. The ways to get powerups is also much different from Galaga because you don't die to get them, nor are their bonus rounds.\n\nWhere is my Galaga remake, Steam/Indie Game Developers? Don't you people remember what fun used to be??\n\ntl;dr: It's cheap and great for all but the epileptics and colorblind folks. It's also not entirely space invaders but that doesn't mean it's Galaga.

They liked each other that they went on a date.  They eventually get married and have a child. This couple is Galaga and Space Invaders, and their child is Void Invaders. While Void Invaders  looks like it's parents, it's got some weird attributes that can't really be found in the familiy tree, such as: a kickass modern electronic soundtrack, and A LOT OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND COLORS. Think of bringing a light machine gun to a rave where evil monsters that explode into light when killed are all gathered for a good time. I've only played a bit of Galaga. I've heard it's an absolute "bullet-hell" of a game. I can confirm that Void Invaders is what I would define bullet-hell with. Now, it can be slow, and then really challenging, but then there are the moments that are: "Holy freaking crap". If you play Endless Mode, you'll see what I mean.\n\nThe graphics are nice. I guess. It's a "pseudo-8-bit" game. It looks nice. What do you expect? COD's "2010" graphics (DICE, I love you) ?\n\nGameplay? You want to ask about a Space Invaders/Galaga -like shooter's gameplay? Well...there are some hard bosses that have unique ways to defeating them, but that's a general gaming thing. What do you expect me to tell you? Well...there are powerups. They can range from a double shotgun, to a rotating shotgun, to a tornado shotgun...I haven't even seen all of them yet. They can stack, and are only useable for a limited time. The Quadruple, Rotating, Tornado Shotgun made me cry. I also already said that it can be hard.\n\nThe soundtrack, as stated above, is modern, electronic, and dance-ish. I personally think it's kickass. It's small though.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game. 10/10\n\nIt'll sure beat Infinate Warfare's space sequence for sure.\n","June 4","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Only problem for me is that it lacks controller support and that if you have epileptic seizures caused from bright lights and stuff like that, then I VERY highly recommend you stay from this game since thats almost like half its premise are the bright flashing lights.\n\nNow that the warning is out of the way, its a great game because it blends the classic gameplay of games like Space Invaders with the modern feel of shooting things to oblivian with plenty of powerups. This game even has MMO(ish) qualities where the farther you go, the more you level which increases things like damage, health, and fire rate are the big ones.","August 15, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You dont belive me? Well ok, here some good pictures to show you some extrem action~\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=558741121\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=558741516\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=558741654\n\nSo yea, basicly, Void invaders is a great mix between the classic "space invaders" and other old shoot´n ups. but 3 things makes the game really enjoyable:\n\n1. The art of the game.\nIf you think about space invaders, you only shot a alien ones and it dies - you also can shot ones only. In void invaders, you really have a ♥♥♥♥ing machine gun as "default" weapon - AND THATS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME! I mean i more like to shoot aliens with a UZI or like than this boring "one-shot-missles".\n\n2. The soundtrack.\nFor real, the soundtrack rocks. I love the title music, the ingame music and what not - and the game is only 17 MB big so i guess the biggest part is even the music - still, ♥♥♥♥ing worth it. If you dont like the game, the soundtrack makes you love it.\n\n3. The ♥♥♥♥ing epic flashing.\n"epileptic seizure" warning - ♥♥♥♥ it. I dont have such problems and im glad i dont have coz this game is ♥♥♥♥ing full of it.\n\n\nSo all in all, Void Invaders is a really nice game, short if you play only the Level mode but its ♥♥♥♥ing -INSANE-. I like it and for 3-4 bucks its still a good price even if you just enjoy the music which is just great for real.","November 20, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It becomes less about skill or pattern recognition and more about making the most out of the powers before they run out.\nOn later levels, running out of power ups equals starting up from the beginning all over again, no matter how much life there's left, there is no point even trying. As soon as its gone, enemies become authentic bullets sponges. Boss battles in particular take way too long to beat while maintaining the same attack pattern for most of the fight.\n\nVoid invaders is cheap and sort of visually appealing, but it lacks good gameplay\n\nThere has to be better ways to increase the difficulty, without making my weapons deal miserable damage","March 7","false","4.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"
