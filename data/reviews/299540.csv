You have three options:  Go in powers blazing, infiltrate the place posing as a customer, or sneak in through the back entrance.\n\nNo matter which choice you make, you'll end up hypnotized by the villain running the place.  It's a false dilemma where all paths lead to the same destination.\n\nThe game is full of these, where all your decisions really do is inform the window dressing.  For a text-based game, where a narrative should be able to be expanded into multiple branching paths very cheaply, this is quite disappointing.  If you've made a text-based game whose central mechanic is simply player choice has less respect for that choice than a AAA game like Fallout: New Vegas, then you've dropped the ball.\n\nEmbarrassingly, I found a couple of typos as well.  The writing is interesting enough at first, but it gets frustrating later on as you'll probably figure out the big "twist" long before any of the characters do, but are powerless to do anything about it.\n\nIt's amusing for a while on a single playthrough, but that's about it.","June 18, 2014","false","4.3"," 372 of 501 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","372","501","0","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadwarder/recommended/299540/","roadwarder","roadwarder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadwarder/","21 products in account","“Heroes Rise” reminds me of one of those really bad tabletop RPG sessions, where the DM doesn’t understand what the point of a roleplaying game is and railroads the players into a very specific plotline, where the illusion of choice is sometimes presented but ultimately all “choices” lead to the same destination, and there’s no real input from the players.\n\nI can forgive the game for not giving the player a choice in powers. That’s not too huge of a problem to me, as long as there’s still enough variation in how we can utilize that specific power. The game definitely appears to give you this, although I’ll admit that I didn’t really explore a lot of the different options in combat, so I don’t know if selecting the “wrong” choice railroads the player into the path that the game wants you to go down, like it does during non-combat choices.\n\nAnd that’s this game’s fatal flaw. There are many moments where you are presented with a choice, but picking anything besides the “right” option will result in the game saying “well, that didn’t work, so you end up doing THIS instead.” That’s not how interactive fiction works. The name of the publisher is “Choice of Games,” right? As in, we get to choose how we proceed through the story? Not so in “Heroes Rise.”\n\nLet’s talk about one particular example of railroading in this story: the forced love interest, Black Magic. Early in the game, you (the player, not the character) are asked to name your first celebrity crush. Turns out that Black Magic looks JUST like that person, and is rumored to be their direct descendent. This is lazy writing. It’s the game’s way of saying “Hey, you should be pursuing this character!” without having to actually give them any depth or redeemable qualities, or any real in-character reason to pursue them (beyond the fact, as the game CONSTANTLY reminds you in any scene featuring Black Magic, that this character is just OOZING with sex appeal). It relies on basing their physical appearance on someone that the player (not even the character, but the player themselves) has (or had, once) a crush on, and hopes that that will be enough to justify railroading the player character into a romance.\n\nThe last straw for me was when (without trying to give too much away) Black Magic creates the illusion of terrible danger for the sole purpose of getting the player in bed. There’s a few options on how to respond to this. I went with completely rejecting her, because holy hell I am not interested in pursuing a character so terribly selfish and manipulative. And after selecting that option, the game literally told me that rejecting her was not a real option, and suddenly my character is sleeping with her anyway.\n\nIs there anything redeeming about “Heroes Rise”? I suppose the writing itself is decent. Maybe it should’ve just been written as a story, instead of disguised as interactive fiction. Not giving the player any real choice in how to pursue the story goes completely against what interactive fiction is all about, and thus I cannot recommend "Heroes Rise."","June 27, 2015","false","12.1"," 69 of 84 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","69","84","4","0"

As I do enjoy books and love customization options in games, including roleplaying and writing little short stories of my own I thought I'd give it a try. If nothing else perhaps it would give me some good memories of playing City of Heroes.\n\nSadly the game couldn't live up to the things the description says it would offer.\n\nI was outright shocked that I couldn't pick the hero I wanted to play. I didn't expect to be able to adapt my main protagonist down to every single ability, but I couldn't even pick a powerset, a background or anything like it. I was thrown a bone of a pre-designed character that I could pick gender, name, sexual orientation and favourite color for and that was the full customization available.\n\nFor a moment I thought about just closing and forgetting about this "game", but I decided to see it through. Maybe the story or the other parts of it would be better. The game starts you off in a pre-defined setting, with all predefined characters. I played around with the choices they give you, but the differences are barely noticeable. No matter what you pick the outcome for the story is the same. You always end up in the very same spot, no matter what you pick and not just once at the very end, but all the time at nearly every part of the story.\n\nChoice to me always is to influence something, not just to have meaningless statistics go up and down. If the world around my character doesn't react to my interactions in any way, what reason is there to give a choice in the first place?\n\nYou can do your worst to treat romance characters poorly yet they still end up wanting to be together with you, quite the same applies to other aspects. Theres a lawful statistic, yet you can never really work together with the bad side.\n\nNo serious customization. no choices that matter. So what remains of this game? It's a railroaded story, like a book and on top of that not even a very long or good one in my opinion.\n\nCharacters are without depth without motivations that make any sense and cliche is dripping from every corner. Antagonists in the story jump on you without real reason just for the sake that you have some bad guys to work against, but no one ever explains why they even dislike you in the first place. The only real motivation that gets obvious is for the main antagonist and even that one feels very forced, not very well thought through and just there for the sake of having something to make the story work, not because the character feels like they would really do anything like it on their own.\n\nOverall the game felt very lacking to me, and not just because it has no fancy graphical options or cool interface. It lacks meaningful choices, good character design and a world that reacts to you as a player. While the price isn't that high for it and I don't really worry about the money, I might have spent my time better by picking up some visual novel or a book instead, or  some other game if I seriously wanted a lot of choices.\n\nI cannot really recommend this game as it is. There are many better text based games out there that offer real choices, better writing and on top of that are free.","June 21, 2014","false","4.2"," 87 of 134 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","87","134","0","0"

This is one of those hidden gems, tucked in the corner of the closet, just waiting to be opened up. If you're put off by the imageless narrative and text-based gameplay, don't be. It doesn't take away from anything and I personally think it makes it more powerful.\n\nScenes are fleshed out and described with detail and precision. Characters have reason and motives behind them, making them feel a lot more alive than their 2D or 3D counterparts.\n\nThere are a lot of decisions to be made in this game and it's very refreshing and comforting to see that they do affect the story. Choices matter, even down to how powerful you make your attacks. Do you want to rip apart an enemy boss with a whirlwind or just incapacitate them with a punch? This game is fleshed out by your decisions and by your imagination. It's brought to life by your realizations and the amount of effort you put into it.\n\nGraphics are not everything. In this generation with our never-ending quest for true-to-life graphics, sometimes we forget what really matters: the story and the experience.\n\nThose things being said, my only gripe is that there is no 'undo' button. There were times when I accidentally skipped over an option because I'd press on my screen twice, making me restart the whole game again.\n\nPick this up, though.

Not only does Heroes Rise take out the "Choice" aspect by graying out options based on what they've streamlined you into to begin with, they also take out the "Game" as well, railroading you down a series of unavoidable plot devices changed in an almost imperceptible way via what rare choice you can make that has any effect.\n\nPossibly the worst part of the game, however, is the main character who either has to be Lawful Stupid or Chaotic Stupid depending on your options. You never choose the right options and often find yourself bumbling about leaving a trail of disasters no matter how hard you try or how perfectly you play the game.\n\nLast but not least is the villain which, avoiding any spoilers, literally has to give you a Powerpoint presentation of the evil plan.

These games were typically released for the mobile and web browser markets, and so you can imagine my surprise when I suddenly discovered one of the Choice Of...games suddenly show up on Steam.\n\nNow you might be looking at the screenshots, and seeing the minimalist approach to the game.  It's pretty barebones right? White screen, text.  And...well for the most part that's it.  That's how the games are intended, and the engine is actually available to make your own games.\n\nOkay great...enough background. So what is this game?  It's a Choose Your Own Adventure.  You remember those from when you were a kid?  "Want to see the glorious death you'll receive for making bad life choices? Turn to page 24!"  Well it turns out that they translate very well with text games like this one.   However don't be fooled in thinking that the game is this simple.  Choice of Games has a simple engine that allows for a lot of interesting ways to script events and allows the game to remember what your choices were.\n\nFor you it basically means that you'll have a Super Hero RPG that you can have multiple playthroughs.  You will have romance options and NPCs to interact and build relationships with in the same way you do in a Bioware game.  The difference? Less pretty graphics.\n\nHere's the thing...if you hate reading? Don't buy this.  It's all about reading.  The game itself is relatively dark in its portrayal of super heroes.  It sort of gets increasingly darker as the game continues in the sequel.   I found the characters interesting, and the options for designing my character throughout the game gave me the feeling that I really was making a bit of an impact.\n\nThe nature of the beast is that the game is kind of linear. Your choices, and you have many of them,  still eventually follow the same road, despite how you might take different paths to get there.   However if you like super heroes, love text adventures, enjoy choices and moral dilemas in your games then I suggest you try this.  You'll pretty much have a couple play throughs at least and considering how inexpensive the games are...I think it'll be worth it to you.\n\nI think it'll take you around an hour or two hours to play through it.  Obviously that's assuming you are reading the story.  Typically after the first playthrough you're probably gonna skip through things until you make a different choice and see what happens. Huzzah.

I was pretty sure it would be horrible. I can't say for what reasons, but that was the state I was in.\nAfter playing this, I can only conclude that not only does it bring me back to my childhood with the "Choose Your Own Adventure" series', it has applied logic which was never possible in a paperback format.\n\nThe writing done in this adventure was very well done. There are parts where I felt things moved too quickly or weren't very smooth, but they hardly took away from the experience. Even with some cheesy sayings or material (which was sort of fun), it flowed elegantly together in a very enjoyable and suprising story line.\nThe two things I feel could have been improved upon are the romance and the diverse elements of the storyline.\nThe romance at times was very well done, but in other areas there was too much emphasis placed on it; even at bad times. It also didn't mix into things very well at certain points and gave the impression of being randomly thrown in.\nThe storyline at times gave me the impression of making a decision, but the result would inevitably be the same regardless of what I chose, or it would have literally no relevant impact on current or future events. In my mind and what I would love personally, is to see a story intricate enough to reflect every decision made; a story smart enough to step back from any sense of a linear story and see many endings, with many futures. As complicated and time consuming as this would be, it would be epic. From looking over ChoiceScript, it's definitely feasible if someone finds themselves interested. Hell, I'm kind of interested.\n\nBut in conclusion, fantastic work. I just finished the second one and I'm currently a few chapters into the third. I've heard there is a fourth one in the works and I am really looking forward to it. If it were up to me, I'd like to see this series continue on even after that.","November 24, 2014","true","18.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

I just finished my first playthrough of this and had to write my review immediately. That's how much I enjoyed it.\n\nOn the surface it's a basic Super Hero story where you have the Hero (you) and an arch enemy. Though before all that you start off as just a normal person except you have powers. Which is pretty common in the future where the story takes place, but only by a 100 or so years i'm guessing. Where in order to actually become a hero you have to register with the government and get a permit. Which shortly after starting the game and getting introduced to yourself your grandmother pays for your permit for your birthday and your heroic story begins.\n\nI won't go much more into the story so I don't spoil anything. Even though it's a choose your own adventure and your story will probably differ from mine even if it's just minor. This is the first game in the trilogy and even though it's a choose your own adventure book at heart I do appreciate the fact that since it is a trilogy you are able to save your game and continue it in Part 2.\n\nOverall it is an amazing story, at least mine was and I would highly recommend it and urge you to pick up the $8 bundle that comes with all 3 games and the DLC. Even though the DLC is mainly just guides to help with achievements and what not and aren't really necessary I think the bundle still ends up saving you a couple bucks if you decide you want to play all 3.","August 27, 2015","true","7.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","4"

(It's impossible to go undercover when wearing your costume - if you choose to go undercover, surely the assumption is that you'd be putting on civilian clothes?)\n\nAfter the game ends, there's an epilogue which presents a number of other choices.

You don't conduct the plot train, you only get to paint it. CHOO CHOO!\nThe game uses its mechanics to do literally the opposite of what it's supposed to do: It tells you, "You are not in control of your character." There were points in the story where they present you with binary decisions and GRAYS OUT the other option. JUST GIVE ME A NEXT BUTTON, YOU ♥♥♥♥ER.\nThe game's idea of a "choice" is asking me what my character feels about a decision instead of letting me make it myself. At one point in the game you the main character and an important support character have a very stressful moment. Instead of letting me choose to not react in a way that will make the situation worse, it simply lets me pick which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing I say/do, in order to make it bite me in the ♥♥♥ later for the sake of the main plot.\nAt one point this game forced my character to have sex with another. I chose bisexual as my character's sexual orientation, and later in the game a male character who I don't really like (and have made decisions saying "not interested"), the game puts me in a sexual situation with him. I see this guy in bed and he's all like "let's pork". My character has been around this guy like an hour. I am presented with a choice walk away from the bed. you're not interested, I pick it. INSTEAD of doing that, my character CHANGES HER MIND and DOES THE OPPOSITE, having sex with the guy. To salt the wound, the next morning, after cuddling in bed, my character thinks to herself, "I've never been happier". It's like the author thought to himself, "People who are bi will screw anyone, right? Even if they say they don't want it, they want it. HYUKYUKYUK"\nTo top it off, most of the writing in this game is "choose what you like the best before I tell you what it is". You KNOW that ♥♥♥♥'s not important when the writer doesn't even care to inform you of what it is. In other words, this game pads its length by giving you TONS of useless choices that don't effect anything.\nTL;DR: Buy this game if you want the author to write AROUND your decisions, instead of trying to incorporate it, because it's easier to make money with a linear story, right?","July 28, 2015","false","8.1"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","20","30","0","1"

Most of my childhood was spent in the 1990s, so I was able to experience the actual "choose your own adventure" novels that were popular back when bookstores still actually existed. At the time, I actually didn't care for them. Nearly every one I read would have ridiculous consequences for choices that seemed logical; your character could die because of a sound choice you made, just because the author wanted to trick you out of a decision. That was my one concern going into the Choice of Games library of games. That, and whether the story would actually suck me in.\n\nIt did. Let me just say I'm not a huge superhero fan. Sometimes I watch the movies, and most of the time I'll play the games associated with various Marvel and DC characters. But I tend to find heroism too black and white to be practical, and tend to be far more interested in the villains of such stories, so I was a little worried this story wouldn't keep my attention. I read this interactive novel from start to finish in one three hour sitting, however, because it didn't shy away from keeping you actively involved in the outcome of certain events. You even get to make small decisions about what your character looks like that I did catch repeated later, helping you stay immersed (i.e. you get to choose what color your "energy" is, and I noticed the game would describe this later on in fights).\n\nIs it written well? For the most part, yes. I noticed some misspellings that could be attributed mostly to typos, and for some reason, the author here has a significant bias against using commas before the conjunction "but" that I noticed popped up multiple times throughout my playthrough. Are the mistakes noticeable? Yes. Are they game or immersion breaking? No. All in all, I noticed about ten errors over the course of a three hour interactive novel, which isn't too bad of a balance.\n\nIs the story any good? Yes. It's mostly a story about going from a nobody to a superhero in a futuristic, arguably dystopian society. The world is just as corrupt as its criminals, with a justice system that crosses the boundaries of reason, technology that is far too incorporated into human life than is safe, and laws that are questionable. You are able to choose where your beliefs lie in this mix, and I was pleased to see I was able to choose a path that wasn't just righteously heroic or immorally anti-heroic. You can also decide what your beliefs are early on and divert from them later, if you so choose, but the game will punish you for this diversion. Throughout the story you are able to choose what sexual orientation you have and you are also able to choose to romance one (or more) of a few characters. Even though I chose relatively early on to romance one character (and had a teen-rated romance scene with said character), I was still given the choice to profess feelings for another later on, so choices hadn't been taken away from me just because I'd already chosen someone else.\n\nWith that said, there were some choices that didn't quite make sense or that I made that in the end, didn't really matter. (I'll keep this spoiler-free.) It was revealed to me that a character I cared about had a pretty shocking secret, and I had to choose whether to be okay with this new information and accept the character with their flaws or not. I chose to say that I understood and was okay with it--and despite this, my character decided on her own to stop talking to this person and ignore all attempts of communication from them. In the end, it did end up that this could work out the way I had wanted it to begin with, but the story ended up deciding for me how my character felt despite me telling her to feel otherwise, which broke the immersion a bit. There's also a clear trust violation committed against you by a main character, and even though they explain it was done for your benefit (and you have the choice to refute that), you still end up giving into their whims and doing what they've wanted you to do all along, which really irked me. The story ended up telling me that my character just knew "it was right", and I honestly didn't agree. Because I had created this character to mimic my beliefs, to see her going against them angered me a bit and made me question the influence of some of my decisions.\n\nOverall, this was a well-written game that gave me more choices than I anticipated, and most of them made sense. Quite a few of them mattered quite a bit (for example, characters in this CAN die). I admired the author for steering clear of the goofy superhero format and sticking with the gritty, more realistic superhero formula that won't shy away from killing characters or having true consequences to actions. Although I was a bit disappointed in the mostly uninteresting villains this game had to offer, the heroes themselves had enough downfalls in their personalities to keep me intrigued in their character development. Because I got three hours out of one playthrough, I think the game is worth its full price even if you'll only go through it once (though, of course, there is massive replay value here). If I had to give it a rating, I would give Heroes Rise: The Prodigy an 8/10. This is a great game at a great price that will grab your attention and hold onto it until it concludes in an epilogue, and it should not be missed.","February 25, 2015","true","3.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I would also recommend this game (and the series as a whole) to anyone who wishes for more sexuality and gender diversity in the superhero genre. Only down side is the thin line between simple and shallow the game dances on, and the hack job of "romance" implemented as an optional subplot.\n\nThe Long of it:\nThe best thing about The Prodigy, and the Heroes Rise trilogy in all, is that it doesn't reward you for being the writer's idea of a "Hero," but for being consistent in your morals (basically: don't play as a character that's all over the place). While the game does scale this consistency on dichotomies of "lawful" vs. "lawless," "fame" vs. "justice" and "soloist" vs. "team player" none of these scales are mutually exclusive (despite what the color-coded bars imply) to one another or are viewed as inherently wrong: you could have a defensive soloist with the law on your side but have a penchant to showboating, or an offensive team player that distrusts authority but will work for the best of the group. During my first run I felt like my choices really mattered, but I was let down during the rail-roaded chain of events nearing the (only) climax, but it does pick up the ball again near the very end of the final fight, though it may seem railroaded again because unless you have a wishy-washy character the final choice for the fight is practically chosen for you depending on the "lawlessness" vs. "lawfulness" scale.\n\nThis wonderful scale falls flat, again, with a shallow story that may only hold a twist or two for people not versed in the cliches of the superhero genre. The first time I played through, I was surprised at some of the late-game twists, despite having read comics since I was eight (but that may be because I myself am trusting), but afterwards it did all seem very droll, such as the main villain's motivation, and what they do to make your character lose faith in the world around them.\n\nIt also felt like only a minimal amount of worldbuilding was done as Millenia City wasn't fleshed out (you only get to see about two-to-three areas of the city while it's continually reiterated to be a sprawling metropolis), but the characters within are very diverse not only in their personalities, but in who they. I enjoyed meeting many of the characters like The Monk and Fistfull from the Millennial Group (the game's version of The Avengers/Justice League), the three choices you have as a sidekick, and others around the Eastern Fringe. Even the villains like the Splice Circle were interesting. But this leads me to yet another of the negative points: The "Romance(s)"\n\nOne of the characters in the game  is specifically tailored to your character's sexuality and gender: straight male, lesbian, and bisexual heroes whose last partner was female have Fem. Main Interest, while gay males, straight females, and bisexual heroes whose last partner was male get a Masc. Main Interest. I can understand that this is so that every and any characters have the option of a love interest. But this is clunkily done because the game prompts you to input a real life celebrity's name as the sole descriptive of the love interest. It feels creepy because the never let that "descriptive" go. Every time they describe the character you just get a [celebrity's name] face/hair/eyes ect. ect. This traps the character within the realm of "love interest" and nothing even approaching individuality despite their unique backstory (and by "unique" I mean an actual plot twist), which is really grating. Especially if the Main Interest ends up female, which adds into the ever-present trend of women being solely present in the superhero genre for titillation and romantic (with creepy under/overtones) fantasy. It also grated on my nerve when the game didn't understand my character's no meant "NO, I don't want a romance" and I was forced to play out the scene where my character was coerced into going into the love interet's room under false pretenses which was remarkably sexually charged and ended up making me feel angry and creeped, while I was okay with it when I actually wanted the romance sub-plot.\n\nThe game would have done better if the "Main Love Interest" was like the other romantic choice. She's only available if you have a lesbian or female bisexual character, but Jenny Yu, your superhero-witness-protection-program agent, proves that the writer CAN right a good love interest. Jenny is her own character with her own motivations and goals. Most importantly, nothing about her changes depending on your choices in Character Creation excluding the possiblity she could be romantically interested in your character. While the reveal she is a romancable option is late game (after the climax), it did feel a bit more holistic, mostly due to the flirty lines interspersed in your character's interactions with her throughout the entire game and not jumping to the "~romance~" (and by that I mean blacked-out sex) after meeting the Main Love Interest not even five chapters prior. If you're planning on playing the full series, and desire to romance anyone, Jenny is widely preferable the "Main Love Interest" introduced in The Prodigy. This deals mostly with my experience with The Hero Project, Prodigy's sequel in which you can transfer up the Main Character along with their stats and choices, but that is not important to playing The Prodigy as a stand-alone.\n\nWhat's best about that is that players don't feel obligated to buy the sequel as The Prodigy nicely ties off the main story, along with multiple sub-plot threads. The ending left me with an upbeat, optimistic feeling and a sense of wonder about where my character would go, which is the best way to end a game in my opinion.","October 27, 2014","true","9.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Perhaps I expected too much from this: like choosing to be a hero or a villain, vigilante or caped crusader, maybe even choose my own powers or create my own character.  However, none of these concepts seem to be involved in this game.  In fact, this game is much more similiar to a short novel (I read through it in 2-3 hours).  Very linear with some unnecessary decision making throw in for good measure.  For example, you can write who your superhero crush looks like. Yet your choices don't have much impact on the progression on the story, really, your choices only seem to affect your "legend" meter, which interprets how famous you are.  Also, at times I wished this book went deeper by making the characters, world, or dialogue more believable instead of superficial.  The book is also riddled with various cliches and cringe-worthy character development ( I mean come on, a villain named Lolli that controls  a prostitution ring?).  Nothing about this game seems memorable in my opinion.  It reminds me more of a trashy teen novel than a video game, and therefore, I wouldn't recommend this.\n\nTL;DR: 0/10 not a weal game\n\n\nSIDENOTE: I tried to make my character a soloist, and not fall in love with Black Magic.  However, the exact opposite happened.  I quit the hero team, but the game forced me rejoin anyway.  And I was a huge ♥♥♥♥ to the Black Magic yet somehow still she fell in love with me anyway.

For the most part you only can expect a short flavor blurb. And while I understand that the amount of story forks and side stories need to be limited even in a purely text-based game there isn't even a SINGLE meaningful choice in the entire adventure or any substantial side story.\nAnother problem is the writing itself, for the most it's serviceable enough but in some aspects it's decidedly less than stellar, mostly when it comes to the villain. While I do not expect them to produce a villain worthy of Shakespeare the main villain and also other villainous characters are just very cheesy and ham-fisted but the author tries to play them straight. As a result I couldn’t help but roll my eyes at many supposedly serious but unintentionally silly scenes.\n\nTL;DR: I can’t recommend Heroes Rise: The Prodigy to anyone who likes to have even minor consequential choices or side stories.","January 31, 2015","false","6.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It doesn't overcome the limitations of the genres, such as the sometimes constricting linearity of text adventures, and the cheesiness and melodrama of superheroes, but instead embraces them and works within these constraints to craft a satisfyingly complex narrative that lives up to the best standards of the genres. The choices you make are convincing in how they drive the story, and it's nice to have a meaningful stats screen that actually helps, rather than hinders, you to enjoy the game. For those who already like the genres: you'll enjoy this; for don't like these genres: look elsewhere; to the majority just looking for an entertaining game: keep an open mind and I promise you'll get your money's worth.

Heroes Rise has kind of sold me on the idea though.\n\nWhat you get (for crazy cheap), is essentially a knock-off Telltale Games adventure (in the best possible way). The story is fairly simple in the Prodigal, but manages a few really good moments. It manages to sustain "the illusion of choice" throughout the whole story with only a few hiccups. There are a few decent twists, though the main twist was clear to me even before they started giving clues which the protagonist fails to put together.\n\nHeroes Rise also has a fair bit of comedy, both the intentionally written and when you screw with the ability to write in your own name. An example of the latter would be my heroic codename: Grimdark. It was hilarious imagining serious people and heroes referring to my hero as Grimdark. As for intentional writing, my favourite moment was blackmailing two superheroes having a homosexual affair, because it was the most heroic thing to do clearly.\n\nThe 'combat' is mostly a veneer. You'll have text options to choose a series of attacks that will generally cost a differing number of 'power points'. However despite the games numerous warnings of the need to conserve you're strength and to use appropriate levels of force, I rarely came close to running low and never ran out. Same thing with health, so the risk of hitting zero (and death) is virtually nil.\n\nSo I do recommend it. Buy the bundle while its at a discount or even after that. What this game is, is a fairly fun romp for a decent number of hours (depending on how fast you read).","June 28, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I remember the days of my boyhood where I would go to Funcoland (Something that existed before Gamestop younglings) and would buy PC text-game with my hard earned 5$ allowance. Back then I barely understood what I was doing half the time and just tried to get the the "official" end of the game and could by this point claim satisfaction as a kid playing his windows game.\n\nWhen I saw Heroes Rise on Steam Sale, I looked and thought "Here comes some poorly animated, poorly done, badly written mess with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story and terribly graphic'd final-fantasy fights. Safe to say I was shocked to hear that this was a text-based game and of all things the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure kind. It made me curious and I bought the game only to load it and start playing with the intent that the game would be something of a time-passer at best when I was sitting in my classes or pretending to listen to my friends over the phone.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nFirstly I will say this about Heroes Rise. If you bought this game expecting to play a variety of characters, then you will be sorely disappointed. Your story is summarily pre-written with you only to change certain things to fit your mood or tone. Sadly you cannot be a vigilante with no special powers, an alien who crashed on earth, or any of the other overused and overdone origins we see in most superhero stories. The explanation for "Powered Heroes" however makes up for this and if thought about considering the setting, does fit the bill enough if you suspend your disbelief the amount NEEDED to play a game like this.\n\nHowever it should be noted that your characters name, gender, alias/codename as a hero, costume, morals, and their sidekick are yours to decide from several options that make the game in my opinion more than worth playing over again some few times after you've beaten it, just not excessively because let's face it...You wouldn't crack open a book you just finished a week ago to read it again, would you? For replayability value, the same ideal applies to this game. Though in all of the decisions that you could make that I listed, you're likely realizing that I didn't list what often is wanted in a Superhero for wanted variety. Powers.\n\nSadly, your character comes with predetermined set of powers and that is sadly what drags the game down from being better in my honest opinon. With a bit of extra writting and coding I'm sure they could've given more lovable variety to this game by letting you choose a bit of variation to your powers such as elements or origin. However again, when you consider the story they are telling, it can be forgiven and glanced over. Especially given the twist concerning your powers and your potential should you press the subject during gameplay. Which brings me to make clear that the game has it's moments of deep immersion and well-written storytelling (aside from some typos you can spot) throughout your playthrough.\n\nIt both caters to and even manages to stray away from some of the tropes and stereotypes a fan of comic-books or superheroes would be familiar with. Some things that I myself as a reader of comics had assumed would happen, ended up proceeding -completely- differently than I expected them to. Though I'll admit there are several inconsistencies I believe to have spotted...however again this game is based off of your imagination and suspense of disbelief so such things can be forgiven easily so long as you don't dwell on them as critically as I have.\n\nIn the end I can say that this game is worth the money you pay for it. It's fun, stimulating, makes you think of how you want your character to act, and really the only thing about it that saddens me is that the game doesn't have actual graphics to it. However it wouldn't be TEXT-BASED then, now would it? With this being the first installment and my already buying the sequel as well as awaiting the third installment to complete the trilogy I'm sure things will be revised as time goes on. All in all the game is worth the few dollars it cost when I purchased it and so long as you aren't expecting a priceless gem, and can settle for something that just shines on it's own...I reccommend buying it despite my critical review of it.","June 27, 2014","true","64.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Since it's a text-based game though, there are no images. Heroes Rise certainly isn't for people who don't like to read. But for those who do like to read and don't mind a lack of graphics, I think it's definitely worth the money. I recommend you play the demo to get an idea of what this game is like. The writing does a decent job of capturing the feeling of reading comics or watching a superhero show, but it's a lot more intimate since it's your character. There are dramatic plot twists and over-the-top scenes befitting the genre. The characters are interesting and not quite how you might expect them to be. I also really love the racial and LGBTQIAP+ diversity in the game (and can't help but want even more!).\n\nThat isn't to say the game is perfect. Unfortunately, while the plot is engaging, the overall events stay the same no matter what you do. There is replay value in the different scenes that you can trigger, but for a game like this, the storyline really should be branching. Your actions should have more effects than they do. The game could also do with some options to change font size and color, and background color. You're locked into the standard black and white. While I don't mind it, I imagine that some people might want to change it. Heroes Rises also needs an option to access the various save files you have. I'd like to play more than one character at once.\n\nDespite those gripes, the largest of which is the linear storyline, I still found myself sucked into the Heroes Rise universe, empathizing with the characters and looking forward to what would happen next. I could hardly put the game down. The entertainment I got out of it was worth the few bucks. Just be aware that you might not feel the same way, particularly if the linear storyline and lack of graphics turn you off.","June 21, 2014","true","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Seems obvious, but the "Choice of" series has a few games I would recommend to people who are looking to be converted and for me this isn't one of them. It's fairly long, a lot of the choices lend themselves to multiple playthroughs, and the sequel only adds to that. But if you're already cool with this kinda game, this is a good one. The plot and characters are entertaining and the blend comic-book hero with celebrity aspects has enough going for it to keep you interested. It should be noted that a lot of the choice aspects are more about building stats then every single choice having a distinct story outcome; although some obviously effect the story, it's more about developing your character and their mindset.

It is a choose your own adventure after all, and many of your decision points have three or more sets of choices. The problem is that the game does not reward choices unless you go down very specific paths. Some of those paths are even pre-chosen for you. Note, that the full review will have major spoilers.\n\n1: The entire plot is linear. You always fail your first mission, you always join the big group, you always fall in love with the one superhero who looks like your childhood crush. I understand this is a text based game, but I felt like some of my decisions were simply choosing my method of going into the next wall of text rather than actually changing what would happen.\n\n2: The choices you get completely free will on are purely aesthetic. You choose your first and last name for free, you get to choose your superhero name for free. You get to choose the name of your parents' "Song" which is engraved on their wedding ring. Most importantly, you get to choose what your character's childhood crush is because there is a sexy superhero who looks just like them! They give you a ton of predetermined choices on those BTW.\n\n3: Your character's moral alignment has to be pure one way or the other to get a perfect score. Most of your choices purely affect your four moral alignments: Fame/Justice, Solo/Team, Offensive/Defensive, and Lawless/Lawful. You can only get a perfect score if you stick to your guns ENTIRELY TO ONE SIDE. Do you want to be in it for the fame, but work with a team and the police? Or do you want to be a soloist hero who breaks the law, but does it for justice? These complex characters are not rewarded, but are in fact penalized with getting the "bad ending" of the game in which 314 people die because your character was too slow.\n\n4: The "bad" alignments are sometimes bad for no reason. I want to work on my own, but I'm not a ♥♥♥♥. There is a scene I got where I found two of the members of the not!Justice League making out in the bathroom. My choices were "Blackmail them?" or "I saw nothing, don't worry." I wanted to be a soloist, but doing the latter raised my team player points because I worked with the team. Why does working alone mean you have to be a ♥♥♥♥? If you just had a Mass Effect "Paragon/Renegade" slider that would have been better.","June 25, 2014","false","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What I don't like about it is that it is written from a very feminine point of view, but you can still choose to play as a male character: If you choose a male hero, his thoughts and actions are incongruent with how a male superhero should behave. He'll be sobbing on the floor because of an argument with his grandma, and be an emotional basketcase. I wanted to be a badass male hero that gives 0 'sluggers' (The author uses the word slugger instead of f*ck, which is comical but immersion breaking for me), but all you can be is a sissy beta teen. It's very frustrating when you get to choose multiple options, and all of them are some variant of: "Behave like a child throwing a tantrum".\n\nIf you choose to start as a female character, however, everything makes perfect sense. Instead of a sissy boy that somehow gets laid by supermodels you get a feminine heroine whose charms enchant those around her. Who succeeds despite her emotional instability. There's a few times when you can choose multiple options which all lead to the same result, which is immediatly obvious after choosing them and immersion breaking. There's some minor spelling errors here and there, but nothing too obvious. There's also a few times where I think choices do not have adequate explanations, leading to unexpected negative outcomes which can be frustrating.\n\nAll in all I can recommend this game. The price was very low for me, much less than a good book costs. You'll need strong suspension of disbelief, especially if you want to play as a male character. Maybe the author intentionally wrote the story from the perspective of the female heroine and added the option to be a male hero just for diversity, but I found the actions of and the responses to other characters of me playing as a male hero so unbelievable, that I had to restart the game at around chapter 13 to play as a female.","June 25, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'd have to say it is more of an interactive novel than a choose your own adventure, if you can understand my distinction between the two. Some choices seem 'not to matter' but actually affect your stats which in turn can affect your Legend score at the end of the game.\n\nSome people will be disappointed that they can't decide what powers they get or what their background is, but that is what I meant by an interactive novel. This is part of a series with a plot which can seem a bit more rigid than some of the other Choice of Games. I don't feel this should stop you if you enjoy the idea of superheroes and a setting with a decent enough background.\n\nAnother complaint I have seen is somebody saying it was too 'dark' for them and they wanted something 'silly'. I don't think that part of their review warranted the downvote. In fact, if you can get past feeling led here and there, the story can be quite moving.\n\nIn the end, this is not as good as some of the other games from the same company. Maybe wait for it to go on sale if you aren't sure, though honestly it doesn't cost much.","January 15, 2015","true","15.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/recommended/299540/","JaysonFour","JaysonFour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/","299 products in account","(Note:  This review covers the whole trilogy.)\n\nHow many of us read comics when we were kids? You know- you'd go on down to the comic shop, drop a few coins or dollars on the latest issues of your favorite caped crusaders, and then proceed to simply lose yourself in the battles and adventures within- and maybe gripe when the blasted thing ended on yet another cliffhanger. Of course, that and a cup full of whatever colored sugar-water they used to call a kids' drink was enough to fuel hours of afternoon playtime as we imagined ourselves to fly like Superman, swing through Gotham like the Batman, or to deflect bullets and fight crime like Wonder Woman. But nowadays, well... video games can only do so much... so why not load up on your favorite sugary drink and see where your imagination takes you? Time to suit up and fight crime in the "Heroes Rise Trilogy".\n\nThis is a set of text adventures published by Choice Of Games, the same wonderful people behind another game I reviewed, "Slammed!". I told you this is a company you ought to throw bags of money at and support, and I still stand by that. The options you have are staggering in character creation- you craft up your own hero, with the only caveat that you can't choose your last name. Pick your options (name, superhero name, gender, sexuality- just like the other CoG stuff I've played, you're free to choose among all the options no matter what you pick, which is a plus!), and go to town. There are other options you'll end up choosing, but those are spoilers, and you don't get any from me, especially on these games!\n\nYour role is an up-and-coming superhero, taking your first steps into the heroic life- and trust me when I say that enemies come in all shapes, sizes, and shades of gray. This isn't like the Adam West Batman show, this is more like a damn good season of Justice League Unlimited, the original Teen Titans, or the original X-Men cartoon that used to run on Fox Saturday Mornings. It'll suck you in, and it'll grab your attention to where you want to see what happens next. Every choice you make could influence how you are viewed, how others react to you, and how your powers could develop. It's honestly a great thing, and there are many, many different endings. Characters can live, die, change views, but one thing will always be the same- it's up to you and your decisions alone. How you live, how you talk, how you fight- everything has repercussions.\n\nThe story wouldn't be out of place on a comic shelf, drawn by some popular artist. That's what makes this whole game- the story and writing are easily top-notch. There's not a damned error or grammar screwup anywhere. I honestly had a hard time finding anything to knock this game for.\n\nAbout the only thing I really can knock it for is the lack of the ability to save. If you want to see how choices play out, you've got to restart the whole game- and some of the choices from the first game have far-reaching implications, so sometimes you'll need to replay "The Prodigy" and "The Hero Project" to see new material in "Herofall". Being able to simply save and poke around, even if it's certain points like new chapters. would be welcome.\n\nOther than that, well... there's not anything I can complain about it. You have to think about what some of the characters look like, but... brush off your imagination and use that. If you can draw, do that. But don't just chuck this game out because it doesn't have pretty pictures.\n\nHowever, it's been confirmed that we are getting a part 4: "The Hero Project: Redemption Season". It launches on April 8th and I almost did the Snoopy dance when I saw that. I'm sure that I'll end up buying this day one when it hits Steam because it is that damned good.\n\nCurrently, you can buy these individually on Steam, or you can scoop up the whole trilogy along with DLC for eight Gabendollars. This is the best eight bucks you'll ever spend if you love superhero things or text adventures.\n\nI wish more games like these existed- this is worth every dollar you'll pay for it and every minute you'll put into it.\n\nTL;DR - Do you like heroes, text adventures or just great stories in general? You'll love this. 9/10.","April 2","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is not, perhaps, the most shining example there is of its genre, but it is so engaging and unique that all else can be forgotten.\n\nMost interactive fiction stories have a single tool for controlling the story, which are the choice branching (which is great by itself) but this game, and every other good Choice of Games out there, carry yet another tool which is incredible in and out of itself, which is the stat system. It allows you to shape your character in different ways and explore the story multiple times with different personalities, not just by choosing different pathways.\n\nI am goin to start with what this game is bad at because I think that is the best way to convene what it is so good at.\n\nHeroes Rise: The Prodigy makes a somewhat narrow use of this stat system by role fitting the player. That means that you will only be getting the best results by following a focused, inflexible play style, and you won't be getting your full glory if you follow what your intuition tells you its right to do at a given time. You need to think in a specific fashion, and you are not even given the opportunity to change your mind at any moment if you want to achieve the best results.\n\nThis kind of recipe system is limiting, but here's what it gives you: The Prodigy's events are somewhat narrow, in the sense that you can play it many times and you will mostly be going through the same situations, but what it gives you is the possibility to go through them in different ways, different play styles, different convictions, and experience the same events through a different perspective. Each time you play it, it can be a quite different experience from the last one.\n\nThe game shines in its adventure: Some people will say that the events are predictable, and it might definitely be true depending on your experience level, and the magic is, it's still fantastic and engaging every time you play it, even if you already know what is going to happen. The characters are interesting (though some relationships develop strikingly fast), the situations you find yourself in makes you care for your choices, especially in combat, and the very first time you play it, you may feel like the story keeps feeding you despite being already over. Multiple times, perhaps multiple playthroughs, even.\n\nDon't be fooled by my hours on record, I've played this game a couple of dozens of time on another platform and I still find myself wanting to go back and experience it every now and again. The fact that it is part of a trilogy only makes it all the more exciting, as you can take your character just like you left it in the previous story for another ride with a completely new adventure style in every instance.\n\nDefinitely worth to love.","June 19, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game goes deep with choices that reflect whether your a hero that wants fame or justice, to abide by the law or lawless and get the job done by any means necesarry even if you want to join a superhero team akin to "The Avengers" or "Justice League" or go it solo. However, the best part to me is the twist and turns that completely turn things upside down and have you wondering what truly is the right choice to be made? It's not so easy to be a superhero afterall, go figure. Towards the end when things really got interesting I could really feel myself getting tense and even emotional as I read page after page and made harder choice after harder choice. It really got me into it and anyone with a wild vivid imagination should definately pick this up and let their mind explore what they would do if they where a superhero.

This feels more like the latter and not FF books.

While I was going through the game, I was really engaged and felt like I could play out a lawless, anti-hero fairly well.\nWould I play through again? No. It becomes very obvious that many decisions aren't really decisions. Either way I will end up going down the same path even if I take a detour of a single additional page. One of the frusterating thing about the CYOA books was that your choices were any that could be thought through. You could make a decision and some completly unexpected, unpredictable event would occur. This has a number of those moments.\nDespite this, I did enjoy it for a single play through.

There are times when you're given 5+ choices or so, but then each one leads to the same outcome. Choices are uninteresting and lack the thought-provoking aspect that I sought. Choices are also limited in that what I wanted to do wasn't one of the options.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ominousflare/recommended/299540/","ominousflare","Ominous Flare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ominousflare/","31 products in account","The Heroes Rise trilogy has an awkward obstacle keeping it from being great. The word is that the third installment is supposedly the best of the series, and that the second one, "The Hero Project" isn't half-bad either. The problem is that you have to suffer through the first one before you can get to better character customisations in the later games. And the customisation of "The Prodigy", unfortunately, just isn't that great.\n\nFor starters, you don't get to choose your powers. That's understandable, but my problem is... you don't even get to choose from a set of powers. Having to choose from at least five powers would have gave the game a better sense of variety, but unfortunately, you only have the option of being 'defensive' or 'offensive', which would affect your 'defensive' and 'offensive' stat. And that's really kinda boring, really. What's the point of playing a superhero if you don't get that many options of choosing your powers?\n\nFrom that, it's clear that the game suffers from the same rigidity every game with choices (like Mass Effect) suffers from, which is sacrificing the player's freedom of choice to force him onto an enforced storyline. While the game does offer a number of ways your character operates (either being a solo hero with a sense of justice, or a lawless badass who's on a team), the ending to this first game will largely be the same. Basically, kinda like the Mass Effect 1 and 3 ending but with a wider variety of colors.\n\nThe variations the game offers comes in the form of three sets of 'percentage calculations':\n\nSet 1\n- Fame/Justice\n- Lawless/Lawful\n- Offensive/Defensive\n- Soloist/Team Player\n\nSet 2\n- Power Level\n- Health Level\n- Money\n- Legend\n\nExcluding 'Legend', the stats on Set 2 won't affect the story too much. Then there's also Set 3, composing of 'relationship stats' that will affect the kind of character interactions you'd have. Set 1 and Set 3 are the stats which will vary the storyline. Although the main story you're on will begin the same way and end the same way, the few flavors in between your choices are enough to give you the kind of illusion of choice you'd see in the first Mass Effect game (this game unfortunately won't reach the level of nonlinearity ME2 and ME3 did, with their multitude of relationship sub-stories).\n\nTo be clear - this isn't really so much a flaw as it is an impractical element of gaming. An enforced storyline with a few variations is an obstacle no game developer has found a practical way of working around yet. Games with choices will always have one enforced storyline with some variations to the things that affect your character. You won't have three or five different kinds of adventures with different settings or genres to choose from, just one, because it otherwise costs too much time and money. Bioware has done this more successfully though with ME2 and ME3, where the variations are numerous enough to give you a sense of individuality - The Prodigy does not have that. Furthermore, this obstacle brings out the real flaw of the game - the writing of the one story you're forced onto.\n\nTelltale games (minus The Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones) have a similar structure: one storyline with variations that are a lot more subtle than Heroes Rise: The Prodigy. This isn't a bad thing when the story is well-done (The Walking Dead). Choices and nonlinearity don't matter when the story isn't well-done (Life is Strange). Heroes Rise falls somewhere between professional comic book storylines and amateur ones (the poorly-written kind game developers shoe-horn into cheap superhero games like Marvel Heroes Online). It does deconstruct the superhero genre a little bit, offering a few twists that are kinda clever, but don't expect Grant Morrison or Neil Gailman material. It's not terrible, but it could have been better.\n\nThat being said, The Prodigy's story should be well-written enough to keep you distracted before you get to the meatier, more dramatic stuff in the second and third game. The sense of individuality still doesn't reach a great level in the sequel, "The Hero Project" (which I just started playing), and the whole "Reality TV" storyline seems trite and uninspired (not to mention tasteless for some people), but I heard that the third and final game, "Herofall", is supposed to be really great for some reason. Furthermore, the variation in flavors does increase to a little extent in the second game. So it's essentially "play the first rigid game to get to the less rigid second game so that you could get to the reputable third game".\n\nIn a time when CYOA superhero stories are rare and few, this is unfortunately the best you can get if you're interested in superheroes like myself. For non-superhero fans though, I can't really recommend spending money on this amateur work. You can find much better CYOA games out there, like The Wolf Among Us and maybe even Choice of Robots (Choice of Games' most popular work, it seems).","August 24, 2015","false","57.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

My problem is that it is the exact same as the mobile version. (Note - my time played doesn't take into account that I played and completed the game on my android several times.)\n\nI loved this series for mobile, and the story is just as good now as it was when it first started - but I strongly feel there should be a difference in the interface between the different platforms. Doesn't have to look pretty or have a different feel, but I have a hell of a lot more screen space - why can't I see my stats as a side bar? Why do I have to keep switching back into the stats screen? What about keyboard shortcuts? Why can't I change the font and size? And if you're not changing a thing about the game, why do you want me to pay twice for the same exact content?\n\nIt strikes me as opportunistic and it takes advantage of CoG's loyal customer base. DLC is not a good reason for having to pay twice. And for people new to the series, the interface (which makes sense for mobile and some sense for web) is a serious turn off on a pc.\n\nIf you already have it on your phone, don't bother with this. And if you don't, still don't bother with this - just get the mobile version.

I was a big fan of pick-your-adventure books when I was young, and interactive novels I have always enjoyed. Fate/Stay Night was a particularly good one from Japan, but there are a lot of graphics since they like to make their novels into anime.\n\nHere, instead we have no graphics, no sound effects. Just the power of words well written. I like how you could choose how certain characters reacted to you with different personas. The MeChip butler, diva or caretaker all gave a different feel for the game, for example.\n\nFor those looking for 27 endings of different plots, you'll have no fun with this novel. It's not really a game, more like a novel that you can immerse yourself in more deeply than a regular book because you get to add a bit of your own personality to the characters. I really became attached to the character in this story, and I've since bought the sequel, Heroes Rise: The Hero Project, and read that one through multiple times as well, I am looking forward to the final installment of the trilogy.\n\nI've stated before in my reviews, that I base a lot of it on how much a product costs me to play for the time I invest in it. At under $5.00 I've easily gotten my money's worth, and with it on special til June 24th at $1.99 it's hard to go wrong for something that you'll spend a few hours at a minimum reading. It's hard to find a paperback in a used bookstore for that price.\n\nAnyways, for what it claims to be, an interactive novel with memorable characters, it was a great investment for me.

I appreciated the customization options for features of the main character, as it not only made for a nice, tailored experience but also made me eager to replay the game to see what they affected.  The decisions you make feel important in the moment, and I rarely felt the dreaded "They don't have the option for what I want to do here!". I enjoyed the twists and turns of the narrative, but surprisingly, that doesn't mean it's only enjoyable once. Just like any good mystery, it's fun to go back and see the bits of foreshadowing you missed, as well as gloating about the ones you caught. It has achievements if that's what you're into, though I personally don't care much for those.\n\nI would say the only negative to my experience was the inability to take back a decision. If you want to try changing one decision towards the end of the game, or you misclicked something, you still have to restart from the beginning to change that decision. I understand why this would be important to have as a feature for the first time through, but I'd rather see that be an option decided by the player in repeat playthroughs rather than it being forced. I've seen others mention they'd like different background colors or font choices, and I'd support those being included but didn't think about them myself as I was going through.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game and am looking forward to starting the sequel right now!","June 19, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But first, you're going to have to get over the fact that this game has no graphics whatsoever.\n\nHeroes Rise is a Choose Your Own Adventure game with stats.  Unlike most visual novels, you have a huge number of choices, and unlike most CYOA games, most of your choices aren't instant-lose or go on with the story.  Instead, many of them have meaningful but small impacts on your game, with a few having the potential to completely change the story.\n\nChoice of Games, the developer, has made a variety of these games - some of which you can play on your web browser or phone for free (like Choice of the Dragon, or Choice of Broadsides).  All of them have huge word counts, branching paths and player choices, and all of them have memorable characters and storylines.\n\nIn Heroes Rise, you play a young super-powered individual, born of two superheroes who now rot in a maximum security prison, seeking to make a name for yourself.  It paints a vision of the future in which superpowers are relatively common, but superheroes are not - and it does a good job.  The world and its characters are memorable and interesting, and there's some replayability in it as well, because the choices you make can lead you to several storylines - although they all end up in the same place, more or less.\n\nMy advice to you would be to try out the demo, or go to Choice of Game's web site and try out one of their games there first.  If you like what you see, well, that's what you're getting here: a good story, lots of words, lots of choices, and not much else.\n","June 21, 2014","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Charmingly written and all in all very well done. I am so glad I stumbled across this and decided to buy, because truly the folks over at Choice Of Games have a love and a talent for creating great stories. I hope that this game catches on, that this genre catches on, and that we begin to see a lot more of this in the mainstream Steam audience.","June 19, 2014","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game captures most aspects one would inquire about if superheroes existed, as well as briefly touching upon potential social issues, political developments, and economic/technological advancements of an alternate future.

After playing and falling in love with Choice of Robots, I came into this game with high hopes. I wouldn't say i'm disappointed but my expectations definitely got in the way of this game's story.\n\nSome of the choices in this story don't feel fully flesh out, which results in some choices to feel completely ignored, no matter what choice you make. Which wouldn't be to bad, and I can see how it would save time during production, but as a player resulting in me reading the next page, "well, that was pointless".\n\nThe story sure takes its time to ramp up, and all the video game-ish mechanics being explained in a fictional world comes across weird. Instead of feeling "warn out", you have a chip in your wrist that tells you that you are "low on mana". I feel like that could be kept within the story's boundaries and explained with just a few sentences.\n\nI think I'm almost done with this book, but depending on the ending I may not start the second in the series. My character is kind of a push over hero, and a little too attached to her fame status. The Legend level thing also feels a little to RPG-ish for a fictional book world.

In the beginning it felt like I was playing a bad superhero cliché written for teenagers...\n\nAs I stumbled through my first mission, however, my opinion of the game changed quite a bit. Some of the choices you can make are hilarious. The more miserably my fledging hero failed, the more I became invested in her story. Also, there were some twists and turns I really didn't see coming.\n\nIn sum, the game is a lot more complex than I initially gave it credit for. Choices you make in the first game have an effect on what happens in the finale. And yes, you can get key characters killed by accident.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning, that the writer created a world that is fully LGBTQA inclusive, which I appreciate.","December 30, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is well thought out and the character development plays similarly to a movie.  The game captures most aspects one would inquire about if superheroes existed, as well as briefly touching upon potential social issues, political developments, and economic/technological advancements of an alternate future.

It does suffer from a few problems though and here a few major one I have:\n\n1. Grammar and errors - Don't get me wrong this is a well written story and it is compelling but it has quite a few grammar errors and even a few words spelt incorrectly, some probably from a slip up. Its not a huge glaring thing at first but after playing through it a while you start to notice a lot of them dotted around, which can cause you to be pulled out of the story. And since it has been out since 2012 on CoG I would have thought many of them would have been fixed or corrected but to my surprise many of them are still there.\n\n2. Biast choices - This game is about being a hero, YOU being a hero. Not the writer. But it seems as though the writer had a little trouble trying give pro responses for other choices. For example when you get nominated for the HoT award and you have to choose between saving your Sidekick or a reporter. It paints that saving the sidekick is the "Right/Justice" choice and saving the reporter is the "wrong/Fame" choice, it even reflects this in a stat update once you make your decision. For me this is one of the problems with the Stats and the way the game part is done, it could even be not the creators fault in the end. Its done in a very "Stereotypical" mindset and doesn't try to go outside the box too much. Why is saving the sidekick the Justice choice? Sure they help during missions but does that mean you should sacrifice a civilian just to save your sidekick? Maybe saving the reporter is a good bump for your "Fame" stat but why has it got to be seen that way? Why isn't saving the reporter also seen as a Justice choice? You are saving an innocent person, who isn't even a hero. Why can't I choose to save the reporter as I think its the right thing to do? Rather than just for fame? Its even more annoying when you reach an extreme in one stat it will grey out other choices! Why take away my control?! Maybe I am blowing this out of proportion but it just grinds me the wrong way. Maybe a CYOA game is very restrictive in how you do things. But still at least the wording could've been done a little better. And I don't even think its as annoying as it is in the sequel, where it really starts to irritate me but we'll get to that in their review.\n\n3. Lack of Graphics - Now I know its a Text game but a little graphic content would be nice. Like font colours for special text. Maybe an image for the cover screen? Or maybe showing off shots of various areas around Millenium City? I would like to see what the Fringes look like :D Even if its just an arial view. Seeing as this game is making its debute here it would've been nice to add a few extra features here and there.\n\n4. Graphic Content - Talking of "Graphic content" why are there hardly any swear words? They've all been mostly replaced with the word "Slugger". Whilst amusing at first it got really annoying when an tense scene happens and all you character says is "Slugger" it kind of dampens the mood of the scene. I could understand if this game was aimed at pre-teens but it describes bloody scenes and people dying in, sometimes, gruesome ways. And yet the writer shy's away from swear words. If your going to use serious scenes go all out, not half-way.\n\n5. Lack of Customisation - Now this is the lowest major problem I have with the game. I can understand why there is little customisation in the game other than the big 5 - What gender are you? What Sexual Orientation are you? What colour is your power? What is your costume? What is you name/Codename? Personally I would've like to choose other stuff, like build or something, but I'm not hankering for it. Its just a little n.iggle.\n\nBut still even with the problems listed above I still like the game. It shows promise and the sequel will hopefully live up to it (I've played it and know it does and moreso. It does suffer from bigger issues, however, but again that will be in that review).\n\nThanks for reading and good luck out there heroes!","June 27, 2014","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is basically a "Zero to Hero" type of tale in which you as the protagonist (you can choose name, codename, gender, sexual orientation, etc) go through all kinds of hurdles as you try to be a legendary superhero showered by fame or (in my case) worthy to represent justice.\n\nOverall, the story is decently written. Sure, it's nothing profoundly deep, but it offers a plethora of characters you can engage in conversation with and several of those interactions feel somewhat real, as if I'm right there experiencing the hilarity, the intrigue, the frustration or the sadness. Heck, the game even has story parts that are quite unexpected and interesting to read. However, the game come across as if it wants me to sympathize with Black Magic after their dark secret is revealed considering the choices you get presented (more positive choices than negative ones) -- which feels kinda off-putting, but it's nothing too bad.\n\nAll in all, it was a lovely superhero story that I got the opportunity to play and become the hero I always wanted to be, a   pro-teamwork warrior of justice that doesn't care about the law and does what he thinks is right.","May 9, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll admit, I was initially hesitant to play what essentially seemed to be a text adventure. Thankfully I was wrong.\n\nThis game is pretty well written. In addition to being suspenseful and dramatic, the writers managed to handle some of the social issues in the plot a LOT (no spoilers but I'm thinking of one thing in particular) better than I would have expected. The characters are pretty likable (except when they're not supposed to be... ♥♥♥♥ off Jury) and overall I thought the writing was pretty consistent. They also managed to explain the mechanics of the game pretty well without it being super overbearing.\n\nIt does have its faults, however. This first game in the series is fairly linear and while there are choices to be made, most of them have little to no effect on the plot overall. While I understand that this is the first game in a series and the devs don't want the player to do anything that might cause plotholes later, a little bit more leeway would have been nice.

I bought this as part of the trilogy, and played through it as a lawful paragon of humanity. While this CYOA is particularly engaging, letting you make a choice almost every 3 or 4 paragraphs, I would really love to see more branching options with wider implications on the game's world, and more possible upgrades for your hero costume, or even the ability to choose from a pool of different types of powers.\n\nI also think these games are priced very reasonably. I paid 8 dollars and enjoyed at least an hour's worth of gameplay for every dollar I paid. I would recommend this entire trilogy to anyone that's a fan of superheroes or CYOAs. This game has definitely put Choice of Games on my radar, and I look forward to seeing the next bunch of games they release!","September 2, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is basically a "Zero to Hero" type of tale in which you as the protagonist (you can choose name, codename, gender, sexual orientation, etc) go through all kinds of hurdles as you try to be a legendary superhero showered by fame or (in my case) worthy to represent justice.\n\nOverall, the story is decently written. Sure, it's nothing profoundly deep, but it offers a plethora of characters you can engage in conversation with and several of those interactions feel somewhat real, as if I'm right there experiencing the hilarity, the intrigue, the frustration or the sadness. Heck, the game even has story parts that are quite unexpected and interesting to read. However, the game come across as if it wants me to sympathize with Black Magic after their dark secret is revealed considering the choices you get presented (more positive choices than negative ones) -- which feels kinda off-putting, but it's nothing too bad.\n\nAll in all, it was a lovely superhero story that I got the opportunity to play and become the hero I always wanted to be, a   pro-teamwork warrior of justice that doesn't care about the law and does what he thinks is right.","May 9, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll admit, I was initially hesitant to play what essentially seemed to be a text adventure. Thankfully I was wrong.\n\nThis game is pretty well written. In addition to being suspenseful and dramatic, the writers managed to handle some of the social issues in the plot a LOT (no spoilers but I'm thinking of one thing in particular) better than I would have expected. The characters are pretty likable (except when they're not supposed to be... ♥♥♥♥ off Jury) and overall I thought the writing was pretty consistent. They also managed to explain the mechanics of the game pretty well without it being super overbearing.\n\nIt does have its faults, however. This first game in the series is fairly linear and while there are choices to be made, most of them have little to no effect on the plot overall. While I understand that this is the first game in a series and the devs don't want the player to do anything that might cause plotholes later, a little bit more leeway would have been nice. Thankfully the sequels don't do this, so don't let this turn you off from playing the other two games.\n\nOverall, a pretty solid game you can get through in about an hour and a half for not too much money.

After playing and falling in love with Choice of Robots, I came into this game with high hopes. I wouldn't say i'm disappointed but my expectations definitely got in the way of this game's story.\n\nSome of the choices in this story don't feel fully flesh out, which results in some choices to feel completely ignored, no matter what choice you make. Which wouldn't be to bad, and I can see how it would save time during production, but as a player resulting in me reading the next page, "well, that was pointless".\n\nThe story sure takes its time to ramp up, and all the video game-ish mechanics being explained in a fictional world comes across weird. Instead of feeling "warn out", you have a chip in your wrist that tells you that you are "low on mana". I feel like that could be kept within the story's boundaries and explained with just a few sentences.\n\nI think I'm almost done with this book, but depending on the ending I may not start the second in the series. My character is kind of a push over hero, and a little too attached to her fame status. The Legend level thing also feels a little to RPG-ish for a fictional book world.

I thought this game was all about making choices and seeing it's result, but noneotherthan the game itself forbids me from making a choice that I want to make?

It has to be the best one on steam.\n\nNow unto the review...\n\nThis game has so many cliches in it's ABSOLUTELY Linear story. A basic summary of this game is: So and So (Protagonist) Lost parents to So and So (Antagonist). Lives with relatives (Your Grandma), and has to deal with the Antagonist's crap for not being nice to their child.\n\nSound Familiar?\nThe world happens to be filled with already super-powered people, so I don't know how something like a Super-Hero could exist, or why there would be licenses to be a vigilante, in a world filled with Super-powered people. It doesn't make you feel special. You feel (and are) like a geneneric Nobody. The Reason why we have licenses for Super-Heroes now is because This and That (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t excuses) that the "author" came up with.\n\nWe then go on our first Super-Hero Vigilante stuff, going after so and so and some sort of artifact known as generic generic. We happen to run into the Antagonist's son. If you don't flirt with them, you can either ignore them, or straight up punch them in the face. Either way, the Antagonist is still going to hate you no matter what. (Which makes this game feel absolutely Linear even more...) No matter what you do, you cannot obtain generic generic artifact because this and that reasons, no matter what you do.\n\nAfter having the ♥♥♥♥ing press ♥♥♥♥ on your name (No way to stop them from doing so.), y- You know what? Let's skip ahead.\n\nNow the Protagonist is being forced a relationship. Though I will give the Author some credit, he does let you pick who your ultimate waifu is going to look like, your forced the relationship with this person. No matter what you say to them, they'll always either agree with you, or LIKE you. Which is pretty LINEAR, isn't it Mr.Author?\n\nNow your being forced onto a team that you admired since Childhood... For some odd ♥♥♥♥ing reason, your waifu is part of this team, and manages to sign you up for it. Oh right, you have to compete for an opening on a ♥♥♥♥ing team of Superheroes in a super-powered people filled world. Who're you competeting against? Antagonist's child of course!\nOh right, I should mention, it is about impossible to lose to this generic ♥♥♥♥, which is now the new name of the Antagonist's child. Generic ♥♥♥♥ fails at everything, while you seem to do great even when your trying to ♥♥♥♥ it all up.\nAs I said previously, THE GAME IS TOO LINEAR.\n\nAnd well, this is much I've done this far. I don't plan on beating it. It's just been too ♥♥♥♥ing linear so far. I bet the Ending is pretty Linear too, isn't it?\n\nMy Recommedations for the Author\nPlay Choice of Robots, scrap the entire Heroes series, redo it, and make sure it's as expansive, and fun as Choice of Robots. ♥♥♥♥ this Linear piece of dogshit.\n\nPS.\nDon't buy the other two games.","December 9, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only just finished the third part of the trilogy, which probably says enough about what I think of this one in particular.\n\nAlso, please note that this review will contain mild spoilers, as this game is an RPG that focuses most heavily on story.\n\nHeroes Rise: The Prodigy is an interactive novel in which you delve into this world of super heroes. What will strike you as different off the bat will be how widely accepted Powered people are. Despite protests from people, those with Powers are more accepted than how other franchises depict them (such as X-Men).\n\nThis story is very well-written. I love the option to have my character be a different sexual orientation than what is considered the norm at this time. The absolute amount of in-game customization is actually very well-done and in-depth, given the type of game this is.\n\nCharacters are written as human. They have their strengths and weaknesses, like every human does. You can relate to these characters in some way or another, and hell, pretty much every character can be liked or disliked with valid reason. (Bear in mind I might be wrong about this, having not played this installment specifically.)\n\nHowever, I feel that a few aspects of the story can be seen as rushed. Of course, they seem to prove a point later in storytelling, so this can be seen as either a plus or a minus. Some of the characters may also seem to act a bit... out there, which may not be to your taste.\n\nI found the stats system most interesting, and how your ending score is dependent on how you played to your stats.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game and the rest of the series. To me, it is an adventure that will definitely last a long time, despite its somewhat-simple appearance.","August 25, 2015","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A simple popcorn read with a lot of fun choices thrown in for good measure. Nothing about the characters or setting will blow your mind, but it is terrifically engaging thanks to all of the ways you can go about different situations.
