It brings back so many good memories and bad (when my WWIII:BG CD got scratched and couldn't play the game anymore). I recommend this game to people that started gaming with 8-bit graphics games, not with COD and CS :)","September 29, 2014","true","45.5"," 153 of 180 people (85%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","85","153","180","28","14"

WWIII:BG is the first real video game I've ever layed and I absolutely loved it. While the gameplay itself may not be up to 2013 RTS standards, the music, ambience, mission creativity, mechanics, and immersion are top notch for its time. Sure there are annoying pathing bugs and stupid AI, but it's definitely not gamebreaking.

Own team AI is where most of the problems are... can only set 3 basic tactics per unit/group... chase 'em, stand still, or stay within area. Even on stay within, you units often roam into areas they shouldn't and get picked off easy. Wost part is the route finding... the game relies on building many units and swarming when you outnumber the enemy... often groups of 15-20 units per group. But the pathfinding is bad. often the first 3 or 4 units head in the right direction, and the ones behind bump intoi them and then head off in another direction for an alternate, often with disasterous effects.\n\nBase building is pretty noddy too. no sign of upgrades for most buildings, just build one to access a certain list of units and then forget it. Having to manage power was a nice touch (each gen can power two nearby buildings) which gives some tactical options of blacking-out your enemy buildings... but most of the time you'll get mashed before you get near ur enemies gens.\n\nAll in all this seems a dissapointing basic RTS cir 2000... if you want a very cheap nostagic RTS shot then grab it on sale, if not avoid, there are much better ones out there.","May 14, 2014","false","6.1"," 46 of 89 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","46","89","0","0"

The mini-map is almost useless because you can't make anything out on it.  It's hard to see your own units on the play-map because they are often the same color as the terrain.  The controls are lacking too...  CAN'T SHIFT-ORDER MULTIPLE COMMANDS!  Finally, I can't stand how the American units have a foreign accent 1/2 the time.  I am so totally unhappy with this game I want to delete it from my game list.","November 27, 2013","false","30.6"," 32 of 87 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","32","87","0","0"

It's 13 YEARS OLD!! The release date of 2001 is in very small print.\nThe videos above make it look like a modern game. However, these aren't in game graphics, just footage from cut scenes. When I bought this game, it was being advertised on the main Store screen as being "new!" However that is deliberately misleading and this has now become a very vocal and major issue of the way Steam is deliberately misleading it's customers (some are saying "downright rip off" on many gaming sites and gaming focused YouTube channels).\nI find this very sad as Steam used to be held in high regard by myself and many, many others for it's integrity and honesty to it's customers.\nAs for the gameplay of WW3: Black Gold, it looks very dated now and has been left way behind by so many more modern games in the RTS genre. It just can't be compared to more modern RTS games in ANY possible way.\nI bought this game and before playing it, went to visit my big time PC gaming neighbour. By coincidence, he was playing the game and was ranting how he had been "conned" by Steam and cursing the game and it's gameplay. So I sat watching him playing it for a few hours, hoping it would get better the further he got into the game. It didn't.\nSo when I got back home, I uninstalled it and never bothered with it again. So I haven't logged even a minute of gameplay on it on my own computer. What I saw at my friend's was enough for me.\nSo when I want an RTS fix, I go for Company of Heroes 1 and 2, Starcraft 2 (both of the already finished games of the intended trilogy), the Warhammer RTS games and the Paradox Grand Strategy games such as Hearts of Iron 3 TFH, Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings 2, etc.\nSo the lesson to be learned here is that Steam is quickly losing it's integrity and high regard in the gaming industry and so be careful to look at all the small print in the advertising for EVERY game it sells. Plus, assume "new" means the game is new to being available on Steam and not necessarily new as in made in 2014.\nI really hope this isn't a downhill spiral and that Steam gets back to how it used to be which made it essential to all PC gamers.","July 21, 2014","false","0.3"," 11 of 43 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","11","43","0","0"
