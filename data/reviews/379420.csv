The visuals are much improved and the new weapons make the combat feel way more satisfying this time around.\n\nI look forward to seeing what gets added in the future.","May 31","true","3.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Just outstanding. Visuals, music (can use own music), feel, options (many), are first rate. Fractal graphics driven by music, classic space shooter arcade feel, it is fantastic. I had the first one, bought from the website. I am sure they will add more stuff, the passion is evident, and they have a good track record.\n\nBuy it, even just for the fact that no other game does what this does.","June 3","true","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
