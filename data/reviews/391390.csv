"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodmorningcmdr/recommended/391390/","goodmorningcmdr","allen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goodmorningcmdr/","476 products in account","A very fun and action packed platformer.\n\nThe controls and combat are incredibly smooth, and there are plenty of evenly placed boss battles and set pieces to pace the game perfectly. Plenty of weapon variety as well, which is always a plus.\n\nIt also rocks an oustanding soundtrack and is quite replayable due to its new game+ mode. Getting the true ending is a puzzle in and of itself that I urge everyone to try.\n\nAnd finally, the humor. Of which there is plenty of. From the dialogue to the scoring system when you die, to the enemy designs and more, there are a lot of laughs to be had in this game. It's cleverly written and well executed.\n\nHave few complaints about the game. The pixel art could be better, I suppose. And some of the weapon sound effects don't sound really impactful. But overall if you're seeking an action platformer with tons of humor this is a great choice.","September 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I do recommend playing the game with a game control versus a mouse and keyboard.  Game plays like an action movie.

It controls quite well, and the gunplay feels much better than any other 2D sidescroller I've tried on Steam. You can try an older version for free through itch.io too http://dustingunn.itch.io/mayhem-triple I've only played this version, so I can't speak to the differences, other than achievements and trading cards.","October 5, 2015","true","5.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Grab your shotgun and tote your badass leather jacket, because Mayhem Triple is the timewaster that will keep you entertained and on your feet.  Jam-packed with action and mild crude humor, it's a game that is definitely worth the price.  Sure, it might feel like it gets stale after a while, but let's be honest:  What shooter doesn't get stale? Definitely recommend this game for those who feel that they're looking for a nice little platforming shooter to pass the time.","September 20, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","2","6","3","0"
