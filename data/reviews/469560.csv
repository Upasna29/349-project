Buggy, generic music, not very realistic. You might think $20 is cheaper than going to a bowling alley, except this game is nowhere near the same realism as actually bowling.\n\nThen the worst part is that it takes itself too seriously. It could at least make up for the lack of realism by having fun with itself, but it doesn't. Instead, it just becomes boring and stale, real quick.\n\nI feel like this game was rushed out as quickly as possible as cheap as possible and charging as much as they'd think people would pay in order to cash in on the new market while it could.","May 12","false","0.3"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","32","36","0","0"

If you don't mind paying the high price tag for single player bowling then go for it. Since choices are slim on Vive games atm. I may keep it but I sure hope the Developer plans to improve it. I wish it atleast claim to be early access because it needs a lot more polish. Graphics are rather ugly, multiplayer is not included, and in my opinion is a requirment. It appears to be using a $30 Unity Assets pack with a few added stock images. Balls just stick anywhere on the controller when grabbed which is strange not being in a standard location. For now I'll keep it as a thumbs up but only because it's the best bowling on Vive.","May 12","true","1.0"," 15 of 54 people (28%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","28","15","54","3","9"

I have been wanting an accurate sports game to play with the Vive using the hand controllers, and this game seems like less of a gimmick and more of what it would feel like to go to an actual bowling alley. I've even hit pins dead on, but I don't get spares or strikes unless I add extra spin to the ball which is what happens to me when I actually go bowling! This game really challenges my bowling skills and forces me to improve. The scenery is an extra bonus that is really relaxing and enjoyable to look at, especially in VR. Overall it's a very enjoyable game that I would recommend to anyone interested in bowling or just to have a good time.","May 12","true","0.6"," 6 of 66 people (9%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","9","6","66","6","10"
