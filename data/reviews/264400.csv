"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/264400/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Jacob Jones is kind of like Professor Layton's younger, somewhat clumsy younger brother trying desperately to follow in the footsteps of his more refined sibling and doing a decent job at it, if still having a lot of ground to make up.\n\nIt helps that he and everyone and everything else in Camp Eagle Feather is so darn cute, with characters that look somewhere between clay models and plushies, toddling around papercraft environments as they present each other with spontaneous puzzles. Jacob Jones in a lot of ways has the feeling of a developer with a wonderful idea mapped out for their game, but who haven't quite gotten a hang of executing it. Dialogue is charming but often a little stilted and drawn out, there's a noticeable lack of music during most of the game, and the interface can be a tad clunky to navigate as it still holds onto its touch-based origins.\n\nThey're minor things that never really annoyed me too much, but the game definitely has a somewhat awkward sensibility, which in some ways is charming and at other times just a little dull. Puzzle variety left me somewhat disappointed, relying heavily on observation and maze puzzles which while fine, tended to be simple or not especially well explained. I was disappointed by the lack of critical thinking required to get through most of the first episode, which largely came and went without a great amount of fanfare.\n\nI still enjoyed it without doubt, as I tend to do with anything that takes cues from my much beloved tophat clad puzzle agent, but developer Lucid Games has left a lot of room for improvement in follow up episodes. It's a solid beginning that I'm eager to see expanded upon, I just can't help but notice that the distinct feeling of something missing, though whatever it is seems well within the developer's reach if only they can latch onto it.","January 21, 2015","true","2.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

It's basically Professor Layton or Puzzle Agent, but with a cute story. You'll get about 2.5 to 3 hours out of this first episode. It's also on Android and iOS and I could actually see it working a bit better as a tablet game. Looks great on PC though and it gives you that Costume Quest childish feel.","September 25, 2014","true","3.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Although it borrows (read: steals) a few of the mechanics from that series-- such as the merit points awarded and finding soda cans instead of hint coins (which fulfill the same purpose)-- this is by no means a bad thing. The world is also beautiful to look at and explore, filled with some very amusing characters with genuinely funny dialogue. Despite the game's shortness-- with just 24 puzzles and the story included-- Â£4 is good value for what you get, with more promised by the developer to come soon. Despite being somewhat inferior to the Layton series, this is still worth your time if you're craving some lighthearted puzzle action.\n\nPROS:\n+Stylish graphics make the game look great\n+Charming characters with funny dialogue to boot\n+Puzzles are more challenging than the art style suggests\n+Cheap\n\nCONS\n-Suspiciously similar mechanics to the Layton series\n-Some difficulty in clicking on soda cans when Jacob blocks view of them\n-Short in length\n-Writing memos can be somewhat tricky with a mouse\n\nOverall score: 7/10, would recommend","September 19, 2014","true","1.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has the "Double Fine" vibe where everything is cute but you can still very much enjoy it as an adult.\nGameplay is very similar to Professor Layton.\n\nThe first episode took me about 2 hours to complete. It ends at a good point, no weird cutoff points like some other episodic content has.\n\nI sometimes had some troubles with the puzzles because they were made for touch controls. It's easy to get used to though.\n\n\nNote that I had some performance issues but I have been able to fix it by messing with the settings of "JacobJonesSystemSettings.ini" at "My Games\UnrealEngine3\JacobJonesGame\Config"","September 25, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's easily compared to Professor Layton and may be just as good.\nFor the 5 Dollar Price Tag (also available on IOS and Android for about 2$ an episode) you'll get a lovely crafted story, a beautifully and rich designed set, cool and quirky characters (my favorite being the death metal loving, red haired boy deathkill) and 24 puzzles that range from very easy to "huh?!". A lot of effort has gone into the game, with every character being voiced really well and an artstyle that's reminiscent of viva pinata and dreamworks movies. It looks and sounds just super charming.\nI'm really excited for episode 2 and i'm totally okay with the price.  The 5$ had me playing for about 3 hours, 4 for getting all of the achievements.\n\nOne of the coolest discoveries this year!\n\n","October 5, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't think so anyway!. The game price are fairly valuable.\n\nAs well, is a wild version of Professor Layton Mystery Solving puzzle game (Yup!, many people said that about this game). Includes fiendish puzzles (but some puzzles are piece of cake!), great "papercraft-look" landscapes, great stories, and funny characters (well, especially I like Flommerly's voice and it makes me laugh especially his lost face and win face reaction LOL!).\n\nYou'd better get this game alongside it's second episode "RoadtRIP!", but getting Jacob Jones bundle is more cheaper than you buy all of them in one price each. Also, the game looks was completely great and better on PC and iPad than from android tablets. I was thinking why not this little game to be Steam exclusives alongside with "Costume Quest" series for kids?.\n\nHoping the third episode will come out because there is something that what is predicted from episode 1 and 2?.","January 1, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Akin to Puzzle Agent, this game has tons of little puzzles scattered across the path the discorvering to mysteries. It's a nice game for $5 and it's seems like you get what you pay for (which isn't saying it's bad). I suggest you play this with others, it will make everything better and solving puzzles with your pals "ish da best".
