As you might expect these generally suffered in quality and had problems like some maps being DOOM 1 maps that were hastily ported to DOOM 2, which tended to break balance and cause additional problems. Some of the maps weren't even for DOOM but rather Heretic. However some of the maps were originally intended for Master Levels but didn't make it into the collection.\nOther parts that weren't included were a poster, and id STUFF, a bunch of encrypted software that could be unlocked via phone order.\n\nMy thoughts on DOOM itself and the quality of the release here are the same as my other DOOM review.\n\nOverall the quality of the map pack is great. The extra levels are a lot of fun and freshen up the DOOM experience.\n\nA quick note, if you plan to play these using a modern ZDoom-compatible source port, check out Master Levels Menu Interface for ZDoom[zdoom.org] by Zippy, which is a replacement for Doom-It and allows you to launch the levels directly from the game.\n","July 3, 2015","true","2.2"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","35","39","4","0"

While there are some good maps in here, there are also poorly designed frustraiting ones. There are countless Doom maps available for free, and many are better than these:\n\nhttp://www.doomworld.com/idgames/\n\nWhat's great about this set of levels, however, is the history that comes with them. These aren't called the "Master" levels for nothing. The guys who made these maps were pretty much the best-of-the-best at the time of its release. If you care about the history of Doom mapping, definitely pick these up!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/9160/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Master Levels for Doom II was ID Software's answer to the plethora of unauthorized level packs being sold for their popular game. Intent on outdoing the guys behind DZone, ID Software got some of the best amateur level designs to craft official levels as an expansion for Doom II. They also compiled over 1,800 WADs on a CD to give the DZone guys a run for their money.\n\nWhile those 1,800 levels aren't include, the 21 that make up the "Master Levels" are fairly good. Not every level is a winner (and some are just down right cruel), but it's a fairly competent collection of levels for anyone who has mastered the base game.\n\nThe biggest issue is that "Master Levels" includes a lot of ridiculous enemy counts. Some levels have upwards of 250 enemies and keys hidden behind secrets. It creates an atmosphere where you can easily get lost or overwhelmed. A few times, I had no idea where to progress because my map didn't show anything else. I went to YouTube and found the answer to be obtuse beyond reason.\n\nThat could also fit the description of how to find the hidden level (taking an invulnerability sphere and making an Arch-vile blast you). It turns what is normally a fun hunt into a frustrating exercise in patience. The AI isn't exactly smart in Doom, so trying to manipulate it in ways that it wasn't developed for just sucks.\n\nThen we get to how some levels are pathetically easy. A few of the WADs have spaced out battle zones that do little more than pad out the length of the level. If you constantly sprint (and why wouldn't you?), there doesn't really exist a reason to have such large landmasses.\n\nSprinting is also key to finding a lot of items. A yellow key may be perched on what looks like an unreachable pedestal, but you really just need to travel a few rooms over and run like a wild man out the window. It's just annoying to see the same tricks repeated so many times.\n\nAs for the Steam release, it's a bit of a mess. The game doesn't run any worse than Doom II or the other DOSBox ports, but it's strange to set up. There isn't a front loaded menu and trying to play them in any coherent order can be quite the ordeal. There are some extra mods for source ports that allow you to freely select each WAD (and the Eternity Engine has built-in support for Master Levels), but it's not as straight forward as launching ZDoom with the other main games.\n\nThere is also no way to individually buy Master Levels on Steam. You have to get it in the Doom Classic Complete pack. While that is, admittedly, a good deal, it is a bit annoying. If you happened to only buy one of the main games or skipped out on, say, Final Doom, you're stuck rebuying them all.\n\nFor that reason alone, I would say Master Levels for Doom II isn't worth it. The Doom enthusiast will already have the Complete collection on Steam, but casual users can just stick with Doom I and II.\n\n6/10","May 26","false","7.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/9160/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","This is a collection of 21 (including one secret) custom levels for DOOM II made by the fan community and originally released in late 1995. Be warned: the quality and difficulty of the levels vary, and they're usually not up to the par set by the Doom community's best-known works. This is more of a snapshot of Doom history than anything, taking then-contemporary 'masters' of Doom level creation and showcasing their talent.\n\nThe retail version of the Master Levels (as in the pre-Steam version) also contained 'Maximum Doom', about 1,830 amateur custom levels indiscriminately downloaded from the internet. It was iD's response to the shovelware discs containing thousands of Doom levels of extremely varying quality that were floating around at the time. You can read about it here[doom.wikia.com] and download it here[archive.org] if you really want to.\n\nThe Steam version comes with a level select program running in DOSBox, but you also receive the individual map files themselves. I would recommend loading these in a sourceport such as Chocolate Doom or ZDoom for a significantly improved playing experience. If you're using a ZDoom program, you could also use this level selection map[www.doomworld.com]. Some of them don't start on MAP01, so you may have to use a cheat code or the aforementioned map to switch levels.\n\nSince you can only buy the Master Levels in a bundle with the other classic Doom games, I'd only really recommend this for Doom enthusiasts.\n\n\nPlaying through each of the levels on Ultra-Violence, here's what I think of them in brief:\n\nATTACK.WAD - a fun little jaunt by Tim Willits (a Strife level designer) through a Doom 2 style techbase in MAP01 style, except with tougher monsters.\nBLACKTWR.WAD - probably the best argument against playing these in alphabetical order. This one throws you straight into the deep end with lots of teleporting monsters, dangerous enclosed spaces and frankly frustrating progression. I will remind you that there is no shame in saving every once in a while on levels like these. Still pretty well-made and features notably tasteful usage of Hell marble textures.\nBLOODSEA.WAD - another slightly less challenging level from the same creator of BLACKTWR, Sverre Kvernmo. Devious but not too unforgiving, with the exception of the end area. Not as visually striking as BLACKTWR.\nCANYON.WAD - another great MAP01 replacement by Willits. I'd say it's above ATTACK in terms of quality: it's bigger, badder and nicer-looking.\nCATWALK.WAD - appropriately named, this level has its moments but doesn't quite pack a punch altogether.\nCOMBINE.WAD - punishing without feeling too frustrating, this night-sky techbase is a good challenge with interesting design.\nFISTULA.WAD - another fun and varied one with a surprise ending. Bit on the short side though.\nGARRISON.WAD - more frustrating than the last couple of levels, but still a solid entry.\nGERYON.WAD - another distinctive nighttime level bigger than the last several entries, and a satisfying experience overall, especially the secrets.\nMANOR.WAD - has some decent combat and great texturing/aesthetic layout, but perhaps a little too clever for its own good. I had to consult a walkthrough in order to figure out how to progress.\nMEPHISTO.WAD - perhaps the best argument against randomly selecting levels to play, at least if you pick this one first. Sverre decided to take the gloves off and prove he was serious about his difficult arena battles with lots of revenants and other projectile monsters, and a final boss fight that's actually impossible to win if you used all your rockets on the baddies that came before. It pulls the rug out from under you repeatedly, but it's oh so good to finally beat.\nMINOS.WAD - this one throws the unexpected at you as well, but is more even-handed about it. It's also one of the larger maps in the collection, which is nice. The techbase-ish look is fairly appealing here yoo.\nNESSUS.WAD - tricky but kind of fun, like the little brother of the previous level.\nPARADOX.WAD - nicely constructed (if a little plain) and challenging but fair.\nSUBSPACE.WAD - apart from the Doom 2 enemies, this wouldn't feel out of place in an E1 throwback WAD. It's certainly an interesting one.\nSUBTERRA.WAD - a frustrating but memorable trek in a brick underground.\nTEETH.WAD - Sverre saved the best for last apparently, judging by the powerful enemies in close quarters and ambush after ambush. Likely the hardest level in this entire collection. Also contains another (secret) level that flew under the radar.\nTTRAP.WAD - probably the second or third hardest level, after TEETH. Lot of tricks and traps here right out the gate, but with enough goodies to survive if you can manage to grab them. Pretty satisfying though.\nVESPERAS.WAD - kind of like NESSUS' meaner big brother.\nVIRGIL.WAD - kind of like NESSUS' weird but still cool cousin.","August 3, 2014","true","0.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Either that or maybe an expansion for Doom 2 will always be good because even if it's subpar, you're still playing Doom 2. But Master Levels isn't subpar, far from it. The level design is top notch and extremely rememberable, and I was quite surprised that 3 or 4 of the levels actually had a plot! And an interesting one at that. For the majority of the levels you're just playing doomguy, but for these 3 to 4 levels, you play a cyberdemon thats actually been turned into a human! And sentenced to death, the cyberdemon fights back and ends with a finale against quite a few cyberdemons. This is easily one of the most impressive stories in a game that only uses .txt docs to explain everything! And by completing all the levels, I have been happily awarded the title of "Master of Destruction!" At least, according to the game... I highly reccomend everyone to play this and become a "Master of Destruction" too! And you should already have it, unless for some bizzare reason you don't own Doom Classic Complete.

The product being sold in Steam should be something like Doom95 or the adapted ones within Doom 3 BFG, not the MS-DOS version that you are able to play through DOSBox on today's modern computers on which Windows 7/8/8.1/10 runs. This case moves the game away from smoothly playable conditions. Also, a product like Doom95 would have served the feature of setting an external WAD file in an easier way. My review about this product is also true for the other earliest Doom games that can be found under the package called Doom Classic Complete.\n\nAnyway, let me repeat the introduction of my comment: I do recommend the game.","January 3","true","4.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The Doom series was a popular series in the 90s and has had another game recently: Doom II. The expansion pack consists of 20 "WADs", with one WAD containing a secret level [the first screenshot on the store page]. Think of this as a bonus, as steam has yet to sell this separately.\n\nThis game runs via the acclaimed emulator DOSBOX, and you will find a copy of the application in the Steam directory. You will be able to select WADs via the Doom-It interface, where you can select one of the 20 levels. The WADs are extremely well designed and my personal favourites are TEETH and MANOR. However, this game is certainly not for everyone.\n\nTry the Doom I shareware on DOSGames using DOSBox before you make a purchase. If you don't like the limitations from the original DOS version, you can copy the WADs into a source port's directory [such as ZDoom and PrBoomPlus] and you can play it from there. They introduce new High Definition graphics and add jumping and aiming abilities.\n\nI cannot give this a score as it is not identifiable as a standalone title; you will need Doom II to play this so that is why Steam doesn't sell it separately. Overall, this is a great modification for Doom II. If you want to use other mods on Doom 2, you will need to use this command on DOSBox Doom2.exe -file [Mod].wad.\n","May 17, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But this one deserves its own review.\nA little statement first. As already mentioned in my other DooM reviews the 0/10 rate is related to the Steam Release. Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). All of this to state I know and Love the game I grew up with. Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically The Ultimate DooM, Final DooM And DooM II: Hell On Earth. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.\n\nThis Master Levels For DooM II release is supposed to have a total of 21 maps (including the "Teeth" Secret level) AND 1830 amateur custom levels. What does this release have? 21 Maps... Don't tell me the 1830 maps would weight too much, wad files have a ridiculous size. Anyways, to play the 21 maps you'll have to stick with an outdated and sometimes stuttering version of dosbox running the game with the already mentioned and useless "modern controls". Too bad that now you can't select a classic control system. Top of the Tops you still have to use that outdated, NON-user friendly ridiculous text-interface to select the map to play with. Meaning you don't get to play the 21 maps one after the other, but you have to select which map replace the original DooM II map. So this means you will get to play again some DooM II levels (21, replacing 32). And that's not the worst part. The maps have the "replacing slot locked" and most of them replace the same slot... BUT WHY?!?!? And if this wasn't enough You are FORCED to use the "Modern Interface" set as default in the other DooM Steam releases. But here you can't revert to the Classic interface. Definitley the worst release Ever. Fortunately this is a bonus pack for those brave or squanderer enough to buy these horrible releases. I'll just copy-paste the cons of the other releases, which still apply on this one. It's not worth a total rewrite...\n\n---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam. THE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor Lags, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that The other DooM Releases have 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT "Modern input" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. But Guess What? Here in Master Levels for doom you can't choose From Modern To classic, so you're forced to play with the useless modern input... And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And "Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD... But seriously, don't waste here your money...)","February 2","false","0.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","6","15","3","2"

Steam version of this comes free with any purchase of Doom 2 there. At least this is what I heard.\n\nAs usual, Steam version was screwed up as far as configuring DosBox goes. But at least interface works fine. As usual, you will have to change conf file in game directory, where you change "ddraw" line to "opengl" so DosBox will not lag hard. As usual, Setup was not included, and you will have to configure cfg file by hand, editing numbers in. As usual, it's Soundblaster by default when it comes to sound.\n\nCollection includes around 20 levels made by fans of Doom. You will get to read info too in in-game interface. As you expect, none of them add anything new, not even new textures, aside from starry sky background. And it's quite a mixed bag. It has bad levels like Teeth, which is bad case of "FPS Elevator level", you got great levels like Black Tower, which is challenging and makes you feel like you are navigating through the tower. You got some levels that you can get through quickly, while most take some time. For sure you will have to pistol-start each level, as they aren't linked to each other. Which is nice, to me at least.\n\nDidn't try mutliplayer there, not sure if supposed to work. Not messing with those ancient stuff myself. You can always pull wad file from game directory to use in Zandronum source port if you want to play some cooperative or survival on those levels.","May 4, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Storywise... Well, they were meant to be a 21 Level Episode Expansion for Doom II, so in the canon of Doom II, there really is no story, but each map has their own story to go along with it (or at least most of them do). The best part is, you don't need to pay $15 for it (or at least I didn't), because it comes WITH Doom II: Hell on Earth. On the flipside, however, they don't introduce anything new. No new monsters, no new guns, no new obsticales. Just harder levels. Despite this, it definitely IS worth adding to your Steam Library. YOU SHOULD NOT buy the Doom Classic Complete pack, though, because you can get Ultimate Doom, Doom II: Hell on Earth, and Final Doom for $4.99 each, and as mentioned earlier, this comes WITH Doom II: Hell on Earth, so you would save at least $0.50 if you buy them seperate.","February 28","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You should get this for free after purchasing DOOM II. Master Levels contains 20 highly difficult levels which sit at the same level as the "Thy Flesh Consumed" episode of Ultimate Doom, and some are even harder.\n\nIt begins with a DOS-style menu which is complicated to use at the start if you haven't operated a DOS-related app like this. Oh and by the way, works with Windows 10 as I'm running the game on it perfectly. You come to the list of .wad files which are all the maps for the game. Follow the in-app instructions and you'll do fine. And if you ever want to quit, go back to the DOS menu while on a level and hit Esc.\n\nFor each level, there is usually a description or plot involved with it. You can also go to the level settings to alter the difficulty and even change monster-related events. Such as No Monsters and the conditions for Nightmare Mode. I suggest starting each level off on No Monsters Mode to learn the layout of the level and get puzzles without getting trampled by the monsters within.\n\nI have cleared all 20 levels myself a while ago, however on ITYTD, and would say that the level design and difficulty are quite the thrill. I really love DOOM and I have gained enough experience to find several of these levels a breeze. But there were a few that were pretty ridiculous. The hardest one in my opinion is "Mephisto's Mausoleum" with many revenants squirming around outdoors and indoors, as well as multiple mancubi and barons of hell to defeat. Even the "Icon of Sin" makes a comeback.\n\nI'm pretty sure Master Levels supports custom DOOM levels in the form of .wad files. I have just found a DOOM level editor and I'm pretty sure you can implement new .wad files onto wherever you have installed Master Levels. If my rumor of custom levels is true, then that makes the game a lot more awesome for me.\n\nThis is an excellent game to play after DOOM II, which I've cleared as well. You can "master" DOOM with these master levels with all kinds of new twisted combos of monsters and gimmicks. It's totally a pass for me as DOOM is my most favorite FPS franchise!\n\nSTORY 8/10\nPRESENTATION 8/10\nGAMEPLAY 9/10\nVALUE 8/10\nOVERALL 8/10","April 24","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For some stupid-♥♥♥ reason, Steam released the Master Levels for Doom II as single files for each level, and the only way to play them is to have a functioning source port for Doom, like ZDoom, GZDoom, Skulltag, and others. You have to replace the levels here with other levels from Doom II, most of which replace level 1. This hassle prevented me from playing these levels for about 6 months before I finally found out how to get them to work with Brutal Doom and Doom Metal Music. But other than the aggressively annoying process I had to go through, the game works and I really like it. If you guys know of an easier way to get this thing to work without buying the steam version, do it. Nothing against Steam, I love this platform, but this is a bit short-sighted to not release these levels as their own game or to have them as an episode within Doom II. I recommend buying or playing these levels, they're pretty cool and original.","December 12, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is just the ripping and the tearing for DOOM Guy.\n\nGameplay: Unlike the other DOOM games, this game is a mixed bag of user levels. Some are very hard with enemies popping out everywhere, and others are quite straightforward. My favorite has to be the Black Tower level. Of course you can still use weapons like the Super Shotgun, BFG, etc. Still has lots of running around and pushing switches/collecting keycards/skulls to gain access to certain areas.\n\nSound Design: The snarling hordes of demons can get repetitive.\n\nGraphics: They're ok if you use a source port like Zandronum.\n\nTechnical: Don't use the dosbox version. There are community guides to make this work as an episode of DOOM II in the forums.\n\nFinal Verdict: Buy this in the bundle with DOOM II for maximum pleasure.","April 9","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
