I've found some of the puzzles in other Nancy Drew games to be tedious and annoying but quite enjoyed the puzzles in this one. There are a few good logic puzzles in this one. The game is a bit short and straightforward but, overall, it was an entertaining few hours.","July 7, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I played it with my wife, so it's not just fun for girls.\nIt was a little bit short but we made the mistake to play it in "junior detective mode". We directly bought another title from the series after having finished this, so...yes it's a goodstarting point for the series...","April 8, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The puzzles aren't too difficult and the characters aren't the best but for one of the first games it's still pretty fun.\n\nIf you don't know who Nancy Drew is and you're looking to try out one of the games, maybe try a different one first? It really depends on if you want to play an AMAZING one and then come back to say you've beaten them all, or play a pretty good one and then move on to the better ones.\n\nThe mystery is captivating just as they all are. Not my favorite, but still amazing and Nancy Drew.","February 7","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Secret of the Old Clock is the first in the series, and this game is set in the 1930s! What could be more fantastic than that? We really enjoyed this game, although it certainly wasn't our favorite one. The characters were not as strong as they could have been, but the mystery itself, while pretty straightforward and linear, was extremely fun and the puzzles were challenging.\n\nI would recommend this game both to fans of the series and to those just starting out. A solid game, just not my favorite.","June 13, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
