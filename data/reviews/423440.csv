I wont give anything away but I will say that if you've ever played Jade Empire, and enjoyed it's style and storytelling, then Choice of Kung Fu will give you another chance to explore such a world again. Full of Kung Fu, Chi, Fox Spirits, Romance, and Rebellion; I was once again, pulled into the story of a single monk residing in a small monastery on the side of a mountain, seeking to learn from the fabled Dragon Sage. The breadth of play styles are impressive and refreshing as is usual in a Choice of Games/Hosted Games title. While the one ending I have gotten was fitting, it left me wanting more. Though, this is a testament to the quality of the story telling rather than the feeling of an incomplete narrative.\n\nA highly pleasurable title from our always entertaining friends at CoG/HG and the writers they help promote. I can solidly recommend Choice of Kung Fu to anyone who is a fan of, or has passing interest in, a Chinese themed setting that spans your life as a monk of the Order of the Peach Tree. Years will go by and it will be your choices that dictate the fate of the very nation you live in. Will you fight with honor and be as the Buddha would be? Perhaps you will dedicate your life to the pursuit of martial prowess and open a Dojo? Maybe you would just like to live happily with your thoughts as you create poetry with your lover? Maybe none of these things. That is the fun part of these games.\n\nIt's all up to you!","December 18, 2015","true","3.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

In the early game it is all about building your character's skills and the late game is all about using those skills. A bad decision can give you a bad result. There is a lot of veriety of skills you can build and use and it creates some very interesting experiences. What is even better, the overall goal of the game changes based off what the player wants to do. I actually ended up changing my goal the first time I played based on my character's experiances. That is a rare thing for a game to do, and I approve.","December 19, 2015","true","5.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/octobig/recommended/423440/","octobig","Octobig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/octobig/","36 products in account","This interactive visual novel/text-based game brings you into a Chinese mythical world of monks, kung-fu fighting, fox spirits, wise teachers, and the Empire. Decide your own personal style of kung-fu and find your path while you rise in the ranks of your Order. Eventually, you might meet the wise Dragon Sage and ask them a question, but before that, you will have to make many choices -- about your stance with the Empire, your friends and rivals, and what to do with your strength and knowledge.\n\nThe Good+ A great, somewhat mythical setting in ancient China\n+ Engaging characters, especially the teachers/masters and the fox spirit(s)\n+ As always, lots of different choices and endings\n\nThe Bad- No save points\n- Limited romance options\n- Style of kung-fu not as detailed as I thought it would be\n\nAs always, if you're into Choose Your Own Adventure games and you also like mythical China (and/or kung-fu), then you'll probably like this game! The only thing I didn't like that much was the lack of depth in some of the romance options -- some of them feel more like side characters than actual participants in your story. But I suppose the whole game itself is more about your personal journey as a whole.\n\nNot my personal favourite out of the CoG lineup so far, but still a good one!","January 26","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I sure most people when they see the word "magic" they thought of stuff like throwing fireball which is clearly not here.  There are more words in the game that is somewhat out of place but is fairly easy figure out by the first timer.\n\nAlso I like to point out is that some wording of choice the author use is very suggestive, believe me, you not going to fall for the demon fox trap on your first playthrough because the choice itself will tell you not to fall for her trap.\n\nDid I mention I love old chinese stuff earlier, because this game is clearly not one.  I would say the auther is strongly influence by the modern TV drama while writing this, you can tell by the setting it use.  One point there is dragon, demon, and immoral, which is great materials for old setting fantasy, then by the end, you probably will ask why even bother.\n\nOverall, this game is a good buy, the achievement part is very fun, but if you have a choice between this and other choice of game, I say go with the latter.","March 5","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isn't really a game, more like reading a book. I bought this bc I am a Chinese and I really wanna see how English speaking ppl would write a Chinese story, and I have to say...well, hard to describe how I feel about it.\nHuliJing, the fox spirit, really??? I laughed at this lol. I thought this would a kinda reality-based game but I was soooo wrong. Seriously, it's funny to see they literally translate fox spirity as Hulijing.\nThe story itself it's not that attractive to me, probably because it's not any Chinese story at all. But hey, it's not a super expensive game, so recommend if you want to kill time, otherwise, don't.\nAlso, I really want to say: whoever drew the cover, I can't appreciate your art.

Alana Joli Abbott authored a story that is worth replaying on occasion, reveals a significant amount of research, has choices with consequences that make sense, and leads to several endings that feel not just rewarding, but inspiring.\n\nMy few objections are that a couple of romance options don't seem to be romantic at all, the player's choice of fighting style doesn't have a lot of specifics, and there could be some more opportunities to introduce cause and effect into this tale.\n\nHighly recommend picking this up and replaying at least once a year for the story. Achievements are a bit on the easy side compared to other Choice Games, so mastery is quite probable within a few short hours if you pay attention and read quickly.","January 17","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately there are no do overs when it comes to your decisions. If you decide to alter a choice, you have to start all the way at the beginning, which can be frustrating depending on how far into the story you are.\n\nAn important thing for new players to be aware of is the outcome of your decisions appears to be based on your stats. I got different outcomes to similar choices on my second playthrough, because I built my stats differently from the first run.  While this means certain playthroughs will require planning your decisions ahead of time, it also means there are multiple ways to deal with a situation both in success and failure, which offers replay value.\n\nI've heard the game is shorter than other Choice Of games, but it was fun for an introductory into their style, and I'm interested in other games they have to offer!","February 6","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
