Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. That depends on what makes a game good for you.\nIt has quite some flaws. The UI is made with flash, runs badly and doesn't give you all the features you'd want. The shaders aren't very optimized. There are bugs. If you're used to have the whole story presented to you, you'll find the story slow and boring.\nSo why would you like this game, like I do?\nIf you're ready to spend some time in its world. And by that, I don't mean "to play", I mean "to look around, read the lore, and let the immersion build around you". This game doesn't do everything for you. It expects you to take a certain part in exploring it and make your own conclusions. If you're ready to take that part, by reading, researching, learning, and maybe continuing to think about it when not playing, you will get an immersive experience in a world filled with horror stories, spooky places, interesting people and secrets like few other games have. Sometimes, it's just more like reading a good book than playing a good game.\nIn addition, the character development system is or is not going to make you happy. If you think that wow has what gets you there, you maybe won't become friends with tsw's system. It has no classes, almost no levels and wants you to rethink your whole build and gear every now and then.\nBut that just fits to the whole concept of a story-rich world. Your character won't develop on a given line, you can, at any time, choose the next direction your character goes. This, and the fact that the look of your character is in no way connected to your play stlyle (or class, since there are none), gives you the possibilty to use your toon as a good roleplaying character. Something that Funcom supports in multiple ways, including places in the world that have no use for quests, but for roleplaying only.\nSo when people tell you about the rich story, they don't mean your character's personal story that is told to you, they mean a world filled with lore, tiny details and story pieces that you can explore bit by bit in order to find out more about it.\nSo yes, if you want a story directly thrown at you, an mmo with excellently balanced classes or a completely bugfree AAA experience, you probably won't like this game.\nBut if you sometimes enjoy a good book, have an imagination that you can use, or like a progression system that sometimes takes roleplaying over balancing, you have found a gem here. One that allows you to immerse in an amazing, spooky world - if you are ready to take exploring the story into your own hands.","November 2, 2014","true","538.5"," 666 of 695 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","666","695","12","12"

The graphics, while not next-gen, are still pleasant to look at and the orchestral score is one one would expect to see in a big title game. But the biggest thing about this game is the freedom one has with gameplay. There are no jobs, levels, or classes. You gain access to 9 weapons in the beginning (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, blood magic, chaos magic, elementalism, hammer, fist, and sword), each with their own special abilities, from this you can equip 2 weapons and mix and match some of the 500+ skills to defeat your enemies. Skills are bought with skill points and there are no skill trees where you must take one skill but forgo another.\nThe characters you meet in the game are some of the most interesting I've seen. Each main NPC is given a full cutscene for every mission they give. They are wise, spiteful, and cheery. Each has their own agenda and will reward you for your part in it. The enemies are also some of the most varied I've seen in years. You will face hordes of zombies, slimy Draug, ancient locusts, bloodsucking vampires, ferocious werewolves, haunting spirits, and monstrous Ak'ab, just to name a few.\nThe PVP is solidly built as well. You have Capture the Flag (fought in El Dorado), King of the Hill (in Stonehenge), and simple Deathmatch in a place called the Fusang Projects. Cusomization is also a big part of the game. There are literally thousands of articles of clothing, from sneakers to coats to gloves, that you can equip your character with so they as stylish as possible while kicking butt and taking names.\nThe only drawback is the user interface. You will experience bugs and there are moments of lag for even the most powerful processors. Luckily it usually goes away with a simple command prompt.\nThis is not a game you want to miss. If you like MMOs and killing monsters, or just want a breack from the usual pay-to-win scenario, pick up this game and jump in. We'll be seeing you in......The Secret World","November 26, 2013","true","534.4"," 620 of 647 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","620","647","0","29"

While I highly recommend it, an MMO can be incredibly polarising, and TSW has it's share of polarising features both for better and worse.\n\nThe game boasts a unique world, you literally will not find another game brimming with the story beats and character that this game has. It's in the environment, incidental dialogue and monsters you come across. It boasts an interesting story about 3 factions, and how each faction is working in their own ways to guard and prepare for the coming filth (and that which is already here). All the while playing off against each other because after all, they have their own agendas.\n\nThe gameplay is fun an interesting, run and cast system so that you are usually always moving. The range of skills and weaponry means that you can cultivate a character to your whim and the unlimited level cap (none, in theory) means you can essentially have a character that can do whatever you'd like it to do. An area calls for you to be a bit tankier? Done. A dungeon requires you to fulfil a healer role? Done. This hammers home the end-game need to build specialised builds that are constantly trying to improve through either signets, augments, or raid tier upgrades (if that's your thing).\n\nIf end game content isn't your thing, and you want to see the rich story through the Solomon Islands, to Egypt and then lastly Transylvania. You don't need to grind any end game gear at all. You can enjoy the story alone, or with friends and can decide at any point if you'd like to engage in a dungeon. Thankfully, the tier levelled dungeons means that there are different difficulty levels of each dungeon.\n\nThe game has a number of well thought out systems that sound brilliant on paper, that sadly are implemented poorly. Which is to be expected of Funcom (Ever the dreamers, never the achievers). The party finder system usually leads to more confusion that it does active parties opting for the tried and true "LFG" posts in general chat.\n\nThe development cycle is notoriously slow, as they are running on a small staff the updates or "issues" as they name them, usually take longer than anticipated. Originally, they had a 1 issue a month plan, after falling behind that on numerous occasions, they have abandoned that for a more vague "when it's ready". Usually coinciding with a "State-of-the-game" update from Joel Bylos (Game Director).\n\nThe game recently has started to receive a huge boost in player base (no doubt the steam sales having a hand in this). New players I hadn't seen before are now reaching the end-game content, which always helps an MMO to remain fresh and current. The community is, for the most part; friendly, vibrant and willing to assist new players. Whether that's communicating answers for questions, or helping with dungeons so that you learn. Bare in mind though: Like most things, if you want to be carried through the game, expect more stick than carrot with players.\n\nOverall, I would suggest this game to players disenfranchised by your typical high fantasy setting we've come to expect from the MMO scene. It a fresh and deserved game in the MMO scene and one that is highly worth trying, who knows, you may just find yourself enjoying it just as much as the rest of us.","December 19, 2013","true","319.4"," 383 of 399 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","383","399","0","8"

Play M.M.O. R.P.G.'s.\n2.) Write reviews on steam.\n\nThis game has forced me to try both :D. Let's start with pros/cons.\n\n----PROS:\n\nStoryline\n-Vast universe filled with dozens of worlds, and thousands of replayable quests.\n-Constent flow of new players, that way no one world feels too desolate/over-populated.\n-Quests. Are.. EVERYWHERE. Everything from a NPC's handing them out at your local city to stumbling across a corpse with a treasure-map in the middle of the road. Very non-linear.\n-H.P. Lovecraft approved, atleast fan-approved :D (To see Kingsmouth in-game made my day)\n-Bits of scattered "lore" throughout the game clue you in about the history of certain landmarks and events that happen through-out The Secret World.\n-Has a LOT of pop-culture refrences. Eveything for popular movies to new video-games.\n-Cutscenes actually put your custom character into them!!! Badass. Real badass, bro.\n-There are plenty of cutscenes compared to MMOs like Guild Wars or World of Warcraft.\n\nGameplay\n-You can either play the classic mouse-clicking way, or switch to over-the-shoulder 3rd-person aiming-view, OOOOOR zoom your camera all the way in and play in makeshift 1st-person :D.\n-Doesn't feel like any other RPG out there. Very fast-paced, doesn't have that 'grinding' feel.\n-Gameplay feels like a upgraded MMO version of "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines".\n-Not typical lvling system. In fact, no "levels" what-so-ever, mearly distribution of skill points.\n-Hack-and-slash, killing hoards of monsters hasn't been this fun since Diablo.\n-Creatures vary from location to location, this game doesn't just color a creature a different color and make him harder, it's like they went through the entire Necronomicon in this game.\n-Great crafting system, strongest weapons/armor/items are crafted.\n-Great character customization, seemingly unlimited choices.\n-Playable alone if the servers ever die. (You'll have to be a high lvl to take on some missions.)\n-Not completely abandoned by devs.\n\nFuncom Points\n-NOT pay2win, not much stuff to buy with REAL money that you can't get in-game for free.\n-If for some reason you're lookin' to spend cash, they've got some great vanity stuff (i.e. pets!)\n-If you want the vanity stuff, but don't have cash, there are promotions that might help.. ;) hint\n-If cash is not a issue for you, then take solace in knowing their prices are really cheap c:\n\nPerformance\n-While the game IS old, the graphics are pretty decent, and are still being patched.\n-I has a: Radeon R9 280x GPU. And it runs like warm butter on ultra settings.\n\nMisc\n-Cool cartoony colors.\n-Friendly community.\n\n----CONS:\n\nStoryline\n-Sometimes you get a quest that is impossible to beat alone or at your current level (despite the quest claiming to be "normal" difficulty), bit of a buzz kill when you make it half-way then figure that out the hard way... by dying brutally and seriously out level'd :P.\n-Compared to other ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes, it doesn't have as many active players as other titles.\n\nGamplay\n-PVP seriously unbalanced. Like... whacky unbalanced...\n...I would spend atleast 50 hours playing co-op or alone before ever stepping in the PVP zones. (I've got 40 hours under my belt and still haven't even reached the PVP zones lol. Big game.)\n-Steep-ish learning curve. (Steep because so different from other games.)\n-Combat animation with some low-rank weapons can be repetative.\n-Defualt short-cut and keyboard layout can feel a bit cluncky.\n-Each issue past 8 is expensive... I reached Tokyo and now I need 29.99 to keep playing :/\n\nFuncom Points\n-They should have made their item market on steam. Would have been much easier transaction-wise. Then again, who can blaim them for not wanting to cut steam in?\n-The Item shop doesn't have good descriptions on some things. They don't mention stuff like: Uniforms don't show stuff like necklaces or gloves, est. Or anything labeled "effects" is used to the London Theatrics Company, yet that info is no-where to be found.\n\nPerformance\n-40+ GB download.\n-This game will eat all your free time up. YUMYUMYUMYUM..... gone. XD (This may be a pro.)\n\nMisc\n-No steam achievements? But it has it owe achievements -_-...\n-At times, the voice acting can be a little corny :P....\nONLY AT TIMES! And It fades away with the awesome story.\n\n-OVERALL FIRST IMPRESSION:\n\nThe storyline strokes your ego enough to make you feel individually important in a world with so many players, while at the same moment stressing the importance of teamwork, breaking the ice for interactions between new-comers and vets.\n\nEven though you can do the lone-wolf thing and beat the majority of missions alone, it's easier and more fun putting a group together to quest with, even if it's a random passer-by who just happens to be on the same page as you.\n\nMany vet players are kind enough to let you tag along on quests if they've got a free space, and you'll always find someone willing to help you whether it be directions, healing, or back-up.\n\n-LONG TERM IMPRESSION\n\nWill update the more I play, but in all honesty, not seeing much negative aspects.\nSo, if you're torn between the fence, buy in confidence, tis' a great game :D.\n\nP.S. To all new players! Don't forget to renew the free stuff they give you at thesecretworld.com, and check out the promotions they do such as; finish 30 missions get 1200 funcom points free.\n\nRecommended Guides for Starters.\n-http://www.tswdb.com/miscellaneous/the-secret-world-beginner-guide/\n-http://yokaiblog.wikidot.com/guides:craft-patterns#toc23","April 22, 2015","true","211.7"," 360 of 375 people (96%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","96","360","375","21","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/215280/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","When you play this MMO, as you most assuredly should do, it will serve you to remember it is not World of Warcraft. It is not Rift, or Champions Online, neither Age of Conan, nor Star Wars: The Old Republic. It is not for end-gamers or raiders, grinders or power-levelers, PVPers or dungeon runners.Rather, it is The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Broken Sword and Syberia, Gabriel Knight and I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream. It is for seekers and journeymen, detectives and discoverers; it is for explorers, and it is for adventurers.So is The Secret World a game you will enjoy?\n\nFamiliar MMORPG trappings are apparent; there are definite systems and mechanics at play that one could use to thusly label this game, but close examination quickly reveals this style of MMO is not one that will appeal to a mass market.Beyond the limited character customisation options, the somewhat hasty justification of your avatar’s situation and subsequent induction to their chosen faction, lies an entire parallel universe to be explored. The scene set is present day, with the twist that here in The Secret World, all conspiracies, myths, and legends are true.The Secret World delivers a definite sensation that there is nothing here that does not exist through explicit design, be it the name of a town or the colour of the flowers planted in someone’s front yard. It feels as though every constituent is grounded and has a weighty history attached, as though understanding the lore is but an Internet-search away.\n\nThe mission structure is unlike any you will have encountered before. There are several types of mission, and a small limit on the number of each that can be active at any time. The translation of this is that one cannot race wantonly through hub areas, collecting missions with abandon, to turn-in simultaneously for experience rewards broaching hedonistic quantities.Neither can missions be discarded once acquired, and though it is possible to pause them to resume later, it’s not an efficient method of churning through content. Of course Funcom doesn’t actually want you to be churning at all, but to be instead involved in your actions, and to see missions through their multiple tiers and increasing difficulties to their satisfying conclusions.Some missions require a rethink of your entire MMO approach to date, and this time I can provide an example. An escort mission of sorts mandated the continued living status of my accompanying NPC. After failing twice, I resolved to level a bit and come back later, until I remembered there are, in fact, no levels.\n\nExperience does still accumulate, but its effect is to unlock more skills and abilities. True, some of these are more powerful, but it doesn’t have the same impact as levelling in other games.Tactical skill-based combat is what's important.The skill wheel takes a while to get your head around, but basically you can choose from melee weapons (sword, hammers, and fists), firearms (pistol, shotgun, and assault rifles) and magic (chaos, blood, and elemental). Each skill has subsequent layers to unlock. You are not tied to any one skill; in fact, you can effectively have two skill "trees" selected at one time - a Blood Mage wielding a Shotgun, for instance. You can go heavy on one skill and unlock deeper and more complex skills or you can choose to pick a scattering of each.\n\nVisual information in The Secret World is more important than it would be in other MMOs. Clues for quests are scattered about everywhere. Being able to read your environment, not just your powers bar, is a skill to be mastered in this game.Beyond the informational side of things, the general art style and attention to detail just completely suck you in.  Sweeping vistas are easy to find if you go high enough, but it's on the ground that you feel the setting.  Mist-shrouded woods, caves illuminated by phosphorescent mushrooms or the occasional lantern, burning deserts, and seashores all have a heft to them visually, even when they're overrun by nightmarish creatures that by turns are fascinating and repulsive at the same time.\n\nAs with the visual, so with the audio. Sound cues are always important, particularly if you've drawn aggro from a mob, but it's the use of sound in quests and puzzles that make it a step above the norm for MMOs.  Finding the signal in static, the right tones to unlock a door, even tracing a siren's song back to its origin point, there's all manner of clever uses for sound in this game and some of them will get you killed in short order if you're not on the bounce. Equally impressive is the voice acting in the game. The storyline and main quests all have voice-overs for their introductions.\n\nThere are a couple things I didn’t get into, such as the dungeons, but I never had the chance to go through a multi-person dungeon.However, I did hit a few single player dungeons and they weren’t all that bad solo.It's a blast to see an massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game that doesn't go straight for the high heroic fantasy genre. Funcom has done an excellent job creating a world that is both relatable and mysterious for players to explore. The Secret World delivers an MMO experience that's distinctly different from its competitors, and it's likely going to remain the standard for future games in the horror/supernatural genre.","January 12, 2015","true","77.9"," 528 of 596 people (89%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","89","528","596","16","16"

I'm very sorry. But I can't keep it short when I'm talking about something I like. And this game I do like definitly.\n\n\nFirst off: Almost all the negative review statements I read concerning this game are true. Period.\n\n\nThis Game is insofar as it concerns the UI, graphical glitches, the inherent logic of development systematics you need to know to advance your character correctly or the combat mechanic in general highly unpolished.\n\nIt falls very often short in giving you a wholehearted experience of a well thought out contemporary horror story. It is quite cheesy actually. Sometimes it's cheesy, sometimes just boring. Sometimes so confusing and overcomplex that you may sigh and just leave it alone.\n\nWhat are all the different stats for? I mean really for. As an advancing player I read through the forums. I do what veterans say is the best option but I just don't understand the mechanical processes of numbergenerating during combat until now.\n\nOn the surface the stats are not only overly complicated but behind this not so complicated scenery lies no truely understandable mechanism which would show up after a few hours and let's you fine tune your characterbuild. At least I never got a comprehensive insight in the numerical processes which lead to the different combat outcomes.\n\nBut: I'm not really into MMO's. Perhaps players who are used to this genre have a much better Intuition for the Interaction of stats in the Secret World. I can't judge this game in terms of being a good or not so good MMO.\n\n\nBecause this is the only one I play. And I play it a lot.\n\n\nAnd I will tell you why:\n\n\nTwo main reasons exist for me that make this game standout between a whole bunch of games I played in the last years and MMO's I tried to get into.\n\n\nThe first one:\n\nA sometimes just amazingly cool feel ambiancewise. I said that the quests often are cheesy. Cheesy like some bad horrorstorypaperback from the trainstation's bookshop. Or sometimes worse actually.\n\nBut on some ocassions I was really immersed in the dark, a bit - not disturbing - but confusing tone of the narrative which unfold. I could name a few quests I play over and over again. And I am absolutely not bored by playing them again. Somme MMO-Player's could say I am grinding... but if I'm grinding I can't say it feels like grinding. I'm looking forward to the nice cutscene I know to start after this boss battle, the beautifully arranged scenery of the abandoned Fair, or the appearance of a not so cliché character.\n\nThe fascinating, gritty or disturbing atmosphere this games sometimes - only on rare ocassions - is able to create reminds me of the self forgetting process of reading contemporary psychoanalytical writings.\n\nMark my words: It's definitely not the same, it shares only some strange layer of significance which is hidden behind the structure of the narrative form.\n\nThere are few games in which I find such a thing. But the ending of the vanishing of Tyler Freeborn quest is such a moment. I'm not quite sure what's it all about, but it's coherent feel makes it worth my time.\n\nAfter I found this feeling in some quests even the shadow of this structural phenomenon reminds me of the cool moments I had in some other quests and makes the less well thought out and arranged levels of this game worthwhile for me.\n\n\n\nSecond one:\n\nThe Dungeons.\n\nI read in one review that this games dungeons have some classic feel to it. Like the old WoW Dungeons.\n\nI cannot say if this is true for I never played WoW. But I must admit that after I did my first (very newby stupid and surely - for my patrners - annoying) dungeon run I finally understood what this MMO stuff is all about.\n\nThe groups which I was joining in this first period of getting known to playing an online game with foreign persons was such a remarkably stressful, chaotic and foremost optimistic experience for me that I instantly got hooked of playing a healer. These persons with which I was running - absolutely unexperienced in building and manouevering the quite responsible position of a healer - were just great, respect- and helpful individuals.\n\nI had the feeling they were about my age. Didn't take my constant failing too personally. Let me practice my skills and even gave me helpful advice and comments on how to become a better part of the TSW community.\n\nI liked this a lot.\n\nAnd I like it today. Everytime I play this game I look forward to doing a few dungeons with nice and relaxed people from all over the globe, and enjoying a few of my favorit quests. That's just a really good way for me to sometimes relax after work.\n\nI like this game and I hope you will like it too and I'm really sorry that I couldn't help and wrote such an enormous blah-blah post but it seems as if it had to be said.\n\nThx for reading.","September 23, 2015","true","408.8"," 307 of 335 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","307","335","15","7"

Currently, I am undecided on whether I love the game or hate it.  There is so much potential and so many problems.  If the price is right for you, do try the game.  I suggest holding back on purchasing DLC (issues) and spending real-world money in the store until you have played in Transylvania and complete at least 10 matches in the PvP mini games.  If you still enjoy the game at the end of Transylvania then you will likely continue to enjoy it.\n\nOn live chat, most players are polite and helpful.  Be aware, however, that The Secret World game can be very stressful and frustrating: even nice players are going to rant and rage on occasion.  There is a filter to keep the bad words at bay if one chooses.  A few nice words to someone having a bad day might help them feel less nasty.\n\nSimple graphic issues:  The recommended System Requirements are not set high enough.  One can play the game while meeting the requirements but there will be system lag that will make some missions difficult to complete.  Platforming within missions can challenge low graphic systems.  The graphics are beautifully done but they are demanding.\n\nNearly all the missions, story missions, and side missions are good.  If you get stuck there is usually someone on the live chat that will help you out.  The greatest issue I discovered with missions is that some involve platforming or jumping from object to object.  This can be a problem if one has system lag or just isn’t good at jumping.  Sabotage missions have a greater instance of platforming and also involve jumping over traps.  The investigative missions have issues of their own if you want to just play a game.  There is an in-game browser for a reason.  One could spend hours researching for answers to puzzles on the internet rather than just playing the game.  (This can be resolved by asking for help or researching walkthroughs for the answers.)  The lock-out time for missions in Transylvania is about 60 hours, which leaves a player looking for something to do until the missions are cooled down.  There are issues (DLC) to keep end-gamers busy for a time.\n\nIssues 1 – 4 are included in the purchase.\nIssue 5 is a mystery story, someone went suspiciously missing.\nIssue 6 is an adventure story, like Indiana Jones movies in a fashion.\nIssue 7 is a horror story where children are the victims.  This is not for everyone.\nIssue 8 is a grind…no real story.  In this issue one gains Augments that improves abilities. (AP costs are very high)\nIssue 9 is a back to where it all started story.  The AEGIS system is introduced and a story of chaos in Tokyo has begun.\n\nPvP has a few issues that make it difficult to enjoy every time.  There will be lag even on the best of hardware.  Sometimes the lag is show-stopping; sometimes it is more like an unexpected hiccough.  Sometimes the teams are not full; a faction can start with only one or two players rather than the total allowed.  If your faction does not have a full team at the start, winning a match is more difficult.  The PvP mini-games are often unbalanced: a team of high-end players can be matched against teams of new/lower level players.  There is an issue where players stand AFK in a match and don’t fight at all.  If you are a tolerant, even-tempered soul, PvP is still playable as even the losing team is rewarded for playing.  Funcom is working to resolve the issues in PvP but we might have to be tolerant for a time before it materializes.  Maybe a very long time.\n\nThe concept of playing the way you want to play falls into the dirt on the second map (Egypt) and dies on the third map (Transylvania).  Some missions and dungeons, if you do not have the right build, cannot be completed.  Away from the dungeons and PvP, one can play with whatever build suits them in most PvE missions.\n\nEven though most days I find something to dislike, I recommend trying this game.  Just hold back on spending too much real-world money until you get more past Egypt.","January 20, 2014","true","064.5"," 180 of 188 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","180","188","0","0"

The games best features come from storytelling and immersion in a dark twisted modern-day world while letting the player go at their own pace and play how they want to.\n\nCombat: The combat itself is pretty generic tab-target, but using cone attacks (aka shotgun blasts) free this up a bit and make it more about kiting and dodging.\n\nLevelling/skills: As advertised the game has no character levels or class restrictions but you can only have up to 7 active and 7 passive skills set at any one time, aswell as a max of 2 weapons.\n\nQuesting/Missions: The game only lets you hold up to 6 missions at any one given time, 1 story mission, 1 dungeon mission, 1 main mission and 3 side missions but these arent the old "go kill x monster or gather x thing" quests which take under a minute to accomplish, Every quest be it side quest, story or main mission i've picked up and finished has provied pieces of information towards the events happening in the area, making everything alot more immersive and larger in scale. (Note:  Investigation missions are quite tricky puzzle solvers that will make you pull your hair out trying to complete!)\n\nStorytelling: As stated above this game is more focused on immersion and storytelling, but how good of a job does it do? Overall the voice acting from each new npc character you meet is extreemly well done and sets the mood, Quite like watching a dramatic horror/thriller film, This also adds depth to the areas you explore and try to pass through bit by bit.\n\nOverall: If you're looking for a game thats big on action, easy questing, quick levelling or combat focused this game wont be for you, If however you want a game that racks your brain, makes you think, pulls you into its world and does a damn good job at keeping you there, Then i'd suggest picking up The Secret World.","November 24, 2014","true","68.6"," 92 of 101 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","92","101","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnigmaticInterChange/recommended/215280/","EnigmaticInterChange","The Cockroach King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnigmaticInterChange/","333 products in account","When we hear the term ‘MMORPG’ we tend to think of Elves, Dragons, and grinding out levels. The Secret World seeks to subvert this trend by not being set in a high fantasy world and doing away with levels, skill trees and the class system entirely. Set in the present day and in this universe, The Secret World has players assume the role of a regular person who has been granted fantastic abilities, and uses them to do battle against dark forces on behalf of The Illuminati, The Templar or the mysterious and chaotic Dragon.\n\nThe biggest thing that sets The Secret World apart from other MMOs is its setting. Events take place in our present day world, and reference real world culture. For instance, the Templar make a point of telling the player that they are nothing like what one might see in a Dan Brown novel. Early locations pay homage to the likes of HP Lovecraft and Stephen King, and mission-giving NPCs feel like they’ve stepped out of film and literature as they go off on their pre-quest monologues. Enemies are taken from myth and legend, and include the likes of Draugh, Wendigo, Zombies, Vampires, Demons and The Bogeyman. I’ve even seen a tribe of Sasquatch.\n\nZones are large and varied. In the early stages of the game, players explore haunted carnivals, sleepy towns plagued by the undead, occult institutions, and forests inhabited by vicious beasts. I’ve been putting many hours into the game since I got it, and still haven’t left the early zones as there is plenty to do in each of the game’s large, open areas.\n\nMost of the time, like in other MMOs, I’m doing missions for NPCs. Upon accepting a mission, the player is treated to a cutscene where the quest-giver tells you (sometimes in a rambling, roundabout way) what they need done. I really like these cutscenes. Despite the player’s character not having any dialogue, the quest-giver monologues are entertaining, as the NPCs have a lot of character and the voice talent has done a good job of bringing them to life.\n\nWhile still maintaining the “Kill 10 X” style of quest, The Secret World expands on the formula by introducing a couple of new quest types. Investigation missions are probably the most enjoyable of these new types, as they deviate most from the standard MMO fare. In investigations, players have to employ detective skills, along with logic, problem solving, and perhaps a little research (made easier by the games handy built in web browser) to uncover clues that lead to other clues, that eventually lead to uncovering some important knowledge. Some of the investigations are absolutely devilish, requiring a substantial degree of effort on the part of the player. One such mission presents the player with a message encrypted in Morse Code.\n\nTo advance to the next stage of the investigation, the player must decipher the coded message (or give in to temptation and google up a guide using the games handy built in web browser). Investigations may also task players with cracking a computer password or following a series of cryptic clues in a treasure hunt across the zone. The investigation missions are a lot of fun, provided you’re the kind of person who is into cracking clues and codes, otherwise they can just be infuriating and force the player to follow a walkthrough to get it over with.\n\nThe other main type of mission introduced in The Secret World is Sabotage. These involve sneaking into an area, avoiding laser tripwires, security cameras and enemies who are capable of quickly dismembering the player if their attention is accidentally attracted. Sabotage quests are not as common as investigations or “Kill X” quests, possibly because they can be a little repetitive. Most Sabotage missions require the player to navigate an area where the price for failure is almost instant death.\n\nThis wouldn’t be a problem, but at times, jumping over a low tripwire is complicated by sloppy jumping mechanics, often ending in something exploding and severely damaging your character, if not killing it outright and forcing you to attempt the section again.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of The Secret World is the way in which it does away with the traditional class and levelling systems that appear in other MMOs. The Secret World employs a system that allows the player to create their own class, or ‘deck’ as it is called, by equipping two weapons, and up to seven active and seven passive abilities. Decks are built by spending a combination of Action Points (AP) and Skill Points (SP), which are gained through accumulation of experience. Abilities are split into categories based on the weapon a character a character needs to use them. Currently, the weapons available consist of Swords, Hammers, Fists, Blood Magic, Elementalism, Chaos Magic, Pistols, Shotguns, and Assault Rifles.\n\nIf one were to play the game for long enough, one could obtain all the available abilities, as there is no limit to the amount of experience a character can accrue. For this reason there is no way to refund spent Ability Points, nor does there need to be.\n\nIf someone was to do what I did, and create a character build they weren’t happy with, remedying the situation simply requires picking up a new weapon and buying some new abilities to go along with it. I was genuinely surprised with how easy it was to alter the developmental direction of my character. I just stopped, equipped a hammer I had lying about, used my spare AP and SP to grab some abilities and weapon skill, and off I went.\n\nThe limitations imposed on the number of abilities a character can equip may be jarring to MMO veterans who are used to loading up their half a dozen action bars with dozens of abilities. I too felt somewhat strategically hindered at first. Eventually I came to see the restrictions as a deeper level of character customisation, intended to force the player to design their deck of abilities around the situation at hand. There’s still times where I really, really want an eighth ability slot, just so I can squeeze in one more attack or passive ability, but I’ve come to appreciate the strategy behind customising my build within the constraints of the system.\n\nCombat is probably where The Secret World is closest to other MMOs. The player still has an ability bar, and the abilities on that bar still have cooldowns. Resources like mana have been done away with however, and each of the two weapons a player is carrying uses its own resource pool. During combat, players use abilities to build weapon resources, then spend those resources to unleash their more powerful abilities, then resources are built up again and the cycle continues. The Secret World seeks to break up the repetition of combat by letting the player perform a dodge roll, which allows the character to get out of the way of incoming area of effect attacks some enemy types like to use.\n\nEngaging enemies must be done with some degree of strategy, as for each unintended enemy entering combat, the player’s chances of survival decrease quite a bit. The enemies that inhabit the outside environments tend to boast roughly the same, if not a larger, amount of health as the player and are capable of taking a bit of punishment, so engaging with too many enemies at once is not in the players best interests. There is no PVP, as each faction has called a truce in order to fight the dark forces.\n\nNo MMO is without bugs, and The Secret World is no exception to this. During my time with the game, I have encountered a few bugged quests, and have even fallen through the world on one occasion. The GMs were amazingly helpful with the bugged quests, rectifying the situation within 15 minutes of me sending off a petition. Other than these isolated incidents, my time in The Secret World has been essentially bug free.\n\nAbstract\n\nStory 9\nGameplay 9\nGraphics 9.5\nSound 9.5\nReplayability 9\nControls 9\n\nOverall Score\n\n9.25/10","January 3, 2015","true","52.6"," 86 of 93 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","86","93","7","0"

No, the game play can get a little rough at times, and the character builder feels quite flat.

The atmosphere of modern horror is perfect without resorting to cheap scares, but instead weaving a tale of Lovecraftian horror and survival, all with the backdrop of major political forces moving in the background.  The 'leveling' system is by far one of the best and most original that I've ever seen in an MMO, eschewing traditional 'levels' and 'classes' in favor of a more free form system of upgrading skills and items to build a unique character.  In addition this is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played, and by far the best looking MMO of anything I've ever seen.

You'll never want to leave.\nUnmatched missions that have a lot of variety and plots that are better than some AAA titles, with great voice acting and solid cutscenes(featuring your character!) for at least half of them(There's a lot!).\nA lot of missions are repeatable.\nInvestigation missions are unlike anything you've seen before. They require real investigation, whether it be using your knowledge of the game, searching the internet(there's an in-game browser), or even calling real phone numbers. Expect these to be insanely difficult. You should put some on hold and do other missions while you think about their solutions or hints, explore the vast world until something "ticks."\nIt makes you think.\nEverywhere in every zone, there's rich content to be found, whether it be hidden lore or a mission.\nTons of in-depth lore to uncover.\nMany large zones to explore with different themes, filled with great design, content and atmosphere.\nEncourages exploration.\nYou can explore when you die, as a ghost, and it is required for some things. The world changes when you're dead.\nLovecraftian horror.\nChoose from three factions, each with their own story and hub. Illuminati, Templar or Dragon.\nGreat character customization with tons of cosmetics to unlock or buy.\nYou get a hat for eating 7460 tacos.\nCountless in-game achievements with rewards of all kinds(XP, cosmetics, items, titles, etc.).\nThere's no character levels. You earn XP to unlock Ability Points and Skill Points; the required amount of XP never changes.\nYou're able to unlock all 500+ abilities on a single character to create complex builds. Skill Points decide which quality level of items you can equip.\nSince your equipment's quality level matters so much, it's not such a bad idea to rush to the next zone to get better loot, then go back to make things a bit easier(A mission may be required to advance to the next zone).\nTwo weapon types can be equipped at once in any combination and you can change them at any time, then you can unlock a 3rd special weapon later in the game.\n9 Main weapon types include Assault Rifle, Pistols, Shotgun, Fist, Hammer, Blade, Elemental, Chaos and Blood.\nThere's auxiliary weapons such as a Rocket Launcher, Flamethrower, Quantum, Chainsaw and Whip. These would be the 3rd weapon you can equip at once and they each have their own set of abilities.\nSeasonal events.\nGood pacing; not grindy as most MMORPGs are.\nNice music, I never felt the need to disable it.\nBuy-to-play, no subscription.\nOver 160 hours in and there's still a ton of content I haven't done.\nMemorable.\nDungeons and Scenarios have multiple difficulties.\nAfter completing 30 missions, you get 1200 free points to spend in their store, which can be used to purchase extra mission packs among many goods.\nThe Issues(mission packs) that are sold don't really come into play until endgame and they're optional, so if you make it that far, they probably deserve the extra money anyway.\nIt has PvP, for those that are looking for it. You can completely avoid it like I have.\nThe community is nice and helpful. Be sure to join the "#Sanctuary" chat channel, great place.\nYou can fast travel to anima wells you find at a very low cost.\nThe zone maps seen via the [M] key are very nice, with coordinates as well as the ability to place text markers to label noteworthy spots. I use that feature a lot.\nAddon/mod support.\nCountless high quality textures and images you'll see in missions.\nUpgradeable sprint speeds(unlocked through faction rank. You have to buy the upgrade in your faction's hub and a lot of people tend to miss this feature for a long time).\nItem crafting and disassembling.\nAuction House(I like them, and it only helps this game).\nExpand inventory space many times simply by using in-game currency. You can split inventories for sorting.\nYou'll probably only use one character, but you can have multiple.\nMakes time fly.\nCons:\nRidiculously underrated considering this may be the best MMO available. There's not a ton of people playing(a few thousand maybe), but that's okay, since at least 90% of the content is possible solo. It's pretty much a single-player game with social features, but you can group up if you wish. I'd say most of the players are using a non-Steam client, so ignore the Steam charts. It's actually not integrated with Steam at all, so you don't have to run it through Steam either. You get a key for the game that you redeem on your account to activate it.\nSome people don't like the combat, some say it's the only downfall, but I personally kind of like it; I've seen much worse. You'll be dodging plenty of attacks, kiting and aiming with AoEs or cone-style attacks, plus the animations and effects are nice.\nDX11 has a couple bugs, so you may be better off running it in DX9 like me. I think DX9 even gives a better framerate. The option is available.\nThe framerate could be better, but it's acceptable and I get too immersed to notice. I think maybe it just doesn't like my 8-core AMD CPU very much, that's not uncommon with MMOs.\nThe prices on Steam are fairly high, especially for Issues(additional endgame missions), but it's definitely worth it.\nIt may be a bit difficult to get into at first, for some people, but that's because there's so much to it!\n40GB install size, but judging from the amount of high quality content and voice acting in the game, that install size seems fair.\nNo Steam achievements. I want them so bad.\nUpdate:\n10-Day Free Trial here[play.thesecretworld.com]","November 12, 2015","true","180.0"," 94 of 106 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","94","106","2","25"

But, well, I've been distracted. By this game.\n\nThe Secret World is an MMORPG set in modern times. Your character awakens with magic powers in a world where all of the conspiracy theories are true, and you're quickly recruited into one of the ancient secret societies. They send you to several supernatural hotspots arouns the world in order to protect your society's interests and stop the impending end of days.\n\nYou get to channel your magic through two different weapons, and you have three guns, three magic focuses, and three melee weapons to choose from (not to mention auxiliary weapons you'll find later on, such as the Rocket Launcher or Whip). Most of the chocies are viable for a player simply looking to do damage. If you want to tank or heal, you'll need to include one of the "tank weapons" or "healer weapons".\n\nI enjoy playing this genre of game, but I could never get into World of Warcraft or its many clones. This game really is something special. The first reason is that the story and mission dialogue is not only worth reading, but it's compelling at times. Some of the characters really are very lovable, and there are some really fun mysteries to unravel. The second reason is that the quest structure is really good. Sure, there are a few "kill 10 wolves" quests, but there's also an "unlock the Illuminati vault by solving a riddle" quest, and a "sneak around the laser system" quest. Each quest really felt like I was doing something meaningful. The third is that, in this game, you're never locked out of certain paths. You spend points to upgrade certain weapons or get new weapon skills, but you can always level up other weapons in the future in case you want to fill a different role.\n\nI should also clear up one thing about this game: no subscription. You pay once, and you get access to the vast majority of the game's content. You can choose to pay a little more for content packs... most of them are worth spending some money on.\n\nI got this on sale, and it's some fo the best money I've ever spent on Steam. If you enjoy playing MMOs, then this game is absolutely worth trying. If not, it's probably worth trying anyway.","May 9, 2014","true","647.8"," 70 of 76 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","70","76","0","1"

It certainly doesn't re-invent the wheel at any point and the movement and combat feels a little floaty. It's yout typical action-bar-pickup-quests-kill-mobs sort of game.\n\nAt least that's what you think when you start playing.\n\nHowever; the game developers have managed to capture this really thick atmosphere through a combination of great story-telling, awesome voice-acting and a brilliant soundtrack. When you start playing the game you really start to get sucked in and the experience becomes increasingly immersing as you follow along with the story. You start yearning to find out the secrets behind the mystery. I really get this 'Diablo 2 but set in the modern world.' sort of vibe while playing it.\n\nAnd really it is that which drives me on. The game has a fairly steep learning curve. A complex crafting system, a massive selection of weapons, skills, abilities, stats -- and none of it is really formally explained. But with a bit of surfing you will quickly find answers to those questions. (using the in-game browser is a nice touch.)\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone playing for end-game content or raiding for epic loot. However; if you're looking to immerse yourself in a really well voice-acted horror story that generates an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife, this could well be for you.","December 25, 2013","true","35.3"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","66","73","0","0"

Many people have already posted about the story line, the atmosphere, etc.  All of that is great.  This is what really makes the game great for me though.   There are no character classes.  You unlock every skill and then you can build your own deck (basically role) for many different types of game modes.  There are your classic holy trinity roles of Tank, DPS, and heals.  However, there are many different hybrid roles as well.  Some examples are a heal tank, melee dps, DPS tank, leech healer (healer that heals with an assault rifle DPS), and then the mixing and matching of many skills/weapons that add more to your build as well.    I have a few hours on this game and my toon can do every role for all the content in the game (sans some brand new content since I haven't learned every role yet in the new content), and that is what makes this game great for me.   Typically in any other MMO you must roll another class to try or play another role.  Not in this game.  You get complete control of what weapons you want to slot, and you craft all your own custom gear.\n\nMany MMOs have advertised the "Play it your way," model of character progression and design.   While, you cannot 100% just make up whatever you want in this game, it is the only game that comes close.   You are never locked into a specific class or build, and with their crafting system you can completely customize all your gear.   It really is the closest thing to the "play it your way," I have ever experienced in a MMO.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone where this is appealing.  To be honest this game has sort of ruined me, as I will probably never want to play a class-based MMO video game again.    I now want my character to be able to perform any role.","September 10, 2015","true","232.5"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","44","47","5","2"

If you dislike MMO-style gameplay, then look elsewhere: this game includes a (somewhat) typical (though unique in some aspects) quest system, the usual grind from time to time, and tinkering with character stats.\n\nIt also does not give you the full experience if all you're interested in is jumping into a game and mindlessly blowing everything up (which, hey, who doesn't love that, too?). Finally, the graphics aren't going to blow your mind (that's not to say they're bad. It's just...they're MMO graphics. What do you want?)\n\nBut with all that said and out of the way, I love the effort this game goes through to create such an amazing atmosphere. The story is intricate and intriguing, the main quests include well-crafted cutscenes with quality voice acting. And the quests! The quests took me by surprise!\n\nThe quests will range from your typical "go here and kill 10 zombies," to an intricate series of puzzles and riddles, leading you through town and exploring secret areas, and finally giving you incredibly challenging riddles that require you to do research (with a pretty cool in-game browser window) to seek out a solution. Never before have I been challenged by an MMO like I have with TSW.\n\nAnd it's also the first MMO like this I've played that has no classes and no levels, pushing you to really invent unique "deck" combinations suited to your gameplay, picking and choosing which two weapons you want to use and which abilities for each. I found I was realllly left in the dark about how this all worked, but after I did some research into everything online, everything started to click into place quickly. Which I suppose is just fine for a game that urges you to research and learn, anyway.\n\nThe subject and genre are unique and interesting, and it's a good experience to turn off the lights, and immerse yourself in the game, reading the clues and lore, learning new things, and exploring this creepy world. I'm hopeful for even more customization of character, and I think the gameplay system could be made more clear somehow, but overall, this game is a definite new favorite in my library. Solo-friendly. Group-friendly. Helpful and nice community.\n\nOverall, you only get out of this game what you're willing to put in. If you explore and involve yourself with the story, TSW is a rewarding experience. It was a refreshing change from my years of WoW addiction, and made me brush the dust off my brain.\nI'm hooked.","November 6, 2014","true","26.1"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","48","54","2","0"

Initially a bit challenging after playing some of the "Press button to kill things" games, The Secret World requires you to know your build well enough to utilize it during combat. It can feel a bit unforgiving at times if you haven't balanced out your gear and stats, but everything is customizable and can be broken down to make new items so it shouldn't take long to get the hang of playing.\n\nI would suggest the Massive Edition for anoyone completely new to the game. The starter weapons are good through the entire first zone (until you hit about 3 million XP) and you also get an XP booster you can use once every 16 hours (lasts 1 hour).\n\nAnother big draw to the game is the overall look of your character and how much you can customize their wardrobe. Your stats are based off smaller items, not your shirt, hat and boots. You can acquire clothing items in game by doing various missions or achievements but you can also purchase them through the Item Store, which allows you to preview the item on your character before purchase. Sure, clothing doesn't affect the game, but being able to come up with your own look is a nice touch. What's more, you get your faction outfit as you progress through the game and you can unlock other outfits as you complete "Decks" (the closest thing to spec/builds in The Secret World). I would suggest looking over the starter decks early and figuing out what weapon combo you want to play, then spend you AP and SP to unlock that starter deck. Once you have completed it, you can claim the outfit for that deck. (Considering you can obtain every skill and ability in the game on one character, everyone is able to complete every deck and play every style.)\n\nOne drawback I've found with The Secret World is that it's a bit of a time sink. What felt like an hour of play time was actually about 4 hours of real time. It's easy to get caught up in the world, I guess.","March 25, 2014","true","51.7"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","44","48","0","0"

You can choose between three secret societies (like factions in other games) to join the battle against nasty monsters or each other.\nThere are no classes or levels but I will talk about that later.\n\n\n~~Payment model~~\n\nTSW is Buy-to-play, similar to Guild Wars 2. You don't need a subscription to play but new content is (partially) locked behind a DLC. When you buy the game you get the base game and the first four Issues (that's what content patches are called). You also get enough Bonus Points (after doing 30 missions) to buy one of the DLC.\nThe item shop is mostly cosmetic and the few non-cosmetic items are far from Pay-to-win.\n\nThe optional subscription gives you some points for the store, a 10% store discount, an item of the month (clothing or pet), veteran points and an item that gives you double XP for one hour (16 hours cooldown).\n\n\n~~Setting~~\n\nTSW is set in the modern world. The three faction hubs are London, New York and Seoul. There are three quest regions at the moment, each with 2-3 zones: Solomon Island (New England), Egypt and Transylvania. The next region will be Tokyo (probably late 2013/early 2014).\nThere is a lot of horror and mystery influence from H.P. Lovecraft, X-Files, etc.\n\n\n~~PvE~~\n\nMost of the quests have cutscenes and the voice actors are great. This is the first MMORPG where I didn't skip any cutscenes and really got into the story.\n\nEvery quest is repeatable which lets you correct mistakes you made with your build early on and gives you the chance to get enough AP to get every skill later (see ~~Progression~~).\nThere are three types of quests: Action, Sabotage and Investigation.\nAction quests are your typical run/kill quests.\nSabotage quests have you sneak around and avoid cameras and monsters.\nInvestigation quests have you solve puzzles, use real life knowledge etc. (One example (SPOILERS): In one of the quests you have to figure out that the hint you just got points to a specific bible verse which gives you another hint for the next quest step)\n\nThe dungeons are some of the best I've ever seen in an MMORPG and can be pretty challenging if you don't get carried through. Each dungeon comes in three difficulties: Normal, Elite and Nightmare.\n\nThe endgame is mostly running Nightmare dungeons and the two raids. With Issue 8 (released in Nov '13) there are also scenarios to run, which are basically instanced missions for solo, duo or groups with random elements.\nUnfortunately most of the content is the same regardless of faction and since you can get everything on one character you are not encouraged to make alts.\n\n\n~~PvP~~\nI don't play PvP myself but from what I hear some love it, some hate it. Better look for another review if you want to know more about PvP.","November 26, 2013","true","105.2"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

Missions that will (most of the time) keep you interested, and a unique class system.\n\nI'll say, this game can be hard to get into. The story alone should keep you going for a bit, especially if you really give it a chance. I sometimes feel the dialouges are a bit drawn out but the story overall is interesting. That being said, questing areas are often not too populated and I imagine it can be hard to make friends, and the ability wheel at first glance can be overwhelming.\nOne of the first thing you'll want to do is join Sanctuary by inputting "/chat join sanctuary" into your chat. This is a fairly active chat for new players with a lot of vets willing to help with builds, questing, and more.\n\nBut as you get more comfortable with the world, your roles, the quests, the dungeons, it can become really fun. This is the only game I've ever played where I LOVE instances. I have no issue grinding every elite on repeat for hours. Each group poses new dynamics, challenges, and the boss fights are generally fun (to me).\n\nCLASSES AND FIGHTING:\nThe ability to change out your roles and classes can be weird at first. Essentially in the beginning you will probably want to be guessing at builds online and hope they're effective until you learn the skills. But once you do, it can open up a  world of building your own builds, rotations, there is really no definitive way to play a class and a lot of the time later, you'll find yourself switching skills depending on the situation, or sometimes even roles, making you more and more valuable as a party member for your flexibility. It is amazingly valuable to be mid dungeon wiping and realizing you can't heal something, only to have a dps come up and say "hey, we can switch", and still be able to progress.\n\nQUESTING AND ENVIROMENT:\nMost reviews talk about this so I'm not gonna go into it too much. The story is interesting, with nice character variety and interesting side stories. There's some excellent attention to detail. There are actually for real sites they've made for this game connected to the story which can be clues and more, and I love little details like that. (i.e.: a character has a blog writing about something relevant to a quest, you can go to his blog: http://www.monstersofmaine.blogspot.ca/)\n\nImmersion is pretty good. Graphics, eh, pretty decent. Exploring and lore hunting is fun. Maps are fairly big, it'll take you some time to run around an entire one and see it all, often you'll find small side missions hidden if you're exploring.\n\nOne criticism I have is the hitboxes for traps SUCK. I absolutely hate sneaking missions. You'll be feet away from a landmine and it will blow up on you. Absolutely hate those things.\n\nCOMMUNITY:\nThe community is often one of the better I have been in. If you are new to an instance there are usually people very willing to help out. I mainly heal in this game and I very very rarely get the whole "omg noob healer!!!" business (even when I can be that). It can be slow but there are some really cool people on this game. Late game players often even carry the easy difficulty dungeons for new players, there can be a very nice sense of community.\nOf course, there are the douches. It is an MMO.\n\nUI AND THE NEED FOR MODDING:\nThe UI isn't great. It can be glitching and it's lacking as well. I'll tell you right now if you decide to get this game, mod the UI. You'll want better combat logs, resource counters, and... Well, just generally, look for the mods.\n\nENDGAME:\nI'm not quite to full endgame yet so I feel a little weird writing about this specifically but endgame is grinding. Grinding nightmares, scenarios, signet missions. If you enjoy the gameplay, unlocking all your skills, making new builds, it's fun. But when you get there, that's definitely a thing. (To be expected in an mmo, but just saying.)\n\nAnyway... Been meaning to write a review for awhile. So...

I wanted to try out my first MMO however I'm extremely picky about "Fantasy" - I usual don't like it. With TSW, it takes place in the Present. It has a "grown-up" story full of characters, etc. not found in most games. Plus, this game has as much playtime as the entire Borderlands series combined.\n\nThere were some Sci Fi MMO's I considered, but I didn't want to level grind - TSW has linear growth and I can "spend" my Skill Points where ever to determine my Quality Level (1 - 10).\n\nWith most of my gamer buddies on Xbox, I have to solo this a lot, and it's very doable - if balanced correctly. Other players are around and will assist occasionally to help you out.\n\nHere's my advice if you want to get started on The Secret World:\nRemember there are no monthly fees. You can play without every buying an In-app purchase. You will earn 1200 bonus credits to buy new side stories or in-game stuff after your 1st 30 missions. You can earn in game credit to buy things too. Spending real money might save you time though, get you time boosts, "outfits" - none of which is necessary. The Ultimate Edition on sale is the best buy with issues #1-#11, side stories, & more.\nPut The Secret World on your Steam Wish List. Install a copy from the Funcom.com site and ask for a 72 hr trial key from the Steam TSW Forums. Then if you enjoy it, get the Ultimate Edition when on sale ( at 60% off = $24 - WOW!! ). *IF you can get the basic Secret World for #1-#3 on sale that will give you time to play it until it's on sale again, but you'll basically spend $$$ to eval a game. Luckily, the Ultimate comes with a base game license key you are allowed to give away. NOTE: This is a FUNCOM key to give, not an extra Steam Key !\nDo NOT create any character right away. You need to do research, preferable before you buy it. (Yes, you are already playing the game, not having bought it yet.)\nRead the Steam Community Guides on it. In particular:\nThe Secret World 101 - has lots of great links at the bottom. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=238124669\nThe Secret World [Revealed] http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=299267939\nPlay TSW using only a controller (Successfully) - read my reply on using 'antimicro' instead of xpadder - including streaming TSW to Linux with Controller support (SteamOS doesn't support antimicro) http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=211633836\nhttp://wordpress.tswguides.com/category/tsw-guides/builds/level/my-first-60/ - this site is a must if your new and will be soloing Lastly, after completing 30 missions, Funcom (currently) gives you 1200 store credits which is worth $10. With that credit, you can buy anything you missed. If you own the Ultimate Edition, you're getting $10 back on your purchase for in-store credit for new chapters & packs. Awesome. Thanks Funcom.\nCharacter creation:\nBe patient creating a unique nickname. Without a login, use http://chronicle.thesecretworld.com to look up if nickname is taken. Note: there are also reserved names - First, Nick & Last . Not everyone can be Snoop Dog or Eva Longoria.\nIf you goof up a Toon's appearance or name, (at the time of writing) you can delete you character & create a new one at no cost with the desired nick name (or even same nickname) so long as someone else doesn't grab the nickname -- I did. YMMV. But if you've been playing and want to re-spec - don't consider deleting it as you'll have many months of game play to get back to where you were. There's very rare reasons to delete to re-spec.\nServers matter for solo adventurers - you want one to find folks for Dungeon runs, PvP gaming, or meet folks to co-op with. Unless you 'Meetup' with someone on another server or are co-op'ing, you will always PvP on your host. I've read I should have gone with Arcadia RP. Now, it's a Role Play host, that means stow (uncheck) your characters gear so it's not visible. And don't Run & Jump over every car & fence you see. I play that way already when I read the suggestion. FYI, It cost $20 to move an existing character to another server. So choose wisely. You can delete a character & create a new one (you have 3 slots) on your preferred server - but it'll be gone forever.\nI have my 2nd of three characters on Arcadia RP. Depending on the zone's or sub-zone's population, it can get occasionally very slightly jittery. If that's a problem, don't use Arcadia. My first character is on Daemon server and its really smooth. My third is on Cerberus. Now I have a character on each of the most populated (English) servers.\nPut every piece of clothing on your character you can when first making them. Jackets, glasses, etc. They will always have shirt, shorts/pants, shoes. However, glasses, hats, jackets, etc. can be removed at anytime. If you want them in-game, you have buy them with earned (or real) currency, achievements, etc. So, take them while their free.\nYou will get bonus stuff from the Steam purchase. Use some of them. Press ',' comma to pull up the store,  select Claim Items, then *review first*. Do *not* claim any yet. Review all the store. Some are even more powerful than earned rings, etc in game but only work below 3mil Exp. Others [ like timed boosts] work for all levels. Consider saving your boosts for later so you level faster/steady on tougher minions/portions.\nFactions only matters for PvP really (capture the flag, territories, etc.). Everyone has the same story to complete, though your faction will alter some dialog. There are a few faction missions, but they are different perspectives or goals of the same event. Everyone can travel to the other cities: London (bank & large market), New York (body modification) & Seoul.\nGame Mods:\n\nViper's TopBar Overload and Viper's Deck Manager\n\nYou'll likely want the Mods: Viper's TopBar Overload so you can install Viper's Deck Manager. The site http://secretui.com has them. Some people use http://Curse.com. You can download them from there too. (I don't like having more clients so I don't run Curse on my rig.)\n\nVDM is the defacto "stringifier" of builds for importing & exporting your current loadout while making loadouts easier too. It's a maintained community Mod. Several Mods are must have but TopBar Overload & VDM are practically mandatory.\n\nThese sites can share & compare your builds with others outside of TSW:\n(Note: if your chronicle.thesecretworld.com profile page is publicly visible, some of these sites will import using that too beside your exported VDM string)\nhttp://www.drakkashi.com/secretworld/\nhttp://www.drakkashi.com/secretworld/Ability%20Wheel.swf (Just the tool)\nhttp://www.tsw-builder.com\nhttp://www.badomens.net/calculator\nhttp://joakibj.com/tswcalcThere's a few more build sites too.\n\nBTW, Viper's DontMakeMeWait is super helpful is speeding past all the startup junk.\n\nTSWRP\n\nAnother popular mod is for http://tswrp.co - it's allows for in-game role play character HTML rich profile sheets to be accessible on the toons. Being HTML, folks can embed photos, use different fonts & colors, etc. Even if you don't RP (role play) you can use it for conveying additional information about your toon or you. The thing is, you have to use the mod if you want to see that out-of-game "meta-data" in-game.\n\nOf course you could use the in-game browser and see if someone has a page at http://tswrp.co/character/TOONNICKNAME (provided you get any capitalization correct since not all nicks are Capitalized.)\n\nGhost Tablet\n\nhttp://www.secretui.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=85 OR http://www.curse.com/tsw-mods/tsw/ghosttablet makes the GHOST computer interface taller for practically no scrolling.","April 11, 2015","true","816.3"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","14"

You dont have to pay to play this game but I recommend paying becasue you get access to a rance of content and store items that you cant buy anywhere els, there are super cute outfits and tons of accessories. One of the best things about this game is you can be any role you like, we have things called talismans and depending on the talismans you equip you can play the role of a tank, DPS or healer, you can also mix talismans and chop and change your spec on the fly, and combind your stats to make a heal-tank :P or a leech DPS or combind all 3 to make very powerful tanking healer dps build thingys (I call them survival builds) to kill the many monsters in the new nightmare level scenario issue packs found in game.

Sick of boring Kill X, Gather Y quests? The Secret World has the most involved quest lines I've ever played. Even their most basic missions are steeped in enough lore to keep you engadged and their legendary Investigation missions earn every bit of praise they've aquired. Tired of spammers filling chat with goldfarming ads and racist tirades? The TSW community is only interested in sharing theories and, occasionally, bad puns. Heck, just don't like monthly subscription fees? Pay once, play forever! And don't worry, while there is an add-on store, it's used entirely for cosmetics, convenience, and story additions. No pay-to-win here.\n\nIf you're a fan of contemporary fantasy or cosmic horror genres, this is an absolute must. Even if you're just a casual MMO player interested in seeing how the genre can work when it's trying desperately to make the Blizzard lightning strike twice, this is a game worth seeing.\n\nCome on... take a peek behind the curtain of reality.","May 11","true","560.1"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","24","25","4","2"

While there are many social features here (such as raid-only dungeons, a kind of "buddy system" designed to connect likeminded players, etc.), TSW feels a lot more like a single-player game with multiplayer options than the other way around. It's HIGHLY immersive and, in my humble opinion, best suited for roleplayers and hardcore ARPGers than casuals or social butterflies.\n\nAs for immersion, one of the things I like most about TSW is that it truly makes you CARE about the characters and the stories it provides for you as a player. Cinematics accompany nearly every main or story quest-giving NPC and your quests are capped to better ensure that you take your time while exploring the regions available to you. The stories are very much alive in this game.\n\nIt's also a true horror fan's wet dream, going far beyond cheap jump scares and the same old monster grinds over and over again. Sure, there are "kill quests" which require you to knock off a dozen of the same mob and you may get tired of seeing zombies around every corner by the time you've made your way through most of the Savage Coast, but you'll also be tracking down the pages of discarded horror novels and following in the characters' footsteps. You'll be battling haunted theme park rides and discovering hidden Illuminati archives. You'll be learning all about the woeful fate of Andy's kittens. It makes the monotony of creature killing so much less monotonous and (in some cases) gets a teensy bit difficult to play comfortably alone in the dark.\n\nKey things to remember if you're just getting started:\n-The leveling system is less about the prestige of character level and more about your combat build, with an emphasis on faction rank and ability combinations.\n-The crafting system is a little (read:extremely) tough to master at first, but once you've gotten it down, it becomes a fun sort of mad science.\n-The dungeons are incredible and well worth the effort of LFGs.\n-You WILL change your mind a half a dozen times about which weapons you want to use.\n-You WILL get frustrated trying to figure out how to complete some of the investigative quests\n-You WILL break down and Google how to solve at least one of the aforementioned quests because the game isn't holding your hand.\n-You WILL die. A lot.\n-The community is there to help you. They're very kind as a whole and I've personally never seen anyone trolled for not knowing how to do something. Don't be scared to reach out if you need help.\n\nThe most important thing to bear in mind about TSW, I think, is that it requires patience and a passion for discovery. If you're looking to barrel through a game that'll make you feel like a god from the word "go," try a different MMO. If, however, you'd rather be elbow-deep in the lore of the old gods and feel like you're literally lost in a world of unending madness, play the Secret World.\n\nMasterfully written, beautifully executed.\nIt's the best MMO I've ever played.","January 12","true","152.8"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiteX3/recommended/215280/","KiteX3","KiteX3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiteX3/","268 products in account","The best and perhaps only consistently good part of The Secret World is the world design; the environments are generally fantastic, the story can be pretty good, and the world overall is vibrant (if a bit shallow).\n\nThe gameplay leaves a *lot* to be desired. The lack of traditional classes and level structure sounds interesting at first, but it's little more than a facade in reality. The "classes" of the game are your weapons, which each have two different "roles" that they're designed around -- Fist weapons heal, Blood magic provides shields, Swords deal DPS, etc -- and the result is ultimately a little more restrictive than Guild Wars (1), except very little in the game makes these equipment "roles" explicit, leaving all of that to discovery (by which I mean the wiki). The absence of proper "levels" in the game is just as fake -- you'll still be stomped flat if you wander too far ahead of your "level" (or encounter a higher-level player in PvP), and you'll trounce anything below your "level" -- the game just hides all of that information from you. The game doesn't "unleash" you in any way; it just trades your leash for a shock collar of painful trial-and-error.\n\nThe controls and netcode are terrible. And yet, somehow, despite the fact that your player character controls like a fish flopping around on an ice rink, Funcom had the gall to include a significant emphasis on jumping puzzles in TSW. (Full disclosure: this review was the product of after two hours' rage, trying to glide my fish up *two jumps*, complete with skidding about, unregistered jump keys, jumps of inconsistent height and distance, and random rolling around.)\n\nSadly, the puzzles in TSW are often painfully vague, or utterly tedious. You WILL need to look up many of them from a wiki, and you WILL want to after dealing with some of these quests. For examples: translating morse code for a pattern in a blinking light that you aren't directed towards; translating phrases into *broken* Latin for computer passwords; learning a demonic alphabet so you can type more broken Latin (thankfully provided) into runes on the floor. There's a few good puzzles interspersed, but unfortunately most of them completely miss the mark.\n\nOverall, the game just isn't worth playing as a primary MMO. If it goes on sale for $10, consider picking it up to play for a weekend or two; tour the game's environments, enjoy a few of the better puzzles, but don't pay so much that you'll feel obligated to play through the unending piles of awful that this game also offers.","February 16, 2014","false","76.4"," 80 of 127 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","80","127","2","0"

This means you don't really get to play dungeons and have to focus on missions to "level" and gear up. You can play the auction house, but there's too large a divide between those who can farm high-Q areas and those who can't; basically items are either pennies or gazillions, which translates to *not very good* and *completely unaffordable/above your Q-level until you've grinded away hours of your life*.\n\nIf you ignore this, and focus on the game as a mission-based RPG, it's not bad. Problem is, it's a grindy RPG, and unless you're one of the dedicated few, there's better RPG's out there.\n\nWhile I wouldn't *discourage* anyone from buying it if they wanted to try it out, ultimately it means I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.","November 28, 2015","false","25.1"," 129 of 216 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","129","216","6","25"

It has a lot of the staple MMO tropes with quest based progression and the "Holy Trinity" of Tanks, DPS, and Healers...it does hold a special place in my heart.   The investigation aspects of this game are amazing and it's quite clear the writers took a lot of time to make sure that you would get involved in the lore of the store they're trying to tell.  Even in the first zone there are missions that require you to understand latin, know 16th Century composers, and be able to determine where to look off of very little info given.\n\nWhile the combat system is rather bland, and it once again follows the typical MMO tropes of follow a quest line through a zone...I can say it held my attention for the many hours I played (Even though it says I've played 14 I have much more then that due to their launcher being derpy.)  I would suggest picking this up full price if you're intrigued about the storyline and are looking for an MMO to try out...or wait till it goes on sale and pick it up for you and a couple of friends. I do however warn you, if you're looking for the typical WoW style gameplay, it's not here.  If you don't like reading, or using your head then the investigation missions might not be for you.

Solid gameplay with a fantastic questing system. This game doesn't disappoint. Every character you meet feels different from the rest, there's no running to npc's taking a quest and skipping through all the quest text. Each mission you take has its own little story and cutscene. Some quests require you to complete others first, in which certain characters will warm up to your character and tell you more of their backstory, making it feel like your actually making a difference. I can't say much about the story in MMO's as most tend to be okay at best but I actually enjoy this game for its story, it incredibly rich on lore and I feel as if I know more of what happens in The Secret World than I do in real life.\n\nPurchasing the expansions (labeled "Issues" in the game store) has added much more to this game. A new verity of weapons to choose from such as Chainsaws and Flamethrowers, to RPG's and Quantum magic. With the latest addition of Tokyo added AEGIS armor into the game, which is sort of like a rock, paper scissor combat in which you must match your damage type to the enemies armor type to do damage before you can physically harm them.\n\nThe Combat system\n\n"The Secret World" eases you slowly into its combat, allowing you to train on test dummies at the start of the game to decide on which starting weapon is best suited to you, then you'll quickly acquire a second weapon which allows you to mix and match up to 7 different skills on the hotbar from each of the skill trees from your weapons, many of which can be mixed together to create powerful skill combinations. At later stages of the game, the combat begins to climb in difficulty adding buffs to the mobs you fight, such as Spectres in graveyards phasing in and out of reality changing their physical and magical damage resistances. With the current addition being the AEGIS system.\n\nThe Story\n\nIts hard to explain the story without containing spoilers, the Story for "The Secret World" is incredibly well written and I have enjoyed every minute of it so far. It has a good mix of serious dialogue with a few jokes thrown in the lighten things up. The characters are written really well, there's a handful of characters that are written so that you can understand them emotionally and then there's a fair few characters that are written so that you will dislike them. Each character in the story is varies from each other and keeps the story fresh and entertaining\n\nContent ("Issues")\n\nTo a certain extent I feel as if this is where the game dropped the ball slightly. Issues 1 through 6 added a good chunk of extra story to the game and felt as if they were worth the money, considering the most you pay for an expansion is around 10 pounds I wasn't expecting a huge amount of content, but atleast something to keep the game fresh for a while longer. Issues 7-8 felt a bit lacking as apposed to its previous Issues. Issue 7 adds an extra bit of story to the Transylvania portion of the game and was fun to play, but as soon as I found myself having a good time with it, it was over. Issue 8 is where my main gripe is at. Issue 8 included the area, well I should say room "Venice".\n\nIn Venice you can take part in scenarios, in which you must keep 2-3 groups of survivors alive through 3 waves of enemies, with a boss at the end of each wave. The amount of survivors alive at the end of the three waves determine how many "Seals" you will acquire at the end. The scenarios are a nice addition to the game, but are incredibly repetitive. Having Issue 8 allows you to take part in three different scenarios, not owning Issue 8 leaves you with 1 scenario to take part in. Scenarios can be completed by yourself, as a duo or as a full group. The maximum amount of seal you can acquire is determined by the difficulty of the scenario you undertake. The easiest difficulty will give you around 5 seals and each scenario has a 18 hour cooldown before you can attempt it, and a 45 minute cooldown if you fail it. In a recent patch the need for getting 80 seals to proceed to Tokyo has been removed to just completing the first training mission in Venice, which allows you to move straight onto the next part of the story. However you can still undertake missions in Venice to aquire powerful gear.\n\nAll in all "The Secret World" is a very well created game with a lot of time and care spent in its creation. I would highly recommend this game to any MMO player and strongly suggest that they stick with it. As each issue adds even better things to the game\n\nUpon the recent patch which changes both the combat, gear and story progression my final rating for this game has changed to\n\n10/10","February 9, 2015","true","205.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","2"

Also it is online and has horriterrimegaultrabad group content. Play it like a singleplayer game, or duo with a friend and the quests will drop your jaw.\n\nThere are no character levels in a sense, you get skill points and spend them accordingly to get a variaty of skills from the giantish skill wheel, and ability points to pump into your weapons and gear levels. It's a somewhat neat system, but it feels like it's only really there to overcomplicate the "no character levels" gimmick when in reality there are levels because you have to pump ability points into gear levels then you are rated by what level gear you are wearing. One of the main reasons why the group content is so bad, the dungeons have a recommended gear level but everyone at base gear level wants to go in asap and get carried / bring down the group.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect isn't actually that bad, but the playerbase makes it horrible. There tends to be the elitist group that doesn't allow anyone to join or even try to learn the content, then the OMGLETSGO base level players who want to get carried through all the content. The dungeons are pretty well made, focusing more on movement and awareness then mindnumbing loldps.\n\nNow the quest system is a whole new monster. The quest system is built for replayability and actually makes you think and work for it the first time through. The quests are basically placed so when you finish one quest, you should be within earshot of another to pick up, and depending on which quests you choose, your route can change when replaying areas.\n\nThe quests aren't the normal "go here" "pick this up" "defend this person" quests, these will actually make you think and make use of the in-game browser. The first area alone will make you translate latin, find secrets in paintings and artists, connect symbols to in-game items, decipher a nursery rhyme, and figure out meanings of cryptic messages. For examgle "Time is the province of Kings and Gods. The hands of time point to truths written by Kings in the words of God.  The path is opened to the enlightened." is just one of the clues during an investigation mission. All the quests in the game are also given a cooldown when finished so you can replay them and get the full xp again; so you can actually play through the same area as much as you want with no penalty, although higher level area will give better xp so you can get some of the higher tier skills easier.\n\nThe game is a bit pricey but don't hesitate to pick it up on sale for a steal. Long as you treat it like an online singleplayer game, you won't be dissappointed. The investigation missions are definitely worth it.","January 17, 2014","true","78.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

Now, on to the pros and cons.\nPros:\n+ Good graphics for an MMO\n+ Extremely immersive, it's got a great story.\n+ Great voiceovers.\n+ TONS of content.\n+ 500+ abilities to choose from and the abilities don't depend on the faction that you choose.\n+ Very enjoyable multiplayer, the community isn't very large, but everyone is extremely polite, mature, respectful and helpful. No-one is going to call you a noob or any other name if you mess up, and no-one is going to make kitchen-jokes if you play as a female character. I promise you. If you let people know you're new or having difficulties with something, you'll find that a lot of players are willing to give you the equipment they have extra and they don't need, help you set up your build, give you tips or just come and save your ♥♥♥.\n+ Extensive DLC once you've finished the main game, and they're totally worth it.\n+ Amazing investigative quests and puzzles that really make you think and depend on your overall knowledge or make you do actual reasearch online.\n+ Tying in with the last +, the game has an in-game browser, so if you get stuck, you have a bug or you want to google for dungeon strategies, you can do it in-game.\n\nCons:\n- The "fast travel" system Agartha is very inconvenient.\n- Many instances in the story mission are solo instances for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason. Most of the content is playable in co-op (and is much more enjoyable that way), but there is no reason non-faction-specific missions should be solo player.  And yet they are.\n- In-game items, boosts and modifications are ridiculously expensive to buy with respect to the money you earn doing missions.\n- Due to the fact that there aren't many players, you might find it can take quite a while to find a group for a dungeon run. It's even worse for lairs, given that you usually need over 5 players to do a lair run succesfully and it's very hard to get people of the appropriate QL together to do them. Unless you're hosting a wicked TSW party at your place.\n- The game makes you dependent on itself, so expect to spend money on DLC. You'll try to fight it. You'll cry. But you'll also feel like you need it.\n\nMeh:\n+- Combat system is a little weird at first. However, once you get used to it, it's not bad, I've seen a lot worse.\n+- I'll stick to my point about the investigation missions being amazingly thought-out, however I do find that a lot of them are not completable without the help of a walkthrough. It's cool that they think of detail and challenge, but ask yourself this - how good is your Romanian? Knowledge of Egyptian mythology and American literature? Can you correctly find the Hebrew equivalent of an Arabic word? How are you with Morse and binary codes? What about hexadecimals? Good? Congratulations, you will be able to complete the challenges with your own head. Otherwise...It's still a great challenge to correctly identify the clues and do research.\n\nAll 'n' all 11/10 would spend hours of my life on this game.","May 3","true","302.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","1"

They aren't TOO bad, but yeah, they're pretty outdated.\n- Animations are wooden and somewhat awkward. The game isn't that old, so I'd expect slightly better combat animations and smoother character models.\n- Pretty generic combat. Tab-target, mash keys, watch them trade hits until one drops dead. It isn't that boring, but in this day and age MMOs are moving towards more action-style combat.\n\n+ Great setting and theme, with all the secret societies and Lovecraftian monsters. You get to be in the Illuminati and fight Cthulhus. How awesome is that!?\n+ Engaging and unique quests. Many of them don't hold your hand and direct you to some place to kill some monsters. You have to put on your detective cap and figure things out for yourself. Figure out the code to unlock a safe, hack into computer systems, etc. Or you can pull out the wiki, but that's no fun.\n+ A huge degree of freedom in the way of character building and progression. No levels, game doesn't pin you to a class, you're able to do whatever the hell you want as long as you work for it.\n+ A deep and engrossing narrative, which seems to be the main selling point of The Secret World. The voice acting and storytelling are top-notch, and that's saying something because I'm a freak for storyline in videogames. I daresay it's on par with many of the story-heavy singleplayer RPGs of today. It's well-crafted, immersive, and absolutely mesmerizing.\n\nSo far I'm loving this game. MMOs like this are a real treat -- not a game, but a world to explore and interact with, much like Mabinogi and Guild Wars 2. At this rate, The Secret World may become my new favourite MMO. Its overall style and design is right up my alley.","January 27","true","70.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Well, that's the theory. The problem is that you won't be getting a lot of contents at max level, unless you fork up the money for the socalled Issues (content packs). As far as I know, you get the game with updates up to and including Issue #4, while the rest (currently up to #10) has to be paid for.\n\nAbout questing in this game: it has often been said that this game does not have quest hubs, quests are found when exploring. This is BS. There are certainly quest hubs, and the quest you're supposed to find while exploring, are mostly impossible to not find, since you'll either do other quests in such areas, or move though them while going somewhere else. Many quests counts as "main quests", and these have one extremely annoying issue: if you already have one, you can't get another unless you accept that the first one is cancelled.\n\nFuncom tried to make a combat system with an advanced skill-up system, but (imo) they failed miserably. Though it's not recommended, it's possible to to go through all the contents while never using more than 2 or 3 abilities/spells at any time. That why many jokes about describing the whole conbat system like this appeared: "press 1,1,1,1,1,2 - repeat and never change".\n\nSo, is it worth it?\n\nWell, not the full price. This game if often on sale here or elsewhere. If you wanna try it, grab it then. Imo, the game isn't as innovative as Funcom tries to make it sound. To begin with, it feels new and fresh, but it quickly becomes repetitive and average.

This is a game I strongly encourage you to play!\n\nDisclosures/About Me\nI've been an RPG fan ever since around 1994, when I received my first Final Fantasy game on the SNES (followed by Chrono Trigger). I've been interested in MMOs primarily for their story and gameplay components. I have a lifetime subscription to LOTRO and was active on there for 5 years. I've played bunches of other MMOS, as well. Of all of them I've played, I can say that this is the one worth getting behind.\n\nValue\nFrom a value perspective, this is a great buy. The actual games comes with tons and tons of content-- I'm ~109 hours in as of writing this review and haven't even gotten to the content not covered in the base game. The item market sells cosmetics (which you can also easily get in-game) and sell story content. This is great! As consumers, we're not being bombarded to buy meaningless junk (a la Neverwinter and, eventually, LOTRO). If there's content restrictions from the item store, it's on actual story content, and it's well worth the purchase. The developers are rewarded for creating great story content (not system unlocks or gameplay advantages), and us consumers reap the benefit.\n\nGameplay\nTSW is a nice blend of traditional MMORPGss and newer, AMMORPGS (action MMORPGs). There's dodging, but it's very straightforward and doesn't require ridiculous motor skills. The ability to play with crosshairs is a lot of fun. The gameplay is fluid and fast, and is very hard. This is a challenging game-- you won't get bored, but you also won't get frustrated.\n\nSystems\nThere aren't many systems, but the ones that are there are great. Think of your skills like cards in Magic: The Gathering. You want to build a "deck" that is as powerful as possible. There is no respect cost, and a single character can unlock every skill in the game (no classes, although you will probably end up playing the "pseudo-class" you want based on the skills you like). More like the Elder Scrolls than any other MMO I've played. Plus, each skill (there are 588, according to a source online!) can be "augmented" to change its effects. We're talking a ridiculous amount of customization, optimization, and progression. It's awesome. :-)\nWarning, though: the amount of depth and intricacy in the systems means it will take a long, LONG time to learn. That's okay. I'm still learning things, myself. You can't permanently mess yourself up, though (since you can unlock everything on a single character), and learning while you go is a part of the idea of the Secret World!\n\nStory\nThis is not a game that you should play for the main story, although it is good. Rather, the stories of the world are amazing, from Stephen King-- sorry, "Sam Krieg" to HP Lovecraft-- sorry again, "Hayden Montag". This is a living, breathing universe, and the sidequests are really the main attraction. If you're looking to power through, skip this game. If you want to be a part of something awesome and really dig into the implications, with full voice acting and lots of strings to connect, this is a great game!\n\nGrouping\nI have no idea. Sorry. I'm playing this like a single player RPG, and it's a great game for it. No need to group at all, from my ~109 hours in. I do not know if there is much group content, and if it is good.\n\nClosing thoughts\nIf you're looking for an excellent RPG to invest your time in, carve out your niche, and experience a great story, this is where you should be. Highly recommended!","November 27, 2013","true","563.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Nothing is spoonfed to you as TSW constantly requires you to think. There are tidbits of puzzles and many of the tedious quests can be challenging as you will need to find clues/hints to progress (which are not indicated with highlighted items). Some of the mobs are challenging too as they have a specific pattern you have to adapt to (think boss fights in those oldschool Asian fighting games).\n\nSome quests even require you to Google answers to puzzles. The lore is a bit jumbled up as everything is mashed up together. You'll get zombies, mages, secret societies, guns and swords in the same game. There aren't necessarily any Sci-Fi lore in the game though (ie. no aliens/technology).\n\nThe community is still bustling after a couple years which is a great sign.

I'm really torn on the game as there are elements that I love and elements that I loathe with a passion.  However, the negative elements are so mind numbingly bad that I cannot reccomend the game.\n\nLet's start off with the good.  The setting:  The Secret World takes place in the contemporary real world, except all the crackpot conspiracy theory crackpot secret society stuff actually exists.  Add to that a generous helping of Cthulhu Mythos, and you have a wonderful, interesting setting that's a very welcome break from the awfully worn out standard Tolkien-esque fantasy setting.  The Secret World also features terrific writing and great voice acting, on par with, or even exceeding, many single player games, never mind just MMOs.  It;s all rally interesting and really well done.\n\nAlso, while the game has its share of standard FedEx and Kill X monsters quests, at least they are dressed up quite well with interesting backstory and delivery.  Plus the game features some cool investigation missions where you are not guided by map markers clobbering you in the face or the game holing your hand and walking you through the steps.  Instead you need to do research, reading lore, looking up figures, checking history of places, and figure out what to do and where to go on your own. (Figuring stuff out on your own, imagine that!)\n\nSo this all sounds great and it could, and should, be a fantastic game, right?  Well then how come I gave it a thumbs down, then?  Sadly this game features some of the worst mechanics I have ever encountered in my some 30 years of gaming.  I am searching for a word to adequately express just how bad the mechanics are...  I guess "atrocious" is the best I can come up with, but I'm not sure it;s strong enough.  I cannot wrap my head around how a game was possibly made with mechanics this awful and how it made it past playtesting.  I can only guess that the person who designed the mechanics had severe brain damage and that Funcom has no playtesting whatsoever.  The combat is awful and boring, and is further marred by controls so poor and unintuitive that it makes combat maneuvering an exercise in frustration.  With enough practice you can sort of get the hang of the controls, but they will never be good or even adequate with any amount of practice.

I'm not entirely sure why; much of it was the same, although not as polished, and less forgiving.\n\nWhen the Ultimate Edition came out, with all the expansions, etc, at a discount, I figured this would be my second try.  I really have not been able to stop playing since I got it (except sleep and food, begrudgingly).  If you want a new MMO to be addicted to, this is absolutely it.\n\nPros: -Atmosphere (horror/arcane/Lovecraftian/gothic - whatever you want to call it) - it's genius\n-Combat - fast-paced, fluid, not tremendously punishing (although not a walk in the park either, which is nice).  a ton of variety\n-"level" progression - it really is very flexible.  Do what you want.\n-gear and aesthetics are completely separate.  I love that I can change clothes like I do in real life without affecting my ability to cast blood spray at zombies.  Fickle and vain.  <3\n-Story / Characters - this stuff is very well developed.  In some ways it may have worked better as a single player game, but there have been a lot of times where another person has come along to save my Dragon hide, and it was great.\n-A LOT of variety in quests.  Obviously a lot of killing and a small amount of collecting.  BUT, the investigation and stealth missions really take it up a notch compared to most MMOs I've played.  You will almost certainly need to go online to solve stuff! (built in browser).  There's also creative use of crafting during quests.\n\nCons: TBD.\nJK - I do have some cons.  My biggest thing is really just my general dislike of MMO enemies and story progression.  The constant respawning when you least expect it, the "grinding" if you have to backtrack through an area, the lack of change in an environment, even when you complete major quests.  These are not even remotely unique to TSW, but to me they are major detractors.  Remember that time you reinstalled a huge set of wards and destroyed the source of enemies in zone, progressing the plot and saving the entire institute?  No?  You can't tell because there are just as many enemies and none of the wards work after 2 minutes.  MMOs.  Womp.\n\nLeaving MMO-general issues aside, I love this game.  I really highly recommend it if you think the atmosphere/story sound even remotely cool to you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggchanting/recommended/215280/","eggchanting","Allycat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggchanting/","399 products in account","The Secret World is basically two games that when mashed together create something incomplete and unpleasant.\n\nThe story and writing are great, especially the writing. This is a game that if you take your time reading the quest fluff you'll be surprised. Okay, the story isn't THAT great afterall, but I think the setting really benefits the way things happen as you progress. Given the moment I got through the first "world" which took maybe 40 or so hours I felt great about it. The moment I went into the second "world" Egypt I felt things slipped almost immedately.\n\nThis and the combat especially are where Secret World starts falling apart. For as much as you can solve quests with knowledge (or the internet) and figuring out what this Moorse Code is pointing you towards or what these crpytic clues mean, the combat is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's clunky and requires you to have up to date gear as well as skills that are inclined to the opposite of what you're doing. That is to say, the skill system is very large and freeform and it actively hinders you if you do not follow a guide. Trying to peacemeal skills you think you want makes things take longer and fights anywhere from teeth-scrapingly close to utterly impossible.\n\nThese problems are exponential when trying to complete known "faction" quests where it expects you to have gear WELL beyond what you can conceivably have the moment they give them to you. It quite literally took me a week of off-and-on grinding to have the "right" skills and gear to even compete with the enemies I fought.\n\nWhen it hits it hits. When it misses you're sent straight up into space. Give it a try when it's cheap to experience the writing but don't expect a WoW killer when it comes to combat.","February 24, 2014","false","51.6"," 42 of 73 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","42","73","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/recommended/215280/","fluffybish","Alessondria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/","87 products in account","I give TSW an overwhelmingly positive 5 outta 5\n\nThe community is fantatsic. The support is wonderful. The payment modle is fantatsic.\n\nI like this game because there are no traditional levels and no classes. You are free to focus on building the character you enjoy. You pick two weapons to use out of 9 total and your 8 active skills revolve around those weapons. You also get to pick 8 passives. Later in the game you get access to a support weapon, of which there are 4, that has its own passive and active skill. And there are dozens of skills for each weapon type. Putting a build together like this is fun and makes you really think about how everything works together. The great thing is you can have dozens of builds all with different weapons and skills. Even different gear.\n\nTo be able to swap out your build as you need to is a HUGE awesome feature. Go from a dedicated tank to a support buffer in seconds. That's cool.\n\nThere's 2 sides to this game... one is combat and the other is missions. On the combat side there is normal PvE grinding (which I find VERY statisfying for some reason), as well as nightmare areas that have stupidly powerful enemies you should get in a good group for. There are also dungeons which are group instanced raids of various difficulty.\n\nMissions are a bit more complex. Sure there are some 'go kill things' or 'run to X and get Z' but they are done with intresting bachground. The Secret World is telling you a story in every mission you do. You get to an area and have no idea what's going on. By talking to people, doing missions, exploring the area, actually obersving the monsters behaviors, and things like this... well it all offers you a small piece to what is going on, how it came to happen, and maybe even what happened to lead up to this. But it never fills in all the gaps. And it never comes out to tell you this stuff. You as a player need to connect the dots and really pay attention.\n\nThis same theme is how the famous investigation missions are. They are like riddles or mysteries you have to figure out by doing lots of crazy things: researching a biblical theologian's works; logging into fake websites (which are suposed to be real in game); using goggle to do actual real research... its insane! And so staisfying!!! Presently I am stuck on one of these missions now. Sometimes I put a 1/2 hour into mulling over it. Sometimes I go to the RP social meet-up spot and actually role-play trying to do work on it... showing people my notes and sharing my thoughts asking for loose tips. Sometimes I take my research ideas online and surf real life counterparts to get more understanding about what the mission is about. Sure I could go to a cheat site but that would totally defeat the reason for the game! I can put the mission down and go kill things or do other more casual missions.\n\nThe other thing I adore about TSW is the cosmetics. You don't have armor. You have stuff like talismens, rings, and charms which are not shown. So every item you see someone in is just a vanity style. The game has a lot of slots for items: head, face, neck, back, chest, legs, etc... so you can buy clothing items in game and mix/ match them up.\n\nTSW is a very hardcore game and not for everyone. I am the type to role-play, take my time with things, and really enjoy a story. This lets me do that beyond my wildest expectations.\n\nSure its not perfect and I would love to see certain things added, such as player owned apartments, but its amazing as it is. If my review made you wanna try this game please friend me and I'll give you a free 3-day trial. Of course I get a little perk if you do this and buy the game, which I would appricate. I'd be glad to play with you and help teach you the basics too.\n\nI liked this game so much I spent $200 on it to become a grandmaster (lifetime membership).... but please don't be confused! The game is buy to own. There's an optional membership thingie you can get to give you special perks. If you buy the game you never have to spend money on it ever again unless you want dlc. But dude you kvae no idea just how much content is included in the basic $30 game, let alone the $60 massive edition.\n\nThis is one of my fav all time games!!! I don't play it constantly because a lot of it is very brain racking and hardcore.","July 11, 2015","true","383.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

There is little sense of progression.\nCrafting is mediocre at best.\n\nThe bad:\nStealth missions are really annoying.\nCombat animations are wooden and just look bad.\nDifficulty of monster varies wildly between push over and whoops, why am I dead?\nBalance between different skills is bad. Some are OP while other should just be avoided.\n\nThe horrible:\nMission design. This is an MMO. So I will play with a group. Why are there so many forces solo missions in this? It is incredibly annoying when you play together and frequently the game sends you into solo instances. You can't build a synergy team of characters since each one of them MUST be able to survive on their own. From a story point it makes even less sense - if our heroes have been working together on a case, why would they suddenly split up to tackle the big baddie at the end on their own?\nThis is made even more aggravating by the fact that there are missions in the main story line that you MUST complete to progress to the next zone that are solo and incredibly hard. So if you can't complete them you can't get help from anyone, you can't outlevel them and come back and try when you are stronger, because you are stuck in the same old zone and can't progress. Basically you can try over and over again until you get lucky or it*s game over. I have no idea why any MMO dev would consider this design wise. Basically you're telling the player 'you suck, we don't want your money!'\n\nYeah, I hate it, but I hate the game.","September 16, 2015","false","86.0"," 34 of 59 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","34","59","0","1"

I like the combat in this game and it was pretty easy to get used to...The only hard part was trying to figure out what skills work best with others and which passives you should equip to best compliment your build. If you're anything like me, this is very confusing but thankfully the community is nice enough to share builds that help in any stage of the game. Some of the builds work better in certain situations and you could possibly be switching builds depending on the fight ahead of you.\n\nI made it through most of the game without much help, as I am a bit hesitant to socialize with other players for fear of being classed as a noob. I just recently made it into Tokyo, however, and found out that none of my previous builds were working out for me. So I started experimenting with different builds that I found on the interwebs and still am having a hard time, especially with the boss-type enemies that have 2 different aegis shields...\n\nThe Missions in this game are very engaging. From when you click the button to start the quest to the response you get from your faction leader after you finish it. The cinematics and voice-work are very nice and you miss out on a huge part of the game if you skip and don't read/watch them. Then there are investigation missions. Before you start this game, I would recommend you buy a notebook to take notes in as even the smallest bit of information in these mission-types is a potential clue. That is, if you want to solve them by yourself. If you need a bit of help with these, there are guides on the internet that can get you unstuck or if you just don't want to waste time, can get you through the entire mission. One of my favorite sites for this is Unfair.co (I believe is the address). This site actually explains, in detail, the steps they went through to solve the missions and what hints you should look for.\n\nNow onto the RP element. This is the most disappointing part of this game for me and it makes me really sad. I love this game and in many games that I love, I love to RP. They have a pretty big RP community with a website and everything to post events. I've gone to a few of these events, and have tried to involve myself in the group. With me being a very new player to these events, it is hard to find a place to fit in. I have walked up to random people that were RPing and led with a whisper asking if they wanted to RP, to which they would usually respond yes. We would then engage in the RP which would usually end up with me RPing by myself, getting 2 or 3 word responses from the other player. After a while, I noticed that the RP community is very closed off to newer people. People only seem to want to RP with people they know and it in turn leaves me standing by the bar, sipping on a drink and ♥♥♥♥ing around on my phone, hoping someone would come talk to me since me talking to them never seemed to work.\n\nRecently on Fridays, the developers have been doing streams on twitch, playing through the different issues and answering questions from the community. I went to the latest one, which they had giveaways going on to win either Funcom points or the new Franken Chopper. I actually won the Chopper and was so excited about it. I would love to see more of these events in the future of this game. It's always amazing to see the developers get in there and interact with the players and to see them play their own game.\n\nTl;dr\nI would recommend this game to every one of my friends. From the combat to the story-telling, this game is amazing. The community is usually very helpful and the developers and GMs are also quite helpful. I haven't done any PVP but I hope to change that in the near future, when I understand the mechanics a bit better.","June 16, 2015","true","353.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

And yet something much darker lurking in the corner of your eye and seeping through the reality of the story , the present players are in over their respective heads and even the Council has little grasp on the vastness of the events at hand.\n\nClasses: THERE ARE NO CLASSES.\n\nThere are no classes at all  within this game which make it a whole different ball game than any other MMO , your equipment has statictics and following those you will perform either grandly or poorly within your assigned role .\n\nThe skill system is rich complex and deep , the fighting is hard and complex don't expect your tank to stand still in a fight facing a boss .. don't expect to stay immobile in a fight , expect to dance around the objectives , minding the telegraphs impairing the critical casts avoiding chain damaging your companions,\n\nNow the Community: As an Mmo TSW stands pretty much by its own , it is dedicated to a mature audience , most cabals (guilds) expect high repect from player to player and that is valid and enforced accross all cabals i came in touch while playing the game.\n\nOk those are the positive points:\n\nNow for the so so part : Game optimization : While TSW is a great game the client-server relationship does need a lot of optimisation , PhysX support is close to nil for most of the modern Video Cards and there are some persistent issues concerning multi threading within the game.\n\nThis game will run fine on most settings but if you run at high resolution and like DX11 in its full glory. The game at the present time does not leverage multithreading and in complex event PhysX might revert back to CPU calculation rather than leveraging the full power of your graphic's cards PhysX capabilities. This will not interfere with gameplay but during raid and evnts but is still a concern time of this review.\n\nThe GM's and Customer support at Funcom: Let me be clear the GMs will address every concern and question and will be helpful within a matter of minutes , they will not leave a stone unturned on the matter and will be nothing short of helpful within their powers.\n\nDevelopment and content delivery : If you expect timely and regularly timed end game content you might want to be patient with the company, on the other hand a beginner within the game will have a LOT to go through before reaching the end potential of his / her own character , take your time , explore around and do not ever forget to help others , i was a simple noobie once and i still go in normal mode dungeons to help new players get geared up on a regular basis. Don't close yourself up in one branch of the skills , you can learn them all and lack of specialization is something you will appreciate as you go through the content.\n\nThe bad part : Events . One word can sum them up ... LAGGGFEST .. the lack of optimization to modern multicore machines really hurts the performance of the game at the time of this writing this can be mitigated by turning off some of the effects and turning those back on when out the event zones.  There are specific channels within the community server to that extent.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed the reading and remember this is not about you being the hero this is about the story and YES it is a hugely complex intertwined storyline that will keep you at the edge of your chair at each custscene .","March 29, 2015","true","0.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","1"

Discovering you are more than human, being flung into a world of conspiracies and illusion, and becoming a demon-slaying detective are among the finest things you can do while listening to Nine Inch Nails. You get a sense of power not from levelling up and seeing numbers, but from creating an intelligent build and combat style in an impressively deep metagame. Quests are done in such a way that you do less running back and forth, and more investigating and gathering clues as to what is happening in the twisted world around you. It modernized the standard quest formula by making each quest's EXP reward much larger, and only allowing you to carry 6 at any given time. All quests are repeatable, and are turned in not by returning to the quest giver, but by simply sending in a report on your in-game phone. You feel rewarded every time you break a cypher or find that one thing that's not like the others, and not because a number popped up over your head. The fact that a developer has dared to make an MMO that challenges the player is something not to be taken for granted. This is one of the few multiplayer games out there that is willing to pit you and your mind against formiddable opponents and tell you a gripping story with each mission you undertake.\n\nGranted, the game is far from perfect. It is plagued with technical & performance issues thanks to an inefficient engine, and the graphical style looks very synthetic on all of the human characters, as though everybody in this already bizarre world is made of plastic. Fights against multiple opponents very rarely go your way, and you are punished mercilessly for being unprepared for any kind of boss event. All this, and a 40GB download is a turn-off for those of us with less than stellar internet connections, myself included. The concept of a hard, mature-themed MMO isn't an approchable one, and the game strives to reach a niche audience that just isn't quite there yet. It's an intimidating package, and lacks the mass appeal of the play-it-safe RPGs of today.\n\nIf you have an itch for mind-bending puzzles, codebreaking, and even some researching ancient history and literature, The Secret World delivers a thinking man's gameplay experience with atmosphere and writing to rival some of survival-horror's best. The art direction and storytelling are a rare find in multiplayer games, and the mature tones set the stage for more refined ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes to come after. It's an experiment worth encouraging, lest we allow MMOs to remain pathetically easy and predictable. Support this game, because risks were taken to make it the way it is and these are ideas worth spreading.","November 30, 2013","true","185.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

A refreshing take on the MMORPG genre.\n\nThe Secret World is not an MMO for everyone, and you either love it or hate it. It features a very interesting classless, leveless system in which you truley can be whatever you want to be. With numerous weapon combinations and deep character customization in terms of abilities withing those weapons, TSW makes you feel unique in your character.\n\nBut the true enjoyment of this game is not in the game mechanics, but rather the dark and beautifully crafted world in which you play in, and the deep story you are immersed in. TSW borrows elements of Lovecraftian story elements which is downright awesome as well as super mysterious. I was told when going into this game not to play it like a traditional MMO, which at first alarmed me, but after the first few missions, I saw how rich and vibrant the story was, and how I felt like a part of this fascinating world which I couldnt wait to rip apart and explore every secret and every detail. In terms of pricing I find it very generous, as many Subscriber-based MMO giants (I'm looking at your WoW) charge heavily for the base game, its expansions plus the monthly fee, whereas TSW is quite fairly priced as a base game, has very cheap DLC that in my honest opinion I would pay double for it and have no qualm, and has a subscriber system but is very different to MMO's with the same system such as SWTOR, as it merely adds cosmetics features and a shop currency allowance (Funcom Points). All in all, I give The Secret World a 9/10, and is by far one of the most enjoyable MMO's I have ever played, and I thoroughly look forward to continuing to play.\n\nTL;DR Thoroughly enjoyable MMO, evenly priced, lovely game world.","February 1, 2015","true","137.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

If you can't do that then you are simply grinding quests into oblivion. If you can do that then "you" are grinding quests into oblivion but you don't care because it is fun.\n\nNow there is a relationship between your character and what you kill. The mobs in The Secret World are reasonable. You won't see any bizzare Korean mythical hybrid-fairy mobs which you could never possibly give a damn about. Or I haven't seen any yet anyways. The first mob you encounter are locals turned to zombies.\n\nI regards to roleplaying your character the game has clothing shops in one of the major cities (London) where you can play Mr Dressup and rig out your wardrobe for which ever environment you currently questing in.\n\nThe environments of the game are present day environments. e.g. the first you get into after your starter city is a small town in Maine and the surrounding back woods. Running around the backwoods of Maine with a sledge hammer and pistols is in my opinion fun.\n\nThose two things in mind you should be able to get your character to the end of the game and if you do then your hours spent playing vs. cost ratio should be pretty good.\n\nConcerning combat: combat is pretty basic. You get seven slots to put abilities in. You can equip two main weapons. The game uses a combo point builder system similar to a rogue in other games. You build to five points and use a finisher (some finishers use less points). Of the seven combat slots you get it is most likely one will be used for a single target builder, two for single target finishers (one for each weapon), one for an aoe builder, and one for an aoe finisher. So of the seven comat slots you only really get two slots for whatever situational skills. It is likely one of them will be a healing skill. Consequently combat is pretty simple however if you roleplay your character it should be more than rather, rinse, repeat. You also get seven passives to compliment your seven combat abilities and these 14 together will constitute most of your theory crafting and the goal you set for the combination of skills you eventually want to achieve in your dream build. I would not recommend looking up a cookie cutter build in a forum while your are still doing the main quest but rather theory crafting your own otherwise it may become a mundane and anxious process.\n\nConcerning questing: quests come in a variety of types and the type of quest is indicated by a box symbol at the quest giver. There are your basic kill quests which never seem to get old. There are sort of covert ops quests where you have to try to infiltrate an area with minimal combat. These can get somewhat old but for the most part stay reasonably fresh. Same obstacles typically but spread out differently. Then there are investigation quests which are fun initially but eventually get very, very old. The investigation quests have two problems in general. The first is the are not necessarily solvable either through intuition or through a process of deduction. Often trying to solve them is trial and error or trying to discern the authors intent. The second problem is they can become quite laborious. Even if you know how to solve a particular part of a quest you can spend a good deal of time translating a piece of text from one language to another one letter at a time. These quests however typically give the most exp so if you want to put in the labor you can. Or you can simply look up the solution online which is very often what you will do which sort of spoils the quest because you are looking at what to do online and then doing it; often times again and again.\n\nThis for the most part is the secret world: questing, roleplaying, theory crafting in modern environments. I haven't reached the endgame yet but I wouldn't expect much from it. I wouldn't consider this game a race to the end(there isn't really a level cap in this game in the traditional sense. I believe your gear has a level cap) but rather a journey where you try to milk what you can out of the content. Maybe the endgame is good I don't know I'm not there.","March 8","true","178.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

To sum up the reviews I read from people ranging from 20-700 hours game time is "its good. wow sucks. TSW is free. GG."\n\nI would very much like to disagree to the popular trend of recommending this game. I have played 800+ Hours of this game. At first I was extrememly satisfied and excited to be playing. I LOVED IT! Then I just stopped loving it.\n\nI noticed quickly that if you are not playing with friends, you will likely not be playing with somebody other than yourself. The community seems so tight knit to the point of toxicity.\n\nIf you do not know exactly what you are doing on your class/abilities/build you will be sorely paying for it. PVP seems to be plagued with the 2-3 players than know EXACTLY what they are doing and in result... 1 shot everyone and everything in their way. Making it nearly impossible to have fun while still riding that learning curve. It also seems to me that the Dragon faction will rule Stonehenge and El Dorado (whatever they are called) and the illuminati will rule the Fushang Province (however it is spelled) Leaving the Templars to scrap together a rare victory on occasion.\n\nThe bag system seems to fail med game due to an increasing amount of lootables/rewards making it a 1-2 hour ordeal to clean your bags and make them viable once more.\n\nThe PVE dungeon system is a tad bit out-dated, Leaving an old school WoW feel. You either need to walk to the dungeon or be summoned there. There seems to be endless trash mobs inbetween bosses. The bosses feel like they are immensly stronger than they should be for the level you can enter the dungeon.\n\nIn conclusion, as a F2P MMORPG I would say it is a good time waster if that is all you plan on doing. I would only recommend this game to someone who wishes to waste their time.... I would NOT recommend this game to anyone looking for an enjoyable experience that lasts till the end.\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfemaledog/recommended/215280/","thatfemaledog","Det. Dicksmack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfemaledog/","654 products in account","The Secret World is an interesting title. It's very unique in it's own right while still feeling very much like a normal RPG would. TSW allows you to join under one of three different societies (Iluminati, Templar, and Dragon) and each come with their own set of story, characters, and game world hubs to explore. Outside of these faction-specific hub zones are regions. And boy, there's a lot here. The first place you'll come across is Solomon Island, which contains three distinct locations all ranging in size. The maps are massive, and there are tons and tons of sidequests, main missions, and story missions scattered about. From what I know, there are three or four different regions each containing two or three different areas to explore. Your quests all range in both gameplay style and type. So let's break them down one by one.\n\nStory Missions - This are quests that follow the main story of the game. How you play it is up to you.\n\nAction Missions - Displayed by a symbol of a man running, action missions are exactly what they sound like. This is where you get to do lots of murdering, defending against hordes, and getting into dangerous situations.\n\nSabotage Missions - Marked with the symbol of a timer strapped to dynamite, these missions are a more stealth orientated. You'll have to do such things as sneaking around enemies, cameras, and even hacking.\n\nInvestigation Missions - These missions are marked with a laptop. This, in my opinion, is the landmark mission type that sets TSW apart from the rest. Investigation missions utilize the game's world, as well as its assets, to deliver a rich detective experience. Problem solving and a keen eye for detail are a must. And, sometimes, they really push your brain to the limit. Don't look up online guides for these or you're going to ruin all the fun. Some of these quests type involve having to follow clues, or having hints dropped on you, figuring out passwords and stuff of the sort. Sometimes you actually need to hit up Google and start doing some research in order to find what you're looking for. It's that kind of immersion factor that makes you really feel like you're actually working towards something bigger and unraveling the mysteries of the world.\n\nDungeon Missions - Marked with a purple icon with 3 figures standing. Dungeons are, as you'd expect, hard. I've only played through one dungeon, and from what I can tell you pretty much go through treacherous environments that can harm you fighting multiple bosses until you finally get to the last boss. Then rewards ahoy!\n\nItem Missions - Marked with a box. These sidequests are not given by NPCs. Rather, they are objects you find around the world (such as a postal van) that grant you the choice of a side quest. They usually tie together with the main story missions.\n\nThere's another called Scenario missions. I haven't gotten a chance to play those yet, but it seems to go on a pass-fail basis depending how well you and your party performed.\n\nDespite the good, TSW has it's draw backs. For starters, don't expect a TPS experience if you choose to use guns. They play out exactly as they would in an RPG. Your skills under 1-7 are what makes your weapons work. Apart from that, the party system has two really lame issues. The first comes from a lot of quests taking place in solo instances. It renders the whole point of a party pointless when you can only advance a certain quest tier by going into a solo instance. Just as well, Funcom also decided to make a gathering loot a game of chance. Sometimes if you kill an enemy, an uncommon or rare item will appear. No one in your party is allowed to take it. Instead, a bar shows up with 3 button choices, "Need, Greed, or Pass." Choosing Greed or Need will cause you roll a di (the number goes to 100 I think). Whoever gets the highest number on their roll wins the item. It's a good system, in theory, but it's also a little annoying. I much prefer GW2's method of just having character bound drops for every member of your party. Although having this system gives off the feeling that working together with other members of different secret societies is more like a fragile alliance rather than friendship.\n\nCombat in TSW starts off really poorly. Melee weapons and Magic tend to be more offensive and do a lot of damage to enemies. And the abilities you get can really pack a punch. Guns, on the other hand, start off rather weak. And, alone, its incredibly hard to play with. It's hard to avoid getting hit because you have a very limited dodge function. You can only dodge once after, I think, a 15-20 second cooldown. This makes confrontations alone with guns rather annoying because you can never keep your distance. Once you gain new abilities you'll be a DPS machine. Of course, the way to do this is to level up and get crowd control abilities. But expect to die a lot and work your ♥♥♥ off.\n\nThe story is nothing short of a miss. The concept sounds cool, and the world is excellent. The backstory and lore stuff is really interesting. I haven't gotten much into the story, but what really breaks it for me is the writing. Cutscenes, which happen at the start of every quest given by an NPC, drag on and on. And since your character is mute, sometimes you'll just be listening to one guy blabber on about something for over 2 minutes. This wouldn't be so bad if the writing wasn't so laughably awful. Characters tend to reference stuff that exists in real life, and make pop culture references left and right. Seriously, the head honcho of the Iluminati compares the organization to XBOX but "more hardcore." What does that even MEAN? There was a secret man who was well spoken but would occasionally drop meme bombs like, "all your cameras are belong to us," and "I am disappoint." These quips don't get me immersed in the story. Rather, they suck me out of the immersive experience. I get that the game is set in modern times and in our world but referencing stuff that exists in real life causes players to think about real life and that breaks immersion.\n\nTSW originally started off as a subscription-based game. That was dropped once the sales were too low. Now you can just buy the game and play forever. However, the game does have an item store. This store contains various items like clothing, boosters, weapon moulds to give your weapons a cooler look, pets, accessories, etc. You will have to drop some cash if you wanna make your character look like a badass. Thankfully though everything is reasonably priced. Special outfits only cost a little under $10, and bits and pieces of clothing run you about 50 cents to 2 dollars a pop.

This subscription model grants you 1200 funcom points a month, as well as veteran points for more exclusive items, a special item of the month, and other various bonuses. I don't know how much of an advantage it gives. But I've been playing without it and I seem to be doing okay. Even if I am dying quite a bit.\n\nIn conclusion, TSW is a blast.

I am still not sure at this point if TSW is taking content directly from Lovcraft's stories or just drawing HEAVILY on them. Regardless, the early parts of the game feel like they would be right at home between the pages of his book. The enemies in the game are pretty different from what you would find in other mmos, at least visually. They aren't repeated so much as to feel stale, but they share enough common themes that you can look at a mob and know roughly what you'll be up against.\n\nNow for the meat of the game; Do you like class systems? Do you crave adhering to a set of archetypes; playing a sword and board fighter or a swift rogue? Well tooo bad, this game abandons the class system, instead allowing you to specialize in certain weapons, from the hard hitting shotgun to the protective embrace of blood magic's barriers, this game has a little something for pretty much any playstlye (Don't worry meatheads, you can still hit things with sticks). Just because there's no class system doesn't mean that you can't play as a tank, or dps or whatever. In fact, where most MMOs or RPGs would restrict you to choosing one, TSW allows you to mix and match 7 abilities, 7 passives, and 2 weapons. Like the passive from the fist tree that ups your crit chance by 15% but don't wanna get your hands dirty in melee combat? Feel free to use it with your fancy assualt rifle. There are a total of 9 weapon types. Each weapon has 2 'inner' paths that must be maxxed out to access the 6 outer paths. Each path has a mix of 7 abilities and passives. I don't think I need to do the math to tell you that there are a ton of options for kitting out your character. All in all the skill system in this game is easy to use and let's you make a character that is uniquely yours.\n\nThe only real problems with this game are as follows:\nIt suffers from the same problems as most MMOs:\nQuests can get repetitive (Kill 10 of enemy x) although there are plenty of interesting quests availible.\nBecause it's an MMO, story doesn't feel as important or persona.\nGroup play is required for a full experience, which  I guess is par for the course for mmos.\nThere aren't a whole ton of people playing. I don't know if that is because I chose a low population server? Or if it is just because the game is less than popular, but it can get a bit lonely, and a bit difficult to find friends to raid with if you didn't bring your own.\n\nSome random good stuff about the game:\nDungeons/Raids don't just have a stupid amount of enemies followed by a boss, instead they have a ton of bosses followed by a super boss. This means you don't have to wade through slightly stronger versions of the enemies you've already been fighting! It also means more drops!\n\nAll main quests are fully voice acted apart from your character, some of the people are interesting, I particularly liked the  native american guy and his disinterested teen niece playing chess and mangling metaphors while hordes of Ak'Ab and Draug overran the Town.\n\nEnemies are interesting. Sure you start out fighting zombies, which I guess are pretty common, but pretty soon you'll be fighting things like wendigos, fish people, and weird giant bug things!\n\nThe game is fun. I am normally not a person who enjoys the bland washed out feeling of mmos. But this game did it for me.\n\nThere are mission types which require no combat, and mission types that require honest to god problem sovling, critical thinking, and an awareness of lore! Note that Funcom has set up websites that you need to visit and explore to solve certain quests. Holy ♥♥♥♥! That took me for goddammed ever to figure out.\n\nInstead of armor deciding your look, you get to choose what your character wears. Defensive stats are derived from occult talismans and lucky chamrs instead of pieces of metal or cloth.\nSorry for the rambly-ness of this review, but I hope I get my point accross. Game is gut, it's only 30 bucks, it's worth the money.","January 24, 2015","true","30.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If not it's best to look elsewhere.\n\n---MORE INFO---\n\nDungeons are extremely fun and among the best I've played in any ♥♥♥♥♥♥me so far. Community is also among the best and is very welcoming and helpful to newcomers. Be sure to /chat join sanctuary when you log in. As I mentioned before, combat is a bit clunky and slow and it can be a bit easy to screw up your build. They added decks a while back that make it easier to follow a certain skill path that can fit what your looking for. Quests are spectacular and are not your typical MMO fare. Some of them are actually quite intellectually challenging and will have you solving puzzles and using the in-game browser to research information. The lore is also very deep and if your big on sinking yourself into a good story, there's lots to find here. End game unfortunately doesn't seem to be very big, it's more about the journey then the goal in this case.\n\nAll in all, TSW is a niche title that will satisfy a certain subset of players. If what I said sounds good to you then it is definitely worth a shot. You may request a trial key over on the official forums (or here, on steam) just to try it out and see if it is for you.

What impress me really much, was choice of weapons. You can choose between magic focus (blood, elementalism, chaos), melee weapons (hammer, sword, fists) or ranged weapons (pistols, shotgun, assault rifle).\n\n\nDark days are coming.

I played quite a bit of world of warcraft and while it has a lot of end-game content, the questing was typically extremely boring because each quest played the same way. The secret world has a lot of variety in quests (Called missions), there are story missions, combat missions, sabotage missions and research missions. The game itself is based on real world myths and mythology and the research missions showcase this the best. You use an in-game internet browser often to research specific subjects. It can range from relatively simple puzzles to huge research undertakings. Story missions are specifically related to the overall story arch, combat missions are more like traditional quests that you'd expect in an mmo, sabotage missions revolve around usually stealing intel or destroying points of interest without being spotted.\n\nAs far as combat goes, it's responsive and pretty fun to play. There are no classes, instead there is an ability wheel that you can unlock entirely. You are restricted by your hotbar, which you can equip a single set of passive/active abilities restricted further by the weapons you equip. My only real complaint is that typically if you want to do PVE dungeons as DPS, you will have a difficult time in the high end dungeons compared to ranged dps.\n\nThe game has no subscription, it relies upon expansions (called issues) which add more areas and missions to the game, as well as lots of cosmetic options.\n\nAnd last but not least you can play as the Illuminati, Templar, or Dragon. While many mmorpgs have a 2 faction world, the secret world has 3, which all work together except in PVP scenarios.\n\nEven with a somewhat lacking/restrictive endgame PVE, I managed to spend 300 hours playing this game before reaching the end of the main storyline (not including any of the DLC).

For every civilization that has existed there are people who work behind the scenes making it tick, or toil. Behind them is the mystery that reaches into places we've never been or even imagined. Danger lurking and the unknown beckoning you to investigate. Dig too far and you might end up buried and forgotten or you might learn what few do. Imagine a world where everything that you thought was not real existed, man and monster. All of those mystical places each with their own calling. Do you join or not and if you do, then who? Enter yourself into The Secret World.\n\nThe Secret World is a mature themed MMO right out of a graphic novel. It involves mysteries of the kind that you'd not likely imagine and characters and worlds beyond. Its graphical features are truly amazing as are its cut scenes, dialog, script and voice talent, all of course mature rated. This is the MMO that I've been waiting for a long time and it fits the bill perfectly. I cannot give away much more than to say that if you've ever been curious and found that you had a unique calling, you need to experience it.\n\n- It is great as a multiplayer experience though it is not required to enjoy the quests as they scale to team member count.\n\n- The music, atmosphere, voice acting and cutscenes are all top notch and yes it does have them but they are part of the narrative to the rich story this game possesses. This adds to the overall experience so this is more than just a loot grab. This has a story and a background. Something that you can learn from if you pay attention. Like a good movie or book it is a testament to the artform of great story telling though you are the story as it develops.\n\n- This is not a money grab in terms of it being an online game with F2P aspects. You pay up front for the client and it comes with a great deal of adventures and experiences. You can play the whole game without buying a thing in the store but there is a point to the online store, that helps but it is not required to enjoy the game. You be be just as powerful without purchases as you can with, its just a matter of how quickly you progress and how cool you look (vanity). Vanity as we all know in online gaming is becoming its own artform and expressive language.\n\n- There are multiplayer quests and dungeons that benefit from team work, but they are optional quests that do not detract from the main story line. Optional.\n\n- The worlds to explore are huge and with so many quests that you will likely miss many along the way so the replay value is high as is the play style.\n\n- Decks are a system of building your character according to archetypes that benefit your character in different aspects plus providing a cool look for your character and other archetype specific gear. A great idea reminiscent of class kits in dungeons and dragons.\n\n- It benefits from team play for sure as you can level much faster as a team. When teaming as I've mentioned, the quests and scale in difficulty so the gameplay doesn't become easier but requires team work.\n\nDid I say atmosphere? This game is oozing with atmosphere in so many aspects it is incredible. If you are a fan of the X-Files or Coast 2 Coast, you want to play this though it is not really a conspiracy theory type game but delves into the mysteries of the unknown for certain.\n\nIf you decide to open the door to investigate further, I highly suggest taking the time to look over the decks system involved in picking a predefined archetypal role for your character as there are benefits.","October 1, 2014","true","66.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, it is not without its flaws...  Poor optimisation (especially DX11) chiefly amongst them.  But the fact that I am a huge fan of Lovecraft alone bypasses that.\n\nBut the game itself?  Very few games have been made where you don't 'have' to do much combat.  Especially MMO's...  In fact, the games combat is fairly bog standard tbh...  It uses the tried and tested formula (mostly, there are also area attacks that deviate from this) of clicking on a mob and pressing number keys to kill them.  But, active dodge and moving during charge attacks at least livens it up a bit.\n\nBut the game comes into its own with the investigation missions.  I recall one in particular, quite early on, where you find a van with some ID in it and have to use an actual website to search for clues.  I'd never seen this in a video game before, so it kinda blew my mind a bit.  A game incorporating things outside of it's programming...  Not really seen it since either to be honest!\n\nBut, some of the investigations take minutes or hours, by hearsay, I've also heard some people can spend days on some...  So, not always to be taken lightly.\n\nAnother fantastic point is the 'class' system.  Or, lack of one at least.  Buying skills and making a usable skill set out of them means an amazing amount of diversity.\n\nThe size of the game is impressive also.  I believe I paid £15 back when I got it in a sale and out of it, so far at least, I have gotten almost 100 hours.  That's not bad going really...  I've barely even made any headway, out of all that time, I am still on the first area, yet to explore the rest of the game...\n\nI can't comment on PvP however, as I have not tried it yet.\n\nAll said and done though, it's a much slower pace than most modern MMO's, so if you're used to the likes of WoW (not meant to sound like a hit at the game as I do still play it), where you do a few quests, then move on to the next area after an hour or two, this may not be for you.  Like wise if you like structured classes that immediately declare what 'role' you will play.\n\nBut on the whole, I would recommend this to anyone.  Especially those who are interested in games with deep, interesting lore and also any fan of H.P. Lovecraft.  For the latter, it really is a must.","November 10, 2014","true","149.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

But it's got an oddly satisfying single player storyline that touches almost every major and minor conspiracy mankind has come up with, and brings it to life.\n\nAs an MMO, it's kind of bad.

The game's first (non-tutorial) zone, for example, features using local Native American magic and the favour of the god Thor to help the Illuminati and an expy of Stephen King fight Viking zombies dredged from the deep by Cthulhu-esque horrors, summoned by Loki using Aztec blood magic and the sword Excalibur, as part of a plot to bring about Ragnarok by stabbing a giant black cube-thing which is part of the machinery of Gaia. Things just get weirder from there.\n\nThe story, cutscenes, characters, and dialogue in this game are, in my opinion, the best in any MMO currently out there, and it's one of the only MMOs I've played through multiple times solely for the story. This is definitely TSW's strength; this, and a particular type of quest the game has, called Investigation Missions, which will... well. There's an in-game browser for a reason, and I sure hope you like looking up Egyptian heiroglyphics and Hebrew plagues on Wikipedia, because you will be.\n\nThey're the good parts.\n\nUnfortunately, then there's the rest of the game. TSW's mechanics are, in my opinion, as terrible as its writing is amazing. Mechnically, it's a tedious, frustrating grind that gives the illusion of choice in character building, but is ultimately so poorly balanced that I really hope you're playing the one spec that's actually useful because otherwise you're going to be spending an awful lot of time in the graveyard. (Slight disclaimer: all of this game's gameplay is built around groups. Though it's possible to solo--and I have--it is exponentially easier to complete with even just one other person along for the ride.) Not to mention that, once the story is over, the gear grind begins and, well. It's a gear grind. I hope you like raiding!\n\nThere are going to be people who love TSW's mechanics, and more power to them (they're the sorts of people who like to use words such as "oldschool" and "hardcore" to describe their MMO playing). I'm not one of them. So take the last paragraph with a grain of salt.\n\nMechanics aside, I have a lifetime sub to TSW and I don't regret it... but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, either.","October 31, 2014","true","195.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","6","8","4","0"

However, after you findout how in-depth the skill tree really is, it opens up ridiculous amounts of possibilities. They need to have respecing available though just incase you ♥♥♥♥ up bad on your skill tree. You feel rewarded after playing though unlike many other MMO's (After the first hour or so).\nThere are two skill tree's in the game. One for Skill points (What level of weapons and armors you can use) and ability points (What abilities you can do). The amount of experiance to fill the experiance bar does not change through out the game, however, the number of skill points and ability points does for better abilities and stronger skills.\nYou earn 1 skill point for each time you fill up the experiance bar. And as the experiance bar is divided into three sections, you also earn 1 ability point for filling up each section of the bar. Some people might ask why this would even make sense to do this. The reason is because they want to be innovative. A more rewarding system. Instead of getting 1 skill point for killing a billion enimies for doing 10 long ♥♥♥ quest's, you earn a bunch of ability points to spend along with skill points which makes the game feel much more rewarding.\nIf you stick to the game and choose a weapon that you think you'll enjoy using, you're much more likely to enjoy the game.\nLet's say that you want to use the assult rifle as a weapon, but also you want to use blades and you're stuck between the two, why not choose both?? You can have two weapon that you use where you can mix their abilities together to kick some major ♥♥♥!\nI would reccomend this game, esspecially if it goes on sale again.","January 23, 2014","true","22.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The quests are a bit more challenging - especially the investigation ones - Hope you like googling Latin :)\n\n\nThe storyline itself is what keeps me playing, I have not skipped a single video sequence - quite a rarity for me. Even the mission/quest vids help the storytelling along by setting the appropriate drama/horror feel.\n\nIt is quite an intrigiuing storyline, although each of the "Chapters" seems to independant of each other. Each Chapter storyline is never truly "wrapped up 100%" so that you are always left wondering if there is going to be more content to keep fleshing out that particular section.\n\n\nI also like the "open class" system, a lot of variety to "play your way" instead of being restricted to specific builds. The ability to Load and Save your preferred combinations is a great idea and allows flexibility for gameplay.\n\nIt is easily solo-able with a number of different healing "weapons" available to create a survival build, although in the early sections if you can pump out enough damage, you can usually stay alive against all but the larger mobs.\n\n\nAnd the best thing?? No subscription and no crippled Pay-to-Play interface like SWTOR.\nAll of the game content is available to play, with DLC addons availble (callled "Issues" )\n\nIn my opinion, is one of the better models for Free-to-Play out there, as it has survived remarkably well against other titles that went free-to-play.\n\n\nRegarding 5-man dungeons - I recommend ALWAYS playing as a DPS. Tanking and healing are a pretty big deal and you have to be geared in a very specific way. You will also cop it from the whole group - as you won't be able to finish the dungeon if you aren't set up properly. Best left to the more experienced players until you start reading the forums on how to gear correctly for the roles.\n\n\n\nAll in all I give this game 9/10.\nFor what this game provides, it is highly entertaining and keeps me coming back to play it.\nMore fun in a group, but easily played as a solo with a bit of forethought.\nOnce again, not amazingly graphically stunning, but I don't need all the "pretties" to have fun playing a game.\n\n\nRead below only if you would like to know a little more about the paid DLC available for The Secret World ("Issues") that can be bought in-game\n\n\n***UPDATED September 2014***\n\nI have recently purchased the additional "Issues" and am really enjoying the new storyline content.\n\n********CONTAINS SPOILERS*********\n\n\nIssue #5 was full of great additional storyline - great narrative from "Tyler Freeborn" and a great spooky ending.\n\n\nLoved the Indiana Jones ripoff quest (with Ark of the Covenant, rolling boulder and the new Whip auxilliary weapon) in Issue #6\n\n\nIssue #7 was very tongue-in-cheek with numerous "spy film" references and tropes.\nThe action was great and I finally got to ride my own vehicle, A Snowmobile! ( if only for about 4 minutes lol)\nThe storyline was in-depth and intriguing and I enjoyed the "reveal" near the end (although I had already kind of guessed)\n\nPlus you get the Flamethrower aux weapon, what's not to like!!!\n\n\nIssue #8 I am not really a fan of so far. I may change my mind later on, but it defintely feels like it is filler content.\nI'm guessing Funcom was pressured to make more end-game content, so they came up with 3 grindy "Scenario simulations" that you can play repeatedly at different levels of difficulty.\n\nMy guess was players wanted something to play while their Nightmare Dungeon runs were on cooldown. Unfortunately, the scenarios have cooldown timers as well!!\n\nI purchased a Tokyo pass from a vendor, which delighted me that I did not have to grind the scenarios for it ( I believe you need to purchase the Sidestories: Further Analysis to be able to do this)\n\n\nIssue #9 TOKYO!! A whole new area with an additonal level of difficulty.\n\nAll enemies now have "shields" and you have to match your damage type (AEGIS) to that particular shield type to be able to damage it.\n\nThe major drawback is that swapping between the 3 AEGIS damage types while in combat will disable your ability to attack for 5 seconds while you change them over!!!\n\nI found Tokyo quite challenging, even the trash mobs tend to kill you if you arent prepared (eg having the right AEGIS powers equipped beforehand)\n\nThe quests were quite entertaining and now that the "Pagan Sidestories" have been released, there is even more content to play in Tokyo before Issue #10. (Issue #9 without the Sidestories was a little sparse on repeatable quests)\n\nUnfortunately as this area is purely end-game content, "grindy" elements have come into play\n- repeating the missions to purchase upgrades for your AEGIS powers and grinding mobs to upgrade the "research" levels on the AEGIS controllers.\n\nOnce again, some great pop-culture references from some of the NPCs made me laugh quite a lot.\nCan't wait for Issue #10 now.","September 22, 2014","true","762.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was very surprised by this MMO and originally did not think I'd ever play it. Thanks to a Steam flash sale, I purchased the massive edition (with a few extras thrown in and some of the expansions.. called Issues, btw) for my brother and myself and tried it out. It's fascinating and unique. Edgy voiceover dialogue and discussions, pretty involved quest/story lines, class-less/level-less system, nicely rendered atmospheric environments all in a modern/urban setting. Funcom did well with this so far. There's a slight learning curve and might not be the easiest or the best game to start with for an MMO newcomer. For newcomers or vets alike, stick with it. The community seemed mature, decent and helpful (at least on the server we chose). And we saw our fair share of players running around in the starting areas, the travel nexus (called Agartha), and the first mission zone we were travelling in. There were default notifications about activity in the PVP territories too, so it seems like the game (at least on our server pick) has a decent amount of traffic and population.\n\nGraphics (8-9) - DX9/11 support, FXAA, tesselation, good graphics options for the workhorses and the slow ponies. Some character models are nice looking and some are just ugly (like SOME of the NPC's.. good lord, comb that hair)\n\nFun (9) - Puzzles, engrossing questlines, decently fleshed out NPC's, class-less/level-less, fashion options.. wide variety of playstyles supported\n\nSound (8-9) - Fully voiced NPC dialogue/cutscenes, Random NPC voice chatter, good atmospheric mood background music, appropriate sound effects, nothing fancy tho\n\nCommunity (8-9) - Decent population sampling for areas we've explored, specific chat channels set up for things like "Mission Hints", etc. and rather helpful, mature, decent chatter in the channels\n\nPerformance (8) - I have settings turned up to Ultra on my semi-beast of a machine. I got the occassional lag in some areas, that I haven't quite isolated as graphics lag or connection lag. I'm leaning towards graphics lag due to the area I was in\n\nValue (8-9) - B2P (pay for the game, don't have to pay a monthly subscription fee). There's optional membership sub for added bonuses, there's an item shop you can buy things with cash (mainly cosmetic fluff and some value-added consumables), I got massive edition for a steal on a flash sale during the summer sale 2014, but overall the pricing is good with all that's included compared to other MMOs\n\nService (8) - The account management site is a little outdated and piggybacks off the old AO account management look and feel.. not very informative or user friendly and can be confusing at times. But you don't spend alot of time in there so I won't penalize the score too much.\n\nVERDICT: So.. to sum it up, I'd give this a 8-9 out of 10","June 30, 2014","true","109.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The setting feels refreshing and new, the story is well played and the limit on the amount of quests you can have at a time allow that story to be noticed (til this day i can shamefully say i have no idea what the story is about in WOW). the fact that there is no leveling or even a class system is a very bold move for an MMO and kinda shows ESO how this system should've been implemented in some sort, as thats how Elder Scroll games are supposed to be, yes skyrim is the only one with absolutely no class system but even earlier elder scrolls titles gave you the option to create your own class to your liking, which is what TSW does very well. also one thing you either love or hate is the option to change and reassign set skills, to hardcore rpg or mmo players, having those choices engraved forever means you have to choose wisely and level your toon very carefully, that is the challenging factor that makes a good game, however the other end adds flexibility for newbies, and expands ever changing features where you wouldnt have to start a new toon to experience said features. The games graphics are rather poor for a post 2010 game, however this is where accessibility is brought into the picture. Realistically, not everyone has a top of the line computer, so with that said it can run on most PCs. Now since im fairly new to this game (but not to the MMO genre) i didnt experience that many bugs in the game, so its fairly polished at this point, but i did hear horror stories in the beginning.\n\nOverall this game is a great MMO, its combat is an "either you love it or hate it" situation, Graphics are poor but not terrible, its not perfect and to some it might be dull, but if youre tired of playing MMO's that desperately copy the WOW formula or are in a over-used J.R.R. Tolkien cookie-cutter fantasy, then give it a shot, if youre still not convinced, wait for it to go on sale","November 13, 2014","true","51.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If I had to choose a favourite style of character progression in an MMO, I'd go with the old school 'Ultima Online' approach, where your skills develop as you use them.  (Well, actually they had that in some MUDs well before MMOs but let's not get bogged down on details).\n\nThe Secret World simply rewards you with Ability Points (used to learn skills) and Skill Points (learned to get stronger) .. hmm, writing that down it sounds weird .. but anyway, you get the points and have the freedom to spend them anywhere .. the game has an ability wheel that is in many ways strange and counter-intuitive, but when you work it out, it's good.\n\nThe game makes a strong first impression, but then, as you step toward mid-game, starts to wane a little .. so I think most players are either:\n\nDabblers - new players giving it a go\nCitizens - folks who have had their dabble and powered through, or went away and came back (like me)\n\nWhen I returned to the game after my dabble, I suddenly 'got' it.  I understood the mechanics better and was a LOT more successful in my play - and once you hit that point where you're comfortable with the mechanics, the game becomes really quite cool indeed.\n\nGive it a dabble.

We did a lot of talking and kept turning down missions because they were all ranked as too hard (which they were not). At the time, pre-steam nearly 2 years ago, it was bugged too, zombies popped up next to you whereever you were, like in the middle of a conversation.

The repetitive quests age is over and you will not find a lack of things to kill or puzzles to solve. And when I say puzzles, I don't mean "light the pillars in the correct order", I mean translate “Clavis Aurea” from Latin which means "Golden Key", go back to City Hall you wandered through on that other mission, grab the giant key on the wall, bring it back, and see if it opens the door. In simpler terms, you will never have to worry about having to go kill 10 monsters for this NPC and then 15 for the next.\n\nThe Secret World is also a classless game, you aren't stuck playing the fighter or rogue. However, you must be careful what abilities you invest in, because there isn't a reset potion. Which means if you invest 500pts in swords and then decide you want to wield a gun instead, you can't relocate those points and will be weaker with the guns against tougher monsters unless you go back to a easier area. That's not to say you'll get bored with the sword, but it does make you question where to put each and every point you gain.\n\nAll and all, it’s a good MMO and well worth the onetime payment. If MMOs are your thing (and you like the World of Darkness/Cthulhu feel) I would recommend giving The Secret World a shot.","January 29, 2015","true","120.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Secret World is a special game, a truly unique and rare beast. You will most probably either fall in love with it and become obsessed, or you will hate it and never want to think about it again. If I had to describe it in a single sentence I'd say that it's like an old shop hidden in an obcure part of town that is full of antique treasures as well as cheap forgeries. There is magic and beauty to be found, and there is the mundane and ugly.\n\nIn a way it destroyed other MMOs for me completely. The lore and atmosphere are absolutely unmatched in the "genre" and have little competition in gaming as a whole. It is one of the few games which you can call "mature" and there are a few reasons for that. Gameplay mechanics and group content don't lend themselves to mindless smashing. Hardcore puzzles demand brain power of a seasoned adventurer and scholar. Dark subject matter and numerous popcultural references cannot be appretiated without familiarity with at least some classic books and movies, which usually comes with age. I have never encountered a childish behaviour from any of the players. Even young or less patient people seem a bit nicer than in your usual MMO and you can feel a sense of wonder emanating from them.\n\nHow you react to what The Secret World has to offer depends very much on your gaming and... yes, I'm gonna say it... life experience. If you are seeking a virtual place you can inhabit and keep coming back to, that can be a catalyst for unique social interactions and gaming experiences no matter how much of the content you have cleared, The Secret World is very likely a game for you. If you are a kind of MMO player that values super-polished gameplay, meaningful loot drops and item progression with attractive, repeatable end-game content above all other components, you will be gravely disappointed.\n\nIt's not to say that there's no good loot/grind to be found. I ran group "dungeons" countless times and for some weird reason I still want to do more of them, even though I never liked repeating the same content over and over in other MMOs. "Dungeons" are among the best you can find in online games today - locations are beautiful and atmospheric, enemy encounters are interesting and demanding. I aknowledge however that many people will find the amount of group content to be lacking.\n\nYour enjoyment also depends on how much are you willing to invest. Steep learning curve, importance of logical thinking and puzzle-solving skills coupled with an overwhelming collection of skills and gameplay that's never broken but only solid at best can scare many potential players. However you can make a really strong argument that those are the game's big strengths, keeping impatient people and "kids" out, while giving more demaning players meat they can sink their teeth into. I for one, though not much of a puzzle-solver, really appreciated ancient mysteries that had to be cracked and eventually became familiar with the complex skill system.\n\nThe Secret World wants you to observe, listen and think. To let go of the real life and immerse yourself in its dreamlike vision. Yes, it will frustrate you many, many times, but its shortcomings always stem from its desire to engage more than just your fingers on the keyboard, but also your mind, personality and imagination.","March 6, 2015","true","12.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story is a unique blend of action, adventure, and horror, and I can promise you that you’ll never be bored if that’s your kind of thing.\n\nThe gameplay is unique in the fact that you can play all the major roles on the same character. This means ideally that you only need one character in the game – but they still give you three slots if you want one character for each faction. You have to pick and choose your build, only having a select number of ability and passive skill slots at any given time. It makes you think, and you have to adapt to different situations.\n\nSo far the game has a lot of replay value in the dungeon content, along with the ability to repeat any mission you’ve done. They also have some really cool season specific events around Halloween and Christmas which make the atmosphere even better.\n\nAs for end game content, I’m still working my way in getting there.

There's plenty of skills to choose from, so you can mess around with different combinations. Quests for this game is very interesting and some are pretty hard if you don't look up a guide to it. If you can find some awesome people to play with, this game will go a long way for you.\n\nYou choose from one of the three factions: Templars, Dragons, and Illuminati. Each faction is against each other in PVP but in the PVE world you are all together. The server you pick only matters for PVP aspect of the game as you will be able to play with everyone for PVE. Cabals which are the guilds in this game are faction specific, so if your a Templar you can't make a cabal with your Illuminati friend. The biggest downside to this game is the player base. Even with all the servers being able to play with each other, there are times where it is dead.\n\nPros:\n- Lots of skills to play with\n- Lots of weapon choices\n- Lots of unique quests\n- Storyline is pretty interesting (different for each faction, Illuminati is the best in my opinion haha *eye in the sky*)\n- Dungeon bosses gain different abilities depending on difficulty\n- Can unlock everything on 1 character (weapons and skills)\n\nCons:\n- Community is dwindling\n- Combat system is not for everyone\n- PVP unbalanced (normally 1 faction dominates, depends on the servers your grouped with)\n- Dungeon/Raids get repetitive\n- Slow updates\n- Gotta buy "Issues" for some new content (not really a bad thing since your supporting the game but it might not appeal to everyone)\n\nIf you meet anyone from my Cabals Lachesis, Atropos or Clotho, they are some awesome people :D Unfortunately I have not been playing the game for a while now.\nPS: Beware of Sliggity he's a therapist.","February 2, 2013","true","111.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Secret World strengths are in its missions. Missions now take research and all no longer just simple "fetch" quests. Some investigative missions actually use external game assets, like browsing Google to find a certain game related websites. These kinds of ideas are innovative and really provide the player a sense of immersion.\n\nThe Secret World is a very challenging MMO and does have a learning curve. Not having a level cap is a hard concept to grasp when playing for the first time. Since the player can basically have all the skills in the game, its hard for a new player to decide what starting skills would be beneficial for early game. Personally, I did not do any research on skills and leveled Shotgun to start out. I soon realized during my first dungeon encounter that some boss uses a good number of Area of effect spells, basically causing me a lot of deaths and very little DPS. My recommendation for a new player is to decide early on the type of player you would like to be (Damage, Healing, Tank) and research what skills would be the best for these roles for early in the game. But, since this game does not have a dedicated class system, players can change skills on the fly to meet the needs of the encounter. Again, great flexibility and innovation.\n\nIn my 50 hours of gameplay, I did notice some difficulty scaling issues. Without prior research, its hard to determine if the player has the power to survive the encounter. I noticed this while primary completing the story quest and have come to a point where I need to complete other missions for skill points to level up my health and damage. Again, this is due to the fact I went into this MMO without prior knowledge. The Secret World forums has a great write-up on how monsters difficulty is determined based on the estimated power of the player.\n\nThe Secret World is a fun and challenging MMO and is recommended for any players looking for a flexible and different experience than any other current generation of MMO's.\n","November 26, 2013","true","131.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Anywho, The Secret World is a mashup of just that, along with strange myths and legends, and secret societies that you get to take a part in (LIKE THE ILLUMINATI!!!).\n\nAt first it sounds a little odd because it's set in modern day, but I can assure you that it's a welcome change of pace from the Fantasy and Sci-Fi setpieces that other games have. The story is fairly straight forward, you pick your faction, and develop your character from that point on. As my main, I was able to chose two starting abilities, the first being the ability to use an Assault Rifle and a Sword; which was awesome because the way in which it's presented to you.\n\nI think most of my fondness for the game comes from just the mystique of the world and factions. There is just so much lore that you want to discover because it takes on all of those myths, and conspiracy theories that are so entertaining to read about already. So props to the developers for taking on something that I don't even think anyone else has taken on (to my knowledge), technically they're lore is already made for them.\n\nBut as cool as The Secret World is the graphics and animations can be a little stiff at times, making it kind of dated, but if you have a decent PC you should be able to up the settings. The UI is also kind of cumbersome to use, it's a little bit all over the place, and not very straight forward. In other games, things kind of come to you intuitively, but here you have to sort of test things out to see if they work. Which brings me to my next point, questing.\n\nQuesting can be great if you get the hang of things, but it was so bothersome seeing so many just all over the place. I'm fine with games making plenty of content available, but I think that the harder missions should have been locked away from sight until the player reached the apropriate level; I saw way to many HARD or VERY HARD quests that I wanted to take on but really couldn't because I kept dying or I just didn't want to bother, which bothered me because it felt like a waste leaving quests there open.\n\nOh, the other thing is that dying isn't normal either. When you do die, your spirit gets respawned at a point and you have to run to your body to revive them. Strange I know, but it works for the universe  - though after a while it might be annoying for some people\n\nOverall The Secret World is an odd gem, it has a lot going for it's strange premise and the concepts are all there to back it up. I really have been enjoying my time playing the game, aside from the few problems I had. The Secret World is an easy reccomendation, and if you decide to play the game, it's best to do it with friends since the experience will be a tiny bit better; again it's not your typical MMO, approach it as a game like DIABLO or DESTINY.\n\nMADE FOR: People who love conspiracies and the secret societies surrounding them.\n\nNOT MADE FOR: People expecting a full blown MMO in the same vein as say World of Warcraft.\n\nTHE SECRET WORLD\n8/10","September 29, 2015","true","28.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If it sounds interesting, there are usually other players giving away free trial keys in the forums. That's how I played for my first few days until I decided I would get it. It's a very good MMO (haven't tried the pvp) but its a little different from other ones. Usually you end up grinding quests all day until you're max level. This is still done sort of; everyone has the story mission for their character, but players may only have one main mission and three side missions, so grabbing everything like in other MMOs isnt allowed.\n\nWhile the combat isn't as great as Elder Scrolls Online, these missions are the highlight. Most seem to involve traveling and combat, but there are also stealth missions (don't let the cameras see you) and detective missions (solve everything yourself). For example, (spoilers for one quest of the game hehe) one of the missions was called The Kingsmouth Code and it was a detective mission. I thought it would be pretty simple and something would show up on the map telling me where to go. That didn't happen. Instead I followed clues until i got stuck. The next clue was hidden on the back of a painting like in the DaVinci Code, and the clue said something like "the hands of time point to truths written by kings in the words of God." uh.. ok cool. So I started clicking everything in sight. All I saw that could be a clue was a clock with the hands at 10:10. I had no idea what to do next, so I had to find help on this one. It turns out I was supposed to use a search engine (B brings up a browser in game) and I had to look up the passage "Kings 10:10" from the bible and it would give me a hint for where to go next. That is insane. I expected the game to hold the player's hand too much and I didn't even consider this. Go kill 20 boars... hah. World of Warcraft what were you thinking?\n\nThe areas are a little different as well. You start out by choosing a faction: Illuminati, Templars, or Dragon (it's a group not an actual dragon, I was a little disappointed too). Depending who you choose you'll start out in either New York, London, or Seoul. This is the main hub city and soon after you'll enter the secret world, which is a confluence of the regions of the game. Portals go to different regions where the missions and story are completed. The first one is zombie apocalypse world like the Walking Dead but with many more zombies. There seems to be quite a lot of missions to do in each of these worlds because I'm still here. I did enter the next one because of curiosity and it seems to be Egyptian themed but it was too difficult for my level. Those issues that come with the game (it says issues 5, 6, and 7 come with massive edition) are the worlds I believe, but there's an in game shop so they can be bought at leisure. I've played a few of the "buy once play forever" MMOs because I don't have time to focus on a monthly fee type (Final Fantasy XIV was the last one I tried) and for the sale price I can recommend it.","April 21, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

If you're a fan of the Supernatural and being badass, this game is for you.\nWhat I really like is that you can play alone or with friends and the challenges are the same.\nI've only played for 40 hours, but after playing some other multiplayer games with toxic communities, this one is not one of them. Everyone is very friendly, and most times are willing to help and teach the beginners.\nIt is also a very forgiving game. If you don't like a weapon set up you may have picked before, you can easily switch to another set and begin storing points for them.\nThe only thing I find lacking is the character customization as the males and females have a set body figure. You can make them shorter or taller but their body shape remains the same. I also think that more customization would be highly benefitial to the game, but I do like that you can wear anything you want and it's not covered by ugly suits of armor.\nAll in all, I recommend this game for the player base and the gameplay, as well as the story.","May 9","true","39.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's one of these games where it feels worth doing every possible mission and exploring everything. Some of the missions are rather difficult and will require you to translate morse code, ancient hieroglyphics, binary and the like. There's no handholding involved here and will have you do some true detective work. You are given a In-Game browser to assist you in your investigation missions.\n\nThe graphics engine works well with the game design and the music is very suiting to the Lovecraftian atmosphere you find yourself in. And as far as i have experienced, the community seems friendly and adult. I haven't run into many other players personally, but i think it suits the apocalyptic mood. It does have a good size player base so the wait for a group event or dungeon is never long.\n\n\nIf you want to try out a MMO that is different and engaging?

I had played AO from launch, and decided I'd skip Funcom games until they got their act together.  I have to say, The Secret World ain't bad.  It's not my beloved City of Heroes, but then ... nothing will be.\n\nIt's a truly classless and levelless system of the kind Ultima Online wanted to be.  Every character can have every skill at max in the end game.  What makes that interesting is that you can only use a limited set of skills (a "deck") at once.  The game really shines when you figure out new builds from what you've unlocked.\n\nPlus, I adore Lovecraft.  This game is like mainlining heroin for a Cthulhu fan.  It's a dark, atmospheric war among 3 factions.  The mythology is Harry Potter meets At the Mountains of Madness with a dollop of Bram Stoker.

I have been thinking about it for a few months and was not sure I wanted to spend the money.  I would recommend the game, I have played a few hours so I am not an expert, nor have I seen everything, but I like what I have seen so far.  There still are people playing it which is nice, the missions I have played so far seem varied and interesting, the graphics are pretty good, and the atmosphere is nice.  The game is not ground breaking, but it is a fun mmo to play.  The only probelms I have had with the game are the long amount of time the patching is taking, not sure if that is because I just purchased the game, but everytime I have wanted to play it is patching, at first it took a long time, now it is down to about 3 minutes.  The other problem is that I had a lot of stuttering when using dx11, so I had to switch to dx9 which I haven't had any problems with FPS wise or stuttering.  I like the game, I would recommend it for some fun playing experiences, definetly not the greatest game every, but for me it is very entertaining.  FYI there are some pretty good videos on youtube by Totalbiscuit and others if you want to look at gameplay prior to buying.","August 24, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Many TSW players will admit that starting out can be a little daunting since there is a learning curve, but those who stick around past the frustration will find the game rewarding in many ways.\n\nAs several other reviewers have noted, this game is coded and run on Flash; however, there are player-made mods (Curse.com has a client that can install them for you) that can help with everything from re-arranging the user interface to auto-sorting your inventory. Additionally, the graphic may not make some of the graphically inclined too happy, but honestly I was not bothered by it and found it charming.\n\nI would go into depth on mechanics and whatnot, but it has been covered by others prior to myself.

It charters many new waters for MMOs in terms of it's atmosphere, character development, and mission variety.  Investigation missions are remarkable and genuinely challenging, requiring thinking outside the box and often some brainstorming with other players.  The Cthulhuian atmosphere is well realized with haunting music, ominous visuals, and alien monsters/bosses.  The classless character system allows for varied, interesting concepts through the use of keywords and passive synergies, so long as they fall into the standard MMO trifecta of Tank, Healer, or DPS.  The story has highs and lows, with writing that can be shockingly dark and clever in one instance and forced/disjarring in another.  For all its innovation however, the game suffers in terms of style/stilted combat mechanics and a lack of replayability due to the solvability of investigation missions.  The community is sparse and it's hard to find players to group with, and the PVP is an afterthought at best and a glop-on at worst.  If you can convince your friends to play this, I highly recommend it.  If it's a game you can only play on your own, it's still worth at least one playthrough, especially now that they've switched to a buy to play model.","January 11, 2015","true","93.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This one is so refreshing. It isn't the standard pick a class and level up system. This one allows you to be whatever you choose to. Whether you want to be up close, ranged, a mix between the two, or some random combination of skills that somehow you are able to make it work.\n\nIn the game, you are able to use 2 different weapons at any given time, (Not including auxilary since I still havent made it that far) which already expands your capabilites beyond most other MMO's. Now if you don't like what you chose thats fine. You simply earn more Ability Points and Skill Points (which isn't hard at all) put them into a different category and start using different skills and weapons.\n\nAll the main missions include cutscenes which are fully animated and IMO well written. Then you have side missions everywhere. Some are just there for extra experience, but most actually tie into either the main storyline or one of the main missions.\n\nBut out of all the things this game offers, so far my favorite, is the investigation missions. These missions are difficult. They make you think. They only give you hints as what to do, you have to figure it out. There are no waypoints with this one. You will have to search things up and read from books, myths, news reports, and anything else you can think of just to be able to complete these. But if you don't care for this, then just google the mission follow the steps get the experience and move on with your life like a lame person would. (No offence to all those who do this.)\n\nI haven't experience everything this game has to offer yet, so I'll probably come back and add to this after another 100 hours of gameplay or so. Cause at this point, I only complete the first story mission I was assigned. From what I know, I still have 3 other HUGE zones that the story will go across and I've only done 1.\n\nSo if you want a simple answer on whether or not this game is worth it. Yes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geargles/recommended/215280/","Geargles","Doctor Redacted","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geargles/","109 products in account","I honestly cannot recommend this game enough for the casual MMO player who is more interested in an immersive story line and thinking about what is happening around them then the shiny prize at the end. The quests are well written with a multitude of collectible lore entries to supplement information as the story progresses and the 'side quests' are just as much an important part of the experience as the main overarching 'plot'.\n\nA Few notes before purchasing:\nA player could easily solo the main story line without being -required- to enter a dungeon or group with others.  The main story line is SHORT and those that rush to the end will find very little end game content at this time to keep them entertained unless they go back to take on the 'missed' quests, lore collections, dungeons, scenarios, issues etc.\n\nThis game is NOT one where you want to complete the main story line as fast as possible.   The issues (expansions/add ons) are tied to specific parts of the maps but act independently of the main story line.  One does *Not* Have to progress the blue main story line at all technically to reach the late areas of the game which gives plenty of time to think on your character's "Choices" in the main story arcs/cutscenes.\n\nThe mechanics and nuances of the skill system can present a steep learning curve and the fact that there are no 'skill resets' or 'do overs' tend to be a turn off for new players unwilling to experiment when they hit one of the zone transitions.    It is entirely possible for a new player to blindly follow a preset 'throw myself face first at it' approach to the first starting zones before completely hitting a content wall and getting *stuck*.  Patient players can easily grind to accumulate more AP/SP in order to tailor their build to face the challenge, but many MMO players will drop the game at this point OR restart their character.\n\nThis is one of those games you pick up with 1-5 good friends and take your time playing through.  The time invested in working out the puzzles/sabotage/investigation missions is well worth it and gamers using guides to 'beat it as a fast as possible' will be disappointed in the long run.","December 31, 2013","true","621.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was a long time Warcraft player, and fell out of love because it felt like a grind.  Grind for materials.  Grind for money.  I always had a laundry list of quests with which I power levelled whatever character I needed.  I ran dungeons over and over again for that off chance I'll get that one drop.  TSW is different in that the quests are actually interesting.  I'm not asked to gather 10 goblin necklaces -- I'm asked to track down a serial killer.  And if, god forbid, I do have to kill X # of this, I can skip it.  There is enough content to level up.  And levelling -- I really enjoy it.  You always have points coming in with which you can change your character if you feel you've made a mistake or you feel unhappy with the current state you are in.  I do miss the days when tanks were tanks and healers were alts, but I don't have that sort of time.  I just want to get through some content.  It reminded me a bit of Grand Theft Auto.  A little open world exploration followed by cut scenes followed by action.  Except that you can bring friends.\n\nThe down side -- this isn't the standard thief/wizard/cleric/fighter game.  It's not elves and tauren and humans cohabitating.  Just humans and more humans in horror settings.  This means that as a franchise it will probably never have the sort of draw as Warcraft.  No draw, dubious financial future, dubious life span of the franchise.  I expect one day to see the plug get pulled.  And I will be sad.  Second -- I hate enforced solo content.  Several times during the main story you are required to go to a solo instance and play and battle.  If you decided to go full healer, you are out of luck -- go back and replay content until you come up with a new build that will make it.  Sorry, but that's a bit silly.  I'm playing this with my wife, and that kind of thing just alienates people who are there to play in a group, or who need more guidance.  This, along with the almost sterilie LFG channel system makes a mess of the social nature of the game that I remember so well from everquest and warcraft.  Maybe it's not the game -- maybe it's me.  But I liked logging in to talk to my friends who were out questing.  I just don't feel any of that here.  And finally, and this is just my personal bias, the zoning system makes the different chapters of this game feel way too compartmentalized.  I get it -- they are different stories, but I remember how cool it would feel to trudge across a desert to find some semi active volcano and forest -- just wandering from end to end of a giant continent.  But that is just not part of the way TSW works.  You go to the first stage of Transylvania or Egypt or some harbor town -- you play enough of the story and you unlock the next zone.\n\nHonestly, I bought the massive edition for my wife and I.  It's the price of two new release games.  When I compare that to buying two copies of Black Ops or Saints Row or whatever, it's a game whose price tag is a steal and has more than enough adventure.","August 2, 2014","true","210.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're looking for an average MMO romp that holds your hand to the point of nearly crushing it, then TSW is the wrong game for you. However, if you're patient, enjoy challenge, thrive on deep skill/character customization and enjoy stellar plotting/writing, then there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be playing this game right now.\n\nFuncom's diamond-in-the-rough makes up for its lack of polish with an incredibly intuitive, level-less skill system that blends TCG-like deck building with the simplicity of Guild Wars 2's weapon-based combat system. Armor is invisible and only provides your character with stats, leaving you with cosmetic outfit pieces to dress your character in. All quests, except for the main scenario quests, are repeatable and provide you with in backstory on characters and locations, as well as providing you with clues that enrich your main scenario experience. The cash shop provides no pay-to-win items--with the "AP Injection" boosts being arguable at best--and instead gives you more options to customize your character with (that are also affordable). You can be a part of the Illuminati (just saying).\n\nI could go on and on about this game, but I'll check in here for now.

Played this game on an off for a while now.  I managed to get some of my guild gaming buddies to jump in,  including my wife O.O  This game starts of easy enough with different types of quest missions for different tastes of game play. With a main storry line to follow along, its hard to get lost.  Vidio clips to follow along as you progress to immerse yourself, like an interactive novel.  I have no idea what end game play is like so I won't comment .  But I will say this.  Running like hell is a strategy that should be on your list of game play. Hence my next suggestion is find friends to play along with.  Some of the game play is intense, a fire fight from one end to the other. Solo play is possible but with a lot of watching where you move and when. Playing with a group of friends is more enjoyable and probably the way the game was originally set up. Buckle in for a rough ride.\n\nNew comers to the game don't be afraid to totally explore your abilities and skills.  Even have decks that can help you develop a combat style and a new look for your toon. A story line worth watching, not a total waste of time.  PvP gankers well probably not the place for you this game is mostly co-op and that's the way we like it. But the pvp zones come in different sizes and as in all pvp in the beginning grinding is a major factor in pvp performance.  And probably weapon quality that only can be achieved with some time spent in game.  PvE areas consist of questing areas, epic areas that can reward you with better loot (suggest a full group) Group instances, solo instances (part of the story line and also acts like a guide for the strength of your toon  eg. can do it yet, go find better gear. Collect stuff make better gear (strongly suggest going on line as this part is not a simple click and play as some items need to be placed correctly.)    Or loot better gear from the instance or as you dive in deeper into the game.\n\nYes this game has been around a while and yes probably could use a machine upgrade for some better graphics and I hope is on the agenda as this game does deserve a spit and polish. Yes I do give kinda a mixed review but I did enjoy my time spent on this game. I'm just blunt and say it as it is.\n\n\n19/02/16\n\nOk, been playing for a little bit now and what seemed like an huge grind has been drasticly reduced.  Once you have made your Nightmire challenge (nm* dungons ) and start looking at some of the more challenging instances. You quickly recognize a huge jump in difficulty. Things are done by the numbers, need to do this need to do that. Failure to do so, drastically reduces you chances. But thankfully you have probably found a guild to roll with that can guide you though the nightmare. Bit of a pun but totally true. But don't fret if you have not, the community as a whole is still helpful as always. Notifications do come up that a new player is in your instance with you. So they know right of a nub is in the room. So don't be shy and raise your hand.  As for end game the first Raid is in New York city and suggested entry is for Pugs 10.44 *quality 10 gear with a level 4 up grade on the item itself and the glyph placed in it) Guild runs 10.11 easily enough. Although nm are difficult once you learn the fights its all rather easy, believe it or not its true. Yea a bit more dancing as I like to call it but it needs to be harder right. And to make things even more of a challenge a couple of instance have been added to keep you on your toes. I won't comment on as I have not delved into them extensively as of yet.\n\nAs of before pvp does not make a huge impact via in game but does help in over all upgrading items that your toon has in his/her arsenal.  Shambala has now been added as a new venue to go rumble in and has proven to be a place to quicly try out new builds and crazy build and builds that make no sense or just fun builds because your toon looks cool. Trust me no one really cares at least when I decided to dance in the middle on more than one occasion no one gave me crap for it. hehehe XD After all its a game and meant to have fun in. Ok blunt truth now. At first I love the new pvp area. But it does get old and the auto balance of your toon has been exploited by a few in game. Thankfully the match is over in about 5 mins but the rewards are good win or loose. A bit better if you win but the main purpose for going is not taken away.  Currency used to upgrade items on your toon.  The down side are the exploits some people use in the game. The run certain builds that take advantage of the balance and well it kinda over. In some cases its mostly prime time its who side has the most exploiters will win the match. More on the down side. It has left the other pvp zones to almost ghost towns. That have left to more crafty ways to finishing them if the zone has come up as a daily. Thankfully it seems exploiters are catching flak from other players as for the numbers seem to have dropped a bit.\n\nSo as for pvper its proven to be a fun stomping ground, but could be disappointed as for the sudden drop in the other pvp zones. I think most including myself as for this novice pvp'er disappointed by the balance of rewards from one zone to the other and the new balance installed in Shambala only to be exploited by a slim number of elitists that have some profound thinking they are Uber leetz when most just think the opposite and they lack any kind of skill.\n\n\nMy thumbs up still remains as I still find this game worth my time. And remain hopeful that the crew at TSW fix the issues that now come up that are all in all kinda minor and probably could be easly fixed. So keep gaming and who knows maybe see you in game.  8D","June 5, 2015","true","057.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was a long time Warcraft player, and fell out of love because it felt like a grind.  Grind for materials.  Grind for money.  I always had a laundry list of quests with which I power levelled whatever character I needed.  I ran dungeons over and over again for that off chance I'll get that one drop.  TSW is different in that the quests are actually interesting.  I'm not asked to gather 10 goblin necklaces -- I'm asked to track down a serial killer.  And if, god forbid, I do have to kill X # of this, I can skip it.  There is enough content to level up.  And levelling -- I really enjoy it.  You always have points coming in with which you can change your character if you feel you've made a mistake or you feel unhappy with the current state you are in.  I do miss the days when tanks were tanks and healers were alts, but I don't have that sort of time.  I just want to get through some content.  It reminded me a bit of Grand Theft Auto.  A little open world exploration followed by cut scenes followed by action.  Except that you can bring friends.\n\nThe down side -- this isn't the standard thief/wizard/cleric/fighter game.  It's not elves and tauren and humans cohabitating.  Just humans and more humans in horror settings.  This means that as a franchise it will probably never have the sort of draw as Warcraft.  No draw, dubious financial future, dubious life span of the franchise.  I expect one day to see the plug get pulled.  And I will be sad.  Second -- I hate enforced solo content.  Several times during the main story you are required to go to a solo instance and play and battle.  If you decided to go full healer, you are out of luck -- go back and replay content until you come up with a new build that will make it.  Sorry, but that's a bit silly.  I'm playing this with my wife, and that kind of thing just alienates people who are there to play in a group, or who need more guidance.  This, along with the almost sterilie LFG channel system makes a mess of the social nature of the game that I remember so well from everquest and warcraft.  Maybe it's not the game -- maybe it's me.  But I liked logging in to talk to my friends who were out questing.  I just don't feel any of that here.  And finally, and this is just my personal bias, the zoning system makes the different chapters of this game feel way too compartmentalized.  I get it -- they are different stories, but I remember how cool it would feel to trudge across a desert to find some semi active volcano and forest -- just wandering from end to end of a giant continent.  But that is just not part of the way TSW works.  You go to the first stage of Transylvania or Egypt or some harbor town -- you play enough of the story and you unlock the next zone.\n\nHonestly, I bought the massive edition for my wife and I.  It's the price of two new release games.  When I compare that to buying two copies of Black Ops or Saints Row or whatever, it's a game whose price tag is a steal and has more than enough adventure.","August 2, 2014","true","210.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geargles/recommended/215280/","Geargles","Doctor Redacted","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geargles/","109 products in account","I honestly cannot recommend this game enough for the casual MMO player who is more interested in an immersive story line and thinking about what is happening around them then the shiny prize at the end. The quests are well written with a multitude of collectible lore entries to supplement information as the story progresses and the 'side quests' are just as much an important part of the experience as the main overarching 'plot'.\n\nA Few notes before purchasing:\nA player could easily solo the main story line without being -required- to enter a dungeon or group with others.  The main story line is SHORT and those that rush to the end will find very little end game content at this time to keep them entertained unless they go back to take on the 'missed' quests, lore collections, dungeons, scenarios, issues etc.\n\nThis game is NOT one where you want to complete the main story line as fast as possible.   The issues (expansions/add ons) are tied to specific parts of the maps but act independently of the main story line.  One does *Not* Have to progress the blue main story line at all technically to reach the late areas of the game which gives plenty of time to think on your character's "Choices" in the main story arcs/cutscenes.\n\nThe mechanics and nuances of the skill system can present a steep learning curve and the fact that there are no 'skill resets' or 'do overs' tend to be a turn off for new players unwilling to experiment when they hit one of the zone transitions.    It is entirely possible for a new player to blindly follow a preset 'throw myself face first at it' approach to the first starting zones before completely hitting a content wall and getting *stuck*.  Patient players can easily grind to accumulate more AP/SP in order to tailor their build to face the challenge, but many MMO players will drop the game at this point OR restart their character.\n\nThis is one of those games you pick up with 1-5 good friends and take your time playing through.  The time invested in working out the puzzles/sabotage/investigation missions is well worth it and gamers using guides to 'beat it as a fast as possible' will be disappointed in the long run.","December 31, 2013","true","621.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadhogs/recommended/215280/","roadhogs","BERN NOTICE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roadhogs/","117 products in account","Here's the thing about The Secret World: it's a game about risk taking, character building and overcoming circumstances bigger than yourself. If you're looking for an average MMO romp that holds your hand to the point of nearly crushing it, then TSW is the wrong game for you. However, if you're patient, enjoy challenge, thrive on deep skill/character customization and enjoy stellar plotting/writing, then there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't be playing this game right now.\n\nFuncom's diamond-in-the-rough makes up for its lack of polish with an incredibly intuitive, level-less skill system that blends TCG-like deck building with the simplicity of Guild Wars 2's weapon-based combat system. Armor is invisible and only provides your character with stats, leaving you with cosmetic outfit pieces to dress your character in. All quests, except for the main scenario quests, are repeatable and provide you with in backstory on characters and locations, as well as providing you with clues that enrich your main scenario experience. The cash shop provides no pay-to-win items--with the "AP Injection" boosts being arguable at best--and instead gives you more options to customize your character with (that are also affordable). You can be a part of the Illuminati (just saying).\n\nI could go on and on about this game, but I'll check in here for now. I promise you won't regret investing your time and money into The Secret World.\n","March 5, 2014","true","281.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The environment and setting are far better than any other MMO I have played. The fact that a large majority of the quests in game have voice acting and cut scenes sets it apart right away.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and feels more involved than other MMOs. The quests require actual thought and I have found myself using the built in web browser to look up random facts to figure out how to solve the current puzzle many times. If you try to solve every puzzle on your own without looking up the solution this game will keep you entertained and sometimes stumped for days. Even the few and far between "gather" quests are all unique. There are awesome dungeons 5 man+, random server events where you are tasked to work with people on the server to defeat things that appear, PvP and a great guild(cabal) system.\n\nThe leveling system is great. No levels.\nOk levels.. kind of.. whenever you gain enough experience you unlock ability points to put into either skills or areas where you can modify your stats. At no point are you locked into a class you can spec for another class and switch when you like with the points you gain from "leveling" and no cap or even really a level number(as far as I know)\n\nThe story is really where this game wins though probably due to the extra effort put in for the voice acting and very regular cut scenes. The missions as I said above really make you think and keep you invested in what is going on. The amount of lore you can find either by the hidden lore items you find or just by talking to quest givers and NPCs that you find is insane. If you play.. when you play.. make sure to click the dialog text multiple times I did not know about that when I first started. The NPCs have a lot of dialog if you are into that. The lore mixed with the awesome environments makes this game by far my favorite MMO.","September 29, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/215280/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","The Secret World is a somewhat unique and interesting take on the standard MMORPG fare. It stands out by having a strong focus on a rich and interesting world, a New World Order themed storyline, paranoid story elements and plenty of characters with their own agendas. TSW shies away from Elves & Orcs and medieval armor and instead brings a cleaner cut world, but one with interesting factions with their own stories to explore, and tons of interesting things to find.\n\nHighlights\nThe great pleasures of The Secret World over its competitors come from the style and story matter and the very clear choice to make this game NOT full of the typical MMORPG mechanics and content. Quests, for example, are structured so that you can't simply walk from area to area collecting quests then running off to fulfil their requirements. Instead, mission types are usually very different and unique, have adjustable difficulty and more. They're designed to make you play in a different way, to be engaged in what you're doing and thinking about what's going on while you explore. Levelling up, another MMORPG standard, doesn't exist, and failing a mission wont make you want to fight more monsters, collect more resources or spend more gold. Instead you'll seek to approach something differently, fight the enemies more , or talk to characters you missed.\n\n* Voice acting is above average, especially for an MMORPG. It helps add distinctness to characters and their personality. Sound assets and audio in general is very well done and treated with respect in this game. Hearing something unusual on a mission in any other game would be a glitch, here it's a clue.\n* Personally I love the fact that this game has been designed with solo-play in mind. There are elements where it's useful to work together as a group, or have friends involved, but on the whole you can play the entire game without talking to another human player. There's no pressure to level up and unlock this and that, and you can always find something else to involve yourself in\n* The lack of a level cap or limitation adds more depth to character customization while not restricting you to any one play style. If a particular set of tasks require you to have more health to tank, or your friends need a healer for some quest, you can adapt yourself to fulfil that role\n* While I have many problems with the pricing structure of this game, one thing I'm happy about is the non forced in-game purchases. Funcom Points are non essential and only really prompted for on the website and can be completely ignored\n* Whether its the nature of the game, or the types of people that it attracts, the community in this game is great. Stumbling across interesting people to talk to is common, and finding helpful and friendly team members is always easy\n* Character customization has a ton of features, and other than some small facial structure feature problems, the clothing, gear, equipment and selection screens are all quite deep and useful\n\nMistakes\nHeld back by a number of small mistakes, there's plenty to make you pause, but nothing that should stop you from enjoying this title if you've already decided it's something you'd like.\n\n* The graphics are fairly good and do the atmosphere justice, but they're definitely not as good or well optimized as you'd find in competitors like Guild Wars 2, EVE Online or The Elder Scrolls Online.\n* Funcom support is inconsistent and typically either very swift or awfully long with their replies and help\n* There are also some very poor interactions between the Funcom interface/website and the game, buying in-game currency with Steam wallet, for example, is a frustrating process. Nicknames must be unique to the server, and seemingly never expire, so choosing a nickname is a horrible process of trial and error until you find one which isn't already taken\n* Poor UI elements and general lack of elegance in the overlays\n\nRecommendations\nTSW is a polarizing game, and there's a very real risk of simply not enjoying the way the game plays. If you're looking for a contrast to the traditional Triple-A MMORPG fare, if you like slowly exploring and uncovering the details of a story and if you don't mind cutscenes and combat being mixed in there and don't mind also working towards unlocking skills and abilities, you'll likely get a lot out of The Secret World. It's a great time sink for those who enjoy it, with more than 100 hours of story content, with a main storyline that could be completed in somewhere around 12-15 hours if the rest of the world were, for some strange reason, ignored.\n\nReviewing the pricing an MMORPG is a little more difficult because of the number of pricing models available, including any DLCs, paid content and more, and The Secret World makes it even harder with a franky awful pricing model. A one-off payment of £24.99/29.99€/$29.99 which, for the amount of content involved, is fairly priced, even when compared against competitors like Guild Wars 2 which runs from £34.99/$39.99 up to £79.99/$99.99 is available, and fair for what's included.\n\nThen there's the Ultimate Edition which is £44.99/54.99/$59.99 and is simply ridiculous for any video game. I know some people like to argue that this is an expected price of some Triple A titles and console releases, but if the standard of game pricing means I'd have to spend more than $300 for a handful of games then it's simply a bad price market, regardless of playtime. There are also 3 overpriced DLCs available on Steam, at £19.99/24.99€/$24.99 each. That's a disgusting £59.97/74.97€/$74.97 for 3 pieces of DLC, each of which also require the base game to play. And to the naysayers comment that they're included in the Ultimate Edition and shouldn't be purchased separately, I ask why they're called Collector's Editions, or even available for purchase if not to try to justify the price of the Ultimate Edition in comparison. Furthermore, the Ultimate Edition includes a second copy of the base game when purchased from Funcom, but NOT from Steam where the majority of purchases take place, which is another disgusting move.\n\nIf the pricing scheme gives you reason to pause, you should remember that the DLC were originally offered as seperately sold content, giving the customer plenty of price options. The Massive Edition, which has now been removed from the Steam Store and which offered exactly the same content as the Ultimate Edition minus Issue #8 (considered the worst and most pointless of the issues) also came with the removal of the separate DLCs and was then superceded by the Ultimate Edition, presumably for a new round of sales, and to remove those DLC options and prompt buying of the Ultimate Edition. While I'm being harsh on a game that offers an absolute ton of content for the right player, it's important to understand that it's a potential waste of $60 or more for the wrong player and that simply not risking your money on a game you might not enjoy may honestly be the best option for many.\n\nWhen on sale, that risk becomes far more manageable. At the time of review, The Massive Edition reached its lowest price in December 2013 of -67% (£14.99/18.99€/$19.99) which was more than a fair price. So far the Ultimate Edition, which is almost identical) has only reached -30% and I'd recommend waiting til it drops at least -50% or more.\n\n\n* Early PR and even marketing of the game and content was done via ARGs[wiki.crygaia.com], which were puzzles and promotions that involved real world websites and groups along with game content and resources and were quite special in their own right\n* All active accounts on The Secret World come with TestLive access[forums.thesecretworld.com], similar to a beta or test server\n* Similar to WoW character pages, you can access a detailed list","July 4, 2015","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As these are covered in many other reviews I want to mention the few problems I did have.\n\n1.Its hard\n\nDon't get the wrong idea most of the PvE is totally fine but after beating most of the game (or when first entering an area) it can be difficult to beat certain missions. (FYI: Im talking about combat difficulty but some missions can be hard for other reasons, there is only one jumping puzzle in the whole game but it is still one too many)\n\nWhile its possible to do ALL of the quests solo it is very difficult if you don't put a lot of time devoloping a really good ability set.\n\nThe best way to counter this is to play with a friend. A mission that is impossible for two people individually can be a walk in the park if they work together.\n\n\n2. high level gear\n\nIn PvE, if you want the best gear available you have to work with four other players to complete a dungeon.\nThe game has a LFG system which means you can avoid matchmade with someone low level but it can also be hard to find someone who can tank or heal since you will need at least one of each. (DPS isn't as much of a problem at low levels since people could just use their solo classes)\n\nThe LFG system isn't used much for higher level dungeons so you will have to ask around in chat to find a group.\n\nSince dungeons are designed for 5 people they will require either everyone on the team doing their job and knowing what they are doing or if you're still at a low level, teaming up with someone much higher level.\n\n3. PvP\n\nits hard\n\nBasically what helps you in PvE doesn't mean anything in PvP so you will need totally different abilities for each. Doing PvP in a PvE build can result in you going the whole match without a single kill.\n\nHonestly with over 1,000 hours in the game i have never had any luck with PvP but since t isn't neccissary to play PvP for the PvE you could just skip it entirely.\n\nOr even if you are bad at it, you still get reward for participating, so if you are willing to grind even terrible PvPers can use it to get really good gear.\n\nThis is honestly one of the best games I have ever played and since you could play hundreds of hours even if you skipped PvP, dungeons and the hardest missions I would say it is definitely worth trying.","February 21, 2015","true","217.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's unlike any "MMO" I've ever played. Let me start with what I DON'T like:\n\n1) Buggy. Development is always happening and the game is always getting better. But you do run into bugs from time to time. Generally it doesn't result an any major headache but rarely can.\n\n2) DX 11 is problematic depending on your video card. Game looks great with it on, but can reduce your FPS to -nil- during combat. Just change it to DX 9 in the options and bam, all your FPS problems are gone.\n\n3) Lock-out's are a flawed portion of the game in my opinion. You run a "Nightmare" difficulty dungeon and you can't it again for 18 hours. Even if your group failed. Now that all sounds fine, but heres the catch - if you lose a person, no one wants to fill their spot because the important currency that drops off the bosses has now been reduced. So that can be quite frustrating.\n\nNow for my favorite parts! I'll stick to the top three since to be balanced:\n\n1) This game is pretty dang dark. "Dark?" you ask? "Like turn up the brightness?" No. Like F****** dark. Like coming across people who've hung themselves and the details include scratches at the neck and her shoe that's fallen off from the ensuing spasims. "Why would you like that?!" Because I'm an adult. I don't need my hand held. I don't need my games 'kiddyized' or more friendly. There's more I'd love to spout off but some of it is spoilers and believe me...\n\n2) This story is fantastic. Plot twists, terrible betrayals and otherwise just well written STORY that doesn't feel force fed. You move the story along at your own pace.\n\n3) 500 abilities. 500. Takes time to unlock them all, but you can. You can unlock them all. Wanna heal? Ok. DPS? Sure. Tank? Please do. Play the way that makes you happy. There ARE fights that require certain abilities to be had or decks (Decks are ability combinations) that need to be used from time to time, but that's okay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/215280/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","The Secret World is a somewhat unique and interesting take on the standard MMORPG fare. It stands out by having a strong focus on a rich and interesting world, a New World Order themed storyline, paranoid story elements and plenty of characters with their own agendas. TSW shies away from Elves & Orcs and medieval armor and instead brings a cleaner cut world, but one with interesting factions with their own stories to explore, and tons of interesting things to find.\n\nHighlights\nThe great pleasures of The Secret World over its competitors come from the style and story matter and the very clear choice to make this game NOT full of the typical MMORPG mechanics and content. Quests, for example, are structured so that you can't simply walk from area to area collecting quests then running off to fulfil their requirements. Instead, mission types are usually very different and unique, have adjustable difficulty and more. They're designed to make you play in a different way, to be engaged in what you're doing and thinking about what's going on while you explore. Levelling up, another MMORPG standard, doesn't exist, and failing a mission wont make you want to fight more monsters, collect more resources or spend more gold. Instead you'll seek to approach something differently, fight the enemies more , or talk to characters you missed.\n\n* Voice acting is above average, especially for an MMORPG. It helps add distinctness to characters and their personality. Sound assets and audio in general is very well done and treated with respect in this game. Hearing something unusual on a mission in any other game would be a glitch, here it's a clue.\n* Personally I love the fact that this game has been designed with solo-play in mind. There are elements where it's useful to work together as a group, or have friends involved, but on the whole you can play the entire game without talking to another human player. There's no pressure to level up and unlock this and that, and you can always find something else to involve yourself in\n* The lack of a level cap or limitation adds more depth to character customization while not restricting you to any one play style. If a particular set of tasks require you to have more health to tank, or your friends need a healer for some quest, you can adapt yourself to fulfil that role\n* While I have many problems with the pricing structure of this game, one thing I'm happy about is the non forced in-game purchases. Funcom Points are non essential and only really prompted for on the website and can be completely ignored\n* Whether its the nature of the game, or the types of people that it attracts, the community in this game is great. Stumbling across interesting people to talk to is common, and finding helpful and friendly team members is always easy\n* Character customization has a ton of features, and other than some small facial structure feature problems, the clothing, gear, equipment and selection screens are all quite deep and useful\n\nMistakes\nHeld back by a number of small mistakes, there's plenty to make you pause, but nothing that should stop you from enjoying this title if you've already decided it's something you'd like.\n\n* The graphics are fairly good and do the atmosphere justice, but they're definitely not as good or well optimized as you'd find in competitors like Guild Wars 2, EVE Online or The Elder Scrolls Online.\n* Funcom support is inconsistent and typically either very swift or awfully long with their replies and help\n* There are also some very poor interactions between the Funcom interface/website and the game, buying in-game currency with Steam wallet, for example, is a frustrating process. Nicknames must be unique to the server, and seemingly never expire, so choosing a nickname is a horrible process of trial and error until you find one which isn't already taken\n* Poor UI elements and general lack of elegance in the overlays\n\nRecommendations\nTSW is a polarizing game, and there's a very real risk of simply not enjoying the way the game plays. If you're looking for a contrast to the traditional Triple-A MMORPG fare, if you like slowly exploring and uncovering the details of a story and if you don't mind cutscenes and combat being mixed in there and don't mind also working towards unlocking skills and abilities, you'll likely get a lot out of The Secret World. It's a great time sink for those who enjoy it, with more than 100 hours of story content, with a main storyline that could be completed in somewhere around 12-15 hours if the rest of the world were, for some strange reason, ignored.\n\nReviewing the pricing an MMORPG is a little more difficult because of the number of pricing models available, including any DLCs, paid content and more, and The Secret World makes it even harder with a franky awful pricing model. A one-off payment of £24.99/29.99€/$29.99 which, for the amount of content involved, is fairly priced, even when compared against competitors like Guild Wars 2 which runs from £34.99/$39.99 up to £79.99/$99.99 is available, and fair for what's included.\n\nThen there's the Ultimate Edition which is £44.99/54.99/$59.99 and is simply ridiculous for any video game. I know some people like to argue that this is an expected price of some Triple A titles and console releases, but if the standard of game pricing means I'd have to spend more than $300 for a handful of games then it's simply a bad price market, regardless of playtime. There are also 3 overpriced DLCs available on Steam, at £19.99/24.99€/$24.99 each. That's a disgusting £59.97/74.97€/$74.97 for 3 pieces of DLC, each of which also require the base game to play. And to the naysayers comment that they're included in the Ultimate Edition and shouldn't be purchased separately, I ask why they're called Collector's Editions, or even available for purchase if not to try to justify the price of the Ultimate Edition in comparison. Furthermore, the Ultimate Edition includes a second copy of the base game when purchased from Funcom, but NOT from Steam where the majority of purchases take place, which is another disgusting move.\n\nIf the pricing scheme gives you reason to pause, you should remember that the DLC were originally offered as seperately sold content, giving the customer plenty of price options. The Massive Edition, which has now been removed from the Steam Store and which offered exactly the same content as the Ultimate Edition minus Issue #8 (considered the worst and most pointless of the issues) also came with the removal of the separate DLCs and was then superceded by the Ultimate Edition, presumably for a new round of sales, and to remove those DLC options and prompt buying of the Ultimate Edition. While I'm being harsh on a game that offers an absolute ton of content for the right player, it's important to understand that it's a potential waste of $60 or more for the wrong player and that simply not risking your money on a game you might not enjoy may honestly be the best option for many.\n\nWhen on sale, that risk becomes far more manageable. At the time of review, The Massive Edition reached its lowest price in December 2013 of -67% (£14.99/18.99€/$19.99) which was more than a fair price. So far the Ultimate Edition, which is almost identical) has only reached -30% and I'd recommend waiting til it drops at least -50% or more.\n\n\n* Early PR and even marketing of the game and content was done via ARGs[wiki.crygaia.com], which were puzzles and promotions that involved real world websites and groups along with game content and resources and were quite special in their own right\n* All active accounts on The Secret World come with TestLive access[forums.thesecretworld.com], similar to a beta or test server\n* Similar to WoW character pages, you can access a detailed list","July 4, 2015","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Silly me.\n\nI wanted this game for 3 years, then I finally got it. I like it quite a bit. The Illuminati are kinda jerks, but they're rich, so I put up with it. It's pretty realistic in that regard. The Templars are weird but they have the coolest uniforms, so there's that. The Dragons are... well I don't know what the Dragons are, they won't tell me.\n\nAnyways, it's got some interesting combat mechanics, and gameplay mechanics. It's got an interesting story. It's relatively fun to play, easy to learn. You don't have to pay for anything really, except the game and the last few episodes.\n\nMy only problem with it isn't even in the game itself. My only problem is that it doesn't have the option to upgrade from normal TSW to Ultimate Edition TSW (or whatever it's called).

As these are covered in many other reviews I want to mention the few problems I did have.\n\n1.Its hard\n\nDon't get the wrong idea most of the PvE is totally fine but after beating most of the game (or when first entering an area) it can be difficult to beat certain missions. (FYI: Im talking about combat difficulty but some missions can be hard for other reasons, there is only one jumping puzzle in the whole game but it is still one too many)\n\nWhile its possible to do ALL of the quests solo it is very difficult if you don't put a lot of time devoloping a really good ability set.\n\nThe best way to counter this is to play with a friend. A mission that is impossible for two people individually can be a walk in the park if they work together.\n\n\n2. high level gear\n\nIn PvE, if you want the best gear available you have to work with four other players to complete a dungeon.\nThe game has a LFG system which means you can avoid matchmade with someone low level but it can also be hard to find someone who can tank or heal since you will need at least one of each. (DPS isn't as much of a problem at low levels since people could just use their solo classes)\n\nThe LFG system isn't used much for higher level dungeons so you will have to ask around in chat to find a group.\n\nSince dungeons are designed for 5 people they will require either everyone on the team doing their job and knowing what they are doing or if you're still at a low level, teaming up with someone much higher level.\n\n3. PvP\n\nits hard\n\nBasically what helps you in PvE doesn't mean anything in PvP so you will need totally different abilities for each. Doing PvP in a PvE build can result in you going the whole match without a single kill.\n\nHonestly with over 1,000 hours in the game i have never had any luck with PvP but since t isn't neccissary to play PvP for the PvE you could just skip it entirely.\n\nOr even if you are bad at it, you still get reward for participating, so if you are willing to grind even terrible PvPers can use it to get really good gear.\n\nThis is honestly one of the best games I have ever played and since you could play hundreds of hours even if you skipped PvP, dungeons and the hardest missions I would say it is definitely worth trying.","February 21, 2015","true","217.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcieadam/recommended/215280/","arcieadam","Arcadian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcieadam/","63 products in account","A phenomenal adaptation/inspiration of HP Lovecraft's delightly horrifying works. Unlike traditional horror, which relies on jump scares and cheap frights, The Secret World draws upon Lovecraft's uncanny ability to tap into what truly terrifies the soul rather than what frightens the central nervous system. You won't be jumping out of your seat on this one. You'll be glued to it.\n\nInitially, I was hesitant to try this game out as an MMO, feeling it may better be adapted for single play, but I couldn't be more wrong. The community is just as friendly as my first MMO, FFXI Online, an experience I'd been unable to replicate until TSW. Although you can play through the game by yourself, you'll never feel truly alone, at least until you enter a wonderfully creepy solo instance, further reducing the frights and increasing the terror. Find a friend or sibling to play with, as I did, and you'll truly be in for an incredible experience.\n\nThe Graphicsare good, even on a computer like mine that's overdue for a graphics card upgrade and experiences odd memory leaks. Even on low settings, the ambience of each zone feels truly unique, coloring each story in a uniquely terrifying way. From the uncertainty of what lies directly in front of you in the fog of Solomon Island to the unforgiving blistering heat of Egypt, this is a world flush with care, love, and lore from its developers.\n\nThe Musical Score is very good. There's little else to say but that you won't be disappointed in the game's ability to match the cadence of your decesnt into madness with an appropriate tempo to accompany you.\n\nThe Lore is what will entrance you for hours. Ragnar Tørnquist, the game's creative director, may very well be HP Lovecraft's reincarnation. You'll feel drawn into his world immediately, spending hours simply hunting down little bits of story to add to your knowledge of the secret world, and keeping your eyes open for new information.\n\nThe Gameplay is truly phenomenal. While the control scheme is typical for an MMO, with your expected hotbar and somewhat uninspired movement, level progression is unique and entertaining. Eschewing traditional levels, you're allowed to select any ability, any weapon, and any strategem you desire, mixing and matching abilities from different progression trees to create a unique set of abilities. Tanks, DPS, and Healers are one thing, but the variety of choices you have on how to fufill those roles are quite large.\n\nYour Missions vary from simple collection quests and defeat a certain amount of enemies, to truly baffling mysteries where the game refuses to hold your hand. You're expected to use your brain, decode complicated ciphers with demonic runes, open up a bible to find a clue hidden in Psalms, or go online to one of the game's shadowy corperation's websites and find its employee directory for your next clue, using the game's own web browser feature. I will admit to you a remarkable frustration towards the morse code segments, though. I did not go to nautical school. I'm fairly certain most of us didn't either.\n\nFor a fan of MMO's, this is a must buy. For fans of Lovecraft, this is a must buy. For fans of neither, this very well might be the game that endears you to both.","May 11, 2015","true","478.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All the NPC's are amazing with great voice actors. There are more type of quests, for example the investigation ones, where sometimes you have to browse the internet to find answers and clues. You have a great set of skills and weapons and you can freely choose what you want to level. You can choose from three secret society and every one of them are unique and really interesting (I especially like the templars with Dame Julia :D).\n\nThe combat is not that interesting in my opinion, but not that bad, especially if you choose a weapon which you really like. I think it's a great game and if you like MMO's and interesting stories, you should definitely try this game out! :)","October 21, 2015","true","283.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The environment and setting are far better than any other MMO I have played. The fact that a large majority of the quests in game have voice acting and cut scenes sets it apart right away.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and feels more involved than other MMOs. The quests require actual thought and I have found myself using the built in web browser to look up random facts to figure out how to solve the current puzzle many times. If you try to solve every puzzle on your own without looking up the solution this game will keep you entertained and sometimes stumped for days. Even the few and far between "gather" quests are all unique. There are awesome dungeons 5 man+, random server events where you are tasked to work with people on the server to defeat things that appear, PvP and a great guild(cabal) system.\n\nThe leveling system is great. No levels.\nOk levels.. kind of.. whenever you gain enough experience you unlock ability points to put into either skills or areas where you can modify your stats. At no point are you locked into a class you can spec for another class and switch when you like with the points you gain from "leveling" and no cap or even really a level number(as far as I know)\n\nThe story is really where this game wins though probably due to the extra effort put in for the voice acting and very regular cut scenes. The missions as I said above really make you think and keep you invested in what is going on. The amount of lore you can find either by the hidden lore items you find or just by talking to quest givers and NPCs that you find is insane. If you play.. when you play.. make sure to click the dialog text multiple times I did not know about that when I first started. The NPCs have a lot of dialog if you are into that. The lore mixed with the awesome environments makes this game by far my favorite MMO.","September 29, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

New content is still being added. I wouldn't worry that you are buying an MMO at the end of it's life.\n-----------------------------------------\nThere are great adventure zones:\nKingsmouth, where a mysterious fog has rolled in and brought its share of zombies.\nEgypt, where a group of cultists are working to revive a dead god.\nTransylvania, where ghouls and spectors outnumber townsfolk, and old soviet experiments have created deadly vampires.\nTokyo, soon to be released.\n-----------------------------------------\nSkill System/Theorycrafting:\nThere are nine weapons, from which you can use any two at a time. Each weapon focuses on two possible roles, like healing/tanking/dps/support. There are over 500 unique skills in total, and the forums are always buzzing about the optimal builds for each role. No weapons are really that underpowered, and each works well depending on the situation. Gear can get rather complicated at high levels. People who like min-maxing will have a blast. If you don't, tons of people will be happy to give you tips.\n-----------------------------------------\nMissions:\nSome of the best I have ever played. There are "investigation" missions where you must crack codes, solve mysteries, and investigate the occult. A lot of these bring back a pen and paper adventure game feel, but can easily be avoided if not your cup of tea. Most missions are on a 1-2 day cooldown, after which you can do them again if you like.\n-----------------------------------------\nPvP:\nI actually can't recommend this. There are some that really love it, but I would not say this is one of the games stronger points.\n-----------------------------------------\nThe Community:\nThis game has the best community I've ever seen. It's a more mature demographic than you might find on the average WoW server. It's easy to find a guild to group/raid with, and even at low levels there are tons of people eager to help. There is even a player made, in-game channel called the Sanctuary, devoted to helping newcomers.\n-----------------------------------------\nCash Shop:\nThere is a cash shop, but 90% of it consists of vanity items/exp boosts. There is nothing in it that could really be seen as pay-to-win. As the game is no longer on a pay-to-play, new content is a one time purchase in the cash shop. Again,  they are not strictly necessary, but I've enjoyed each one enough that I would buy it again. If the massive edition is on sale you might want to get that, as it will save you around $20 at a later date.\n----------------------------------------------\nOverall I would highly recommend it.","March 31, 2014","true","537.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilviusGaming/recommended/215280/","SilviusGaming","Silvius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilviusGaming/","81 products in account","The Secret World is a game I was tempted to play when it was released in 2012, but because it was most likely yet another MMO condemned to fail I just never bothered. The Steam sale reminded me of its existence and the removal of the subscription requirement gave me a reason to try it out.\n\nYes, it's barely alive and (thus) not much of a MMO but the Secret World still manages to be surprisingly entertaining nonetheless. It may have been different before, but I'm very well able to play the game without even sharing a minute with another player. I even surprised myself with a feeling of rather irritation than excitement when I see another player, who is most likely going after 'my' quest mobs or about to spoil a future quest event. The only thing you might miss when playing on your own are the few dungeons the game has, but the solo-instances make up for them.\n\nWhich brings me to the strongest point of the Secret World: the quests are captivating. Not just because of the dark (sometimes twisted) stories they have to tell, but also the refreshing gameplay. Most quests involve in-game cinematics and the occasional text (item) is often displayed to you in a very creative and attractive way. Yes, you're still more often than not killing # of these things and gather # of those items. But it rarely feels like a grind; as the mobs and the environment are stunningly original and demand your full attention: Traps are where you least expect them and the mobs are often well camouflaged. A step in the wrong direction often results in death due to a 'double pull'. The occasional 'research quest' are incredibly well done and connects the game with the real world in a fantastic way. Though people with a proper brain will still find some of them extremely challenging.\n\nVeterans might beg to differ, but the game is hard so far. As a newbie you're thrown into the deep after struggling with poor tutorials and a 'help'-system that seems to be half finished; on some meaningless subjects you're bored with a video, while some of the essential subjects consist of one empty sentence. While the game pretends like it doesn't matter what kind of weapon (spec) you pick, you will notice soon enough that without any strong healing abilities you'll end up dead quite often, as the healing abilities of some weapons simply aren't good enough. After I realized this and adopted 'Blood Magic'-healing, the game feels more doable.\n\nConclusion\nThe relatively hard (combat gameplay and learning) difficulty and 'subscribe-to-play' competition were probably the main reasons this game wasn't succesful as an MMO. Yet the Secret World is captivating, rewarding and original in its genre. I sincerely recommend you to give it a go when you're into challenging games with good stories to tell.","April 5, 2014","true","71.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Come on in.\n-----------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------\nState of the MMO:\nA niche game with a small but dedicated fan base. New content is still being added. I wouldn't worry that you are buying an MMO at the end of it's life.\n-----------------------------------------\nThere are great adventure zones:\nKingsmouth, where a mysterious fog has rolled in and brought its share of zombies.\nEgypt, where a group of cultists are working to revive a dead god.\nTransylvania, where ghouls and spectors outnumber townsfolk, and old soviet experiments have created deadly vampires.\nTokyo, soon to be released.\n-----------------------------------------\nSkill System/Theorycrafting:\nThere are nine weapons, from which you can use any two at a time. Each weapon focuses on two possible roles, like healing/tanking/dps/support. There are over 500 unique skills in total, and the forums are always buzzing about the optimal builds for each role. No weapons are really that underpowered, and each works well depending on the situation. Gear can get rather complicated at high levels. People who like min-maxing will have a blast. If you don't, tons of people will be happy to give you tips.\n-----------------------------------------\nMissions:\nSome of the best I have ever played. There are "investigation" missions where you must crack codes, solve mysteries, and investigate the occult. A lot of these bring back a pen and paper adventure game feel, but can easily be avoided if not your cup of tea. Most missions are on a 1-2 day cooldown, after which you can do them again if you like.\n-----------------------------------------\nPvP:\nI actually can't recommend this. There are some that really love it, but I would not say this is one of the games stronger points.\n-----------------------------------------\nThe Community:\nThis game has the best community I've ever seen. It's a more mature demographic than you might find on the average WoW server. It's easy to find a guild to group/raid with, and even at low levels there are tons of people eager to help. There is even a player made, in-game channel called the Sanctuary, devoted to helping newcomers.\n-----------------------------------------\nCash Shop:\nThere is a cash shop, but 90% of it consists of vanity items/exp boosts. There is nothing in it that could really be seen as pay-to-win. As the game is no longer on a pay-to-play, new content is a one time purchase in the cash shop. Again,  they are not strictly necessary, but I've enjoyed each one enough that I would buy it again. If the massive edition is on sale you might want to get that, as it will save you around $20 at a later date.\n----------------------------------------------\nOverall I would highly recommend it.","March 31, 2014","true","537.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can play solo through most of the game, or you can join a group. Otherwise you can wander round helping out other players at random. That's right, people can rely on the kindness of strangers. Folks are right neighbourly around these parts.

One I can't keep my system on three way crossfire I've noticed Issues with the script. So after switching to only one R7 all is good. Other than that the graphics are amazing, Its hard to believe this game is almost two years old. This game is just way too damn addicting. It has been my personal obsesion for the last past two and a half weeks since i got back into it. Off the bat one thing that is clear is this game is harder than coffin nails so if you don't like a challenge look else where. The secret world is one of those games I couldn't get into around its launch I actually bought a physical copy and couldn't get into it due to the lack of following, content, and just plain old not having the gear to have an enjoyable expirience. Around the hollidays last year they dropped the price down to fifteen bucks after seeing that steam provided the right forum for this game to shine. I said why not and bought another copy. I'm so glad I did, right away I noticed there was way more to do and much more of a following now. Now that I've got the ball rolling I can also say I've even enjoyed the story so far. I can see myself still playing this game two maybe even five years from now. Like someone else mentioned If you're unsure buy it on sale and see what happens. You might like it. For anyone wanting a break from MMOs as you know them this is it. For anyone who's never played an MMO before give it a shot.

The game has a great mix of zombies, cultists, conspiracy theory, and other crazy subjects that just fit well.  It keeps some of the favorite MMO conventions like tank, healer, dps roles---but at the same time, breaks away with a fairly complex skill system.  The game is overwhelming and pretty hard at times and always a bit strange--but very few games have captured me like TSW.  The quests are actually interesting and varied.  The cut-scenes remind me of GTA a bit in style and do a good job of drawing you in without being too long winded.","January 17, 2014","true","259.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I really like the character system used, giving you a lot of freedom on how you want to progress. An other very good point of TSW is the questing system. You can't just pick up every quest out there and you haveto be keep on what quests you take. I also like how the game looks like - it really gives you an apocalypse kinda feeling.\n\nWhat I don't like are the hordes of zombies (which are pretty agile BTW) that you see everywhere and how some are really overpowered. An other bad thing is the 'X marks the spot' idea for quests. You can see from afar where you have to go to, to do your thing :(\n\nLast but not least, the game absolutely looks stunning!","January 19, 2014","true","33.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

TSW has an extremely deep and unique system both in quests that will realy force you to use your grey matter (And at times look up walkthroughs in frustration) and a levelling system unlike any other MMO that will be very tricky to figure out! (Protip: If you are new, stick to the decks! Grab a beginner deck, then an advanced one)\n\nWords of praise: As said, TSW is an MMO unlike any other. The setting is unique, the quests are unique, you will not find a WoW clone here, and the graphics, if your computer can handle them, are incredible. The game stays interesting all throughout, and the story and setting are thoroughly fascinated. Those who persist will find a very immersive and entertaining MMO that takes you on a journey through The Secret World.\n\nEverything is true, now you must protect the innocent from the monsters in the dark.\n\nWell worth the money it charges, given the lack of a monthly fee, it is very affordable.","February 10, 2014","true","216.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's VERY story heavy, and the story is fiendishly engaging. A lot of the quests have fully voiced cutscenes which involve the NPCs giving you hints for what you should do. The quests are highly intuitive and unique and are, in my opinion, a fantastic study in how to break the 'Kill X monsters' or 'Find Y items' monotony of many MMOs. Prepare to use your brain because these quests actually require you to think. Pressing B in-game brings up an internet browser which they fully expect you to use to google things. One quest wanted me to spell out a specific word from a specific verse in a Latin translation of the Bible. Another had me go to a fake company's website to look up how to repair one of their radio dishes and then sent me a location in Morose Code. I haven't even covered a fraction of the content, but I'm excited to see what else they have for me.\n\nThe game isn't perfect by any means, but it's still really cool. The setting and the world they put together is my all-time favorite type of setting, so I admit I'm biased on that but even so it's really well done and very coherent. I'll try and wrap this up without repeating things now:\n\nPros:\nSuper awesome atmosphere, interesting story line, really unique and memorable quests, gear and clothing are different things so you can dress however you'd like, go clothes shopping in London, punch some zombies, really flexible skill system which can and should be changed up as needed, most things can be completed solo if approached intelligently, it actually treats me as if I can think instead of blindly pushing me from quest hub to quest hub, you can phone in completed quests so you don't have to run back to the quest giver, look for quest clues while you're a ghost, there's a skinwalker type dude who can sell you GIANT STACKS OF TACOS in London. Don't want to use tacos instead of traditional health potions? That's cool too because you can break the tacos into giant stacks of nachos for quicker snacks.\n\nCons:\nSkill system can be intimidating at first, the minimum specs are kind of high and it doesn't really play well if they aren't met, quests, especially investigation type quests, can get really hard, really fast simply because it's expecting me to do things I'm not trained to do in a game. One quest dealt with a ghost and I didn't know what to do because it turns out I needed to be dead to see the next clue.\n\nIt's different, but I'd like to see more things like it. There isn't a subscription fee so if you're even curious you should give it a chance. If you're not sure it'll run, ask someone who plays for a referral and try it for 72 hours free.\n\nAnd remember, EVERYTHING. IS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucchus/recommended/215280/","bucchus","Bucchus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bucchus/","1045 products in account","I no longer enjoy MMOs these days. If you're looking for a good World of Warcraft fix, The Secret World won't help you at all. In the traditional MMO sense it's not that good. There's no feeling of progress in gaining xp and gearing up isn't satisfying so as a Diablo-style loot fishing lottery it's bad. The combat is a lackluster combination of Age of Conan and Guild Wars that feels hollow and has to be included in the game just because MMOs apparently can't exist without constant combat. The skill trees seem bland and honestly I don't see much difference between the fighting styles because they all have generic skills that do some damage. How do you even fire a shotgun in 50 different ways?\n\nHOWEVER, all of that can be endured or mostly ignored (combat hasn't been difficult either so far) to enjoy what this game does best, it isn't actually a WoW-style MMO but instead it should be treated as an online adventure game. The very detailed setting areas seem lovingly crafted, the lore is interesting and subtle and the NPCs are actually pretty well written and voice-acted. The world is a hodgepodge of secret societies and X-Files paranormal and Lovecraftian influences combined with just about everything else that fits under horror. If you liked how some of the areas in Age of Conan felt and looked, I think it's based on the same engine. It seems fairly taxing though so weaker rigs might have problems.\n\nHere comes the real reason why you should give this game a try: The quests. Sure, there are traditional MMO style quests that have you fedexing items somewhere or following simple map pointers to kill 5 of thing X and return, with cutscenes. These are enjoyable because the well-made maps make it seem like exploring instead of grinding. THEN you run into some of the investigation quests which might be the best content I've witnessed in MMOs.\n\nThese are quests that don't have any easy pointers at all, only vague and cryptic clues. They're like Alternate Reality Game things where you must use google and wikipedia to decipher all the puzzles, they can't be solved just within the game (well, the game actually has a built-in web browser). Don't be tempted to go straight for the spoilery walkthroughs but try to solve things yourself! I don't think I've felt so clever in ages when I managed to crack a devious puzzle involving medieval lute music and googled actual score sheets.\n\nSo, have you ever made that mistake in an MMO where you realize that a particular puzzle has to do with entries in the bible, so you look it up and fail to see how it all fits, only later on realizing you should've checked wikipedia based on another clue so you'd realize you had to look up the passage in the original latin translation? Other MMOs have done the Indiana Jones action side but this game does the library research/puzzle cracking side.\n\nI've played this thing solo just because I think it works nicely as an atmospheric single player roleplaying/adventure game where you sometimes bump into other players, I have no idea what the group instances are like. If they're like the usual raid combat stuff I'll happily ignore them because I'll focus on the content that makes me feel like a X-Files librarian instead of the usual warrior puppet flailing around to the beat of bosses.\n\nOh, and because it doesn't require a subscription I don't need to handle it like a job that has a clock ticking "play me now or you don't get your money's worth!" Grab it on sale and you're set. Perhaps you'll even enjoy the combat side, but I don't think that's necessary to enjoy this game anyway.","September 26, 2014","true","38.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","4"

The Secret World pits players against horrors beyond belief, in scenarios inspired by classic film and fiction. The premise is exciting, but is it worth playing? Well...in a word, no. But that's a rating I need to clarify.\n\nIt does have some interesting areas, enemies, stories, and especially the unique experience/ability/skill system. The voice acting is generally good. There's plenty of tongue-in-cheek, which helps it not to take itself too seriously when it shouldn't. And what music it has is very good.\n\nIt's easier for me to talk about where I feel TSW failed. First and most importantly of all, the factions are all horrid packs of asslords that you will not like...how original. I understand they're going for 'realism' -- which, to clunky writers means 'unlikeable people' -- but it's been done to death, and here it just puts new players off. They're instantly confronted by people they have no real reason to do anything but work against, no matter who they pick. Given, after the introductory missions, you won't have to deal directly with your faction very much at all for long periods of time, but making it a pillar of the game itself was a mistake.\n\nI think it's a major problem of MMOs that so many have resorted to shoehorning characters into militaristic factions that not only don't make sense but aren't appealing, and it doesn't even matter the setting; they still do it regardless. If this really needed to be a part of the game, it should have been closer to endgame where a player chooses, based on interactions up to that point, which faction they will support. TSW's premise is one that would just work so much better if the player were an unaffiliated character, slowly figuring out the factions and figures behind the scenes, perhaps communicating with unknown parties...unknown until much later in the game. With how little part faction plays for quite some time, it really would have been much better to take that approach, as well as more suspenseful and engaging.\n\nAs for writing, it's absolutely awful. The introductory missions are so abysmal they're often embarrassing, and some of them are offensively sophomoric or uncomfortable in clearly unintended ways. Characters are obnoxious 'just because', and they're not even believable or realistic in their presentation. It's pretty much a mass collection of people you are designed to dislike, which destroys any real willing suspension of disbelief.\n\nThe character development systems are interesting and robust, but even though skills and abilities are given video tutorials, there are other systems in the game that players are left to sink or swim. Items accumulate in the inventory without explanation, and even though a shop presumably for kits to use them can be encountered, no effort is taken to explain. Similarly, certain gameplay mechanics go utterly unaddressed, such as dropping missions you don't want to complete (you can't, only replace them), or how the game expects you to approach the stealth-oriented missions (which it only informs you are stealth-oriented and gives you no real information on how they're different).\n\nAnd speaking of those stealth missions, avoid them like the plague. While the battle system and skills/abilities are actually refreshing and robust for the most part, the game is not nearly solid enough to even remotely allow for the kind of precision and demanding that they require. There are also a number of occasions where a player will find himself instantly blown up, with no explanation as to why or how it could be avoided. Nothing is explained about these overly picky missions, and they're frustrating and worthless. They don't fit in TSW anyway, but there's no effort to introduce them to the player, and as a result they just end up even less likeable.\n\nThe tracker is okay, if a bit too approximate. It'll lead you to the area, but highlighting of key interactive objects is very poor, meaning you might pass by an essential item a few dozen times before happening to notice it. While I understand the need for not making the objects too incongruous, they end up being annoyingly hard to find and blend into the scenery. It would be nice to have an option to make the objects more noticeably highlighted.\n\nSpeaking of options, it would also be nice to have the option for subtitles when people speak, for those of us who are hard of hearing or simply can't understand what some of the voice actors are saying. Sometimes there are subtitles, sometimes there aren't...\n\nThere are no recovery items or boost items that are made clear initially either, so it can be a bit overwhelming for new players to become used to what's going on. The introduction to battle, a dream sequence common to each faction, doesn't really help much and, like the rest of the intro sequences, is incoherent and fairly useless except for raising questions it has no intention of answering.\n\nThe game itself is something that can be enjoyed if you can tune out the poorer aspects of it. Battle is usually fun. Exploring the environments is enjoyable, and they're given a lot of personality. The player characters aren't super-customisable, but they're not bad. If you avoid the stealth missions, most of the others are fun. The stories of the locations -- what I'd really call 'modules' or 'regions' -- are pretty interesting, even if the overarching story is the opposite.\n\nTSW is one of those games that has such potential, but it doesn't actually manage to achieve much of it. It's frustrating perhaps most of all because if you can see that potential, it's terrible to see it fail again and again to actually get there. The result is a mediocre game that I can't really recommend to anyone without a lot of caveats and disclaimers. If you really want to try it, get it on sale and give it a try. I just can't guarantee you'll think much of it other than an occasional time-waster with pretensions it isn't able to back up, and that's a pity because it could have been something so much more special.\n","April 21, 2015","false","36.5"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theparrotlover/recommended/215280/","theparrotlover","It's High Noon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theparrotlover/","236 products in account","Ever wanted to battle a Lovecraftian creature with a shotgun? Now you can. The Secret World is a unique MMORPG for many reasons. It features a modern day setting in which secret societies battle out with many various myths and legends. The game also has a class-less system, in which players can put a combination of any two weapons of their choice and create a skill set based on their own playstyle.\n\nThe setting takes place in a modern day age where creatures terrorize the world and it's up to secret societies to contain them (for multiple reasons). The game features an engaging story and side-stories to go along with quest. The stories are amazingly well-done, espically in quest/missions, often invoking a sense of mystery to push your forward. Many of the quest vary, but still retain some of the fetch and kill quest, many have you solving eleborate puzzles, sneaking through a heavily defended base, solving a murder, dodging the line of sight from a sniper; while, more are simple, such as killing X numbers of enemies.  However, the game has a very dark overtone, which can be a turn-off from the usual easy-going nature of MMO worlds.\n\nFor those wondering about the classless system, the "Trinity" still remains. The character can equip non-aesthetic gear known as Talismans to boost their profiency in one of the "Trinity" (DPS, TANK, HEALER). The classless system features 9 weapons each with different roles such as support, healing, dps, debuffing, and etc. You can combine any of these two into combos that fit your playstyle. The combat is a lot more active than most mmos, requiring you to dodge and actively use skills.\n\nSpeaking of non-aesthetics, the gear you get stays off your character, so you aren't forced to wear that "ugly armor", the game features clothing that you can purchase, unlock, and (obviously) wear to suit your character. While the intial character customaztion isn't so robust, the game features a full line of clothings in which you can dress your character.\n\nThe game features big areas that are themed, filled with plenty of quest to keep you busy. The difficulty curve feels about right, slowly scaling up with your progression through each area. The game features the typical "instances/dungeons" where you battle your way through the standard 6 boss format with up to 5 players. It also features three difficulty levels, Normal, Elite, and Nightmare. Normal serves as the progressing line through each dungeon, with fairly standard completion. Elite is the same thing, but for higher level gear, and Nightmare is a brutal and hellish asylum for those whom honed their tactics to form a congregation to conquer Satan's dungeon for a rewarding payoff. (It's THAT ♥♥♥♥ING HARD).\n\nAlthough, with such content, comes a couple of bugs. Playing the game for long periods of time can cause a memory leak, and once in a while you may experience a quest/dungeon/game breaking bug. However, this can be easily repaired by contacting an admin via /petition command, or logging off and back on. The beginning of the game (the first area) can seem a bit slow, slowly racking up abillities points while more slowly accumlating skill points to spend on your weapon skills.\n\nIn short, The Secret World is a unique experience from an MMO perspective, featuring the right amount of difficulty, story, and gameplay to keep a driving force to play it. The game features several bugs however, which are easily repaired but can get annoying sometimes. For those looking for a core MMORPG, the trinity and character devloping remains and does not delve into over-"casualising" itself. The game is downright hard, yet forgiving. It inspires creativity by allowing a free-form system in skill development. If you're looking for a refresher and are willing to try out something a little different, The Secret World is that MMO.\n\n-This awesome game was a gift from an awesome friend, shoutout to him :D!!!

They also do the slasher horror style too if that is your thing.\n\nThey have traditional quests with way points that lead you around while telling a story but they also have investigation missions which are a different beast altogether.  These are like a mini detective novel where you will have to research on the internet (no not for the walk through, play the game properly, grrrr).  For instance one required me to translate Romanian another take down and decode morse code .  They really make you think and will tax your brain cells assuming you do them properly without any cheating.\n\nSo stories good, it also looks pretty decent as well graphics wise and the audio does its job of building up atmosphere too (like it does in a good film).\n\nRight the not so good (not bad just not good either).  The combat is clunky and will take some getting used to.  There is active dodging, telegraphs from mobs to avoid and that can get a little hectic.  The skill system has so many aspect to it  that it can be a very confusing thing to get a grasp of when you start. Its quite possible to make the game harder for yourself than it needs to be if you are not careful with your build (there are a ton of guides to give you the basics that will help you get a good start though so don't worry too much about that).\n\nSo yes a flawed diamond of an mmo and if you can put up with the odd bits then you will find a really great, deep and atmospheric mmo that no other has been able to match so far.\n\n","June 5, 2014","true","352.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have mix .5/.4's and all MP on NM dungeons.  Instead of a basic review just tossing down a few styles that these games have.\n\nGeneral:\nPros:\nGood atmosphere\nGood lore\nEasy to jump into and no sub fee\nFun Combat\n\nCons:\nNo huge point to factions.\nVery small MMO so once your played one char to max, thats it.  Re-rolling means going through the exact same content.\n\n\nSolo play (Questing / overworld)\nPros:\nVery well written\nVery nice voice overs/cut-scenes.\nExcellent quest design with multiples "types" (Kill/Stealth/Investigation which is a "puzzle" mission).\nEasy to get around (its quite literally a hub based MMO with all zones off 1 main hub).\nSome type of "theme" for everyone.\nBest pick-up quest system ever.  Never too overwhelmed, but never left with nothing to do/find.\nFully repeatable content.\n\nCons:\nWeak, short, and disappointing main story (that basically says "hey, we will finish this later").\nVERY linear.  Incredible so.  You just going to be going from Zone A->B->C with no choice in the matter.\n8 "main zones" to quest in so a very small world.\nNo real reason to Re-roll since 95% of what you will be doing is the exact same quests.\nCan be rough for those who don't know MMO basics.\nWhile it tries to do everthing, it can be jarring in enviorment.  Like Solomen island?  Well thats it, it doesn't continue to be like that the next two area's.\n\nEndgame Instance (5 - man)\nPros:\nVery well done fights.\nBest loot pinata (wow style) dungeons ever made.\nThere is always something worth looting due to BB/upgrade system.\nMild flexibility\nDecent dungeon progression.\nEnjoyably repeatable.\nNicely defined roles\n\nCons:\nMeta seems to be require "X" from "Y" role.  Tank passive flexiblity is hit hard due to required passives.\nCan't skip cutscenes....EVER.  Its neat the first time, not the 100+ times.\nSome dungeons *Especially* the upper ones are buggy, and most likely will never be fixed.\nDungeons are very rarely expanded on.  Prepare for 1 new dungeon a year if it keeps at this rate.\nTop heavy so new players to endgame are left floundering unless they join specific channels etc.\n\nEndgame (Raid)\nPros:\nDecent fights, nothing grand, but not bad.\nNew York Raid (NYR) drop rates are fair.\nAlways a reason to raid NYR due to upgrade mechanic\nItem drops provide unique effects that are desired (NYR)\nPugs are often for raid content so guildless players have a shot (if they can manage to get invited w/o kill proof)\n\nCons:\nOnly 2 raids, but the Kingsmouth raid drops are so lackluster, by the time you can kill him he isn't worth it.\nOnly 1 really raid worth doing means you are stuck with the raid for a long time.\nNot much flexibility for guilds due to lockout + 10 man + 1 raid.\nRequires a decent machine to run it well.  Even 10 man's can get quite hefty.\nPugs often require kill proof leading to the WoW mindset of "Link acheezement first plz".","March 9, 2014","true","68.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The strong point of this game is the story and the atmosphere. Compared to other MMO's it beats them by a mile (storywise). However compared to strictly story driven (stand alone) games, it is not all that good. I often wondered if this game would have been better as a stand alone. There are a lot of cutscenes, which are usually nicely done. The quality of the main storyline did suprise me as it flutters around and some side missions are actually better than the main storyline.\n\nThe combat is rather rather dull and hp of many mobs increases faster than your dps. Combined with the story driven missions it makes the game feel rather slow. This does not have to be a bad thing mind you, but when indoctrinated by WoW or the like you will really have to get used to this game. The game can be quite unforgiving at times, which at certain points is a nice challenge, and at other times quite silly (making you want to read the mission guides in advance). Bringing a friend does help quite a lot (but be aware some parts of missions have to be done solo in mini instances).\n\nPVP is aweful at the moment. Players are "balanced" but not quite to the level of other QL10.5 types. Most areas are static most of the time, being at the mercy of the faction with the most players. On the flip side, it allowed me to read a good book while picking up points for epics, jumping in (and dying painfully) when we got attacked.\n\nAll in all I enjoyed the atmosphere in the game and running around trying to find out what happened. I picked the game up on steam with a discount and I think it was worth the money. Though, as you noticed, I think it could have been a lot better. I have not played endgame content (raids), nor do I think I will. The replayablility does not seem that high to me, once you have seen a story, you will want to go to the next (even though they are repeatable).\n\nPs. the game seems to be optimized very badly, at least for 32bit systems. I actually had to tweak my memory to make it run (I wish I could say smoothly). I ran it without steam, hence the low hour count.","February 23, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Suprisingly good story with plenty of voice acting and cutscenes are present at the beginning and end of almost every quest other then the side quest. The other interesting thing about this MMO is the investigation missions which require you to do research and solve puzzles with little to no help from the game. These missions are pretty difficult to give you an idea in my 10 or so hours of play I have had to decode morse code(or at least attempt to :P), solve ingame riddles by studying ingame lore, and figure out passwords by using the ingame browser to solve the hints. The maps are also pretty well done and while not as massive as many other MMOs the maps are still quite large and space is well used. FInally the one thing that really suprised me and which will probably keep me in game is the dungeons. I have only done 1 so far but it was great basically no junk mobs just bosses and mini-bosses, and i must say the bosses are amazingly well done.","August 21, 2012","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

First, I really like the buy it once, no monthly fee model.  While the game didn't start out that way, it was that way by the time I got into it.  Second, the freedom in character development as far as what skills to get, and the unique (at least in my experience) way the weapons and skills work is very nice. I also like that in the main quests, all of the quest opening and closing cutscenes are actually voiced and acted out, while all the lore and everything you can collect can still give you a bit more backstory if you feel like spending some time with walls of texts.  Like any other online multiplayer game, this game does benefit quite a bit if you have some friends to join in on the adventure with you.","February 5, 2014","true","128.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played many between then and now and must say that The Secret World provides an amazing experience and does a solid job mixing up the MMO formula. It really can play like a normal single player game if you want, outside of doing dungeons a few group quests and some end game material you aren't forced to group with others.\n\nWith that said you will always run into people running around that if they see you struggling will generally give you a hand. Chat is mostly friendly with people offering to help or looking for groups. The class system is open ended. You build your character as you want. You aren't restricted and being forced to reroll, you just swap out your abilities and can change your playstyle or role in a group just like that. Obviously some builds are more optimized than others but part of the fun can be trying something different or new out. The great thing is you can unlock everything on one character. Sure it will take a long time but it is feasible. You start the game by selecting one weapon and as soon as you gain your first SP, you can unlock a second if you will. Having said that, you can only ever have 2 weapons equipped at any time but between combat you can swap them. This means you can use only active abilities for the weapons you currently have equipped.\n\nCombat plays out with a universal 1 second global cooldown with more specialized and powerful abilities having extended timers or requirements such as building up charges for effectiveness. You also have a dodge move that can pull you out of the fire, sometimes literally, fairly frequently.\n\nNow I want to tell you that it does a wonderful job with the horror themes and mythology. The voice acting...works but the dialogue is generally well written and each quest giver has their own personality and self contained reasons or stories for being involved. Mission variety is fairly standard ranging from gather "x" to kill "y" but where the missions really shine are the dungeon/group activities and the investigation missions. Both require you to actually think while some require you to just check for the solution online as it presupposes an understanding of say a long dead language. They make whatever you have played before from Point and Click Adventure games to Silent Hill/ Resident Evil/ Horror genre tropes look like grade school.\n\nThe game does have an item shop that contains mostly comestic items and "issues" or DLC. TSW handles issues like DC Universe handles DLC. Now with TSW they also have the first 4 issues I believe for free to all players. So you'll just have to pick up the later ones and yes, they still are supporting the game with new issues and content on a frequent basis.\n\nThe visuals are ok, a bit dated for the time and some of the abilities have recycled animations as I stated earlier some of the voice acting is bad (normally in a good way though) but on the other side the aesthetics/atmosphere/environments, ability control/combo system, interesting story/monsters, solo/group play, puzzles/mission variety and taking place in a modern setting far exceed the negative things I have to say about the game.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Yes. I highly recommend it. Snag it on a sale and give it a shot. It's pay once and play which is no different than the next Bioshock DLC, Madden or Total War game except when it's on sale it is about the price, or actually lower than, the price of the Bioshock DLC but has far more potential to suck you down to the dark and wet city of R'lyeh and keep you there either until you go insane or you find the secret to The Secret World *cue X-Files music*.\n\nJ'ai fini","February 8, 2014","true","242.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have mix .5/.4's and all MP on NM dungeons.  Instead of a basic review just tossing down a few styles that these games have.\n\nGeneral:\nPros:\nGood atmosphere\nGood lore\nEasy to jump into and no sub fee\nFun Combat\n\nCons:\nNo huge point to factions.\nVery small MMO so once your played one char to max, thats it.  Re-rolling means going through the exact same content.\n\n\nSolo play (Questing / overworld)\nPros:\nVery well written\nVery nice voice overs/cut-scenes.\nExcellent quest design with multiples "types" (Kill/Stealth/Investigation which is a "puzzle" mission).\nEasy to get around (its quite literally a hub based MMO with all zones off 1 main hub).\nSome type of "theme" for everyone.\nBest pick-up quest system ever.  Never too overwhelmed, but never left with nothing to do/find.\nFully repeatable content.\n\nCons:\nWeak, short, and disappointing main story (that basically says "hey, we will finish this later").\nVERY linear.  Incredible so.  You just going to be going from Zone A->B->C with no choice in the matter.\n8 "main zones" to quest in so a very small world.\nNo real reason to Re-roll since 95% of what you will be doing is the exact same quests.\nCan be rough for those who don't know MMO basics.\nWhile it tries to do everthing, it can be jarring in enviorment.  Like Solomen island?  Well thats it, it doesn't continue to be like that the next two area's.\n\nEndgame Instance (5 - man)\nPros:\nVery well done fights.\nBest loot pinata (wow style) dungeons ever made.\nThere is always something worth looting due to BB/upgrade system.\nMild flexibility\nDecent dungeon progression.\nEnjoyably repeatable.\nNicely defined roles\n\nCons:\nMeta seems to be require "X" from "Y" role.  Tank passive flexiblity is hit hard due to required passives.\nCan't skip cutscenes....EVER.  Its neat the first time, not the 100+ times.\nSome dungeons *Especially* the upper ones are buggy, and most likely will never be fixed.\nDungeons are very rarely expanded on.  Prepare for 1 new dungeon a year if it keeps at this rate.\nTop heavy so new players to endgame are left floundering unless they join specific channels etc.\n\nEndgame (Raid)\nPros:\nDecent fights, nothing grand, but not bad.\nNew York Raid (NYR) drop rates are fair.\nAlways a reason to raid NYR due to upgrade mechanic\nItem drops provide unique effects that are desired (NYR)\nPugs are often for raid content so guildless players have a shot (if they can manage to get invited w/o kill proof)\n\nCons:\nOnly 2 raids, but the Kingsmouth raid drops are so lackluster, by the time you can kill him he isn't worth it.\nOnly 1 really raid worth doing means you are stuck with the raid for a long time.\nNot much flexibility for guilds due to lockout + 10 man + 1 raid.\nRequires a decent machine to run it well.  Even 10 man's can get quite hefty.\nPugs often require kill proof leading to the WoW mindset of "Link acheezement first plz".","March 9, 2014","true","68.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

First, I really like the buy it once, no monthly fee model.  While the game didn't start out that way, it was that way by the time I got into it.  Second, the freedom in character development as far as what skills to get, and the unique (at least in my experience) way the weapons and skills work is very nice. I also like that in the main quests, all of the quest opening and closing cutscenes are actually voiced and acted out, while all the lore and everything you can collect can still give you a bit more backstory if you feel like spending some time with walls of texts.  Like any other online multiplayer game, this game does benefit quite a bit if you have some friends to join in on the adventure with you.","February 5, 2014","true","128.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played many between then and now and must say that The Secret World provides an amazing experience and does a solid job mixing up the MMO formula. It really can play like a normal single player game if you want, outside of doing dungeons a few group quests and some end game material you aren't forced to group with others.\n\nWith that said you will always run into people running around that if they see you struggling will generally give you a hand. Chat is mostly friendly with people offering to help or looking for groups. The class system is open ended. You build your character as you want. You aren't restricted and being forced to reroll, you just swap out your abilities and can change your playstyle or role in a group just like that. Obviously some builds are more optimized than others but part of the fun can be trying something different or new out. The great thing is you can unlock everything on one character. Sure it will take a long time but it is feasible. You start the game by selecting one weapon and as soon as you gain your first SP, you can unlock a second if you will. Having said that, you can only ever have 2 weapons equipped at any time but between combat you can swap them. This means you can use only active abilities for the weapons you currently have equipped.\n\nCombat plays out with a universal 1 second global cooldown with more specialized and powerful abilities having extended timers or requirements such as building up charges for effectiveness. You also have a dodge move that can pull you out of the fire, sometimes literally, fairly frequently.\n\nNow I want to tell you that it does a wonderful job with the horror themes and mythology. The voice acting...works but the dialogue is generally well written and each quest giver has their own personality and self contained reasons or stories for being involved. Mission variety is fairly standard ranging from gather "x" to kill "y" but where the missions really shine are the dungeon/group activities and the investigation missions. Both require you to actually think while some require you to just check for the solution online as it presupposes an understanding of say a long dead language. They make whatever you have played before from Point and Click Adventure games to Silent Hill/ Resident Evil/ Horror genre tropes look like grade school.\n\nThe game does have an item shop that contains mostly comestic items and "issues" or DLC. TSW handles issues like DC Universe handles DLC. Now with TSW they also have the first 4 issues I believe for free to all players. So you'll just have to pick up the later ones and yes, they still are supporting the game with new issues and content on a frequent basis.\n\nThe visuals are ok, a bit dated for the time and some of the abilities have recycled animations as I stated earlier some of the voice acting is bad (normally in a good way though) but on the other side the aesthetics/atmosphere/environments, ability control/combo system, interesting story/monsters, solo/group play, puzzles/mission variety and taking place in a modern setting far exceed the negative things I have to say about the game.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Yes. I highly recommend it. Snag it on a sale and give it a shot. It's pay once and play which is no different than the next Bioshock DLC, Madden or Total War game except when it's on sale it is about the price, or actually lower than, the price of the Bioshock DLC but has far more potential to suck you down to the dark and wet city of R'lyeh and keep you there either until you go insane or you find the secret to The Secret World *cue X-Files music*.\n\nJ'ai fini","February 8, 2014","true","242.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a lore-driven MMO which seeks to immerse the player in tiered quest lines across multiple locales.

Basic stat grinding does not exist. The auction house, as with any MMO, can cripple the feeling of progressive improvement so I would avoid it. Atmospherically the game excells, although I will note the graphics are nothing to write home about. There is occasional framerate slow-downs and sometimes the camera angles can be difficult to set.

Yes, that is the true heart of this game. The setting is pretty simple, since basically, it's our modern world. Yet, it's so more complicated. The story is greatly told, with a lot of cinematics with good voice acting, and loads of quests that allow you to discover things you wouldn't even believe. There is especially one type of quest that I like, it's the investigation quests. Instead of giving you a goal and showing you how to go there/do it, it makes you search your way through it. Riddles and enigmas to decipher, to get through the quest and finally achieve your goal. It's really interesting.\nWhat's really interesting in this game is that it's really a MMO and a RPG. It really mixes a classical RPG with everything you have in a classical MMO: PvP, different builds, chat, dungeons, guildes, etc... It's not your boring MMO with meaningless quests, it has a real story and feels really cool.\nI mean, who never wished to be a Templar? These guys rock. Well, ok, the Dragon rocks too.\n\nBiggest downside? Once you reach "endgame", all you'll have left to do is grind a lot.\nYou will also have to buy what I can only call DLCs to go further in the game at a certain point.

With an i5-4210M (2.60GHz) and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M GPU, on low graphics settings this game tends to frequently stutter, especially during combat.  The developer needs to optimize the game better, but otherwise there's a lot of good and fun ideas to be had\n\nEDIT:  It seems the game runs very poorly on DirectX11, which would explain the poor optimization thing.  Running the game in DirectX9 allows it to run quite nicely and generally isn't choppy at all except when the game tries to load a crowd of players in (and that doesn't last very long).

Cutscenes are mediocre, with lots of out of sync lips when characters are talking but it's tolerable.\n\nThe network ping is pretty bad from time to time (from Australia) and the minimum latency is around 280ms so feels sluggish even though I'm running at 60fps.\n\nFull of helpful players and cabals (clans) that can make it a lot easier for newer players.\n\nLots of customisation and options to tinker with and it's easy enough to add friends or meet up with someone on the same server as you.","June 28, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game looks nice, sounds nice, and plays very well for how ambitious it is. The game boasts a large world and replayable missions while lacking tried and true character leveling instead opting for experience based skill and ability point on a threshold system. This lends itself to a feeling that no point spent is wasted. I highly recommend the game to anyone looking for a solid MMO with a moderate difficulty who isn't a fan of a monthly sub fee.

When I first heard about it, I figured it would be like Hunter: the Vigil but online, and settings-wise, it is similar.\n\nWhat has kept me playing are the NPCs and the ability system. I play with subtitles on and I take screenshots all the time because of the awesome, funny, or insightful things the NPCs say. Player abilities are built around selecting 2 weapons, 7 active powers and 7 passive powers. It gets more complicated as you go because synergies emerge as you earn powers that set conditions and then exploit them. There are no experience levels; content is separated mainly by the quality of your talismans (talismans because pants and shirts are divorced from in-game effect, freeing you to look how you want).\n\nGroup roles tend to fall into tanking, healing, support and damage. You are free to change roles any time you aren't fighting: just use the gear manager to switch between ability and equipment sets.\n\nEvery MMO seems to want to avoid the "kill 10 rats" type quests, but The Secret World is one of the few that succeeds. Those missions still exist, but they are clearly labeled Action and they appear along side Sabotage missions, where the player must avoid detection and Investigation missions, which actually require researching the clues on the Internet.\n\nPvP is the primary deficiency I've seen. It is kind of unpopular and my computer can't handle it. (Assault rifle particle effects can be crippling.)\n\nTL;DR - Not a straight WoW copy and great if you're into Lovecraft & World of Darkness","July 16, 2013","true","268.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First, there is no leveling. That's right. You gain experience and apply experience benchmarks towards skills and abilities. Your one character can conceivably learn how to do everything in the game. There is no cap on your advancement. This is a really cool aspect to the game. They balance this seemingly amazing gift with the fact that you can only ever have 7 active abilities and 7 passive ones. Many of these play off each other too, so it behooves one to play their character with a concept. The lore of the game is ripe with themes from H.P. Lovecraft also, so if this sort of horror appeals to you, then TSW is a real treat. Armor is gone, replaced by an assortment of magical treatments that provide you with the real armor against all of the unholy and undead things in the game. I would definitely recommend a visit to The Secret World if you haven't already. Its fun, it's a treat, it's really really different.\n","May 6, 2013","true","92.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics are good and if your graphics card is good enough, you can even get tesselation into the game which makes the game look pretty awesome. The game is also optimized pretty badly, it runs mostly in quite good fps but there are some places which makes your fps spike pretty low, especially if you use the tesselation.\n\nWhat makes this MMO stand out from every other MMO's currently available is that the "class system" is unique and works pretty well, because you can make your own "class". What would be cooler than playing with a group where one player uses firearms, one magic abilities and another a mixture of melee and magic? The class system is so cool that you can even mix two different types of abilities into one. There isn't any levels in the game, complete quests and kill enemies to gain ability points which are used to unlock more abilities for you to use.\n\nAlso, the game takes place in present time. The enemies are mostly created from different urban legends which makes them quite interesting and unique from other MMO's. The storyline kind of mixes things with real life, urban legends and myths which makes it really interesting and different. One of the things I like the most with the quests are the research missions, which tells you what you need to find out, then you use the in-game browser and find out the answers yourself to continue the mission. Sometimes it is too hard to find out the answers yourself though, so you need to find a mission walkthrough to get past one obstacle, but they are pretty fun and sometimes they make you involved deeper into the story.\n\nAlthough, the early stages of the game is pretty easy with a group, I recommend playing this with a few friends. The game gets tougher when continuing towards the end, and once you progress long enough you can't solo the quests anymore. One of the biggest reasons why you should play with a group, and it is more fun than playing alone.\n\nIf you want a good MMO, which is different from other MMO's at the moment, you want this one.

Considering that it's only $30 when not on sale and that you can easily get over a hundred *fun* hours off of it (which, sadly, my steam profile doesn't reflect since I originally played before I realized that TSW was on steam) and that on sale it could even go down to $5, I can't recommend it more.\n\nLong story short:\n-Kinda bad combat system that takes some getting used to\n-Cutscenes before a lot of quests (when the quest giver is human, of course)\n-Long story quest that gives you an actual reason to go to the different zones (unlike a certain game made by blizzard)\n-Non level-based experience system (you still gain experience, but you get a certain number of ability points or skill points after a set amount of experience that never increases; you get to choose where the points go, rather than being what the game wants you to be. Sandbox elements too good.)\n-HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ THE INVESTIGATION MISSION. THE ♥♥♥♥ING IMMERSION IS STUPIDLY GOOD.\n-Press b to bring up a functional internet brower in-game (which is used for a lot of quests)\n-The amount of effort put in by the devs is too damn high (http://www.kingsmouth.com/ = the website for the first town you go to. There are twitter accounts for important characters, and other websites for important companies)\n-Immersion immersion immersion\n-Stuff\n-Things\n-If its on sale, buy it\n-etc\n\nYes, I recommend this. It might not have taken 5000+ hours out of my life like Maplestory or WoW, but I'll be damned if TSW isn't a good $30 game.

No classes, you can decide how you want to play. Tank, DPS, Healer, Hybrid. There aren't alot of dungeons in the game, but they're always fun to repeat. The game gets alot of content updates (including new dungeons). You can choose from three factions at the start of Character Creation, in which you can level and exile. Every faction has it's own features, advantages or disadvantages. You got to try the game out, the story and the ambience are just amazing. The graphics rock even on low settings. So please try it out, it's worth a shot! (Maybe even two.)\n\n8.6/10","January 18, 2014","true","96.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Considering that it's only $30 when not on sale and that you can easily get over a hundred *fun* hours off of it (which, sadly, my steam profile doesn't reflect since I originally played before I realized that TSW was on steam) and that on sale it could even go down to $5, I can't recommend it more.\n\nLong story short:\n-Kinda bad combat system that takes some getting used to\n-Cutscenes before a lot of quests (when the quest giver is human, of course)\n-Long story quest that gives you an actual reason to go to the different zones (unlike a certain game made by blizzard)\n-Non level-based experience system (you still gain experience, but you get a certain number of ability points or skill points after a set amount of experience that never increases; you get to choose where the points go, rather than being what the game wants you to be. Sandbox elements too good.)\n-HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ THE INVESTIGATION MISSION. THE ♥♥♥♥ING IMMERSION IS STUPIDLY GOOD.\n-Press b to bring up a functional internet brower in-game (which is used for a lot of quests)\n-The amount of effort put in by the devs is too damn high (http://www.kingsmouth.com/ = the website for the first town you go to. There are twitter accounts for important characters, and other websites for important companies)\n-Immersion immersion immersion\n-Stuff\n-Things\n-If its on sale, buy it\n-etc\n\nYes, I recommend this. It might not have taken 5000+ hours out of my life like Maplestory or WoW, but I'll be damned if TSW isn't a good $30 game. Also, no subscription needed.\n","January 18, 2014","true","44.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I can't get enough of it. Been playing it non stop recently and I don't think it'll end anytime soon. The game mechanics are superb for the style of gameplay it utilizes. Gunplay and melee combat and spectacularly executed, and I have seen few games that can pull it off. Especially in an RPG style game like this. The magic is also well done. Each weapon and fighting style can be combined in hundreds, if not thousands of different ways! The skill trees and the abilities are very well done as well as thought out. Once you learn it, it becomes quite easy to figure out what you want to do with your character, and at that point, the posibilities become endless.\n\n!!! - To start, one of the most important things I really want to mention about this game is it's setting and style. It is MODERN DAY. And there are no fairies or anything! Which is a really fresh getup with the game. Now you're probably thinking, "There are muthical creatures in this game!" Yes! There are! And each one of them are gruesome, disgusting and AWESOME! They look beautiful. Much different from a futuristic and fairytale style setting. Oh! And I forgot to mention. It has the Illuminati, Templars and Dragons! Secret Societies for FACTIONS!? That's a win/win for everyone.\n\n!!! - You could become a pistol dueling swordsman, a elemental mage who uses shotguns, and even an Assault rifle marksman who bashes enemies heads in with a HAMMER! The combinations and playstyles very in so many forms it takes player variety to a whole new level. I still have yet to use all the weapons and magics with all their main inner ring abilities.\n\n!!! - The questing as well! Man oh man, whoever designed the quest lines and missions on this game knew what the heck they were doing! Along with the main storyline that you play along(which is also extremely compelling) you are allowed to do extra missions along the way with an additional set of 3 extra side missions possible. Now they are not given to you, but as you move to your next objectives you can pick them up along the way, rewarding you with money and some awesome trinkets and gear.\n\n!!! - The game mechanics are also something extremely notable. The way combat is done is fairly simple and straight forward. It is hotkey based but is simplified to the first 7 number keys on your keyboard. You can apply 7 active combat or supportive abilities of which are all really fricking awesome! Along with that, passive abilities (7 of them as well) can be activated as well! This makes loadouts limited, but it allows  you to experiment with combat combinations and permutations.\n\n!*!*! -As for the bad parts, there is few to say but the ones that are there are something to note of. Grinding is definitely an aspect of this game, but it doesn't really feel like it as you have much to explore and kill. But repetitive killing will come if you are focusing on acquiring AP and SP points. And there is no Leveling up system, which is pretty cool but it makes guidelines for the newer players hard to follow as they try to progress.\n\n!*!*! - The monsters and enemies on this game are a problem as well, especially when trying to get through the storyline. Determining whether you can fight and KILL the monster you are about to engage is hard to predict since there is no definite sign. Fighting something you can't kill is of serious consequence since you have no real ability to flee. The storyline throws you through missions/tiers quickly, meaning you get through the mission faster than your character can keep up with. So you WILL have to grind and wait a bit to be able to kill or fight the monsters coming up in the next section of the mission.\n\n!*!*! - The learning curve on this game is also a bit of a moderate level. The interface and hotkey tutorials is easily forgotten so you will have to dock some time into learning it. Understanding some of the combat mechanics such as Resource Pooling and Ability screening can be a bit tricky. Figuring out what your supposed to do, how to get stronger character wise, how to get better clothes and MUCH better gear can also be a bit of an issue for new players unless they delve into some research. Noobies might find it frustrating a bit to figure out what they're doing.\n\nThe All in All:\n\nPROS\n-The Factions are Illuminati, Templars and Dragons. Awesome in a box.\n-New and Fresh setting. Set in the Modern Day rather than fairies and Knights in shining armor.\n-$29.99 is a GREAT price for what you're getting.\n-Combat is fun and well executed.\n-Great Mission and Questing opportunities\n-Graphics won't murder your computer. (CPU may be an issue)\n-Thousands of different play styles and combat combinations.\n-Really. Fricking. Fun.\n\nCONS\n-Learning the game is a bit tricky.\n-Character Development vs Monster Progression is hard to keep up with.\n-Some might find the game a bit repetitive in combat.(Vary your playstyles as you go through! Don't stick to one or two weapons!)\n-Most of the ways to make yourself look cool is by paying REAL MONEY. But it is not a requirement. Faction armor is provided.\n\nThe Verdict, Should you buy this game?\nYES! For 30 bucks you are getting a SWEET deal. Any MMORPG fan is going to fall in love with this game. The factions are each unique and great! The weapons and magics are all cool and well designed. The quests feel endless. For not subscriptions, this is a MUST BUY! This is definitely a 9/10. I say 9/10 since there are definitely some fixe(not just bugs) and tweaks dearly needed. But otherwise, almost perfect. Get. This. Game.","February 9, 2014","true","74.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The early and middle parts of the game are rich, interesting story, supplemented by detailed environments, memorable characters and enemies, and well-written plots. The endgame is a punishing grind for gear and skills. Additionally, the latest holiday events were grind-fests, as well.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes.

I bought it when it was first released and played for years to come.\n\nSince I've tried to find an MMO that I felt had as much depth as well as a breathtaking atmosphere and nothing could compare.  That is until I got my mitts on The Secret World (again by Funcom - it appears they got my number).  So, I'll break it down into a few categories outlining my favorite part of this game.\n\nStory:\nOne of the largest problems I have with MMOs is that I live in Japan, a time zone that makes it difficult to get online during the busiest hours of play.  Usually when I hop into an MMO is sparsely populated and just finding a team can be nearly impossible.  Therefore, it's necessary that an MMO have a solo experience that is every bit as strong as the multiplayer experience.  On this, The Secret World does not disappoint.  The questing and story mission are some of the best I've ever experienced in any game, much less an MMO.  The number of story missions, main missions and side missions is staggering, but what's even more staggering is that they all interweave into each other, contributing to the overarching story as a whole.  Everything feels connected and it's the most rewarding solo experience in a game I've played to date.\n\nMultiplayer:\nAt first, I thought the multiplayer aspect of the game was sorely lacking, but upon joining the Sanctuary chat channel and finally getting powerful enough to start enjoying dungeons, playing with a team really opened up.  Even though there aren't that many dungeons available, they're of the quality that I relish playing them over and over with different teams.  The enjoyment comes not from figuring out the dungeon, but figuring out how best to work with your team members.  You can constantly tweak your build to fill in gaps in your defense or build up your offense.  What this results in is that at the beginning of the dungeon, when the team is still freshly formed, the team is weak.  As you plunder through the dungeon, each member slowly tweaks their build and play style to work well with their teammates and by the time you reach the boss of the dungeon, you're team is working together like a well oiled machine, soaking up hits while dishing out the pain.  Or, if you don't gel well with your team and try to figure out the best way to work together, you all die.\n\nCharacter depth:\nThe reason the multiplayer aspect works so well is because of the depth of the character build system.  There are no classes, you can learn any weapon on the fly.  You can be a healer for a particularly tough fight, but on the easier parts, you can switch over to a damage dealer and help knock the enemies down faster.  Or, you can build a leech healer that steals HP every time you deal damage, creating a nearly indestructible solo build.  The ability wheel at first seemed simple, buy the most expensive abilities and equip those.  You can't think about individual abilities, just like the theme in multiplayer, you have to think about which active abilities and which passive abilities play well with each other.  As you dive deeper into the ability wheel, you start to realize the complexity of it all.  This allows countless different builds and allows you to make a really unique character that tailors perfectly to your play style.  It requires some serious thought though.  I have a stack of notes on my desk of build ideas (some borrowed from others, some my own creation and some blends of the two) that I try out depending on the situation.  Additionally, there is no one universal build.  There is so much diversity in the enemies you come across that sometimes you have to use a completely different build just to survive.  This is by far one of the most rewarding aspects of the game.\n\nAtmosphere:\nGraphics have come a long way since the days of Anarchy Online.  This game is nothing short of gorgeous.  I have a fairly serious PC (Phenom II X6, Radeon HD 1950, 32GB DDR3) and I still only manage an average of 30 FPS, so keep that in mind.  The visuals are stunning and each area has its own unique feel.  Nothing feels like it has been reused or recycled.  But, in a way, this game reminds me of the Stalker series of games.  It's not just about pure graphical power, because in that sense, there are many games out there that can outshine it.  It's about the whole package  The visuals, the sound, the music, it all works in wonderful unison to pull you into the game.  It's so easy to get caught up in the atmosphere and depth that I often found myself completely letting the real world surrounding me dissolve and disappear (much to the chagrin of my significant other).\n\nCommunity:\nI've found that the community is even better than the community in Anarchy Online, which is to say, amazing.  The Sanctuary chat channel in particular is a godsend.  Some of the most helpful people I've ever met in a game, I've met in this game.  Everyone is good natured, willing to answer any questions (no matter how menial they may seem), and even help us lowbies battle through some of the more particularly difficult situations.  Getting into a Cabal (the equivalent of a guild or org) is taking the wonderful community and adding in a very strong sense of camaraderie.  The community is always active, helpful, fun and downright pleasant.\n\nOverall:\nIf you would have asked me in my first 10 to 15 hours of play what I thought of the game, I would have said it was good but not great.  If you were to ask me now (at just 150 hours in), I would say it's downright amazing.  The game unfolds piece by piece, drawing you in further and further.  If you're looking for a unique gaming experience you can share with thousands of wonderful people, this is your one stop shop.","June 19, 2015","true","491.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm just here to brown nose a little.\n\nI don't write reviews, ever, but for this game I can make an exception. It's story telling is genius, its graphics don't even need to be good (Even though they are) because they way they've managed to capture the atmosphere is so perfect that I lack words to describe it, and the voice acting is top of the line.\n\nThe Secret World is like playing through a really good psychological suspenful, mystery, horror movie. I captures all of the best elements of story telling and its lore has a deceptive depth to it. For the life of me I cannot understand why this game hangs on the fringes as something of a cult "classic" when it has the potential to be something huge.\n\nBetween solving puzzles and wracking my brain dechipering codes or unravelling painfully obscure mysteries I find myself at a loss for exactly how to convey just how much I like this game. It's strange really. The feeling it gives from the music right down to the appropirate scenery. Every lovecraftian thing, every eldritch monstrocity seems enough to make anyone's skin crawl with creep, fear, and confusion.\n\nIn more than 100 hours of gameplay I've played solo, I've not completely a single dungeon, and I still find this game incredibly entertaining.\n\nI'll say this and shut up. The story writers for this game could have easily written a series of novels and even the scripts for award winning movies. Hell, even a television series would be mindblowing with the kind of writing they do. I don't know what intellects they have behind it all (Never watched the credits) but these folks are top notch.","August 7, 2015","true","171.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In presentation alone it’s a huge breath of fresh air..\n\nThe game is “buy to play,” requiring an initial purchase with further subscription being optional. The benefits to a subscription are an “item of the month” ranging from unique pets to clothing items, a once-a-day XP booster, a 10% discount in the item store, and, most notably, ten dollars worth of currency for said item store. The store itself is home to a great deal of items, but they can ultimately be placed into two categories: Cosmetic and Boosts; even the mystery Loot Crates only provide semi-randomized bonuses that fall into the second category. Paying real money for anything that affects gameplay is really only buying an accelerator for one kind of progression or another, and progression is nowhere near slow enough to make the player feel shoehorned into spending money if they don’t want to. In fact, it’s probably far more likely you’ll find a pair of pants you really want for your character in the item store than a boost you can’t live without.\n\nBeing effective in combat is more about planning out builds and skill rotation than spamming abilities; players have a fairly limited number of active abilities at any given time, split between any combination of two weapon classes. Some combinations are, of course, better than others, but most weapons have something to offer any given role. The MMO “holy trinity” is present in any activity requiring a group, but because the game is classless and every player eventually learns every skill, there is significant wiggle room. One (in)famous dungeon is often done with a self-healing tank, for example, while the group’s healer switches over to dedicated damage-dealing. Another dungeon usually sees the damage-dealers also playing support roles to help the healer deal with the bosses’ tendency to spam damage-over-time effects.\n\nAside from things specifically meant for groups, the main meat of the game can be experienced from start to finish by a solo player, although this severely limits play options; a soloist will have to be able to survive on their own, requiring some form of healing or tanking ability, usually the former. Co-op’ing the story and sidequests with even a single friend can result in a much more diversified experience with players able to pick and choose roles, but the capability of solo play allows players who wouldn’t normally be interested in a social experience to treat the game like a normal RPG with drop in/drop out co-op. While endgame dungeon grinds can’t be done solo by any means, the entire story can be played through without ever touching the endgame grind. A player uninterested in making the numbers on their gear go up will not find themselves hindered in advancing the plot.\n\nThe story itself puts most single-player RPGs to shame. NPCs are lovingly voice-acted and animated, reflected in the game’s 40GB install size. Moreover, they are written as interesting people and do not lose the player to apathy while waiting for them to just say what item they need five of brought to them. Mechanics like player resurrection don’t just have lampshades hung on them, but are actually important to the setting; being dead and looking for something of interest on the other side is required for solving more than one quest. The actual plot twists and turns around the game’s various locations, avoiding frustration by giving the player character actual progress in solving the various mysteries before bringing up new ones. There is a lot of story to go through; sidequests often provide relevant information, if not easy access to the in-game codex, giving a reason to do them beyond the XP reward. Unfortunately, the plot does not vary greatly between the different factions; the different NPCs one must deal with provide greater variety between them than the faction specific missions, although a point in those missions’ favor is that they are each actually the same mission as seen differently by each organization. Still, at no point did I find myself not caring what happens next, and not just for the main plot. The player is actively encouraged to wander around Elder Scrolls style (though the game world is nowhere near as large as that comparison may imply, unfortunately,) exploring everything. Many quests are found in the wild instead of being given by NPC questgivers, and almost every quest involves exploring the setting in some way, even if it’s only fighting back a nasty overgrowth of the local eldritch horror.\n\nQuests are built with the setting in mind. An entire subset of quests is labeled as “Investigation,” and the game is not kidding. These often require serious thought and observation of details, a far cry from the usual MMO fetch quest. The fact that your character is given a high-end smartphone in the beginning is not just for flavor, as you will often use the in-game web browser to check information from company websites and blogs, or, if you’re very poor at puzzle solving like I am, to google the solution. There is absolutely no shame in giving up on a quest or three in this game. While the investigation missions may be unforgiving, they are rarely illogical and progress naturally; finishing one without cheating feels like one has made a genuine triumph instead of feeling like one has worked around obtuse design.\n\nIf anything is obtuse, it’s not the quest design but, rather, the UI. Why a game that has not one but two quests involving morse code does not come standard with an in-game notepad is beyond me. Fortunately, many of the UI’s shortcomings (including the lack of a notepad) can be solved with third-party plugins. Quests are also not bug-free, but the developers have been very diligent in fixing them since release. They're also very attentive towards the player base; not only do events happen regularly, they last long enough for anyone interested to achieve even the most grindy of goals and once-in-the-game’s-lifetime rewards without playing the game non-stop for a week on end.\n\nThe game does not have in-depth PvP, but what’s there is functional. Enough people play it that you’ll end up in a queue for the PvP areas more often than not. Starting players will have a stat boost when entering PvP so it can be played at any point in character progression, not just end-game. Effectiveness is entirely based on build, and the game encourages different builds not only for different situations, but for the different activities as well. A standard solo build will be less effective in a dungeon, a standard dungeon build will be less effective in the Scenario activities where each player must have some level of survivability instead of relying purely on the healer. The game makes it relatively easy to manage different builds with an easy menu for saving them and then switching between different ones.\n\nThe graphics do not disappoint. High settings put a high amount of detail on everything, from paved road to grass to buildings to clothing. The game is fairly scalable but meeting the minimum system requirements are a must, the developers have not been conservative with them. If you choose to roll a Dragon, be prepared for an experience with the uncanny valley in the intro; by and large, however, the game avoids this problem. The writhing Filth lives up to the horror people speak of it with. The baked desert of Egypt is, as it should be, a far cry from soggy, dreary New England.\n\nThe Secret World brings some much-needed variety into the MMO space, not just for the setting, but for the effort put into quest design that makes accomplishing things both interesting and fulfilling.","March 20, 2014","true","228.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So, I'll break it down into a few categories outlining my favorite part of this game.\n\nStory:\nOne of the largest problems I have with MMOs is that I live in Japan, a time zone that makes it difficult to get online during the busiest hours of play.  Usually when I hop into an MMO is sparsely populated and just finding a team can be nearly impossible.  Therefore, it's necessary that an MMO have a solo experience that is every bit as strong as the multiplayer experience.  On this, The Secret World does not disappoint.

Even though there aren't that many dungeons available, they're of the quality that I relish playing them over and over with different teams.  The enjoyment comes not from figuring out the dungeon, but figuring out how best to work with your team members.  You can constantly tweak your build to fill in gaps in your defense or build up your offense.  What this results in is that at the beginning of the dungeon, when the team is still freshly formed, the team is weak.  As you plunder through the dungeon, each member slowly tweaks their build and play style to work well with their teammates and by the time you reach the boss of the dungeon, you're team is working together like a well oiled machine, soaking up hits while dishing out the pain.  Or, if you don't gel well with your team and try to figure out the best way to work together, you all die.\n\nCharacter depth:\nThe reason the multiplayer aspect works so well is because of the depth of the character build system.  There are no classes, you can learn any weapon on the fly.  You can be a healer for a particularly tough fight, but on the easier parts, you can switch over to a damage dealer and help knock the enemies down faster.  Or, you can build a leech healer that steals HP every time you deal damage, creating a nearly indestructible solo build.  The ability wheel at first seemed simple, buy the most expensive abilities and equip those.  You can't think about individual abilities, just like the theme in multiplayer, you have to think about which active abilities and which passive abilities play well with each other.  As you dive deeper into the ability wheel, you start to realize the complexity of it all.  This allows countless different builds and allows you to make a really unique character that tailors perfectly to your play style.  It requires some serious thought though.  I have a stack of notes on my desk of build ideas (some borrowed from others, some my own creation and some blends of the two) that I try out depending on the situation.  Additionally, there is no one universal build.  There is so much diversity in the enemies you come across that sometimes you have to use a completely different build just to survive.  This is by far one of the most rewarding aspects of the game.\n\nAtmosphere:\nGraphics have come a long way since the days of Anarchy Online.  This game is nothing short of gorgeous.  I have a fairly serious PC (Phenom II X6, Radeon HD 1950, 32GB DDR3) and I still only manage an average of 30 FPS, so keep that in mind.  The visuals are stunning and each area has its own unique feel.  Nothing feels like it has been reused or recycled.  But, in a way, this game reminds me of the Stalker series of games.  It's not just about pure graphical power, because in that sense, there are many games out there that can outshine it.  It's about the whole package  The visuals, the sound, the music, it all works in wonderful unison to pull you into the game.  It's so easy to get caught up in the atmosphere and depth that I often found myself completely letting the real world surrounding me dissolve and disappear (much to the chagrin of my significant other).\n\nCommunity:\nI've found that the community is even better than the community in Anarchy Online, which is to say, amazing.  The Sanctuary chat channel in particular is a godsend.  Some of the most helpful people I've ever met in a game, I've met in this game.  Everyone is good natured, willing to answer any questions (no matter how menial they may seem), and even help us lowbies battle through some of the more particularly difficult situations.  Getting into a Cabal (the equivalent of a guild or org) is taking the wonderful community and adding in a very strong sense of camaraderie.  The community is always active, helpful, fun and downright pleasant.\n\nOverall:\nIf you would have asked me in my first 10 to 15 hours of play what I thought of the game, I would have said it was good but not great.  If you were to ask me now (at just 150 hours in), I would say it's downright amazing.  The game unfolds piece by piece, drawing you in further and further.  If you're looking for a unique gaming experience you can share with thousands of wonderful people, this is your one stop shop.","June 19, 2015","true","491.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm just here to brown nose a little.\n\nI don't write reviews, ever, but for this game I can make an exception. It's story telling is genius, its graphics don't even need to be good (Even though they are) because they way they've managed to capture the atmosphere is so perfect that I lack words to describe it, and the voice acting is top of the line.\n\nThe Secret World is like playing through a really good psychological suspenful, mystery, horror movie. I captures all of the best elements of story telling and its lore has a deceptive depth to it. For the life of me I cannot understand why this game hangs on the fringes as something of a cult "classic" when it has the potential to be something huge.\n\nBetween solving puzzles and wracking my brain dechipering codes or unravelling painfully obscure mysteries I find myself at a loss for exactly how to convey just how much I like this game. It's strange really. The feeling it gives from the music right down to the appropirate scenery. Every lovecraftian thing, every eldritch monstrocity seems enough to make anyone's skin crawl with creep, fear, and confusion.\n\nIn more than 100 hours of gameplay I've played solo, I've not completely a single dungeon, and I still find this game incredibly entertaining.\n\nI'll say this and shut up. The story writers for this game could have easily written a series of novels and even the scripts for award winning movies. Hell, even a television series would be mindblowing with the kind of writing they do. I don't know what intellects they have behind it all (Never watched the credits) but these folks are top notch.","August 7, 2015","true","171.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ephelduath/recommended/215280/","ephelduath","pimpin' ain't easy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ephelduath/","1024 products in account","TSW is an action adventure game with MMORPG mechanics (combat, PvP, group content). The writing and art design are all excellent - enough to warrant a satisfying single player experience! If you're a fan of Gaiman, Lovecraft or King - you'll love the setting. Horror is a main theme here and there are many "nope" moments.\n\nI've been playing this game since early access and the story/setting still messes up my head big time. It slowly builds from mysterious text messages, words hastily written on torn-out pages, whispers from the faucet. To get a glimpse of what's happening, you have to piece it from lore entries, dialogues, small hints in dialogues or hacked emails.\n\nThe production value is very high. Most quests have fully voiced cutscenes and there's a lot of unique art assets - all items you investigate have their own art work (cell phones, books, notes etc.).\n\nThis is one of the most challenging MMOs I've played - both quests and combat require thought and skill. Investigation missions are hard, but even the basic missions require some investigating (in most cases you actually have to figure out where to go). Many quests play like an adventure game - you have to hack computers, combine items, finding hidden objects, solve environmental. Combat requires a lot of movement and the limit on active/passive skills requires a good setup.\n\nThe game goes very cheap on sales and the basic purchase gives you full access to PvP, dungeons and raids. Subscription is totally optional and just gives you a small xp boost, points to spend in shop and a vanity item. There are paid mission packs released every few months and some of them are good to have for high-end gaming. The game shop is mostly xp boosting and clothing - there are "magic boxes", but it's nothing major (everything you get from them can be obtained by normal means).\n\nBRAINBONER 428/10","July 17, 2013","true","365.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I Love this Game and I Don't know why.\n\nMaybe its the design, maybe its the way the system opens up as you get more Xp, or how no ability is locked off to you without Reason (Story Spoilers for why 1-2 Abilities are locked.. so i won't get into it). The "Deck" design for building your character is nice and gives decent hints for how to play different Playstyles, In-game tutorials are there if you need them for most of the Systems that are in the Game... And the Community is Generally friendly.\n\nThe story is fun (For Me atleast) and goes into directions that are predictable sometimes and sometimes a Complete Curveball (Transyvania and Dracula are one of the more interesting ones). Then there is the Lore entries... You don't just get one or 2 pieces of information about whats going on or Concepts.. you get massive logs to look though that give enough information to sate most people.. and those things it doesn't answer? It's usually just not something you've found yet...\n\nOverall I recommend The Secret World.... It's a Fun Romp though a Modern World that's going though a Magical Apocalypse as Cthuluoid entities (And Things MUCH WORSE) are waking up and breaking into our reality....\n\nThe Dreamer's Wake, How will you stop them?","May 26","true","691.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's game world is very fun to play in. Now that this went subscriptionless, it is definitely worth the one time cost of $30. It breaks away from the monotony that every new MMO brings by being unique in that unlike all other MMO's, it is set in our real world and every horry story is true: secret societies, zombies, vampires, werewolves, illuminati, gay marriage, all the nightmares are real. So unlike games like World of Jack Black Kung Fu Panda Craft, it is not a big looney tunes f--kfest. It also actually makes you use your brain sometimes to figure out tough investigative quests. There are also no levels in the game: you gain ability and skill points to use on upgrading your ability to wear higher quality weapons and armor and to buy new active/passive abilities.\nThe dungeons in the game are the best dungeons I've ever played through in a mmo because of one thing: they don't ♥♥♥♥ around and waste your time. It's straight up boss after boss after boss fight with only a couple of filler mobs in between bosses, but mostly it's just back to back to back bosses. Dungeons are quick and rewarding, the way it should be. No ♥♥♥♥ing around with piddly little who-gives-a-♥♥♥♥ easymode mobs.\nThe biggest drawbacks about the game are that combat is a bit on the generic side, the ability system is awkward and somewhat confusing for quite a while until you get the hang of it and ask a lot of questions about it in general chat, and the game, despite being out over 2 years now, is still buggy. I am always discovering some new bulls--t technical problem with it that I have to email their tech support about. I've never had the kind of odd problems I have with this game with any other game ever before, but they are not deal breaking problems; I can still play the game relatively fine. That is until I hang at a load screen and have to restart the game once in a while. Funcom sucks ♥♥♥♥♥ at making pc games... The combat and ability system and technical issues are what I think to be the reasons this game went f2p in a year's time, but it gets a bit more satisfying the deeper you play into the game. The ability wheel system could have been done way better though. Groupmaking could be way better implemented also.\nBesides that, the reason it is for sure worth playing is everything else it offers. Its real-world setting and original story are a nice fresh take on an otherwise bogged down genre that has become way, way too over-cliched with the fantasy and dragons gimmick. I love fantasy and dragons, but God damn take it easy on that ♥♥♥♥. This game could also be optimized much, much better so it runs better, but does not detract too much from the fun. A nice game, pick it up for some interesting fun. Unless you are an adult toddler queer who likes World of Jack Black School of Rock Kung Fu Panda Big Bird Teletubbies Craft.","June 26, 2015","true","156.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In fact, it's probably the best RPG I've ever played.\n\nThe endgame is thin. Mostly just running dungeons, which is difficult to the lack of a proper tool to find groups. The PvP... don't even touch the PvP.\n\nBut you know what? None of that matters. This isn't the sort of game where endgame is all that matters. It has other strengths to draw upon.\n\nThe story is unbelievably good, featuring some of the best writing and character development you will ever seen in a video game. The ambiance is haunting and creepy, with incredibly good SFX that really makes you feel like you're living it live. There are some very original (and challenging) stealth and puzzle missions that do a great job of imparting the feeling of ancient mystery and creeping dread.\n\nSome complain about the combat, but in my experience, most of those complaints come from people who haven't taken the time to study the ability wheel and find a build that suits them. I find the combat very exciting, and far more challenging than your average WoW clone.\n\nI also very much appreciate the adaptability of the classless system. If you find a situation your build is unsuited for, you can just change like a chameleon. It's very satisfying to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you, come back with a tweaked build, and faceroll the monsters who were slaughtering you minutes before.\n\nAlso love that gear and clothing are two separate things, so you can dress however you want. This game is a virtual fashionista's wet dream.\n\nThe business model is also very generous. No mandatory subscription, no lock-boxes, no pay-to-win.\n\nOverall, TSW is a very challenging game with a steep learning curve, but if you have the patience to master its intricacies, it will pay major dividends with its impeccable storytelling and rich progression system.","December 4, 2013","true","687.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game puts a new spin on the mmorpg genre while still keeping with familiar gameplay mechanics.  This game does not hold your hand, in fact it barely helps you at all, and I love it.  There are no levels, instead you gain skills through experience that are weapon based, and you can use as many weapons as you want, switching entire gear sets on the fly, changing up your gear, as well as your active and passive skill sets.  The setting is very dark, with a ton of different monsters to slay and the tiered questing system is also very cool.  The devs are still involved and very active, the community is actually really great, and the game caters to solo and group play, so whatever your style you can find your niche in The Secret World.

If you want the full experience and if you want to show off some style, be it with pets, clothes, emotes or dances, be prepared to fork out some more cash for the rest of the expansions (Issue 12 has already been announced).\nThe gameplay however is freaking amah-zing! You start off as a loser who swallows a bee (yeah what an idiot right?) WRONG! You suddenly get super/magical powers and one of the three conspiracy factions shows upandtells you they want you to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up on their behalf.\nSo now you either get a gun, a bashy or slicy stick or a magical trinket that makes you poop fairy dust (oh and charr enemies with your freaking eyes).\n\nSo get up kiddies and swallow a bee :D (don't. Just don't.) And join us in the magical adventures that TSW has to offer. Believe me the storytelling in this game is so off the freaking charts that you'll sink hundreds of hours into the game before you realise you lost your job and your wife left you. Don't get me wrong this is not a hating review, I'm addicted to this game like noone else.\n\nOh and a GIANTass plus for this game is that EVERY single main and story mission has FULLY VOICED CUTSCENES and i'm not talking about people that just phoned in their voices, no im talking about pain staking voiceacting for EVERY single character you meet. And the characters even have personality! (Suck it WOW) And this isn't just another fetch me this and that grind game, no one mission ends where another begins, usually interconnected with (again) FULLY VOICED CUTSCENES :D so it feels like a really organic experience :3\nIt's also set in a modern day setting where monsters decided to ruin everyones day and started ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up...\nBut who cares!

The ideas Funcom had were superb, The game's tone is as sinister and mysterious as intended. I can only recommend it for its vibe, and I suggest to everyone who is interested watching the first two hours of the game on Youtube.\n\nWhere the game falls flat (for me) is the approach to player friendliness, or User Experience, as it is called in the software industry outside of gaming. User Experience is horrendous. Google for "secret world frustrating" and you will see what I mean. Many of the quests have you running or clicking around aimlessly, as you cannot find what you are supposed to do, or where you are supposed to do it. TSW's idea of mission design is like giving lego pieces to somone who has never seen any, and tell them "Play!".\n\nThey follow the same route with the brilliant idea how a character's skills are built, then leaving the player completely in the dark how to do it efficiently, so that you can actually play the game. The forums do not help either, as the majority of good advice is from players who left in 2012 and 2013. With the game's changes since then, their advice no longer works, and trying to understand what experienced players talk about is like reading a foreign language without a dictionary.\n\nSome players claim that the game is the Thinking Man's MMO. They are entitled to their opinion. I view it as the Unfinished MMO that would have needed another two years of design and development, and with that it could have been a great title.\n\nI am utterly disappointed, as the game could have been so much more.","April 26, 2015","false","130.9"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","22","43","0","0"

And why would that ever be bad?\n\nThe story is absolutely captivating, the details put into every aspect of it are bound to catch any fan of horror/sci-fi and it is lovely, as a long-time fan of Ragnar Tornquist's work, to see tiny elements of The Longest Journey in there.\n\nIt brings something new to the MMO genre and while it's certainly not for everyone, its uniqueness and niche content are certain to draw only the truly interested. It's never going to be BIG, but it's never going to suffer the social downsides of more generic MMOs like Guild Wars, Rift or WoW. TSW is a mature game catered to a specific niche audience, and it's great at what it does.\n\nAs a downside, combat can and often is either repetitive or frustrating. Builds require a lot of tinkering and calibration to be made viable, but in the world of Google this can be easily by-passed by looking up various builds perfected by the community and just using those. Therein comes the second problem: repetition. Rotation-based combat works, but people are getting bored of it and many modern MMOs are doing their best to steer away from it. Not TSW sadly, and I often find myself pressing 12311111241111... ad infinitum until something is dead. Thankfully, the necessity for dodging out of the way of many attacks keeps me on my toes, and is one of the things keeping combat from being unbearably dull. But hey! Repetitve combat gives me the chance to spend my time admiring the awesome monster models, which are beautifully designed, crafted and animated.\n\nIn all, fantastic game with some mechanical drawbacks, but as long as you don't mind mashing buttons, you're going to enjoy the hell out of it (literally, perhaps).","February 18, 2014","true","183.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I looked into this when i got tired of fps games, and endeavored to find something different to indulge my minds ever yearning need to be placated. no easy task i can assure you, but tsw hits the mark, it has a story line which will take you from the gloomy rural outskirts of kingston town all the way to the frozen warewolf ridden hell of transilvania, along the way you will run through, tombs, deserts, hidden tree fortresses, grave yards, and encampments of npcs ready to guide you on your way as you journey through the vast and diverse landscape that is the secret world.\n\nthe story line itself is complex, and if you fail to watch part of it you will find yourself wondering what is going on throughout the rest of the game, but then half the fun of this game is that you do actually learn from it, and its maturity level is fairly high, unless you have an iq of 140 and consider yourself to be "quite the historian" or your primary place of residence is in a library i doubt that you will get all of the obscure historical references left by the game on hand, and will more than likely have to do a bit of light reading before it all starts to take form. to be fair, I think i learned more from this game about ancient european history and folklore than i did in school. you will also find that unless you have that knowledge you will probably be looking up solutions to quests online quite frequently, i know very few people that can speak all the languages that you would need to know to even begin to fathom what the quest is asking you to do. but that doesnt really work against it, the game has a built in browser for exactly that purpose, which has been adjusted to provide search results that will only give you a clue as to the answer and not give the entire game away.\n\nthey have obviously put alot of thought into it, and i liked that it took me a whole year to level up just to complete the main ability tree, it keeps you focused and goal oriented for a long time, even after you have finished the main story line, there are sub stories and seasonal stories constantly being released, plenty of which are free to play. id look into this one if you like adventure games, or rpgs, or massive online multiplayer games, and also enjoy an intellectual challenge, this might have what your looking for.","March 2, 2015","true","639.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is uniquely story-driven compared to many other MMOs that have story elements tacked onto fighting in order to level up. Of course, with any MMO one aspect is to see your character advance. The Secret World is no different but FunCom has somehow removed the grinding elements. You can learn any skill and max it out if you wish—so there's very little sense that you can ever screw up and select an "unworkable build". Instead, you take the abilities you've learn and configure them so that they work well together. No re-spec is necessary. Gear is important, but not absolute, and its readily available.\n\nIf you're the sort of person that "wants to love their MMO" but somehow just quits without ever going very far, this may be the game for you. Now that it is subscription free like Guild Wars 2, playing is a one time investment. There is a real world store but it sells consumables and cosmetics which are unnecessary. There are even ways within the game to get new outfits without spending any real world cash.\n\nIf this goes on sale at Steam, I heartily reccomend it.","December 4, 2013","true","53.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's quite emmersive. There are 3 types of quests. Main quests, side quests, and small quests. Main quests and side quests consist 3 types of quests, Action quest (the usual fighting stuff except most of the time you have good reason to do it), Sabatoge quests (these are inflitrating something, usually an underground hideout, or some sort of enemy related building, and well.... you sabatoge it with various things to do), and Investigation missions (these are what seperates the secret world from everything else. Basically it's an ARG where you have to find clues, solve puzzles, and investigate things both in and out of the game with reasearch via google and books). Small quests are just small things like go from point A to point B and do something or fight these monsters. The more generic quests. And every quest besides small quests have a fully voiced cinematic cut scene. Combat is very free and open.

The combat is action bar based...  why is it such a big deal that the game isn't "innovative" in 1 aspect?  The most popular MMO in the world has action bar based combat, so obviously it doesn't make or break a game.  Plus, this game makes you think about how to level your character and equip abilities, unlike many other MMOs.  The number of combinations of active and passive abilities is huge and gives you so many possibilities.\n\n","January 23, 2014","true","97.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I played Everquest back in the day, and of course WoW, but they all ended up boring me to tears. Even City of Heroes and Champions lost their luster quickly as the "get a sandwich gaming" style started to wear on.\nDon't get me wrong, TSW still has its grinds, but it has enough stuff that you don't find in most MMOs that you can ignore the grinds. There are investigation missions where you have to figure out the clues for yourself. The game doesn't always hold your hand. There is even a little 3D platforming in there. While you can find yourself in a "gather 10 wolf pelts" mission, you may also find yourself trying to inch through booby traps while a crazed survivalist watches from the shadows.\nI can't say enough good things about the skill system. Not having to follow a class and only chose that class' powers? Magical. Sure, it could have been expanded (and a stealth tree would have been amazing), but it's still nice that you can focus on guns and swords, and then suddenly switch to fists if you want to.\nAlso, the customizable clothing options are hard to beat. Sure, it's like dressing up dolls, but I just don't care. You can dress your character any way you like, and then strut down the street as if the BeeGees are playing. It's a great idea. There are a few clothing options I hope they'll add later, but that would mean YOU playing this game.\nMy buddy summed it up best: "This game has style."","January 28, 2014","true","917.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A hidden little treasure. The questing can be a little confusing due to players not having levels. So you may find yourself beginning quests that are too difficult. But once you find the right area to quest in it goes rather smoothly. I do enjoy the fact that the game sometimes encourages players to do research outside the game to complete quests. I also like how open the skill tree is and how each player can have a unique set of abilities. The voice acting is phenomenal, the music is addicting, and the ability animations are fun and exciting. The in-game store items do not seem too game changing so there’s really no worrying about rich players having OP characters. It’s definitely better than many free-to-play mmo's out there and even better than some pay-to-play games. I bought the game when steam had it on sale and am so glad I did.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/parkouraliberte/recommended/215280/","parkouraliberte","Moonthane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/parkouraliberte/","92 products in account","Currently at Savage Coast.\n\nThis game has a lot of mixed reviews, and for good reasons.\n\nI bought this game last year (I think) and it's sat uninstalled since the first time I played it. At the time, I couldn't figure out what I was doing because I was focussed on other stuff and couldn't be bothered trying to get into something new (my own fault, obviously).\n\nBut anyway! Installed it recently again and I've got to say it's excellent in some ways. The story and overall concept is absolutely brilliant, I love it. Modern setting in a good looking environment and plenty of cool places for roleplaying.\n\nUnlike most MMORPGs (including Champions Online, which is a favourite), the questing doesn't feel linear at all. I haven't had two quests that have felt the same, and I've completed more than I can count. The combat is great fun aswell, though I would prefer it if this game was gamepad compatible. Still, other than that, no complaints really. Questing gets tough though, and you have to pick your upgrades carefully or you'll not enjoy your time. Playing with another person (preferably someone you know, who is an active player) is insanely good fun!\n\nThe character customisation is great, appearance you might find a little limited. But then again, I say that after playing Champions Online which is simply insane when it comes to your character's appearance choices. Speaking of CO, this game is pretty much Free Form the whole way through. You're not stuck to any particular tree of abilities, and you can even (if you have the patience) keep going until you get enough skill/ability to points to unlock ALL the powers *insert raised torch* and alter your build however you please. It's pretty endless, and there seems to be new content every year which is really cool.\n\nThe environments themselves look great, from London to Egypt this game offers some great adventure. The enemies are well designed and sometimes things get pretty spooky...also BIG THUMBS UP FOR VOICE ACTING!\n\nThe loading times are...horrific, at least for me. Just logging in takes longer than you'd think necessary, and then switching from Agartha (probably didn't spell that properly!) to London is equally as irritating. Updates aswell...despite being able to get 1.9mb/s on Steam, the game launcher gives me an average of below 1mb/s and just goes up and down seemingly without end.\n\nWeapons/Talismens seem scarse. I've completed a lot of quests and so far only received one weapon (that I actually use with my powers). However, I found the auction house to be very helpful and the rare weapons you buy with tokens from completing quests in specific areas give you a great punch!\n\nThe community has to be one of the best I've come across. Very helpful, there's always someone around to help out. The RP community is very good aswell, the TSWRP addon from Curse makes it very comfortable to create a character. The lore also is very clear so there's not much confusion to be found.\n\nConsumables are suprisingly fun, SMOKING A CIGAR HEALS YOU IN THIS GAME. Also, they're cheap (in the Horned God bar) which makes it handy for characters who want to have a shmok'!\n\nGreat game for Roleplayers, great game for PVPers, great game overall with just a few flaws that can be overlooked with ease.\n\nAlso, anyone calling this game "pay to win" has either not played the game at all or have some other reason to moan about a problem that doesn't exist in this game.\n\n8/10, may seem a bit of a high score considering the flaws but in this case the benefit SERIOUSLY outweighs the cost.","April 7, 2014","true","166.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It bares more resemblance to a Lovecraftian horror than a Tolkien work, dubbed by my friends "Call of Cthulu; the video game" (even if only few parts have sanity meter mechanics).\n\nSettings include a small town in New England overrun by undead, a city in Egypt fighting against a new uprising of one of its ancient foes, and a series of post-Soviet occupation Trannsylvanian towns besieged by vampires and werewolves.\n\nThe foes run the gambit from classic design to compleately reimagined, whatever needed to fit into a modern setting.  Zombies in track suits, golems made of scrap metal, cultist in hoodies, and vampires covered in parkas and gas masks (to protect themselves from the sun, duh), scuttling wendigo, sloshing dragur, glowing will-o-wisps and more.\n\nCharacters are distinct and memorable, with NPCs that will make you laugh audibly, cry physically, and moments that will make you go "what the f###?!?"  Every one of my friends who have played this game have a favorite, and a least favorite, character.  Dialogue is well written, better than some TV shows.\n\nQuests vary between standard assult and dungeon missions that require slaying of hordes of mosters (or one big one), sabotage missions that require tact and subterfuge, and research missions that involve extensive out-of-game study.\nI cannot emphasise the awesomeness of research missions enough; they are incredible in-depth puzzles and can make you do anything from learn arabic to visit game-based websites on the real world internet to scribble notes about demon runes like a madman.  The lazy can simply Google search for a walkthrough, but those who enjoy mystery will have a blast connecting the dots.\n\nAs a MMO RPG, it still suffers the stanard MMO RPG flaws; other players mercing your tagets before you can reach them, small pools of active players looking for group for the dungeon you want to run, nessicerey grinding to become strong enough to handle the next area, player characters in gaudy outfits providing jarring contrast to the scenery, the silent protagonist, and so on.  However, these flaws don't detract significantly rom the game.\n\n\n\nWhen all is said and down, I would recomend this game to any fan of modern fantasy.","March 14, 2014","true","171.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And why would that ever be bad?\n\nThe story is absolutely captivating, the details put into every aspect of it are bound to catch any fan of horror/sci-fi and it is lovely, as a long-time fan of Ragnar Tornquist's work, to see tiny elements of The Longest Journey in there.\n\nIt brings something new to the MMO genre and while it's certainly not for everyone, its uniqueness and niche content are certain to draw only the truly interested. It's never going to be BIG, but it's never going to suffer the social downsides of more generic MMOs like Guild Wars, Rift or WoW. TSW is a mature game catered to a specific niche audience, and it's great at what it does.\n\nAs a downside, combat can and often is either repetitive or frustrating. Builds require a lot of tinkering and calibration to be made viable, but in the world of Google this can be easily by-passed by looking up various builds perfected by the community and just using those. Therein comes the second problem: repetition. Rotation-based combat works, but people are getting bored of it and many modern MMOs are doing their best to steer away from it. Not TSW sadly, and I often find myself pressing 12311111241111... ad infinitum until something is dead. Thankfully, the necessity for dodging out of the way of many attacks keeps me on my toes, and is one of the things keeping combat from being unbearably dull. But hey! Repetitve combat gives me the chance to spend my time admiring the awesome monster models, which are beautifully designed, crafted and animated.\n\nIn all, fantastic game with some mechanical drawbacks, but as long as you don't mind mashing buttons, you're going to enjoy the hell out of it (literally, perhaps).","February 18, 2014","true","183.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

This story driven game really had me addicted, only thing bad about it that I can find is the hours that were sucked away from my life. XD\n\nPros:\nGreat visuals,\n\nCaptivating mystery story,\n\nWell resurrected Lore, and references to the works of H.P. Lovecraft and other fairy tails.\n\nGood gameplay with most everything being available after purchase\n\nGood community\n\nGreat customization of characters and character options\n\nCool monsters.\n\n\nCons: at the time I write this (10/18/2015)\nYes despite what I said there are a few, but there all trivial and don't take away at all of the games value.\n\nMore development needed in New York, and Seoul.\nLondon is a rich and beautiful city, and while the other two are amazing in there own right, they don't feel as lively. While I know where the base camps of the even more secret, secret organizations, they still feel like they need work, Banks, markets, new clothing and comedic styles, possibly apartments or living spaces for players. Or even just expanding the size. Those two just feel lacking, and need more of a spotlight in my opinion.\n\nSprint speed cant be changed. It's locked as the fastest sprint you own. Which can be really frustrating for newer players when working with them, or just people who cant offord the next level of sprint speed.\n\nMounts, (such as motorcycles) that appear to have multiple seats, cant actually hold more then one party member. Now this is a very small pet peeve, and they just came out with the mount system, so it could change in the future, but still it's somthing that would be nice.\n\nHonestly though, I would highly recommend this game for anyone into MMOs, and just in general, it's a good game with a nice balence of costemization and story driven gameplay.","October 18, 2015","true","364.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have been playing MMORPG for over a decade now. Seen better and worst many times before. The secret world is definitely worth your attention if: you like horror climate in games, if you like freedom from start of the game, if you likke innovative ways to build and progress your character, if you dont mind progressing through most of the game on your own and dont mind spending lots of time looking for groups. Then this game is a perfect choice.\n\nMyself however i had a large issue with lack of group runs on the low level, i dont mean QL1 or 2 here i mean QL5 and above. Sadly there is no groups for new players, yes the Sanctuary chat is friendly and full of people but none of them is willing to do group runs below QL10 cause they dont get anything out of it. The facebook page is almost dead and apart from devs putting up the news there the response is very very little. Seem that the game is largely populated by high level players who dont bother with newbies. No LFG tool also does not help in this type of game as fresh players have no way to learn their class in group. Personally i think this takes a lot of good out of this game. MMORPG is all about teaming up with people and overcoming obstacle in groups and i am sad to say but you will not see this in here untill you waaaaay deep into the game and bored of feeling that you play another single player rpg.\n\nIam recommending this game as a good game on its own but not for hard fans of team work.","December 20, 2015","true","42.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you want to put your brain on auto-pilot and mindlessly hack and slash mobs, then this is not the game for you...you HAVE to use your brain.\n\nYou can be any role on one character, because you can learn all of the skills, unlock all of the weapons, and get all of the gear, all on the same character.  Weapons range from wolverine like fist claws, to assault rifles and different melee, range, and magical types.  Reading the passive skills, and learning what weapons/skills/talismans to use in different situations is the key to your survival...you'll do a lot of learning from mistakes, that's for sure.\n\nThis game also has one of THE most helpful communities I have ever experienced on any game, and I have made a lot of good friends here.  My wishlist is forever stocked with special Collector Editions, Issues, and other DLC for the game, as I have fallen in love, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who thinks it sounds interesting.  Also a game that is best played with a friend, and I also recommend joining a cabal (guilds in game)  If you do join, I'm on the Arcadia server, I'm a Templar (one of three factions) and my IGN is Jennory, I'll help you with any questions you may have :D","January 3","true","585.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's an MMO that plays like a single player game, and the atmosphere and lore are incredibly immersive and detailed. I read that, in some areas, you will hardly ever see any other players (by design) in order to enhance the player's immersion in the environment. Pretty kickass. The Ultimate Edition is a great deal in terms of value, so if you're thinking about buying TSW and wondering which version to get, pick the Ultimate Edition. You'll save a bunch of money on the other issues (storylines) in the long run: you get issues 1-4 with the base game, but you get issues 1-11 with the Ultimate Edition. You also get 30 days of membership, 1200 bonus Funcom points (which you can use to buy issue 12 or 13 if you felt like it), an exclusive outfit, some other items, and a bonus game key for the standard edition of the game that you can give to a friend.

In a MMO marketplace dominated by fantasy and "space" titles, TSW has attempted to do something unusual and has succeeded. The developer, Funcom, has a history of releasing cerebral, out-of-the-box titles and TSW continues this development strategy. While not tied to a single famous IP like Funcom's Age of Conan MMO, TSW reaches into many lesser known or less celebrated genres such as spy (James Bond), explorer (Indiana Jones), and horror and also the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, and John Carpenter as well as many conspiracy and secret society tropes found in movies and fiction.\n\nThe updates to the game are released as Issues (complete with comic book cover art) and the hundreds of game missions are connected as part of a vast, interwoven story which unfolds as the game is played. Fully voiced and animated cut scenes for main missions add to the feel of a film or television series with recurring characters. All of the conventional MMO features are here too with a crafting system, PvP, pets, mounts, raids, and guilds (Cabals) but unlike anything found elsewhere in multiplayer online games.

Because the Ultimate Bundle comes preloaded with almost all of the expansions for the game (you'll also get $10 worth of Funcom Points upon completing your first 30 quests; I recommend using this to buy Issue #12).\n\nIf you buy this there is no upgrade option, you'll end up having to buy the Ultimate Bundle which is basically buying the game twice.  Either that or you can buy the expansions if you want, but that'll cost you more than just buying the Ultimate Edition.  So in summary, the game itself is GREAT, I absolutely recommend it.

Having played multiple MMO's, what fascinates me about this one is it's simplicity. You don't need to spend years figuring out the best builds or the most successful mechanics. People who fancy the sophisticated stuff might dislike that, but I'm really into it.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty good (for an MMO at least), and different quest types like sabotage (sneaky-stuff) and investigation (use knowledge and research to solve complex riddles, some of them are really difficult, don't spoil them by cheating) increase the overall feel.\n\nThose of you familiar with the works of Lovecraft will find some resemblences in the game, something I'm highly enjoying (especially since I feel there's way too few Lovecraft-themed games out there).\n\nIt might not have the larges community, the fanciest graphics or the most complex system, but this game has it's own elegance. In a certain way, it is truly unique.\n\nIf you're looking for a simple, rather easy-to-learn MMO with a rather different setting than most, this one might just be right for you.","December 21, 2015","true","605.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I enjoy it, it's good, but I'm down right furious that it's not better.  The story and setting is my favorite in gaming and is incredibly immersive.  The actual gameplay however is either just OK or inscrutible.  For instance 95 hours in and I have virtually no idea what my stats do or if my build is good.  The story and the voice acting make up for everything though.  I'll always remember investigating on Solomon Island, or doing missions for the statues in Cairo.  This game should be better!  So it can be everywhere!\n\nEdit Feb. 2016 = I've purchased the lifetime sub before it went away, I love the story and presentation but most everything else is either passable to just terrible.  The game has given me an error EVERY time I log out.  Every third or so time I try to log in to the game it either get's stuck on the load screen or the program just ends.  The design of about ten percent of the missions will just infuriate you instead of challenge or engage you.

If you want a typical, linear fantasy story; then, you are going to be very disappointed. The story of the game isn't one fluid narrative, it's the opposite. It tends to give you bits and pieces of what the storyline is as you complete quests, and you don't understand what or why you do things most of the time. Yet, that matters little in a game like this. As matter of fact, that might be the main attraction.\n\nThe best part about Secret World is the apparent lack of convention. There are no classes, no levels to speak of. The level of freedom with constructing your character is quite refreshing from typical wizard/ warrior/ archer mmo's. If you make a mistake in your build or skill tree, you have the safeguard of knowing you can simply earn more SP or AP to fix your character. It's even possible to earn every skill from every weapon, and every ability from every weapon. As a matter of fact you are given a reward for doing so.\n\nThe Secret World rewards players for thinking outside the box, I've never used Google to solve a quest up until I played this game. Become very comfortable with the idea that you'll be using search engines for trickier questions and riddles being asked in the game. However, there is an in-game web browser for your convenience, should you choose to use it.\n\nYes there is grinding; but the number of content available and the variability between each quest never makes it feel like you're grinding. You can choose to rush your character to high faction ranking, or you can take your time and explore the game. The game often rewards you with achievements, lore, and some surprises if you choose to do so.\n\nThis game has arguably one of the best mmo communities I've played in so far. Helpful veterans always help lower level players, and Cabals (the Secret World's version of guilds) are diverse in their members and goals, and players always seem to be working with each other to support other players who ask for help. Cabals can also hold a large number of members (I'm currently in one that has over 250 members).\n\nI bought this game on sale, and I am sad I didn't buy this sooner. However, even at full price this game is still a steal. I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for something different and unconventional.","January 26","true","60.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The Secret World is not for everybody though. While it is heavily story-driven there's a lot of puzzle solving to do and they're not always easy. One of the things I like the most about the game is the skill tree. Actually, it's not really a skill three but a skill circle, which means you can spend points in everything and make the most hybrid builds ever.

(Ex. using Google to search forum sites and read what "other people" have seen/heard) While the combat is extensive, it's still a little lackluster, the guns feeling especially boring to shoot, everything else seems to have it's charm though. The enemies have the standard, shoot here, dodge this from red telegraphing enemy, ect. ect. I do recommend it to anyone having a few friends cause it's hard(-ish) to solo but it is fun none the less. Character customization feels nice, it's finally nice to see a game where clothing is a bit extensive and LOOKS GOOD for once so you don't look like every other agent in your entire corporation. The only reason I stopped playing this was mostly because it did seem to get a little too grindy in some areas, and I'm usually not one to moan much about grinding XP and doing side missions in games, but good lord there were a LOT of side missions, all coming with a cutscene with nice voice acting. (That and the launcher seemed to have issues when starting up.) Overall, I'd say give the game a chance if you have some extra money, it's nothing too different from standard MMO formula but with an extremely immersive storyline and very challenging puzzle system.

That doesn't necessarily mean  it's bad.  In fact, it is a fairly good game and has a decent online community.  End game content is a little sparse and redundant, but that is not why I picked it up.  The content (occult based post-apocalyptic backdrop) and the voice acting are amazing.  The plot is interesting enough and the characters are enjoyable and often hilarious.  The gameplay mechanics, specifically the 7 and 7 skill deck setup, allow for a lot tweaking and keeps things fresh.  However, while the game is immediately addicting, it wears on you after awhile.  I found that stepping away for a few days, I had little to no desire to resume play.  Also, microtransactions...lots and lots of microtransactions.  Be prepared to spend way more money that you intended to on cool new outfits and various other game additions.

This is not only one of the best MMOs ever made, it's one of the best games ever made.  The quality of the quests alone is enough to warrent a purchase, especially now that it's F2P.  In no particular order, why you should buy this game immediately.\n\n1.  Character building.  If you like tinkering with characters, this game is like crack.  You can choose any combination of skills and passives at any time, save the build, and switch between them pretty much instantly.  This is a character tinkerers dream.  Once again, worth buying the game *just* for this.\n\n2.  The quests.  I'm not usually much one for quests, and I tend to find them boring, poorly thought out and/or written, or really flimsly excuses to get you to go pick up 10 bear asses.  This is the first MMO I've played where I look forward to the next quest string.  The writing is superb, not just for a video game, but in any context.  The voice work is also outstanding.  The game is intelligent, and funny, a great combination.\n\n3.  The world.  The game world is really fantastic, and draws you in to the setting very well.  It's easy to suspend disbelief and really buy in to the world.\n\n4.  The QUESTSSSSSSSS.  They are so good, and so varied.  There are so many different kinds of quests....it's...amazing really.  There are more good quests in this game than all other MMOs combined in the history of MMOs, and that's not hyperbole, I've played most of them.\n\n5.  The challenge.  Both from a combat perspective, and a using your nogging perspective.  You actually have to think in this game to solve some things.  You also have to pay attention to what you're doing and how you're buidling your character.  Random run of the mill quest mobs can and will kill you if you don't pay attention.  I love that.  It's not so hard that it's frustrating, but it's hard enough that it keeps you engaged, unlike every other MMO that more or less lulls you to sleep while leveling.  Leveling in this game is *FUN*....gasp.\n\nThis game is an absolute steal at 10 times the price, once again, not hyperbole.  Why this hasn't gotten more attention, I'll never know.  Maybe it's too smart for people?  I dont' get it....  This game is amazing, and by far my favorite MMO for ages, and close to being my favorite of all time.\n\nThis game is in my top 10 games of all time right now, not just MMOs, but anything.  I'm shocked at how good this is, and how little attention it's gotten.  Everyone that is even remotely interested in character progression games should own this.","October 4, 2015","true","86.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Your character can learn every ability and skill in the game and can assign only up to 7 abilities on to two bars, one for actives the other for passive effects. You may be wondering what classes in the game there are, truth is their are none. You are only limited to the combination of weapons such as Pistol and Shotgun or Blood and Sword when it comes to how you play your character. So you might have messed up your build, don't worry, you can repeat any mission except the main storyline missions. As these will provide you with the necessary experience to gain ability points and skill points.\n\nAlthough the setting is modern day and it presents itself in a grim dark fantasy, the story and npcs are very meaningful and quiet human for how they deal with their situations.\n\nThe most populated shard, according to my research, is Cereberus. I mention this as you may notice that the lower level zones are quiet empty so bringing a friend in is a welcome idea. Although when it comes to raiding and dungeons, don't fret as you can join parties across shards.\n\nThe game is definetly my recommendation as its very well made for an MMO in today's market.","November 12, 2015","true","62.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is not only one of the best MMOs ever made, it's one of the best games ever made.  The quality of the quests alone is enough to warrent a purchase, especially now that it's F2P.  In no particular order, why you should buy this game immediately.\n\n1.  Character building.  If you like tinkering with characters, this game is like crack.  You can choose any combination of skills and passives at any time, save the build, and switch between them pretty much instantly.  This is a character tinkerers dream.  Once again, worth buying the game *just* for this.\n\n2.  The quests.  I'm not usually much one for quests, and I tend to find them boring, poorly thought out and/or written, or really flimsly excuses to get you to go pick up 10 bear asses.  This is the first MMO I've played where I look forward to the next quest string.  The writing is superb, not just for a video game, but in any context.  The voice work is also outstanding.  The game is intelligent, and funny, a great combination.\n\n3.  The world.  The game world is really fantastic, and draws you in to the setting very well.  It's easy to suspend disbelief and really buy in to the world.\n\n4.  The QUESTSSSSSSSS.  They are so good, and so varied.  There are so many different kinds of quests....it's...amazing really.  There are more good quests in this game than all other MMOs combined in the history of MMOs, and that's not hyperbole, I've played most of them.\n\n5.  The challenge.  Both from a combat perspective, and a using your nogging perspective.  You actually have to think in this game to solve some things.  You also have to pay attention to what you're doing and how you're buidling your character.  Random run of the mill quest mobs can and will kill you if you don't pay attention.  I love that.  It's not so hard that it's frustrating, but it's hard enough that it keeps you engaged, unlike every other MMO that more or less lulls you to sleep while leveling.  Leveling in this game is *FUN*....gasp.\n\nThis game is an absolute steal at 10 times the price, once again, not hyperbole.  Why this hasn't gotten more attention, I'll never know.  Maybe it's too smart for people?  I dont' get it....  This game is amazing, and by far my favorite MMO for ages, and close to being my favorite of all time.\n\nThis game is in my top 10 games of all time right now, not just MMOs, but anything.  I'm shocked at how good this is, and how little attention it's gotten.  Everyone that is even remotely interested in character progression games should own this.","October 4, 2015","true","86.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The investigation quests are unlike anything that I've ever played before.  All of these things basically made for a fabulous single-player game.  I played that game, and loved it.  I'll probably pick up the various expansion packs as they're released, and play the new content.  The mmo parts... are not so good.  The Dungeons are "meh" and the pvp combat is dull and grindy.  I could never bring myself to play the raid content, because I'm allergic to grinding.  The single-player aspects of the game are good enough, however, that it's absolutely worth buying and playing.","December 17, 2014","true","137.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyThingsO_O/recommended/215280/","FluffyThingsO_O","$a$h","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyThingsO_O/","14 products in account","One of the best... if not the best mmorpg i have ever played. Definitely a game to try!!!\n\nEDIT: ... Still the best mmorpg I have ever played, its got tactical and strategy situations, character development is very vast and there are at least 300+ different builds for tanking, dps, support, medic, etc, also it is updated quite often and there are new players joining all the time.\nBUT.... best of all it never ever EVER gets boring!!! there are way too many  things to do o theres never a dull moment, which compels you to keep playing... which in my opinion bumps it to 1st place.\n\n\n=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=SPOILERS=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=\nI dont know why I marked this section as spoilers... even if I keep talking for an hour I still wouldnt even scratch the surace of this games amazing storyline.\nSo... you start with one of 3 factions in this game, Dragon, Illuminati and Templar. The faction you are in only makes a difference when it comes to boosts and buffs which changes dependiing on how your faction does in PvP. You also choose 2 wapons from a selection of 9 different kinds of weapons (3 Melee, 3 Ranged and 3 Magic), although you are limited to 2 weapons at a time there is no rectriction on how many weapons you choose to master ... meaning that there is a huge lot of customizing available and choosing the right 2 weapon combo is all up to you ...(I suggest Assault Rifle and dual pistols for beginners :D). Each weapon has active abilities and Passive abilities which you can chose from but you can only have 7 active and 7 passive abilities equiped at once, but there are over 40+ different actives and passives for each weapon which makes character development very very interesting. You can also import and export your builds or other builds from different players and this is an in game feature not a mod. So players can share thier builds with each other. PvE builds and PvP builds can be the same but usually they differ a lot. I usually tank in PvP and my builds for PvE are vastly diferent, they might have the same weapons but totally different actives and passives. You can find a lot of good builds for PvE online but PvP builds are not so easy to find, players who do well in PvP want to keep it that way so hardly anyone shares good PvP builds but I guess thats expected. What makes this weapons customizing even more awesome is that you are not limited to the passive abilities of the weapons you have equipped, for ex: If I have chaos magic and elemental magic equipped (good weapons for intermediate players) I can equip a passive ability of assualt rifles which increases accuracy even when no assualt rifles are equipped. SO ... I guess you kinda see why i said it never gets boring... but this isnt even the tip of the iceberg lol. After weapon abilities comes armor/armour. The armor aka talismans you can equip come in levels, so level 1 talimans <lvl2 talismans<lvl3 and so on. But its not so simple as that, there are different lvl 1 talismans with varying stats. To equip higher lvl talismans you have to master the lvl in your skills table first. Same is for equipping higher lvl weapons. There isnt a character lvl system, but rather a stat based system. And your stats get affected by weapons and talismans. The higher the lvl, the better the stats. Doing missions grants you 2 different kinds of points, AP which is ability points and SP which are skill points.  To unlock wepon active&passive abilities you need AP. To increase the lvl of weapons or talismans you can equip you need SP. Generally AP is gained faster than SP but that kind of balances out as you progress in the storyline. I suggest that when using SP, focus on talismans first then weapons and there are 2 different streams for weapons, max out one stream first then move on to the next because if you spend SP equally on the streams, you might have both streams at lvl 5 lets say, you will only be able to equip lvl 5 weapons even though the total amount of SP spent, if spent on one stream only, would allow you to equip a lvl 7 or lvl 8 weapon. But in the end its up to the players as to how to spend thier AP and SP :D. Lastly, for weapon customizing, you can greatly impact your stats by glyphs. Glyphs are an accessory for weapons and talismans. There are tons of different glyphys that each have different stats that can be applied to the weapon or to you (talismans).\n\nSooooo.... that was JUST weapons and that was a brief explanation :P. Theres quite a lot more to weapons, talismans and glyphs but this should be enough to get you started. Moving on to other things I love about this game... Crafting. Not a lot off players like crafting in the beginning of the game but thats only because its not easy getting materials early on. But you can craft any weapon, talisman or glyph as long as you have the materials. But crafting is a little different in The Secret World. You dont just click craft and voila the equipment is crafted, thats boring. Luckily we have a way more interesting crafting process which you will learn very early on in the game so im not gonna type up another essay to explain that, just know... they found a way to make crafting fun :D.\n\nPvP: PvP is again a lot of fun. There are 3 different battlefields you can fight on and each has completely different set of rules and objectives. So its not just 1v1 or team battles. The following site can explain PvP briefly or in detail a lot better than I ever could so make sure to check it out, https://forums.thesecretworld.com/showthread.php?60445-PvP-101-The-Beginner-s-Guide-to-TSW-s-PvP.\n\nTheres so much more I can talk about, relating to this game but it would all be but words you are reading, If you really want to know what the game is like you should play it :D. The cost is so meager compared to content of the game and its just a one time fee. Also theres no kind of pay to win scheme. The only thing ive ever bought from the store is boosts. Other than boosts theres not much that money can buy to give you an edge over others which is the biggest selling factor in my opinion. I wont deny that there are other mmorpgs with similar characteristics but I am positive that The Secret World is one of the very few (I can count them on both hands) that combine all these amazing features into one very very very amazing game :)\n\nIf anyone needs any help dont hesitate to send me a message here on steam on in game (IGN: NexisX)","July 27, 2014","true","82.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With all graphical options turned to the lowest, this game does not run well on my machine (i7-2600, ATI 5700, 12GB RAM). I'd say it's just do to my poor graphic card, but the game takes several dips at weird places where it shouldn't, like the middle of a small house with nothing going on. Otherwise, the menus offer a great variety of graphical options, so you should be able to make the game perform a little better on your machine. However, if you own a machine with lower specs than mine, you probably shouldn't buy this game unless you're okat with playing with low FPS.\n\nNow that this is out of the way, let's talk about the core gameplay, which consist of both the combat and the detective missions. First, let's get started with the combat. The Secret World offers a good variety of different weapons, but they do not offer impact like a classic first-person shooter would. The hotbar combat gets boring after a few hours of playing. There's a good variety of abilities and you'll easily find a strong variety of build to play with, but you won't find impactful combat. It'll feel like pressing keys on a keyboard while you character performs a generic animation.\n\nThe detective missions are very interesting, but they require you to use the in-game internet browser, which is just a normal browser directly within the game, you could use Google on your usual browser if you wanted. The problem with this is Google itself, it's a little too good. It'll give you the best results for you search, and usually, it's not the clue you were looking for, it's the whole answer to the mission you're doing. It makes the mission both too easy for those who just want the answers and too hard for those who'd like to do them in the intended way.\n\nIn about 20 hours of play I nearly managed finish the first area at 100%. I spent a lot of time running around and looking for clues, but I never got really bored of the game. I did take a few breaks, but I enjoyed playing the game for long sessions of over three hours at a time, which should be the norm for a MMO.\n\nNow that The Secret World adopted the Guild Wars 2 model of "Pay Once, Play Forever", I have to say the business model is fair. I bought the game for around 30$ and I easily got 20 hours out of it, and there's many more left if I ever decide to play again.\n\nThe Strong ||\n- Solid variety of abilities allow a wide range of builds\n- Fun, intriguing and interesting story\n- Innovative detective missions\n- Fair business model\n\nThe Weak ||\n- Generic hotbar combat with few impact\n- Poor perfomance\n- Easy to google answers for the detective missions","August 16, 2013","true","62.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyThingsO_O/recommended/215280/","FluffyThingsO_O","$a$h","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyThingsO_O/","14 products in account","One of the best... if not the best mmorpg i have ever played. Definitely a game to try!!!\n\nEDIT: ... Still the best mmorpg I have ever played, its got tactical and strategy situations, character development is very vast and there are at least 300+ different builds for tanking, dps, support, medic, etc, also it is updated quite often and there are new players joining all the time.\nBUT.... best of all it never ever EVER gets boring!!! there are way too many  things to do o theres never a dull moment, which compels you to keep playing... which in my opinion bumps it to 1st place.\n\n\n=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=SPOILERS=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=\nI dont know why I marked this section as spoilers... even if I keep talking for an hour I still wouldnt even scratch the surace of this games amazing storyline.\nSo... you start with one of 3 factions in this game, Dragon, Illuminati and Templar. The faction you are in only makes a difference when it comes to boosts and buffs which changes dependiing on how your faction does in PvP. You also choose 2 wapons from a selection of 9 different kinds of weapons (3 Melee, 3 Ranged and 3 Magic), although you are limited to 2 weapons at a time there is no rectriction on how many weapons you choose to master ... meaning that there is a huge lot of customizing available and choosing the right 2 weapon combo is all up to you ...(I suggest Assault Rifle and dual pistols for beginners :D). Each weapon has active abilities and Passive abilities which you can chose from but you can only have 7 active and 7 passive abilities equiped at once, but there are over 40+ different actives and passives for each weapon which makes character development very very interesting. You can also import and export your builds or other builds from different players and this is an in game feature not a mod. So players can share thier builds with each other. PvE builds and PvP builds can be the same but usually they differ a lot. I usually tank in PvP and my builds for PvE are vastly diferent, they might have the same weapons but totally different actives and passives. You can find a lot of good builds for PvE online but PvP builds are not so easy to find, players who do well in PvP want to keep it that way so hardly anyone shares good PvP builds but I guess thats expected. What makes this weapons customizing even more awesome is that you are not limited to the passive abilities of the weapons you have equipped, for ex: If I have chaos magic and elemental magic equipped (good weapons for intermediate players) I can equip a passive ability of assualt rifles which increases accuracy even when no assualt rifles are equipped. SO ... I guess you kinda see why i said it never gets boring... but this isnt even the tip of the iceberg lol. After weapon abilities comes armor/armour. The armor aka talismans you can equip come in levels, so level 1 talimans <lvl2 talismans<lvl3 and so on. But its not so simple as that, there are different lvl 1 talismans with varying stats. To equip higher lvl talismans you have to master the lvl in your skills table first. Same is for equipping higher lvl weapons. There isnt a character lvl system, but rather a stat based system. And your stats get affected by weapons and talismans. The higher the lvl, the better the stats. Doing missions grants you 2 different kinds of points, AP which is ability points and SP which are skill points.  To unlock wepon active&passive abilities you need AP. To increase the lvl of weapons or talismans you can equip you need SP. Generally AP is gained faster than SP but that kind of balances out as you progress in the storyline. I suggest that when using SP, focus on talismans first then weapons and there are 2 different streams for weapons, max out one stream first then move on to the next because if you spend SP equally on the streams, you might have both streams at lvl 5 lets say, you will only be able to equip lvl 5 weapons even though the total amount of SP spent, if spent on one stream only, would allow you to equip a lvl 7 or lvl 8 weapon. But in the end its up to the players as to how to spend thier AP and SP :D. Lastly, for weapon customizing, you can greatly impact your stats by glyphs. Glyphs are an accessory for weapons and talismans. There are tons of different glyphys that each have different stats that can be applied to the weapon or to you (talismans).\n\nSooooo.... that was JUST weapons and that was a brief explanation :P. Theres quite a lot more to weapons, talismans and glyphs but this should be enough to get you started. Moving on to other things I love about this game... Crafting. Not a lot off players like crafting in the beginning of the game but thats only because its not easy getting materials early on. But you can craft any weapon, talisman or glyph as long as you have the materials. But crafting is a little different in The Secret World. You dont just click craft and voila the equipment is crafted, thats boring. Luckily we have a way more interesting crafting process which you will learn very early on in the game so im not gonna type up another essay to explain that, just know... they found a way to make crafting fun :D.\n\nPvP: PvP is again a lot of fun. There are 3 different battlefields you can fight on and each has completely different set of rules and objectives. So its not just 1v1 or team battles. The following site can explain PvP briefly or in detail a lot better than I ever could so make sure to check it out, https://forums.thesecretworld.com/showthread.php?60445-PvP-101-The-Beginner-s-Guide-to-TSW-s-PvP.\n\nTheres so much more I can talk about, relating to this game but it would all be but words you are reading, If you really want to know what the game is like you should play it :D. The cost is so meager compared to content of the game and its just a one time fee. Also theres no kind of pay to win scheme. The only thing ive ever bought from the store is boosts. Other than boosts theres not much that money can buy to give you an edge over others which is the biggest selling factor in my opinion. I wont deny that there are other mmorpgs with similar characteristics but I am positive that The Secret World is one of the very few (I can count them on both hands) that combine all these amazing features into one very very very amazing game :)\n\nIf anyone needs any help dont hesitate to send me a message here on steam on in game (IGN: NexisX)","July 27, 2014","true","82.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Such an awesome story. And puzzles, oh my. This game requires you to research everything from Hebrew alphabet to Egyptian mythology, translate Romanian, research pharmaceuticals...and so much more. Very dark horror themes. Play this long enough you WILL dream about it. And you will catch yourself humming the music. Especially a certain Lullaby. This is a damned smart game, and I love it.\nMechanics - the combat doesn't suck. There are way better combat mechanics out there, and if that is a primary issue for you then you probably want to keep walking. The deck system is nicely complex and lets the biggest control freak and stats fan have hours of fun putting together builds. But when you hit Issue #8 in Venice they added a new mechanic that is really grind heavy and then becomes essentially useless when you hit Tokyo. I suspect player retention would improve if they stripped that out completely. The scenarios are a fun mechanic and nice for grinding for purple gear but don't spend a lot of time on the augment business - just get to Tokyo where the most recent mechanic kicks in.\nGame stability has been really good for me, plenty of tutorials and info out there from the player community and you WILL need those.\nSo if you love a great story and some compelling content this is your game.","August 19, 2015","true","953.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A couple of short cutscenes introduce you to your new bosses and leads you into the tutorial section of the game.  From there, you're off on a journey to build your powers and your reputation within your organization that will take you from the nicest little island in New England ever go to Hell, to the sands of Egypt and a crazed cult ready to burn up the world, to the dark forests of Transylvania for a showdown with creatures of the night that put Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney, Jr. to shame.  But if you need to take a break from saving the world, you can always duck into El Dorado or Stonehenge to challenge other agents and take control of the mystical sites which help your particular society when you decide to go back out into the field.\nThere are no classes in the game.  Your role is determined by your gear and your equipped skills, both active and passive.  Weapons are the base from which you build off of.  Thus, it's possible for two players to be using the same weapon family, but have considerably different roles when going through group missions.\nFuncom has done an excellent job creating a world that is both relatable and mysterious for players to explore. The Secret World delivers an MMO experience that's distinctly different from its competitors.","December 9, 2015","true","242.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's honestly a pretty cut and dry experience, albiet with a fairly unique premise. It's not that the experience wasn't enjoyable, because the game IS well made. I didn't encounter any bugs or crashes or anything like that. It just failed to really hook me at all. The combat comes off pretty flacid, and the story and NPC's were far from engaging. On top of that, the character and rollplay lacked any real substance. Several hours in, I felt like I was just forcing myself to keep playing for the sake of my friend who purchased the game as well, and I realized that it just wasn't worth it.

Anyway when you join the game you choose between a variety of weapons since their are no classes to speak of, you can have magic to guns to swords and hammers choice is yours and in the game you can level up whatever skill you desire aslong as you ahve the weapon to use it for, this opens many combinations for your character and the game has 500 skills, that alot. The bad part about the game is its a slow start and you really have to think this mmo will not hold your hand like wow or guild wars but I think thats apart i enjoy. Another thing is its more casual mmo so its not too addicting as say guild or wow but its still real fun, if your a pvp guy though play a different game the pvp sucks here. overall this game is fun and creative, trying something new for once, if you play this game I promise you this is one you will remeber I give it and 8/10\n","December 13, 2013","true","56.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Personally love this game since it gives me vibes I used to get when I first played Half-Life 2 (on the soundtrack alone, but embraced by everything mysterious that keeps coming afterwards). Some really amazing sights to see. Some mysterious plot thrown in, and I loved it after the first three hours.\n\nNote: there are plenty of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments that will utterly make you rage quit unless you've been focusing on one or two particular skill trees - and even then it tends to push your buttons at the worst of times. Just be ready for some hard ♥♥♥♥.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs of recently I have "finished" the game. I also have changed my rating from positive to negative. Here's why.\n\n1. At a certain point in the game you are introduced to a specific location, wherein you gain access to new mechanics in the game - cool stuff. However, within a very short span (approx. 30 mins.) you find out that this cool new stuff was primarily introduced just so you'd have a larger motivation to pay out for content to continue playing the story.\n\n2. (♥♥♥♥♥♥-off laugh) Yes, the ♥♥♥♥ing key event that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game has been building up toward, ever since the beginning cinematic sequence, is a ♥♥♥♥ing purchased expansive "content". I emphasize "content" because the the content being offered is sorely lacking when in comparison to a number of other game "expansions". In short, I bought the game expecting an in-depth (and FINISHED) story experience, but it came up wanting at the end with a pay-wall.\n\n3. There is no excuse for the level of aborrent glitches and bugs in the game. I did mention them prior, but had apparently figured out that those bugs and glitches have existed for months or years... So the only explanation is that the Dev's could not be bothered to fix their game since they're too busy pushing out new content.\n-----------------------\nTL;DR:\nThe game has excellent story, interesting mechanics, and intriguing mythos & characters, however it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs/glitches, lack of community, downright "unfair" enemy-types, and limits your experience for the sake of money.","January 27, 2015","false","148.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It forces you to find clues and think like a supernatural investigator would. The leveling system is revolutionary, no other MMO lets you put points into skills this way.

In an MMO where there are no Experience Levels, this can be difficult.\n\nOther thoughts: This game is very unique, features a customizable character thing, and lets you indulge in supernatural settings thought long lost.

The game itself is different than any other MMO i've played in the aspect of it's puzzles. Some of these are literally undoable unless you google the answer (which they actually tell you to do,even call the quest a "google quest") or if you happen to be a brain.\nNow in my opinion  that isn't a bad thing, it's a new form of challenge and a game without challenge gets boring easy.\n\nGameplay itself is pretty nice. Not class based whatsoever. The weapons you equip decide your skills and there are many skills to unlock. If you get tired of a weapon and want another, you can switch anytime you want. You aren't restrticted.\n\nYou'll find out pretty fast the best gear comes from dungeons  (as with most games) but the playerbase is pretty low so finding a group for the dungeon can be difficult sometimes although i have to say the community is very nice. There is usually someone willing to run newbies through dungeons just for the sake of entertainment.\n\nArmor doesn't affect style. You can wear what stats you want while wearing a cosmetic style over it.\n\nCharacter creation is pretty lame. Not many choices to pick from and no long hair choices at all...well they say long hair but it's shoulder length..\n\nThat's about as much as i can say as i'm still pretty new to the game still.","August 24, 2015","true","33.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I say give it a chance especially when you get over $150 worth in content for $20 or even $60 when there is no sale, still worth it considering the price of each issue and side quest pack alone being almost $10-15.  This is how it works. There is no official class system, get used to it, you will never be successful using just one build literally.  You can solo the story content with the right builds, Pvp is decent, they have your straight Deathmatch, to capture points of interest to gain points, if your faction wins a Pvp match, you get a buff, World domination is key for a nice buff. The story is great, when i watch people on twitch who have never played skip some cutscenes, i laugh because its not that simple if your the type who doesnt use guides, the game is much more fun if you play it and actually figure the puzzles out for yourself, they even have an in-game browser, which for people running two monitors, doesnt matteer much, but still nice, add-ons become dam near essential later so pick up some mods when you start getting to the beef of the game, dungeons. Dungeons start like normal, though not centralized around dungeons or raids, they are practically necessary end game, because of the drops. I wouldnt be able to even put a dent in how much content there is in a short paragraph or two.  Lore is damn near endless and increasing, with the release of issue 13 in December 2015, you can tell Funcom does not ♥♥♥♥ around with this game, yes there are minor bugs here and there especially with one of the cutscenes in blue mountain the horror of this girls face is just awful lol her mouth is off set, but regardless, the game itself is not nice to people who think they can pull mobs and gain a ♥♥♥♥ ton of xp, nono the game is much harder than you think, there are viable builds that can last throughout the game and there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ builds like really why would you think thatd be good? But experiment with it, try making your own build after you read up on how penetration is almost the most essential for dps builds in the beginning, and how some specs like physical and magical defense are ♥♥♥♥ no matter what you try to accomplish lol.  As i said before i have not even scraped the surface of how big this game is, it starts slow, and progressively gets better.","January 13","true","247.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
