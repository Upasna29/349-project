You are a detective and your job is to search around a huge mansion to find clues about a missing woman. There are basically 3 parts to the game. 1. You'll need to find, say, 30 items. The game will give you a few different rooms to search with a total of 35 items. So if you can't find a super sneakily hidden thingymabob, you can just switch rooms and search for other items. Once you find your "30" items, you go to 2. You need to complete a jigsaw puzzle. The picture will unlock a page of the missing woman's journal and you'll slowly unfold her enthralling story. Keep finding items and putting together jigsaws to complete the journal. So now I'll mention 3. You don't have access to all the mansion rooms at first. Many are locked and you have to do multiple things in a scene to get it open. Each puzzle scene is quite unique and you get no hints so you pretty much have to click on everything until you figure out what to do. This may sound annoying but, believe me, it's not. The locked doors are extremely fun to figure out and you really feel a sense of accomplishment when you solve them. The atmosphere of this game is spooky. Things will howl in the distance, floor and wall boards will creak, and a ghostly voice will let you know that, no, this mansion is not a pleasant place. :p I've played MCF: Ravenhearst many times on Bigfish and I DO have to warn that the Steam version is a bit wonky. You can't chat or take pics while playing and when you quit the game, Steam tells you it's still running so you have to shut it down via task manager. Major pain. Still, I have to give this game a thumbs up because I really enjoyed playing it, for the umpteenth time. Also, if you enjoy this little gem, there's a sequel - Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst which is much more like an Artifex Mundi game, with an extremely creepy story. Actually, I'm about to start playing that next! If you're an HO fan, I highly recommend Ravenhearst and Return to Ravenhearst, either on Steam or Bigfish or wherever else you might find them. :)","December 29, 2015","true","7.1"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","21","21","2","0"

You have Emma Ravenhearst's diary, a young American that came in England in the 1870'. What will you uncover?\n\nMCF is a well-known series that was one of the most famous during the first era of hidden objects games, though the series is still continued and was even ported to portable devices, like the DS, iPad or even on consoles like the Wii. This game is the 3rd installement and is opening the Ravenhearst story-arc.\n\nThe goal is simple: you clear scenes with a list of items, you open doors with elaborate locks (and with stuff that aren't used but are just there to confuse you) and at the end of a level, you have a jigsaw puzzle to build in order to read the next page in Emma's diary.\n\nYou have also five hints that can help you.\n\nRavenhearst isn't so different from what I remember of Huntsville and Prime Suspects, that I played years ago in retail versions. However, the setting is more dark and is orienting the series towards more paranormal/obscure storylines. I understand why they expanded this universe, as many questions are still unanswered, apart for Emma's fate.\n\nAnd while the locks could get you some white hair, the hidden objects are respecting the code back then: some very obvious, others well hidden or so small that you're missing them easily (I still don't know where is the hotdog in the treehouse for example). Thanks god, you don't have to clear each scene completely as you need to find a required number of clues. Generally, you can let two items on the side.\n\nAnother thing is that Ravenhearst doesn't seem to be translated here on Steam. So, unless you're used to English, you'll have some difficulties to find some items. I still don't remember what a spigot is and a fudge stick isn't something I would have in mind.\n\nThe graphics are quite correct and creepy, even if you're marvelling at the number of rooms in that manor. I mean, a surveillance room, really?\n\nAnyway, if anything, I'm glad to see Ravenhearst finally discounted during these sales. This one was on my wishlist since 2011... and while the price is reasonable, nowadays, you can find the game for less (I found some HOG in retails for 3 euros for example), so, yeah, a discount is probably the best way to acquire it.","December 26, 2015","true","6.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/recommended/50990/","shiaakuma","shiaakuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/","696 products in account","The most important thing to know about this game before you buy it is that it's an old-school hidden object game, NOT like the more modern Artifex Mundi-style titles.\n\nThis means that there is no real map, no inventory, no walking around to different locations.  Each "level" consists of a series of scenes ("rooms") that are cluttered with roughly 9849259025 items, and like modern HO game scenes you have to find around 8 objects in each room.  The "level" is cleared when you've found the right number of items; there are generally about three more items on the list than you need to progress so there is a little wiggle room if you really can't find something.  If you play for an extended time in one sitting, you'll find it gets a little repetitive; personally, I find this one better as a time killer once in a while rather than something to spend an afternoon playing.\n\nThe minigames are few and far between and consist of a puzzle to unlock a new room.  The puzzles are not the standard HO game fare that you may be used to if you play the more modern games.\n\nPlot is unfolded through a series of jigsaw puzzles after each "level" that unlocks a journal entry.\n\nThe biggest complaint I'd have is resolution; this game is made for older computers and it shows.  Items are sometimes difficult to find due to graininess/blur.  However, it is perfectly playable and although it perhaps didn't age all that well from a graphical standpoint, it is enjoyable if you like purely hidden-object games.\n\nSo in the end, the recommendation is positive for people that enjoy the HO aspects of modern Artifex Mundi and similar titles.  If you play the more recent titles and hate the HO part, you'll want to avoid this as there is little else.\n\nI would NOT get this game at full price; $9.99 is far too much for a ten-year-old game without any frills that didn't age that well.  Wait for a decent sale if you're planning to pick this up.","January 24","true","5.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
