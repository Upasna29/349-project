But this game is desperately lacking one, so I'm giving it a go – just for the fawn of it.\n\nThe Deer is a very short game, but it does what it is set out to do with plenty of charm. This game tries its best at being sweet and clear about a very special animal: the deer. It is easy to fallow along the explanations, without staggering behind – even if you happen to be a young calf.\n\nThe art is adorable – really, it's smooth as velvet! It caught my eye in a hart beat.\nThe mini-games are scarce and short, but I figure they suit their purpose well, so the game shouldn't loose points because of that.\nThe background music isn't exceptional or hyper-articulate, but it is suitable fur the brief playing time.\nConclusion:\n\nYou'll at least learn (and remember!) a hooveful of facts about the deer during this little endeavour, so buckle up and trot into a little discovering trip. I suppose kids will have more fun than does of us who are already too seasoned for some non-action non-adventurous non-super exploding point and clicking experience, but if the theory that learning is easier through games holds any truth, this game is a worthy purchase for the young – and therefore certainly amoosed. It will most surely help those who can't lern or grasp certain facts about such a splendid animal.\n\nJust remind your kids and yourself: this deer is not up for trophy!","December 7, 2015","true","2.5"," 97 of 117 people (83%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","83","97","117","52","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vornag/recommended/400240/","Vornag","Overgrown Bastion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vornag/","106 products in account","It doesn't take a significant amount of time to realize just what kind of narrative The Deer is trying to establish.\n\nThe Deer, taken at surface value, is an educational game oriented towards young children, going over the evolution of the deer as we know it, but it's far more than what it claims to be.\n\nAt it's core, The Deer is a gripping experience that asks the age old question of human existance and what it truly means to be alive. It is executed perfectly, never once taking control away from the player- an important detail that greatly aids us in understanding the central idea behind the game.\n\nThe game is thoroughly nihilistic in it's thoughts, questioning much (if not all!) of what we, as a species, consider important.\n\nI'll be spoiling the majority of the game, so if you wish to have a blind playthrough, don't read following section. It's currently on sale (Dec 4-10) for only 11 cents, and it's an absolute must have. Even without the sale it's only 19 cents, so you really don't have a reason to miss out on this gem. I highly recommend this game to anyone that's looking for a game with purpose and meaning.\n\nEDIT: Price has been raised, still worth it.\n\nRead the full review at pastebin com/Kf8UHQ36\n\n-----------SPOILER-----------\n\nThe game opens on a somber notice. Melancholy guitar plucks away in the background as a painting of our protagonist standing by a pool of water fades from full color to oversaturation, representing the passage of time. Summer becomes winter, winter becomes summer. Again and again the transition plays back and forth, all the while our protagonist is silently staring at the water, observing their own reflection.\n\nThis symbolises self-doubt and self-questioning. Our protagonist is unsure on how to continue with their life, coming back day after day and observing their reflection- their own self image and past. They quietly judge themselves, trying to correct their course in life as best as they can, mourning their losses and repenting over their wrongs. This continues day after day, our protagonist practically petrified in place, weighed down by their past actions and regrets.\n\nThe tragic part, however, is that they have no reflection. I'll leave that open to interpretation as many things can be derived from this one small detail, far too many to list in a single steam review, so let's simply continue\n\n\nAs we press play, the screen fades to black from left to right, which is an important detail. As everyone knows, when you play Mario, you go right. When you play Megaman, you go right. Right is the only and "correct" direction that you can go, any attempts to swim against the current are promptly shut down. This aggressive fade from left to right forces our character to move forward; to forget about their past (the left) and to boldly march forth into the future (the right.)\n\nAs the fade dissipates, we see our protagonist standing in a forest. For the first time since we've seen them, they appear happy and content with their situation. Relaxed, optimistic music plays in the background, birds sing their songs and the local wildlife goes about their preparation for winter. However, the trained eye will notice white outlines around some of the artwork, as though the surroundings were cut and pasted to form the scene, as though it was deliberately engineered to appear pleasant and happy.\n\nThe forest is an illusion; a mirage constructed by the psyche of our protagonist as they desperately try to block out reality. It's their own personal dreamland. They aren't -actually- happy. They want to be, but whatever was left in the past prevents them from doing so. This is when the player gains control over the character.\n\nThe controls are simple. A and D moves the character left and right. The mouse can be used to inspect and interact with the scenery. Please do recall, this is all still brilliantly disguised as an educational game targeted towards young children.\n\nOur character starts below a tree with the label "Memory" on it, with a play button below it. When clicked, the screen once again fades from left to right and we're greeted with the age old game of memory, in which we have 12 face-down cards we have to match with eachother. It's a trivial task for anyone with developed mental capacity, but what's strange about this section is that once we match all cards together, nothing happens.\n\nOur efforts, like our protagonist's, were for naught. Not a victory jingle, or any sound for that matter, is heard. Our only option is to go back to the forest by clicking the -left- button.\n\nOur character wants to go back. They wish to undo their wrongs.\n\nWhen we click the button, we get an uncharacteristic fade to black from right to left. Our character is ready to go back. But the fade is different now. A large black rectangle blocks the left part of our screen, symbolically preventing us and the protagonist from looking "back". The important detail here is that we were exiting the minigame -memory-. This is a metaphor for Alzheimer disease. Our character wishes to go back and repent, but, tragically, cannot remember what exactly they wish to go back and fix.\n\n\nWe're back in our character's false forest. When attempting to move there is a slight bit of delay. This is our character hesitating to make a move, wanting to stay where they are but wanting to make a change at the same time.\n\nThe longer we hold down a direction, the more difficult it becomes to start moving in the other one. People may view this as shoddy programming, but in truth this is intentional. As our idea gains more sway in our mind and we begin to dedicate more and more of our energy to it. It becomes increasingly harder to let go and we refuse to approach it from another angle.\n\nOur character is tunnel-visioned on one solution, unhealthily so.\n\nIf we attempt to go left we are, unsurprisingly, blocked off by an inconspicuous tree. What's important to note is that the further left you move, the denser the forest becomes, blocking more and more light, symbolising our character's dark and twisted past. Seeing this, they wish to move forward, but due to what was mentioned just earlier, it takes them a long while before they gather their resolve.\n\nThe protagonist is forced to move forward. There is no other solution.\n\nAs our character moves onward, the passage of time becomes more and more apparent. The forest begins shedding it's leaves and the ground is covered in snow. It's getting colder and colder. It represents the response our character received in their darkest hour from those that he cared and loved; the cold shoulder.\n\nShortly after we encounter our second minigame in which we have to help our protagonist make provisions for the winter. We select from a list of 12 (in truth 13) foods. Logically speaking, it's the player's objective to select the five foods that are fitting for a deer. In truth, however, it isn't. Like the previous minigame, this one doesn't reward you for completing it. Whether or not the player chooses correctly, incorrectly or not at all is irrelevant.\n\nThis is our character's current mindstate. They do not care whether they succeed or fail.\n\nThe only option, like previously, is the back button. Our character wants to go back. It's the only thing they care about, but they know the way back is blocked off and that the damage has already been done.\n\nThe protagonist and in turn we, the player, are forced to move forward.\n\nWe are railroaded in one direction. We cannot deviate, our path is clear-cut and unavoidable. Our protagonist is not fatalistic, they are simply powerless or without will to change their life. The "choice" of movement we are given isn't truly a choice, but a veil that gives us meaning, one that, when broken down, removes our false sense of purpose...\n\nRead more in the full review linked above.","December 4, 2015","true","1.8"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","92","57","62","48","3"

So let's just get that out of the way first, shall we?  Here goes:\n\nDeerie deerie me.  Oh, deerie deerie DEERIE me.\n\nThere.  Done.  Unlike numerous other reviews on this Store page, though, I'm now going to do my best to be somewhat impartial and objective about the product that you see before you.\n\nHmmm...let's see now.  Firstly, I do appreciate that this isn't for old ♥♥♥♥ers like me...it's for kids.  Really YOUNG kids, apparently.  Though, granted, really young kids who can still read words like "Pleistocene Epoch", but only with the added encouragement of getting to move a cute little digital deer about with the A and D keys.  So I'm going to do my best to be non-judgemental about that.\n\nThough let's be honest here...ninety-nine cents ain't a lot of money, but it's a tad steep for a game/"interactive experience" which takes significantly less than ten minutes for an adult like myself to "play" through.  And that's INCLUDING the "extras", which provide just an inkling more insight into the whole Pleistocene Epoch thing.  Even the slowest, stupidest ten year-old will get perhaps thirty minutes out of this, tops, and that probably includes REPLAYING the darn thing at least once, and maybe sitting a short exam afterwards prepared by a parent or adult guardian.\n\nI'm not questioning that this is probably a nice little educational "tool" for kids (apart from the bits where deers can apparently breathe underwater, and prehistoric creatures all wear Santa hats).  But as someone who doesn't generally buy or use such things - I have no kids myself, but could hardly resist this on sale for fifty cents or whatever it is I paid - I'm still inclined to assume that there's similarly-intended product out there which represents far, far better value for money.\n\nSo here's what I'm going to do.  I'm not only going to give this a thumbs-up - 'cause it's perfectly "fine" for what it is - I'm even gonna go as far as to give it a six out of ten, at least initially...then I'm going to dock it a point for having the gall to mention the word "Megalodon", before swiftly refusing to ACTUALLY SHOW ONE.  I'm sorry, but in my book, as well as that of my former ten year-old self, THIS JUST ISN'T ON.  Giant sharks were, and still are, all but the be-all and end-all of my world.  ♥♥♥♥ "show me the money"...SHOW ME THE MEGALODON, YOU ♥♥♥♥ERS!\n\nNow listen here, "Chubby Pixel".  I'm gonna let this one pass, if only just.  But for your next project, I not only want a "game" which goes for AT LEAST TWENTY MINUTES, I furthermore demand that it be ALL ABOUT GIANT SHARKS.  Charge me a dollar for that, and I promise that I WILL BUY IT.  I won't even wait on a sale.  And since it'll be set entirely in the water, and it won't be a frickin' DEER who's under the water, I fully expect the controls to include W and S, in addition to A and D.\n\nI'm glad we had this little chat, Chubby Pixel.  Remember: Sharks, same low price, WASD.  This time you get a pass - a C-minus, granted, but still a pass - but next time, young lad and young missy, I'll expect you to work a little bit harder, or you'll be facing EXPULSION.\n\nClass dismissed.  Now get out of my sight, before I call your parents!\n\nVerdict: 5/10.","January 9","true","0.5"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","73","44","60","32","7"

You control which direction a deer walks, read text message popups, and play a couple little kid minigames.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\n\nStory: The story? You play as Alfred the Deer, what's that? his name isn't Alfred? Well it's Alfred now, you join him on his deer story of coming to grips with depression of the loss of Dinosaurs.\nNot really, There's no story for the game.\n\nGame Play: Hello reader, have you looked at the store page for this game? Because after reading the store page there's no real point to playing the game. "Did you know there are no Dinosaurs in the ice age?" Yep. "Did you know that the Megalodon's are extinct?" Yup. "Did you know the Ice Age is called the Pleistocene?" Ye.....wait, what? "Can you pronounce that word, Atratzu?" Now you're just being sassy.\nI'm definitely not the age demographic for this game, and chances are, if you're reading my review: YOU AREN'T EITHER! This Game is probably geared for little kids who know how to read, or for you to read to your little kid while he or she hammers on your right and left keys or matches acorns and pollen.\nReally, the best use WOULD be to spend time with your little kid and let them play this, treat it like a bed time story book.\nFeatures: 2 mini-games ("A matching game", and "put the skeleton back together!"), hub world where you walk around and "learn" about the ice age or "Pleistocene".\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements, but I wish there was one that said "You're a full grown adult and played through this game while streaming it on twitch", but I guess that's too specific to apply to many other people.\n\nPrice: The stand alone price is $0.99, You can play through it in minutes, the longest I could drag it out on stream was 20 minutes. (Where's my cookie? I want a cookie for that, please.)\n\nConclusion: If you're over the age of.... 7, this isn't going to hold your attention, also if you're under the age of 7, wow you're an active reader if you look at my reviews, kudos kiddos!\nNow the real hard part... do I thumbs up or thumbs down? It's not a "bad game" it hardly feels like a game though, I'm going to thumbs it down because Steam really isn't the medium for this type of game, in my opinion.\nThanks for reading!","February 8","false","0.4"," 38 of 52 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","38","52","10","15"

Mainly for children,the game feature some minigames you can play. A memory game,where you connect the same object to the exact same other thing is where ever you find it at. Second one you just find the five correct foods the animals woud eat,even though it's impossible to fail any of the minigames,but I guess still offers some knowledge. Last one is just where you put a skeleton back together,that looks like a deer to me. The game is possible 10-15 mins long,if you spend your time doing the games and reading the stuff they offer you to read,well that you're supposed to actually read,due to this game is made for educational purposes,though for the price they ask seems a bit high in my opinion,but it's still not that expensive.

Going back and forth through the entire length, reading everything on display, clicking through "minigames", reading instructions and whole curiosities section in menu - it all takes a little under 10 minutes.\n\nThe artstyle is nice to look at, but that's the only positive thing I can say about it. I have no idea who the target audience is - not adults that's for sure. As for children - they would need to be old & knowledgeable enough to read English (there are no other languages), exhibit high tolerance for boring random tidbits of knowledge and be ok with no other elements to entertain them (just get your kid some nicely illustrated and well edited children's book on this topic instead).\n\nThe only gameplay there is (pressing A & D to walk left & right) is clunky - it takes several presses to switch direction, and The Deer will often continue walking in the previous direction for a while, even when the opposite button used. Sometimes it will get stuck going in one direction and if you want to walk another way you need to restart the game... Clicking often misses it's mark (most apparent in the "find 5 right foods" minigame - what gets marked is usually somewhere around the cursor, not under it, sometimes you need to click a couple of times for the game to register). Oh and those issues persist even in the correct resolution. What resolution is that? Well apparently anything 16:9 - if you pick different ratio (windowed/ fullscreen - no difference), then the sides will be cut off (which is apparent by things like half a home button in the curiosities section or half of the deer head stamp you receive after solving a minigame).\n\nBasically what little gameplay they had in there, they couldn't even make that right.","April 2","false","2.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

When I first heard of this I thought we get to play through the life of a Deer and learn things along the way... that'll be an interested concept. However I was fastly disappointed and heres why.\n\nPros:\n♦ Game is playable and works (Doesn't crash or have bugs)\n♦ Graphics seem decent (For what it is, they are decent)\n♦ Has Steam Trading Cards (It's good that is has them, but see my cons on this as well)\n\nCons:\n♦ Expensive for the time you get out of it (It took me 4minutes to read and do everything, 4 minutes for a dollar...)\n♦ Way too short (Took 4mins to complete the whole game)\n♦ Information was weird (Some was interesting and others was just like why would an educational game say that?)\n♦ Minigames were pointless (There was only 3 and each one had no timer, no score... essentially had no aspects to make them even worth playing or replaying)\n♦ No replayability (Once you play it once, there is no reason to go back)\n♦ Not enough content to unlock Trading Cards (As I said it's good to have them, but as cards take 2hours to drop and this game takes 4minutes to play, why have them?)\n♦ No Achievements (There could easily have been achievements)\n♦ No point purchasing the game (I say this because the gameplay advertisement video on the store page literally shows the whole game... why buy something when you can see it unlimited times for free?)\n♦ Isn't really an educational game about Deer (Don't get to play through the life of a Deer, only really gives random facts about random animals, objects and things around him)\n♦ Concept of Water in this game is misleading for Children (I say this as the Deer walks under water and puts on a scuba diving helmet and can breathe. For an educational game, that is far from being very educational as this is not what actually happens and by doing this it could teach kids that if they throw a deer into a lake, it'll be able to breathe which isn't the case).\n♦ Poorly executed game (Game has potential to be massive and highly educational, except it's short, has minimal educational facts and little to no fun gameplay)\n\nOverall, I think the game creators knew there wasn't enough content in the game and hence made Steam Trading Cards to make it look like people were playing their game for at least over 2 hours which probably looks good for it's $1 price. Also as the whole game took me 4mins to complete and the fact you can watch the whole game for free on their Steam Page via their advertisement gameplay video... I wouldn't recommend wasting $1 on this game as you'll be highly disappointed like I was.\n\nPS: To review I had to play for 1 more minute as I needed 5mins to review not 4.","March 13","false","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/400240/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1596 products in account","The Deer is an educational game brought to us by Chubby Pixel; the publisher behind such gems as Paradise Island and Woodle Tree Adventures. The game teaches specifically about the Pleistocene epoch, commonly known as the Ice Age, and the store page claims that you will "discover everything about marvelous era". Unfortunately, this proclamation is far from the truth.\n\nIn all actuality, you'll learn a few facts... a very few facts. The title lasts a mere 3-5 minutes, and that's with completing the three mini-games that make up this otherwise deer walking simulator. Neither the developers or publisher have stated an age market that they are attempting to cater to, but I would guess between the ages of 12-15 as many of the words and terms utilized are too complex for the average younger children. The mini-games themselves are of no educational value, and are simply in place to elongate the already substantially short experience.\n\nThe bottom line... your child or student is much better off with a book, or even the Wikipedia page. I will say that the artwork for the game is well detailed and pleasing to look at, although that is really the only pro point for The Deer. Even at a five minute longevity, this title is just not worth your time, effort, or money.

Teach kids about Ice Age...\nThe graphics are cute, although I had some problems with resolution...\nThe texts are fine... I liked reading through...\n\n... but... This game is so lazy made, that it made me cry... You walk around with A/D keys... but for me whichever you press it will go, first to the left to the end, and then to the right... It's probably the problem that only I got, since I don't see anyone complaining... So, let's go to the second problem;\nThere are 3 mini games... Only 3, that have no replay value... I know that attention span of kids is low, but 3 very, very mini games... Every game is just played and finished without ANY feedback... When you finish it (or you think you did), you need to press BACK button to return...\n\nAfter all; Idea is great... I really like it and support these kind of games  for kids... It would be nice to have some mod for languages (not everyone are English, and it's important to have these kind of games in native language)... But it should be done with more care, and not just rushed through... But then, again, for this price you can't argue too much... But I really wished for it to be better and longer made... And a little bit pricier, for that matter...\n\nSo, message to developers; Please, continue to make similar games, with similar graphics (I really liked it) but make it longer and with higher quality...","December 4, 2015","false","2.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","3"

The gameplay video does reveal pretty much all the aspects of the game. If you are older, getting this game for your child may be good, while if your trying to get it for yourself you should buy the game while it is on sale or get it free from a giveaway.

I remember that, like it was today.\n\nSuch a shiny day, the sun was above my house, smiling at me, starring right into my eyes. I said: "Hello sun!" The sun has smiled, and  blinked on me. I have opened my window, so a little ladybird could come in, and say hello to me too! I said "Hello, little buggy friend!" The ladybird smiled at me, and gived me a little poop.\n\nI have turned on my computer, imagining a nice, beautiful games that i could play. I opened my folder called "The Folder" and saw program Steam. I said "Hello steam! What a nice day, isnt it?" Steam said "Yes my friend", and blinked to me. I have runned the program as administrator, and clicked on the beautiful "Queue" icon. I saw a lot of games, but the one i saw that day, wasnt like the others. It was called The Deer. I was wondering. " Is it a game? or some kind of porn i havent seen yet? " I have clicked on it, and bought thousand of copies, for my imaginary friends. Finally, the games was after hours of majestic updates and tons of gigabites, downloaded and installed. I have double-clicked on the icon, and almost burned from my hot expecting. Then the logo came out. "the Deer" I have screamed to the house, called my parents, and got the camera. The game was running, at 100 FPS. I would never think of that, cause of the expensive requirements, the game wanted. I saw the beautiful looking menu, and cute little deer, starring at me. I have pressed the button PLAY and....\n\nThe Adventure has begun. I have walked trough prehistoric forests, sees and oceans, learned a thousand things from history, about life and about deers. I feel like, i am connected to deer somehow, i feel like. Like if the deer died, my entire life was about nothing. The game, the deer, and everything about it, is awesome. I highly recommend this game to everyone, wondering, how it could be 1000000 years back in past. The Deer is not just a game. The Deer is love, the deer, is life.\n\n\nAfter this review, i feel like a little bit autist, but that is alright, my mom had me tested.\n\n\n***Non of ladybirds has been hurted during this story, and the sun is still happy***","January 5","true","4.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","6","11","6","0"

Or rather about a deer and the holocene and pleistocene time periods. It's a bit of a collection of trivias and tidbits of information strung together in a game-format. The information can be found by mousing over parts of the environment as you walk along with the deer. The music is okay as background music, and the visuals are cute and neat. I enjoyed myself in the few minutes that I played this game. I bought it for 11 cents on sale and it's a good price, but I'd be willing to pay up to 1 euro for this concept, even though it's short. A series of this sort would be a good idea, even though it's more of a short relaxing visual journey than anything else.\n\nIt would be a great way for (young) kids to learn about life in earlier time periods on Earth, but it doesn't really teach them much. I think it would be a great way to see if a kid is interested in knowing more about the history of life on Earth. The minigames a very simple, but at least it's something extra to interact with.","December 8, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

With magnificent over-the-top action taking place in stages that are a veritable theme park of exciting attractions, The Deer pushes the limits of the action genre, bringing to life its fast-paced, dynamic climax combat. 9.5/10","May 14","true","0.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

This affection slowly into a crippleing addiction towards sexy deers. I have jerk off to many female deers such as but not limited to bambi, bambi's mother and real life deers. Many people see me as a freak, but I can assure you that I am not weird. I develped my deer love because of an experience I had while hunting, I accidentally stuck my ♥♥♥♥ into the dead deer and this was the beginning of my love life. Anyways, back on the review for 'The Deer', this game is actually fufilling my childhood dream of being a deer. Additionally, the way the character moves is absolutly magnificent, every time I see it move a little bit of ♥♥♥ squirts out of my ♥♥♥♥♥, this has made playing 'The Deer' a bit of a challenge since I will run out of ♥♥♥ before even reaching the first puzzel. However, if you don't experience the same problem as I do I would recommend this game for you and your ♥♥♥♥♥.\nAlso, don't believe this guy -----> http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198239685890.","December 7, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This is one such game. The Deer is an educational game for children that aspires to teach players about the Ice Age. The focus is on the deer and its immediate surroundings. Like the mouse. And an oak tree. The game can be completed in less than 5 minutes. Using an abysmal control scheme, you guide the deer from the left to the right. There’s the aforementioned mouse, oak tree, a squirrel and a rhino. After about 5 meters, you come to a lake. Not a problem because deer don’t swim, they simply walk along the bottom of the lake. After about 4 meters of underwater walking, there’s nowhere else to go. Along those 9 meters of gameplay, you can click on three points of interest to play three mini-games. One is a memory game, the other is about recognizing deer food (deer don’t eat fries from McDonald’s – shock!), and I don’t even know what the hell was the third one about anymore.\n\nI didn’t learn crap from this game. But the worst offending thing is the horrible grammar, especially considering that this is supposed to be an educational game. “Between the companions of The Deer, there were even the lazy dormouses.” “Did you know that the majestic oaks can live even 1000 years?” “Near the lake, lived even many frogs and toads.” Unless you want your kids to learn broken English, stay away. Absolute bullcrap. Apart from the illustrations, which are nice and which drew me to the game along with the premise, the only good thing was that I bought the game during launch for 11 cents (the developer has since increased the price to 99 cents). It has trading cards, so I actually made a profit.\n\n1 OUT OF 10 (TERRIBLE)","December 14, 2015","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wouldn't bother writing this review (that took more time than playing the game) if the publisher didn't ask nice.\nFirst of all the art is beutiful, no doubts about that. But I didn't come to look at pictures I came to play and the UX was very underwhelming (I'm also a Unity game dev myself):\n* First of all using the free edition of Unity seems very unprofessional but considering the scale of the game I'll give it a pass.\n* The walking mechanic which is just walking left or right with A and D (with no other input option like the arrow keys) and even simple thing like that doesn't work and you can't turn for some reason if you changed the direction once. WTF?! I don't know how they screwed something that simple.\n* It's just walking to either direction until you hit a wall, on the right side you walk underwater but this game supposed to be educational so why the heck that dear can breath under water?!\n* The memory game is broken, instead of giving feedback if you chose the two coresponding items (every two items of course) they just disappear after 4 seconds. This is not how it should work, how did you screw it up?\n* All mini-games don't end when they're finished. You need to exit yourself manually. Why? Also the mini game don't tell you when it's finished.\n* It takes about 5 minutes top to finish this game including reading about the era when that deer was alive.\n* On the plus side it has steam trading cards hence my more than 5 minutes gameplay. But it seems that it is either a lie, mistake or another mis-implementation since no badge are actually available.\n\nI can't recommend this because paying for less than 5 minutes unchallenging game when basic simple stuff isn't implemented right seems unjust.","December 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 14 of 34 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","14","34","3","13"

You learn about other animals that live with the Deer, what the deer likes to eat, and all and all it a pretty good educational game. The art is adorable, and the Deer has to be the cutest character in the game. My only problem was it was extremely short, but it was free so I'm not complaining about anything other than wanting to learn more and look at more of this art style. This was the first game I have played by Chubby Pixel, and I gotta say I really wanna check out there game "Woodie Tree."\n\nLast not about the game is that around December all the animals are wearing Santa hats. It's adorable.\n\nIt's free, so I would recomend it to those who like ambient and relaxing adventures.","December 14, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not worth the buck (pun intended).\n\nPROS :\n- cute graphics\n- soothing music\n- (not quite useful) informations about the pleistocene epoch\n- Steam trading card (the only reason I bought this game on discount)\n\nCONS :\n- too short\n- only 3 mini games\n- only several minutes play time (I played several hours just to receive the trading card drops)\n- poorly executed\n\n============================================================\n\nFULL REVIEW ::\n\nDid you know that majestic oaks can live even 1000 years?\nI don't.\nAnd this game tells me that stuff along with other things about the pleistocene epoch.\n\nThe concept is quite good; making children learn something using interactive media like this. Cute graphics, soothing music, and simple gameplay. That's perfect, right?\nNOPE.\nIt's poorly executed. You can only go right, left, and find "hidden" informations about the pleistocene epoch in the background. There are 3 mini games that you can play once and you won't play it again.\n\n1. Memory : Match similar images from a set of images. Once you've completed it there's no message or anything. You just press back button and that's it. Try replay it and you'll find the same images position from previous game. They didn't even bother randomizing it. :(\n\n2. Snack and Lunches : Choose 5 foods that deers ate. If you choose wrong it will display X on the image, otherwise it will display a checkmark. You can choose all the foods. There's no message on completing the game, just like the previous game. Well, at least you get to know what deers ate.\n\n3. Paleopuzzle : There are scattered bones and a silhouette of a deer. Place the correct bones into the deer. If you place it correctly the bones will auto-snap into the right position. And just like the other games, it has no message when you've completed the puzzle.\n\nYes, that's the whole game. I'm not trying to undermine the developer's effort in developing this game, but I've made a better "game" for my history subject in high school within only several days. At least make the deer's journey longer, add more minigames, and make it more interesting.\n\nI bought it on 90% discount at around $0.1 so I won't complain too much. But this game doesn't deserve its full price.","December 7, 2015","false","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Just a tiny bit of adnimation & movement with some educational facts here and there.  The 3 minigames are really stupid, and not even random if you were to replay them.  Because it is so simple, people will say it is for kids.  But the memory game relies only on you picking the 2 same ones fast enough, which sometimes was taxing on my hand for one of the pair, let alone a less coordinated child.  This looks like a little project someone threw together on a few weekends.  There is probably far better & more interesting free stuff on the internet.  I barely got 6 minutes through this before I couldn't stand it anymore.  I doubt a child would really find this interesting, and I sure didn't find anything amusing.\n\nHowever, I got it for trading cards.  It succeeds at that.

It puts you straight into the shoes of an early ancestor of the deer to walk around and learn about how your creature was created. You will soon realise that this journey of deer is simply a metaphore for how mankind has developed a tendancy to overlook our own self realisation and ancestry creating a mass overreliance on our peers.
