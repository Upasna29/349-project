The game concentrates on the core: The level design and elements are brilliant. The sountrack is C64 sid style genius. High replay value as levels can be played for speedrun times or for exploration to find all secret areas.","November 8, 2015","true","50.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"
