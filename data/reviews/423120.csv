Instead of studying for actual finals, I played an interactive novel where my character *ahem* negotiates for a higher grade and bombs another class on moral principles. I couldn't have asked for a better time.\n\n(+) Most importantly, the novel is well-written. As in, amazingly well-written. If this novel was published and in a bookstore, I'd scoop the novel up for $20.\n(+) Fun and inventive characters. It was impossible to choose a favorite, but Tress is a L'Oréal goddess.\n(+) Lots of character customization. My costume was a hot mess. Also, I love the inclusiveness with options for "asexual" and "non-binary gender."\n(+) Lots of romance options. Hey Mob ;)\n(+) Did I mention this game is well-written?\n\n(-) The story isn't complete. You'll have to wait for Part Two, but good things come to those who eat their vegetables.\n(EDIT: This doesn't mean that the game isn't "unfinished." This is the start of a trilogy and there's enough material in Part One to whet your appetite until Part Two is released. The ending is doesn't feel rushed or ends abruptly.)\n\nI cannot wait to see what happens in Part Two. There are so many unanswered questions! The spoiler contains a semi-spoilerific open-ended question for the author/anyone who wants to answer. My character wished he had super strength as a kid, so when I knew about Mob's ability, I knew that was the RO for my character. However, there was one line that intrigued me. This line was around Downfall's final exam. Mob mentioned that he felt unusually stronger around the classmates and faculty, so is it possible that my character develops super strength despite not being a Z-Person? Or is it because of Downfall revealing her abilities? Or something else entirely? Who knows?\n\n10/10 Would accidentally rename myself as Captain Powerless again","December 5, 2015","true","10.7"," 64 of 84 people (76%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","76","64","84","19","5"

The subject matter is something I am really interested in (Heroes and comics) and given how badly most comics are written these days (new 52,,, yuck) this is a breath of fresh air.    This is like the movie Sky High, which I also loved (wish they had made a sequel) I have logged a lot of hours trying to get all of the   sub plots (and trying to pick which one will be my starting point for the next installment).\n\nBe advised, this game is exactly what it says.   Text based, with only a few images at the start and no music.  Other than that, it is a lot like Long Live the Queen and Magic Diary.    I am impressed with how much dialog is included, it is like a Choose Your Own Adventure ... novel.   I think it (by in large) avoids the pit falls of the Choose your Own Adventure books,  if you really think about the choices and the characters... the responses make sense.   For the cost... it is a real steal.\n\nI recently got a little burned following Life Is Strange, but I think the developer of this game will come through with a lot of endings at the end that will please everyone.   I think the problem with Life is Strange is that producing a bunch of endings when you have voice talent, music, and graphical images, and a lot of overhead,  is very difficult.   I have really high hopes that in the end of this game, if you make the right choices, some endings may actually be very rewarding.  I wish it had a few more images, for key plot twists... but it is still fun to use your imagination.","December 13, 2015","true","53.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

The writing for the choices themselves and the ongoing effects they had really made me feel like I was playing my character and wasn't being ham-fisted into binary options.\n\n\n(+) The writing is fantastic. Characters have charm and the over-arching story is both interesting and engaging.\n(+) Flexibility in character styles and choices\n(+) Re-playability\n\n(-) The UI for the menu and stat-tracking is poorly designed.

Maybe not on the parents side, but this is the closest I've felt to losing a loved one in my life so far. I can not recommend this enough. I'm still crying from all the mistakes I made. I made all my choices carefully, I was cautious and I still ♥♥♥♥ed up.\n\n"You can not change the past but you can work towards the future"\n\nThis story single handedly changed me from a wise-cracking detective with a heart of gold simply looking for love with a paper girl called Origami into a hateful, spiteful, Batman-like figure hellbent on revenge. And on a level of real emotions and passion, these choices were made with those in mind. I feel this pain, I'm griefing the losses and my mistakes and I just know, when part 2 comes out, I'm going to make many more terrible choices in anger and grief. Here's looking at you Crook. We'll ♥♥♥♥ Manipulator up, screw everything else.\n\nHere's where I'll take someone elses review format (griffit8 to be precise) and put in my own opinions.\n\nPros(+) It is EXTREMELY well written. Very long if you consider the amount of hours you'll get out of it with a quite bountiful study system and skill variety that quite clearly affect the outcome of your actions.\nProtip, don't try to be a jack of all trades or you're gonna have a bad time. You know what, do do that, it's a part of the experience to play as yourself.\n\n(+) All of the characters are extremely memorable and unique archetypes.\nThe best part is your choices of what you say will generally always coincide with their personalities and elicit a response in regard. The great thing about this is you will actually make friends and '?a love interest?' to match your personality.\n\n(+) The character customization is nice and is done over quite a few pages and kinda never really ends as you evolve tiny amounts throughout the story.\n\n(+) So much romance, so little time. I ended up alone, simply for making the wrong choices no matter how right they seemed, but it never felt detached and it always flowed perfectly.\n\n(+) The Price is amazing for such a well developed story. I would easily pay $15 for this.\n\nCons(-) I would also mention the story being incomplete but as mentioned, it is a trilogy with part 2 currently being worked on. I love this story and can't wait, but 2017 is a big wait at this point.\n\n(-) This isn't really a con of the game, just a con in general because you made me really sad with the ending I got, BOO HOO!\n\nFinal ThoughtsIf I haven't already said it a hundred million times. If you love a good story, like to read, like to choose your own adventure, love plenty of choice options, a bit of romance and making plenty of terrible choices that will affect and reverberate the entire outcome of the world around you then getting this is a no-brainer!\n\nFor the Developer/AuthorIf you do read this, I would really appreciate a text document of all the characters personalites and appearances presented in the story. I'd go through it myself but I can't bring myself to read the story again at this moment, I'm still really shaken up.\nI'd like to use them for reference for some fanart I'd love to do. Consider me a part of this universes fandom! A self-insert addition would also be my wise-cracking, cautious but do all you can for your friends even at the cost of your life, studious but terrible at physical activities detective in a trenchcoat, Dusk, I really feel like he was a part of the story too.","January 2","true","5.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

I really did. But this story just isn't at the same level of quality as others that Choice Of Games has released. I understand that this is under the Hosted Games label, but it's not even close. I own almost all of the COG games on steam, and this is the only one that has regularly made my choices feel forced and meaningless. This is also the only story that has regularly failed to provide me with the choice that I thought was the correct decision for the situation.\nThings you need to know:\n- Part of a planned trilogy. Nowhere on the store page does it say this.\n- Incomplete story (Not even the story arc in this chapter is fully resolved and nothing is really wrapped up. It just...)\n- Inconsistent quality. (Some spelling and grammar mistakes. Most of the problems are strange writing problems like scenes that are out of order or contradict things stated in previous paragraphs in the same scene.)\n- Several choices require knowledge from previous plays to make the "right" choice.\n- Many choices have unclear consequences.","December 10, 2015","false","7.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The second time I played through the way I wanted to play through it. Honestly, it took me half the first playthrough to get what was happening. I cannot wait for the next installments.\n\nAlso, I never play these types of games, but the idea of a community college choice oriented super hero game attracted me to this game. If you are debating getting this game because you are interested, give it a shot, it's worth it.\n\nI'll also say this, some decisions you make do not change the outcome of specific events, but there are choices that influence the majority of game play. I hated my first gameplay and I played again with a new idea behind my super hero and did a 180 flip with my character and he's at a place where my first character was not even REMOTELY close to. It's very reminiscent of those old novels that you would make a choice and go to "page ___ to continue."\n\nTL;DR: It's fun. Don't deny it because its text based.

It's the first part in a series of who knows how many installments.\n\nThere seems to be this intricate system in place of tracking how well liked you are, what your stats are, what your equipment is... It doesn't matter one bit. It's just fluff and doesn't do anything. Maybe it does in the sequels but for now it doesn't and that's all that matters.\n\nI guess if you're a fan of these developers, then you'll like this. It was my first experience with these guys and I'm not impressed at all.\n\nTo give you an idea: imagine a school kind of like Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Add in a Harry Potter-esque atmosphere, except with some adult themes and fanfic tier plotbuilding. At least the grammar seemed alright. And then at the end of this flaccid ride, it just ends.

A checkpoint system would be excellent for redoing chapters or single choices instead of replaying the entire game up to the point in question. At the very least, there should be an unlockable checkpoint system otherwise you end up clicking through the game without reading and tend to miss points or other choices.\n- The stats in this game are ridiculously confusing. The stats for your character have words like "pow" and "woosh" each signifying strengths and public image. Additionally, there is another stat menu showing four character traits.  Because of their confusing nature I never used them and ended up making choices through trial and error.\n\nAs for all text choice games on steam, this game is text only. No music or images. If that deters you I would play the demo for free on steam and make the decision from there on. Personally, I don't find the $4 price tag too much considering how well made and enjoyable this game was. If you do find it pricey, you can always wait till a sale.\n\nExcited to see how the rest of the story plays out.\n8/10\n","March 16","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Major spoilers. My overall impression of the game is negative. While I do like the world they have created, everything else about this game is, in my opinion, pretty sub-par. On a site where the other CYOA games are much more well written and flat-out better than this game, i'm surprised by the amount of positive reception this has recieved. Maybe it just knows its audience. I mean on the offical thread for this game, people were talking less about the quality of the writing and more about how to romance Stoic. It should give you a rough idea of who this CYOA game is for.\n\nStory and characters The story doesn't really go anywhere. The only major plot point is the contrarian, but we know just as much about her at the beginning as we do at the end. She shows up, blows up a few things and leaves, leaving the characters just as confused, and essentially in the same place as they were at the beginning of the game. The school closes down and they have to study in a field somewhere which is interesting, but it's reopened again by the end of the game anyway which makes the whole "leaving the school" thing entirely redundant. In fact, most of the plot doesn't really go anywhere. The only real difference between the beginning and end of the game is the fact that Origami dies (a character who was fun, but with very little depth), Nil leaves and is replaced (a character who's entire purpose is to be mysterious) and Stunner leaving for Prestige. Everything else is the same. Speaking of characters, every character is a one dimentional caricature of a human being. The most interesting thing about them are the secrets that the game keeps hyping up, but I always just felt the game was just shortchanging me by making me fight for even a slither of character development that the secrets provide. They are things that really only work if there are other things that make your characters more interesting. But the secrets were it. I wouldn't disagree with people saying it is written like a fanfiction.\n\nBad stat screen I have no idea what any of the numbers mean, and some of the stats just make no sense. The personality ones for example. They're all percentages but I have no idea what the percentages mean. Are they meant to represent the percentage that your personality is that trait? If so, why don't all the percentages add up to 100%? What about the relationship screen, what's that about? The game just assigns a random value on each character, but what does this value even mean? It goes higher when I kiss peoples asses but I don't get what the numbers for. It was even more confusing when i saw that the hidonist was -2 for me. So is our relationships so bad now that he's repulsed by me? I don't know, he isn't really treating me any differently. The stat screen for your skills aren't much better. They use onomatopoeia in order to represent the different skills. For example, strength would be "pow" on the stat screen, speed would be "whoosh" and so on. It was cute for the first ten minutes of the game, before you realised those stats are incredibly important and you'll probably be looking at them the most in the game. In which case you are soon left frustrated as you keep needing to look back at the "Explanation of Stats" at the bottom of the page.\n\nCombat system is awfulI have no idea what choices uses what skills, which means most of the time I'm just guessing what to do in combat, which usually leads to me losing. Does charging use the strength skill or the speed skill? Is it both? Maybe its defensive but I have no clue, the game doesn't tell me. Even things like punches and kicks, one time the game refers to a punch as a "quick punch". Am I supposed to infer that means it uses the speed skill rather than strength? Did punching ever use the strength skill? I assume it does but the game gives me no feedback. Do the numbers attached to the skills even have any bearings on the outcome of the fight? I have no clue. This is made even worse by the fact that there is no way to revert back to the beginning of a chapter or whatever. If you screw up, you have to play the whole game again.\n\nAnnoying non-choicesThey are there solely to give the illusion to the player that they have more choice than they actually have. Some of these come disguised as legitimate choice options that reveal their true nature after you select something, the game explaining it away usually with a character shutting you up before you get to say anything or someone attacking you before you get to make a move. These are annoying but they don't happen too often. However, most come in the form of painfully contrived questions directed at the player asking you about how you feel about something. Things like "How do you feel about Prestige?", "What is your opinion on the Hidonist?", "Do you regret going to the slumber party?" and so on are so common in this game. My personal favourite asks you something along the lines of "What do you think Tress is going to say?" Really? In a true CYOA, the game would actually LET me choose what she is going to say, or at the very least, it wouldn't feel like it needs to ask those sorts of questions because there would be plenty of other choices in the game. This game seems desperate for actual choices, which leads me to my next point.\n\nIt shouldn't be a CYOA, it should be a bookThis is one of those CYOA games that don't play at all to the strengths of the medium. It's so caught up in telling its own story that it forgets that it's meant to be a choose your own adventure, I mean it's the name of the genre for gods sake! Do you know how much better it would be if instead of the game shamelessly forcing you to interact with certain characters, you got to choose? I mean I guess it did that when you got to decide what things you wanted to study, but I never did that for the characters, I did it to get my skills up. There are scenarios where if you don't do what the game wants you to do, you are punished by being stripped of content altogether rather than given an alternate route. My go to for this argument is at the beginning of the game, where if you p*ss off Tress (aka easily the most annoying character in the game) and Stunner (aka D**chebag McDudebro) by losing the capture the flag match or leaving a bad impression on Tress, you don't get to talk to them outside of school in that issue. At all. Instead of being given alternate ways of interacting with the characters, Tress just flat-out blanks you at the supermarket and you don't run in to Stunner at all. This is a problem that is a lot bigger in the grand scheme of things. At the end of the game, you get to choose whether to run to be the team leader. If you choose to do so, each member of your team will vote for either you or Tress to be leader. On my "technically" third playthrough, I lost. I was confused because while I wasn't getting top grades, I still thought I was more compitent than Tress was. So I searched through the COG forums and realised that the only way people will vote for you is if their arbitrary relationship number was high enough. This immediately makes one of the most subjective things about the game (who you interact with and who you talk to) completely objective, where you are screwed over if you don't talk and build a relationship with the right people from the start.\n\nOverall, pretty bad IMO. Get Tin Star. Or something else other than this.\nEDIT: Grammar and formatting","December 20, 2015","false","12.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Some of the characters are interesting (the most intriguing aspect of the game is trying to find out each student's secret) and the game definitely has its moments, but writing is a bit ham-handed and there were two major issues that greatly reduced the enjoyability for me:\n\n- The plot is strictly rail-roaded. There are several occasions where you are offered various choices, only to see the game tell you that what youi chose was not possible after all and some of the choices you did not pick occurred instead. There are several odd non-choices, where you are just asked to select an opinion that has no effect on anything. And none of tthe choices you make actually affect the  course of the main story;.basically your choices only affect which relatiomships and skills are advanced, there are no multiple possible storylines.\n\n- This does not feel llike a complete independent game. You start developing a character and following his/her story, but In the end everything is just left hanging in the air and you get an advertisement for the sequel – you are told merely the opening chapters here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/konamilano/recommended/423120/","konamilano","Kona Milano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/konamilano/","911 products in account","TL;DR: A by-the-numbers fanfic in game form. Wait until the story is completed or at the very least an editing pass is done.\n\nCommunity College Hero is a novella-length text adventure game. I drew a comparison to a novella because certain events will take place in a certain order regardless of the choices you make. This is in comparison to "choose-your-own-adventure" games where the genre can shift dramatically and the game is full of ways to die at random.\n\nOur story takes place over a semester at Speck Community College's Heroes Among Us Program. The story hinges around conceits that are straight from the bad fanfic stock trope list:\n\nA school for the specially gifted which is run by the adult members of the community the young ones will be joining.\nYou are the school's sole muggle student; in what may be the most egregious example of the Everyman Quota trope I've ever seen, there is literally one position for a non-powered student, and you fill it.\nThe protagonist is secretly extremely special, of course. They're one of the world's first legacy heros - they're the child of a villain.\nYou join a diverse cast of heroes that can step up to perform any role the character doesn't.\nAlthough being described as the 'rejects' from the more popular schools of higher hero learning, they may wind up being the ones that save the world anyways.\nSo the story's pacing follows the beat of a well-worn drum, similar to every High School Alternate Universe fanfic you've ever read. That's not an immediate condemnation; what it lacks in originality it can easily make up for in writing quality, heart, and evocativeness.\n\nThe game is at its best when it comes to your fellow classmates. You'll be wondering about Dirty Girl, the almighty Combat Wombat, Origami, Tress, and Crook. Even bit parts have something to remember about them. Most of the characters have different-enough voices when read, and have different enough views on the world and actions in the scenes that you can tell who's speaking without needing to be explicitly told; this is something that many books and even many comic books don't get right, and this is when Community College Hero is firing on all cylinders. Many of the characters subvert expectations in at least a small way once you get to know them - you might be surprised to find out who is actually a villain trying to go straight, and who is a powerhouse 'slumming it' with your class. The other heroes in this game are what give the story a "one more page" quality, and why my first playthrough to 2am was immediately followed by a second playthrough, just so I could get in the heads of other characters and take some roads less travelled.\n\nWhile your classmates are well-written, your teachers and the other metas of the world aren't. Nil has as much character development as his name suggests. Downfall is a straight up brute, no matter what you do. Ms. McCormick is the token muggle professor. Captain California is as sleazy as his name suggests. The Hedonist is just as ham-fisted as you'd expect. The only superbeing outside your class that really gets any development or time is the Contrarian, and even she is poorly developed. Finally, there's Mega Cat, who is namedropped continually... but whom we are left utterly in the dark about. Is he a hero? A villain? A talk show host? I've played through the games several times at this point, and I couldn't tell you who he is, what he is, why he's name dropped by almost everyone, or why I should care.\n\nThe world, itself, also varies. Being written by a lawyer, the description of superhero law is actually fairly interesting (and I wanted more!); if you like reading Law and the Multiverse, this game will scratch that itch nicely for you. Other than that, the world is fairly beige, damning for a four-color genre; you have a vague idea that the diversion point between our world and their world is 'Zenith technology', but the only description of that that matters is a note that you didn't benefit from it.\n\nThe actions you take on the world are varied. Some actions, which mark turning points in whether or not a character will sleep with you later in the game how characters see you, are little more than two short sentences. Other times, actions you think will be brief encounters are given detailed, even moving descriptions, with multiple path branching within that subevent and several meaningful dialogue choices. The differences between the two are jarring, particularly as they can be juxtaposed right next to each other.\n\nIt's incredibly easy to be spoiled early - and I don't just mean the achievements. All game long, there's a 'Stats' screen you can pull up to check your inventory and attributes, as well as prior grades. This same screen will also tell you your exact relationship level with several students - and whenever a student doesn't appear in this section, you can tell for certain that all actions taken there are just wasted potential. (Too bad if you like the duo of Rain and Shine - or the class clown Hi-Jinx - they don't get a relationship track.)\n\n(Speaking of spoilers, there's a joke in the achievements about Community College Villain: Coming in 2017!. If this game's finale just got spoiled by its achievements - both in how this game will end, and how long it'll take to get there - I'm going to be disappointed.)\n\nI feel this game needs an editor, badly; of course none is listed in the credits, just playtesters. And that's a shame. I'm not just referring to the spelling that was obviously machine-checked, or the multiple punctuation issues or sentences left hanging mid-sentence. There are multiple inconsistencies in the world's canon - sometimes even between the text and the choices; after being told that action A is frankly impossible, you are given action A in your very next choice list - and selecting it reveals that choice A is definitely possible. Just having an editor to help massage the sentence structure would help mightily. From the odd lack of adverbs and clauses, and some word choice issues, I get the feeling that English isn't the author's native language. It's never grammatically incorrect (punctuation issues aside); it's just not an English writing style.\n\nThe game lets you down in the end. Several plot threads are hanging in midair, and the game's epilogue does nothing to resolve them, but instead ham-fistedly opens up several new options. And then: "Join us for Episode 2 of a multi-part series!" No sign of how many parts there are, nor how long we'll be waiting, nor if we'll need to buy in for another $3.99 for another set of chapters, nor if we'll ever be able to hit on the cute brother-sister team that takes up one of the chapter headings.\n\nFinally, I think a change of engine is in order. The Choice of Games engine is extremely limiting; the program never feels like a native application, but rather like a HTML 3-era webpage. For a story that comes in paragraph beats like this one, a visual novel engine such as Ren'Py might be better suited. It'd also give us a chance to see more of artists Shane Martin's lovely oil paintings - and I'd love that, because the oil paint quality both casts characters as larger than life, and sets it apart from the Manga Studio style coloring we've come to expect lately out of anything fanmade.\n\nFor now, I can't recommend this game. We don't know if we're going to be charged piecemeal for the remainder of the story, and we don't know if we're going to get an editor to help later chapters be better than the current game. If you like superheroes or long-form stories, however, sneak this one in your watchlist; what it does well, it does very well, and if we get an editor that has as much passion as the rest of the team, the the only direction this series will be going is up, up, and away.","December 21, 2015","false","16.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's full of drama, mystery, intrigue, and romance. This is marketed as Issues 1–4 of a 12-issue miniseries, so perhaps there is yet quite a bit to come. I've played through the game several times, created wildly diverse protagonists, and have so far unlocked over 80% of the achievements, so I feel as though I've seen most of the possible choices you can make in the game.\n\nPros:Diverse gender and sexuality options, including non-binary gender and asexual orientation. This is so rare in games that I decided to play this game based on this fact alone. There are also numerous romance options, which can be a lot of fun.\nWell-written, complex characters. Other than a few minor characters, each character seems detailed, multifaceted, and mysterious. In true superhero fashion, it seems that everyone has a deep, dark secret, including the faculty of the college.\nStats. Unlike other interactive fiction, this incorporates RPG elements by giving my character statistics and allowing me to base my decisions on them, as well as influencing what sorts of decisions I can make and how successful they are likely to be. Decisions I make during the course of the story also modify my stats, which include my relationship scores with the various characters.\nCons:Railroading. This is my biggest complaint about the game. While there are lots of options, many of which influence various outcomes, sometimes it seems like none of the choices make any difference, particularly in the final act. I understand the need to advance the narrative towards a particular end, but the mark of a truly skillful author is to make it feel like my choices guided me there, even if the outcome was predestined.\nNot fully polished. I may be rather pedantic, but errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation tend to jump out at me. There weren't many, but in a game that is essentially 100% text, it becomes all the more important to catch them before releasing the game. Also, there were occasionally some logical inconsistencies in the text based on certain choices I had made. None of these inconsistencies made much of a difference to the plot, but they did pull me out of the immersion at times.\nClunky interface. Attempting to navigate the various menus was awkward at times and felt somewhat unintuitive. Of particular note is the inability to return directly to the stats screen from one of its sub-categories (Relationships, Academics, or Resources). In addition, while I can save my game once I complete it, the system for doing so is confusing, and I hope that in a sequel, I will have some way to access a list of the save files, because it is doubtful that I will remember the file names that I chose.\nFinal ThoughtsAs a piece of interactive fiction, this game is quite good. Despite my criticisms, my experience was positive overall, and I do recommend investing money in this product to support the developers. I'm very eager to see how the story plays out, and given the price of this game, there is little reason not to get it if you are a fan of the genre. In fact, there is a demo version which you should consider playing first, just to see if you will like it. Have fun!","December 8, 2015","true","22.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's ZERO answers there. Despite forming study groups and urging others to study, there's ZERO information. You're tasked with answering several questions -- like how much coverage heroes are offered on a policy or the limitations of that policy in coverage -- but there's no info presented in the game or in the "stats" screen. It's a guess-fest and that's unaccpetable garbage.\n\nUp until the first test, I was having a good read. After I got a D because I had no prior knowledge of the material (despite attending classes and not learning a single thing since I was apparently not given the option to learn it).\n\nI usually like Choice of Games stories but this one is frustrating  and, in the end, unenjoyable. Really could have used more playtesting and editing. Also... just because I'm an acrobat I can't wear anything revealing? Like, hmm... what acrobats generally wear?\n\nAlso, and probably most importantly, I've restarted and gone through several different paths again and again... only to find the ooutcome the same.

This story appears to be published under Hosted Games, where you can submit your story to Choice of Games, and they can publish it if they think it's good enough (Stories published under Choice of Games are commissioned by professional writers.) Hosted Games can be good. Zombie Exodus is excellent, go try it. But I recognise that these authors are not professional, so I can forgive lesser quality for more creativity.\n\nThis story, however, is a disappointment on both fronts. There's no other way to put it: the writing is terrible. You can on ly play 3 cliched archetypes. I can't even immerse myself into the archetypes because the dialogue is awkward. I want to choose a dialogue option that fits my character but the lines are so bad I cannot imagine anyone saying them. The story introduces a whole bunch of characters without much characterisation at once. There are some scenes that might be considered technically good, like the early terrorism scene and the park capture-the-flag scene, but they're not worth it.\n\nThe writer should not be charging money for this fanfiction-quality of writing, let alone charging more per-installment (this is only the first installment!) than the all-around excellent Zombie Exodus. Choice of Games shouldn't let this quality be published under their name. I bought this game without demo-ing the game because I trusted the company to do quality assurance, because they made great games like Choice of Robots, Choice of Romance, and Heroes Rise. I'm just... seriously disappointed.\n\nP.S. If you want a better superhero/villain game, try Heroes Rise or Diabolical. If you want powers in a school setting try Psy High. They are much, much better.","December 13, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

If you've ever played any other "Choice of..." games on a phone or online, then you already know what you're getting into.\n\nThe story is about a normal person getting accepted in a a community college for future superheroes.  It's sort of like One Punch Man but you're only power is being the main character (which I definitely don't mean as a negative; you're just a normal person.)  You experience what any other superhero college student would: romance, friendships, weirdos in strange suits, evil villains and those weird classes you had to take to graduate.\n\nNow, that may sound pretty boring or just plain odd but the way the story is written makes it very engaging and has you wonder what can happen next (and how you can not get killed by it.)  I'm anxiously waiting for the second part to come out so I can kick some super-villain butt with an electric baton and brass knuckles.  Doesn't that sound awesome?  You know it does.\n\nThe only real problem I have is not having save states until the end.  I really want to know what happens if I just stay quiet and anti-social the whole time or if my friend will still like me even after I give him a swift kick in the nuts.\n\nAnd why isn't Stoic a romance option man?!","December 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Go play it. It's what sold me on buying the game.\n\nI'd played a COG gamedemo before (Tin Star) and I skipped on buying it, as it didn't catch my interest. This game? This? I played the demo and when I reached the end I immediately bought it because I just had to know what would happen next. What happens next? It gets better, that's what happens next.\n\nThe NPCs are fun and believable (well, for superpowered people, anyways) - a few of them look stereotypical at first look, but most of those do reveal hidden depths if you befriend them and probe deeper. The story is great and hints of even bigger things to come. It gets slightly railroady at times (I still don't get why I have to be rude to Hi-Jinx, for instance), but that's unavoidable in a computer game, and there's no blatant plot-induced stupidity forced on you. And I probably chose the most boring path midway through the game. I'll have to replay it. Speaking of which...\n\nThis game has incredible replayability - with branching paths and mutually exclusive options, you'll have to play it about a (Diabolical) Dozen times to get all the information. There's half a dozen romanceable characters, too, if you're interested in that, of both genders, and they don't care what gender you are. And then there's trying to optimise the paths you've already chosen, which will likely lead to another couple of replays.\n\nFair warning, it's part 1 of, apparently 4? It's issues 1-4 of 12, so that's what I'm assuming. This means it'll take you some downtime and probably 4 times the stated price to get the whole story. The author has assured people that he's already hard at work on CCH2 and that he has no intention of pulling a Robert Jordan, a George Martin, or, heavens forbid, a Valve on us.\n\nFor those that care, you also get to suckerpunch people.\n\n9/10 - if in a future installment I get to turn Professor Sleazemarble into a rockery, then 12/10\n\nDude, seriously, demo - go play it, it's free.","December 7, 2015","true","21.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Really enjoyed it! But don't be fooled that just because its a text game doesn't mean it isn't fast paced and full of action. It's a real "page turner" and it can be hard to stop and take a break from it as you just NEED to know what happens next.\n\nIt's a well written story that immerses you in a world filled with characters that you can connect with. As it is a game written solely in text, it lets your imagination create the characters and in doing so you make it part of your own. You can make choices and choose your story and it's more than just playing a game and completing tasks etc. Like I said before, it's more like a table top RPG with only your imagination to visualize the world described in words. A great deal of skill is required to bring a world to life with graphics, but it is just as skillful to paint it in words while still leaving enough mystery for the reader to fill in the blanks with their own interpretation.","December 9, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, the game does not end on too heinous a cliffhanger, and I plan to buy the upcoming installments (and they better be coming)\n-It's kind of pricey for what they are offering. I got it on sale and thought that $3 was pretty steep for 4 chapters.\n\nThat all being said, I very muched liked these features about the game\n-Top tier waifus.

Despite the expositional infodump in the first few pages, Community College Hero: Trial by Fire manages to surpass the bloat and by the end of the chapter had me genuinely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the bad guy, wanting to save a flying paper airplane and a kid who looked like an 80 year-old Charlie Brown by his description.\n\nA decent addition to the genre but the supposed overhauls to the stat and class system in part 2 will be most welcome as the overlap and stat stacking does make some challenges trivial and others almost impossible.

Overall, it was a highly entertaining text-based game that was kinda satisfying for me. You, first off, sort of create your own hero by what your real name is, your hero name, what you wear for your uniform, what sort of personality you are. You are given as a powerless sort of super hero (BATMAN!) but you can go above that. This is a big stats game, as your choices affect your personality (Joker, Brooder, Traditionalist, Charmer), natural stats you have (like strength, stealth and stuff), your relationships with your fellow students and teachers, and what your grades are for the exams. Yes, you take exams. You're really in a superhero school where you have to study and such. On experience, I was quite popular (tried to stay on everyone's good side), didn't date anyone although I could have (wasn't really interested in dating those type of characters, but that's just me), and did really well in classes. There, of course, is another story that surrounds this adventure, which is the villian that's against the school. Some drawbacks I had were that some of the choices didn't really affect the story (you'd choose things but there was no outcome - wasn't too sure why it was asked), you're not completely finished because this is a series of games so you will have little closure (especially that after the event in the fourth chapter) and some of the charcters have little background, but it might be due to your choices. It's definitely not the best CYOA, but for the price of this game (especially if it was on sale), the game play I got just from one story, the immersion you have in it, it was worth it.","January 12","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, it was a highly entertaining text-based game that was kinda satisfying for me. You, first off, sort of create your own hero by what your real name is, your hero name, what you wear for your uniform, what sort of personality you are. You are given as a powerless sort of super hero (BATMAN!) but you can go above that. This is a big stats game, as your choices affect your personality (Joker, Brooder, Traditionalist, Charmer), natural stats you have (like strength, stealth and stuff), your relationships with your fellow students and teachers, and what your grades are for the exams. Yes, you take exams. You're really in a superhero school where you have to study and such. On experience, I was quite popular (tried to stay on everyone's good side), didn't date anyone although I could have (wasn't really interested in dating those type of characters, but that's just me), and did really well in classes. There, of course, is another story that surrounds this adventure, which is the villian that's against the school. Some drawbacks I had were that some of the choices didn't really affect the story (you'd choose things but there was no outcome - wasn't too sure why it was asked), you're not completely finished because this is a series of games so you will have little closure (especially that after the event in the fourth chapter) and some of the charcters have little background, but it might be due to your choices. It's definitely not the best CYOA, but for the price of this game (especially if it was on sale), the game play I got just from one story, the immersion you have in it, it was worth it.","January 12","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since this is just the first installment, I'm only going to compare it to HR: Prodigy.\n\nSo to start off, you'll be happy to know that this is not a complete rehash of HR: P.  CCH is its own thing entirely, and while there are similarities (tragic backstory involving parent(s) that was/were shunned by society, mystery involving villain with unknown origins and motives, power-play between different hero factions) I feel like those are general tropes that superhero stories have been using a lot recently.\n\nAs a whole I think HR: P has a better all-around story.  TbF is spending a more of its time getting you ready for the sequels and I feel like there was less resolved at the end than in HR: P.  If you only wanted to play one game and have no intention of playing the whole series, HR is probably the better choice.  TbF also had a LOT of characters, which made it harder to get to know them all.  You'll have to do several playthroughs if you want to understand all of them, whereas HR kept it more condensed which allowed more development for the characters it had.\n\nThat being said, I did thoroughly enjoy this game.  While it did feel crowded at times, I do still think that all the characters were developed well and had there own unique personalities.  The environment really did feel like a college, which helped CCH differentiate itself from other Choice of Games hero stories.  The plot was engaging, the mystery was fun, and it did a great job at getting me excited for the next installment.\n\nSo while I do prefer HR: P, I feel like CCH: TbF has done a fantastic job at making its own thing, and I can't wait for Eric Moser to publish the next several chapters.\n\nPlus it was a thousand times better than HeroProject: Redemption Season.  So there's that.","May 26","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I look forward to the next part, but I would like to see more realistic dialogue options in the future as well.\n\nOne last thing, I don't know if I can provide much constructive criticism, but I find the "issue art" to be a tad...strange. Perhaps it's just me, but I strongly dislike it (mainly because I already have an idea of what each character looks like in my head, but also just because I dislike the style it's done in). I'm fairly sure I'm alone with my issue with it, however, as I see nobody else mentioning it.\n\nOverall, worth a few dollars, but I'm surprised the author hasn't taken the time to update the typos or ask players to submit reports on where typos are so that they can be fixed. If the author went back and fixed the typos, I would have no qualms recommending it, but at the moment, I would hesitate.\n\nIf you have enjoyed movies like Sky High or series' like My Hero Academia, this adopts a similar idea, and it will likely be worth purchasing once all parts are released.\n\n\n\n(This is one of the many times I wished there was a neutral option for reviews. Take that how you will.)","May 31","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
