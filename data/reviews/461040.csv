This may seem few but, throughout all the games I played & watched, non successfully completed all the levels, from start to finish, as cooperation was abit one sided! :D\n\nIt's a brilliant game for a starter at parties & at local 'local multiplayer' events. Easy to pick up and play with gamers & non gamers alike!\n\n...As well as being one of the most cutest games around :3 <3","May 7","true","1.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
