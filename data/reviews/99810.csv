"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/recommended/99810/","bizargh","Bizargh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bizargh/","118 products in account","Before I give my praise for what I consider one of my favourite shooters of the seventh console generation period, I must alert you to these facts:\nIf you don't have an existing Xbox Live account, or perhaps at least an email with Microsoft's Outlook or old Hotmail, the Games for Windows Live service this game remains tied to is probably gonna cause you an exceptional amount of trouble (As it has for the many writers of the Do Not Recommend reviews). And from what I'm told, good luck playing this game if you do run into trouble. I have an Xbox Live (Gold) account, so either I passed with flying colours or I was lucky.\nThere is however an easy workaround I've successfully tested to disabling GFWL on launch, which whilst will not let you play Multiplayer at all while using it, will allow you to enjoy the Singleplayer modes without the need for GFWL.\n\nFirstly, head here to download the fix I located (Never have found the creator): http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Bulletstorm#Play_without_Games_for_Windows_-_LIVE\nThe contents of the .zip are "xlive.dll" & "xlive.ini", which will disable GFWL when copy-pasted into the game's files.\n\nSecondly, simply copy & paste the "xlive.dll" & "xlive.ini" here: Steam\SteamApps\common\Bulletstorm\Binaries\Win32. It doesn't overwrite anything, so no need for backups or changes to adjust to (Other than the previously mentioned inability to play Multiplayer whilst these files are in Bulletstorm's Game Data).\n\nAnd there you have it! You can enjoy the Singleplayer Campaign & Echo Missions without the need to use GFWL. I hope it helps you as much as it has me!\n\nAlthough the game's default FOV is 85, which is within my personal comfort zone, I encountered constant screen tearing due to the capped 22-62fps smoothed frame-rate (Even with VSync turned off), and Mouse Smoothing is enabled & I don't believe it can be disabled via the Options Menu.\nPC Gaming Wiki however has instructions & a recommended tool; "BulletStormINIEditior" to allow you to edit the game's encrypted Config' files to uncap the frame-rate & adjust your numerous FOV levels. With it, I can now play at FOV 90 with no issues at all, I've had not one instance of screen tearing since and have turned Mouse Smoothing off outright. Here's the wiki page for more details: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Bulletstorm\n\nIf you unfortunately cannot play the game, but adore the game's soundtrack, Epic Games has officially released it freely to download along with the Epic 20th Anniversary Original Soundtrack. And speaking personally, it's gloriously badarse!: http://epicgames.com/community/2013/12/essential-gaming-top-15-original-soundtracks-of-the-generation/\nRight, with that cleared up:\n\n\nGame Review\nIn Summary:\n\nYou have crash-landed on an abandoned Resort Planet infested with Mutants & Psychopaths. You have a wrist-mounted Energy Leash, a gloriously strong kick & an small assortment of weapons seemingly forged by Gods of Extremely Cruel & Highly Unusual Punishment, each vastly unique from each other (Which in addition to your standardly equipped Carbine, two can be carried in Singleplayer). The environments are littered with lethal hazards such as Exposed Wiring, High-Altitude Drops, Deadly Vegetation, and many more. I can never tell you this more literally; GET CREATIVE.\n\nJust don't expect to be able to find anyone in Co-op Multiplayer via Matchmaking. I haven't yet (Not big surprise). But on the bright side, it can be played alone without significant difficulty, and if you're lucky enough to have a friend to bring, it's quite the Horde-like fun (Only it's much less surviving and so much more score-earning, so be sure to Kill with Skill!)\n\n\nIn Detail:\n\nBulletstorm is unmistakably a console port, but all things considered, a pretty damn good one.\n\nWith your mouse & keyboard and fully rebindable keys (Which can be given secondary bindings also), you can Kill with Skill with beautiful control! And with the fixes I mentioned above, you can have a glorious shooter experience with this game almost akin to that of the classics who threw realism out the window for sheer mayhem!\n\nThe more modern mechanics like Rechargeable Health & ADS do often work in the game's favour, as the lack of concern of health is helpful in allowing you the utmost creative freedom in killing and extra zoom to land those headshots & hard-to-hit crotchshots. But although Sprint gives you exceptional speed (With Sliding even greater, especially on slippery-looking & sloped surfaces), it serves more as a quick exit mechanic than anything else, with enemies eagerly coming to you or standing still to suffer at your hand. And be warned about difficulties above Normal, as you can find yourself the odd occasions where you will find the need to cower behind a chest high wall to wash away the red cowardice from your screen. But otherwise, the game's main challenge relies on you being creative as possible & racking up your Skillpoints/Murdercash to resupply & upgrade newly found weapons, whose costs vary upon difficulty.\nIt's also worth noting that there's no shortage of Quick Time Events in the more cinematic moments of the game. However, People Can Fly differentiates them by rewarding Skillpoints based on your response time to their prompts, which if left unpressed sometimes proceed with a 0 Skillpoint reward depending on the event, or if do cause a reset-to-checkpoint failstate, don't require sharp-timing or anything beyond single-button prompts to avoid. So in my experience, their presence was not uncomplimentary at all.\n\nAs for story, well, while the humour most often relies upon the foul mouths & one-liners of it's characters which can certainly get more than a chuckle or two for those not above genital jokes & 80s action, it does also provide a violent revenge tale which has the capacity to be taken seriously if it proves your thing. Don't expect a lot, but it might just keep you going till the end.\n\nUnfortunately, the replay value isn't high at all. The linear design of the singleplayer often leads you to find the most Skillpoint-rewarding techniques, which can make repeat playthroughs seem like obeying an unwritten routine whilst not strict, is often practical. The Echo Missions (Singleplayer segments seperated for Competitive Leaderboards) are even more this as you find a means to find your best skill routine to earn your Stars and rank up the Score Leaderboard (Which could be your thing if you're looking for a challenge). As for Multiplayer; Think Horde with Bulletstorm's Kill with Skill, with an emphasis on racking up points instead of surviving ridiculous odds (But you might need to give downed team-mates literally a good & quick kick every-so-often as the waves progress). I haven't found anything via Matchmaking, and whilst it can be played on your own very adequately, the only appeal in doing so is ranking up to unlock new cosmetics such as Armour Camos & Gun Skins (Additional Leash Colours were bonuses for Special Editions or Pre-orders only if I recall correctly, although you have a choice of Blue & Quiksilver by default).\n\n\nVerdict\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic shooter experience which harkens back to the old days of shooters of gratuitous violence, extreme attitude & action-packed fun, whilst embracing a fair few of the modern mechanics, this is one of them! (Although Wolfenstein: The New Order might be a more substancial offering & successful blend of classic-with-modern in comparison, but 9GB & Unreal 3 reliable performance vs. 50GB & id Tech 5 technical quirks which some have encountered on occasions are a big difference).","November 24, 2014","true","10.2"," 573 of 622 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","573","622","9","36"

The dialogue is b-movie rogue hero stuff and progress is linear and direct, with no bother with an open world/roam anywhere playing field.\n\nSimple, yes, but the first surprise came with the highly polished gameplay. Controls are fluid and instantly familiar. Character movement is smooth and aiming is easy. Fun and combat variety come from the "leash," "thumper," kicking, and sliding mechanics. Leash an enemy and yank them toward you, and they float in slow motion for a few moments while you kick or shoot them to pieces. The skill-based kill system is fun, encouraging you to be creative. What they also got right is they don't make it impossible to do this by overrunning you with hoards of enemies. While combat is well paced, you still have time to try out those various kills. The more creative you are, the more points you earn. Some of the skills are comical too (kill a burner by shooting his butt), and the whole game has a carefree, lighthearted feel to it.\n\nThe soundtrack is appropriate ranging from heavy metal guitar riffs when you die to sweeping orchestral melodies that set the stage for the upcoming action. The voice acting is top-notch as well, as the actors must have been cracking up at some of the lines they had to say.\n\nDon't go into Bulletstorm hoping for a Mass Effect story or even a Call of Duty shooter, as you'll be disappointed. I went in with an open mind and got something that had been done before, yet fresh and exciting at the same time. Skillshots are extremely humorous and simultaneously gratifying, and a twisted, adult sense of humor kept me amused throughout. The game is crass, vulgar, graphically violent, and way over the top, but I smiled or laughed quite a bit and enjoyed it immensely.","December 20, 2013","true","6.2"," 313 of 369 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","313","369","0","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/99810/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","It should only take one look at Bulletstorm's literally insulting advertisements to know the sort of game it is. A blood soaked, over-the-top story of a space pirate's revenge, it's crass, gratuitously violent, filled with more ♥♥♥♥ jokes than you can shake a stick at, and most of all absurdly enjoyable!\n\nIf you can get past the constant poop jokes and references to male genitalia, there's actually a fairly entertaining story hidden under the brohaha. As ex-military turned pirate, Grayson Hunt, the game opens with a swig of the bottle and a suicide crash into your previous general's ship. Through some miracle you both survive, and thus it becomes a race to see who will kill the other first as you endeavor to get off the overrun planet you've been stranded on. It's undeniably shallow in many places, but for what its worth the characters are surprisingly enjoyable despite their rough exteriors; often melodramatic, but always full of the tongue in cheek, self deprecating humor that pervades every area of the game.\n\nBulletstorm seems to operate on a philosophy that each moment needs to be more outrageous and spectacular than the last. The set pieces come at a whirlwind pace, and a scope that truly left me scrambling to pick my jaw up off the floor, as it takes on the challenge of besting itself throughout the admittedly brief 5-6 hour campaign. The idea of inserting downtime or filler into a game is one developer People May Fly have entirely no idea about, as for as short a game Bulletstorm is, the density of the action is so great that it's almost exhausting to try and take it all in. Aside from the terrible cliffhanger of an ending (likely setting up a sequel we'll never see), I wasn't the least bit unsatisfied with what I got out of the experience, and in fact would compare it favorably to a shooter that spends twice as long showing me half as much.\n\nThe idea that drives all of Bulletstorm is killing with skill. Sure, you can take an enemy down with a simple headshot, but if you want to rack up the points you need to get a little more creative than that. The amount of carnage you can cause after you discard the ideas of every shooter you've played before is truly ridiculous, from kicking enemies into man eating plants, creating massive explosive chains, and stringing enemies together with a single bullet, to any number of possibilities I couldn't even begin to list. The combat rewards originality and style above all else, and the encounters are designed in such a way that you can unleash your homicidal imagination like few games ever allow. All of this is tracked and rewards you points depending on the originality and impressiveness of your kill, creating a constant strive to never repeat the same thing and try for new and more insane combos throughout.\n\nGears of War might have been Epic's showcase for Unreal Engine 3, but Bulletstorm really puts it to use with a barrage of color and incredible explosions. The level of violence is in a league of its own, but it's so outrageous that it almost seems comical watching heads explode and enemies flying into fan blades (or maybe I've just turned that much more psychotic). It's an impressive visual accomplishment that sets a new bar for what can be done with the engine, with a fantastic array of effects and vistas that still hold up years later.\n\nBulletstorm is easily one of the most original and satisfying shooters I've played in a long time. The level of personality and creativity in every area of its design is absolutely brilliant, and its self aware nature hilarious and even charming at times (or as charming as characters whose favorite past time is inserting "♥♥♥♥" before every word can be). The shooting is both rewarding and inventive, rejecting the tried and true "aim for the head" mentality of so many others for its own unique brand of bloodshed. If you've ever found yourself feeling the strain of repetition with first-person shooters, you owe it to yourself to give Bulletstorm a shot. It's one of the most inventive and rewarding to come out in a long time, and demands an audience far bigger than the one it received.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 209 of 251 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","209","251","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/recommended/99810/","misspauling","Cade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/","586 products in account","Crude, violent, and packed to the brim with outlandish insults, Bulletstorm is one more shooter with a gruff white male protagonist.\n\nIt's also a great game, however, and one I think is worth the time of anyone who likes shooters, creative ways to dispatch enemies, or some pretty good writing/plot/dicktits.\n\nLet's get this out of the way first: The dialogue in Bulletstorm is insane. The amount of creativity that's in the core gameplay extends to the trash talk the heroes and villains spout constantly ("I'll kill your ♥♥♥♥!" "Take a lick of the salty taint of DOOM, you braindead biker ♥♥♥♥♥s!") and if you're not in the mindset for it, you can come away feeling like it's just too silly. I enjoyed it though because it doesn't take itself seriously, and the characters are often bewildered by some of the things the others say.\n\nThe core plot of the game isn't necessarily unique, but it's interesting enough to keep you playing to see what happens. Unfortunately it does end on a cliffhanger and with no sequel in sight, this could be frustrating for you.\n\nThe gameplay is where Bulletstorm shines, though, and it doesn't take long to see why: the amount of options for creative baddie bashing is astounding. Slam a guy into spikes with your telekinesis-esque Leash, shoot a guy in the groin and then shoot his head off, or even use a shotgun to blast the torso off an enemy. These are just a few of the dozens of Skillshots in the game, all of which earn you points which you use to buy ammo and upgrades for your guns. The game nails progression, and it's never very long before you get either a new gun or a Charge upgrade to one of the guns you have, both of which unlock new Skillshots to keep killing fresh. There's also a few bosses, though they're largely forgettable or repetitive, and a couple turret sections that, while they aren't as fun as the normal game, don't show up often enough or stay long enough to feel annoying.\n\nOverall, I had a blast with Bulletstorm and I can wholeheartedly recommend it. It's got a few issues, and the lack of a sequel is disappointing, but this game is definitely worth your time and money.\n\n8/10","January 29, 2014","true","15.1"," 84 of 101 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","84","101","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/99810/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","I've come to a conclusion: Bulletstorm wasn't so much developed as it was raised on human growth hormones and taught the English language by a group of sailors and truck drivers. It was also shown every '80s action and sci-fi movie ever made about a dozen times, given a bottle of whiskey, handed a gun and instructed to shoot anything that moves.\n\nThe people who clearly felt that the first-person shooter genre was skimping on the "S" in "FPS" and taking itself too seriously birthed it; the sort who've made the likes of Painkiller and published Unreal Tournament and Gears of War. It's clear in everything from its distinctive style to its disregard for the plausible.\n\nYes, Bulletstorm is ridiculous, but in the way that the very best guilty pleasures are.\n\nThere's a story, and ... well, let's just say there won't be any novelizations around the adventures of its protagonist, Grayson Hunt. (They'd simply read, "He killed a lot of people. The end.") But it's there, and Hunt's revenge-fueled bloodlust is plenty of motivation for his wild ride through some truly fantastic, alien locations.\n\nA lot has been made of the language in the game, namely that it's pretty salty. It's true: Grayson and his rival, General Serrano, speak in an almost unending stream of near-poetic vulgarity. It could have come across as forced, but I think it fits, with Grayson's swears and quips helping to punctuate the violence and provide a little levity exactly when needed.\n\n\nWhile its characters may be one-dimensional, Bulletstorm's setting is far from it. The world – Stygia – is as deadly as it is gorgeous. From wreckage-filled mountains, through desert wastes, and finally to (and under) the ruined resort, Elysium, it's a surprisingly vibrant setting, especially after all the blood's been spilled.\n\nThat's the crux of the game really: the violence. Not the amount, but the inventiveness. This game succeeds in providing a great setting within which you can shoot, kick and energy leash bad guys to death in a huge numbers of ways. From a simple headshot to remotely guiding a (sometimes) human bomb into other enemies and beyond, the possibilities for being sadistic for points are awesome. The world is filled with deadly surprises with which to dispatch foes gruesomely (and stylishly), whether it's giant cacti or blast furnaces.\n\nIt's been a long time since I've grinned as widely while playing an FPS as I did with Bulletstorm. It's a vulgar, violent and supremely gung-ho experience obviously created by some slightly mad people who really love the genre. I suggest you turn up your sound system, forget about your military FPS training and settle in for some good old fashioned killin'.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","October 6, 2014","true","4.9"," 118 of 161 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","118","161","7","0"

There's no jump button, lots of cinematics, regenerating health and a weapon limit, but Bulletstorm is still one of the most entertaining shooting games of all time, limited only by your creativity in killing bad guys.\n\nStorywise it's a bit juvenile at times, but this is a cool story with insane set pieces that are still impressive to behold. The longevity you get from this game will depend on if you can continue finding different ways to kill your enemies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/99810/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Bulletstorm is providing just everything people expect from shooter games - especially if we're talking about expectations of people who saw and liked Duke Nukem, Serious Sam and Gears of War titles when they were released. Simply put, there is a big plate of fresh bloody meat at your disposal, along with atrocious bosses, and served with delighting amount or the breath-catching "special effects", to nurture your eyes.\n\nWhich is more, the gameplot is something like "Arnie and Sly, back at their late 30's, going into space, to kick some (plenty) assets". Shoot, kick, slice and splatter - prove you're a macho mano! And cut a spicy joke, sending another dumpback to the moon with your blaster, while drinking another shot of whatever burning! And all that - without any charges from your neighbors for unfit behavior. An excellent discharge after a day's work.\n\nNow, I'll step back a little, to provide more clear picture. Bulletstorm is a classy, modern-cut and hardcore-at-soul, nicely-cut and performed FPS game with you in the role of space cowboy (or marauder), crushed hard on the surface of the hostile planet, filled with blood-thirsty thugs and some big killing things you'll certainly don't want to mess with. All of that covered with quite a good story about broken lives, friendship, revenge and redemption.\n\nSo, what's not to like there? I can think of three things.\nFirst, if you don't want big amount of testosterone in your system - for various reasons, like your age, gender, religion, life experience... As for me, I'm myself not always combat-ready, and willing to go with killing sprees... But that mostly not because I can't handle adrenaline boosts, as for the second reason - I'm not too fond to splatter-mechanics, as I prefer to do things clean way, pink mists at most. Bulletstorm is not like that. You just have to use all special kills, as it conserves so much of the precious time and ammo... Third gameplay reason, which may turn someone down - Bulletstorm is still a corridor-narrow heavily-triggered FPS, even if colourful and alive - not everyone were born for FPS games, and not everyone like corridor-narrowed patterns. And that's ok.\n\nWell, you can say, that all my three reasons, is actually one, and that's not even a prime for this game to be only "Mostly Positively" recommended. And that's true. The main reason some people turning this brilliant of game design down - is not about game itself, but rather about notorious almost-dead GfWL DRM system. Yeah, the point is, with that system, you can't just rig yourself into the game, you'll need to create (if you haven't had one) an account on the web-site, which is registering visitors only when you're using Internet Explorer to access it...\nAll I can say there, is repeat after Arnie and so many other men like him: "No pain - no gain".\n\nGame is not perfect, sure. I'm not a fan of corridor shooters, I don't like helluva gore around me, and of course, I'm hating GfWL. But, all in all, Bulletstorm deserve 8.5/10 in my book.

It's now running in Origin.  Here's what I had to do:  I think I logged into my existing Windows LIve account and got it to do an update.  I had to use task manager to manually kill the game when prompted so it would finish the update.  I did this twice.  Now it seems to work in Origin and it logs into Windows Live automatically each time I start.  It's an UT3 engine game so my joystick screws it up.  I have to plug it in after the game starts otherwise my character just spins around in circles.  Happens for all UT3 engine games for me.  NOW THE GAMEPLAY:  Linear shooter but entertaining.  Graphics are typical UT3 engine and are quite nice.  No bugs and framerate is nice.  There is a story enough to keep you entertained and the levels are good but nothing stands out other than the visual.  Assault rifle seems underpowered but the other weapons are a nice balance.  Each situation makes you think about which weapon to use for the best effect.  BOTTOM LINE:  I would NOT buy this again based on extreme difficulty of installing it.  Stupendously difficult with no warnings of what is needed to get it to work.  If you can get it running, it's worth it if you want an OK entertaining shooter single player game.  I will not go online or rate the MP version of it.  So the single player is OK, but the extreme installation difficulty in my opinion makes this a game not to buy.  You have been warned.\n\nUPDATE!  right click, register game.  Log it into your origin account.  Where does it say to do this?  I'll keep you posted.  It looks like it is available under my origin software.  Nowhere did it say to do this when launching the game!  Nowhere! LOL!  It's reinstalling under origin over 7GB!\n\nOMFG!

In addition to a nice variety of weapons (each of them having secondary fire modes), you can push-kick enemies away or bring them close to you Scorpion-style ("get over here!") with an electric leash. You can also slide to knock your enemies down, and use the environment in your favor.\n\nThe fast-paced action is almost non-stop, and not tiresome at all, thanks to the dozens of ways to finish off enemies. The point-reward system encourages you to always be creative with your kills throughout the campaign in order to unlock upgrades and purchase ammunition for your weapons.\n\nSpeaking of the campaign, the plot is a nothing to write home about, and the levels are very linear. There are no meaningful choices to be made. But admittedly, this is not a game that takes itself too seriously. Its main focus is on good old mindless, uncompromised fun, and it delivers flawlessly on that front.\n\nGraphics are beautiful. I found myself taking screenshots of gorgeous vistas at every turn.\n\nThere's no competitive multiplayer mode, but the co-operative "horde" mode is very satisfying.\n\nWhat else can I say?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/recommended/99810/","abedsbrother","AbedsBrother","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abedsbrother/","525 products in account","Okay, let's get the Games for Windows Live (GFWL) thing out of the way. When I started the game, I was asked to login to GFWL (I already have a profile I have used for other games). I logged in, and GFWL downloaded an update that required me to restart the game. Restarted, and was able to login and play without issue.\n\nOn to the review:\nBulletstorm is a superb shooter, with some unique mechanics, SUPER colorful environments and great weapons. I would even say that it is worth the asking price, except the multiplayer is barely populated, making the single-player campaign the primary draw.\n\n+ The kick and slide mechanics are first rate, and easy to execute. You'll be sliding around in no time.\n+ The "leash" mechanic is also fun, though Red Faction Armageddon does the same thing better and with more variety\n+ The assortment of weapons is great, each requiring different methods to execute kills. My favorite was the homing sniper rifle; fire a shot, and you control the bullet with the mouse, guiding it around cover to kill enemies!\n+ The level design is good if linear. Don't be expecting alternate routes to go anywhere - there aren't any - but the path twists and turns enough so that directionality becomes confused.\n+ Though there are plenty of check-points, the game can be very hard if you want it to be.\n+ Plenty of variety in the enemies you fight, with lots of mini-bosses even on Normal difficulty.\n+ The graphics are COLORFUL. The opening levels happen aboard a ship, and feel confined, but once you get out into the countryside and city, the vibrant color will hit you in the face. Detail and design of the graphics is great too. Some of the enviroments reminded me of a sun-lit Bioshock.\n+ Bulletstorm is easy on system resources, making this game playable on a lot of machines. I never saw more than 500MB of video memory used; most of the time it hovered around 250-375MB\n+ People probably don't buy shooters for the voice-acting, but it is very good, especially the always-excellent Jennifer Hale.\n+ The single-player story embraces an entire genre of B-movie action stereotypes. Everyone fully commits, and the game succeeds well at it.\n\n- Few people in multiplayer. Get some friends together, and I'm told it will still work. But don't purchase Bulletstorm thinking you'll be able to join random online matches. I wasn't able to find any.\n- With the multiplayer a dead end, the single-player campaign needs to carry the game's appeal. And it is very appealing, but it is too short. My first play-through clocked in at 8.9 hours. Replayability appeal relies on upping the difficulty and "restricting" yourself to specific weapons.\n- No manual save system. The entire game is saved via checkpoints.\n- The final boss is a series of QuickTime events. Always knock a point off for that. There are several non-QTE bosses in the game; I guess this is just how the developers wanted the game to end.\n\nNot everyone has the GFWL issue; I suppose I was one of the lucky ones. Lucky indeed that I was able to play Bulletstorm. As a shooter, it carries my highest recommendation. But get it on sale just in case GFWL screws you over; then you won't have wasted much money.*\n\n*Early reports indicate that users on Windows 10 no longer have the GFWL issue. I'm on Windows 7 x64.","August 23, 2015","true","18.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

The gameplay isn't made of obvious fighting/idle segments (arenas, corridors).\n\nAnd when this formula starts to get boring, the game ends with a typical cliff hanger.

Bulletstorm is a wild ride of a game letting you kill your enemies in all sorts of wacky ways combined with a heart felt story of redemption. The game itself I feel plays a lot like Serious Sam with everything being way over the top characters, guns, kills, enemies... But isn't that exactly as we like it!!! Graphics have aged well as I found myself pausing multiple times to take screenshots of the beautiful scenery. The character designs look familiar to "Gears of War" but from a first person point of view. Understandable as it's made by the same developers. But I like the designs so this is all good! The amount of combos you can do between the energy leash, the environment, your kicks, and the multiple settings on each of your guns. If you're not having fun with this game you're just not trying hard enough because it is effortless. Just experiment with the tools that the game gives you and you're bound to have a blast!","January 5","true","10.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","0"

The advertising would like to have you believe its all fun and games. About points, about getting sweet kills and having a good time. Unfortunately, the story of the game is complete crap. Take a dose of "Dudebro" soldiers and add a dash of "serious story" and you get bullestorm. The story tries to be all self serious, and yet the main villain can only speak in curses. Dying friends, a revenge plot so hammy that you could easily prepare christmas dinner with it, and a completely unlikeable protagonist ruins every piece of the games "story".  Now I don't mind cursing, hell I enjoy cursing myself, but the main villains cursing took it to a whole new level, a level in which it is not actually cursing, but just empty words, that he constantly blabbers in an attempt to be "shocking" or "evil"\n\nAnd what was the lenght of the story? 5 hours. Literally the longest most boring 5 hours of my life.\n\nAlright so the story is horrible, absolute garbage. I mean literally some of the worst crap out there. It even cliff hangs, if you can believe it, like bulletstorm deserves a sequel. The shooting mechanics are OK. A lot of the weapons are pretty useless while others are on the border of overpowered. The mechanic in the game where you get skill points for creative kills is pretty OK aswell, but in the end its not worth it to slog through the story to get "epic" kills.\n\nFinal recommendation? Don't buy this game. Not on a sale, not because your bored, and especially not if you are looking for a good time.","June 28, 2014","false","5.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Like most modern FPS titles, you'll spend the entire game running along a linear route, repeatedly going from quick time event to fish-in-a-barrell shootout in a course of unimpressive gameplay. This assertion is exemplified pretty handily by the game's kicking gimmick, which is unweildy and has its potential crippled by level design that prohibits much fun from being had with it. That said, Bulletstorm does have some pretty crucial things going for it. The weapons are all really satisfying, and while the plot is nothing special, the story is at least filled with enough snappy and humorous dialogue to keep you going through the roughly seven-hour singleplayer campaign. This is fortunate, because multiplayer is, predictably, dead. While I don't recommend Bulletstorm, I qualify that by saying that I did enjoy its cinematic elements while lamenting the failures of its video game elements.","December 22, 2014","false","7.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","3"

Though still plagued by challenge ruining health regeneration, Bulletstorm rewards you for destroying your enemies by utilizing impressive weapon efficiency, leashing and kicking them into environmental hazards, or a little of both!  Doing this earns you efficiency points which buy you ammo and weapon upgrades, so if you play this game in the boring, tedious mindset of Call of Duty or Halo, you'll find yourself high and dry very quickly.  The action just keeps on coming, offering widely varied environments with a ton of different hazards and eye catching visuals, which also tends to demand a bit more out of your hardware in return.  The game may not be difficult at all and the story may be pretty generic and predictable, but that doesn't seem to be the game's focus, which becomes obvious when you hear endless, hilariously juvenile lines like, "I'll kill your ♥♥♥♥!"

Brutally fun to play. I love that there are many styles of killing. You can really mix things up and have your own playing style. I love that you are only able to re-arm yourself based on your kill style points, it really makes you more aware of how you are playing. Survival of the fittest :P\n\nThe characters are pretty straight-forward but I have to admit that for being a pretty foul-languaged person by nature, I still learned some new insults and swear-words. This pleased me greatly. I really love using my leash ability to yank infected bad guys into broken spkey walls and objects. There is something satisfying about kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of bad guys and watching them splatter into cactus'.\n\nThis is a classic must own videogame for any shooter fan. My only disappointment is that the follow up Bulletstorm 2 seems to have fallen to the wayside (which is a shame because this would make a great series to continue).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drakesvg/recommended/99810/","drakesvg","Hingle McCringleberry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drakesvg/","447 products in account","Bulletstorm is that over-the-top, crude, fun, adrenaline soaked game that only comes along once every few years.\nBulletstorm shuns away from many of the modern trends in FPS games. Rather than mimic many of the popular tactical FPS games that populate store shelves every year, it embraces the FPS genre’s roots. It shows more influences from games such as Duke Nukem (not forever) and Doom rather than Call of Duty. One example being the gameplay is fast paced and score-point focused.  The player is rewarded with score points for the more outrageous and over the top moves in dispatching the alien/enemy hordes. As player’s point’s increase, the player can unlock new abilities and moves that help keep the gameplay from growing too stale in its short running time.\nAnother example of old school gameplay is the cover system. It’s similar to the Serious Sam games, that being cover is optional and not a requirement for advancement. In many areas the player can go in guns blazing and survive. With fast paced fun retro style gameplay and average beat time of 8+hours for main story*, there’s sure to be some enjoyment had for most FPS gamers.  Although a few words of caution much like Duke & Doom, Bulletstorm is a game solely for mature audiences. It has a strong focus on violence and profanity that would make a sailor blush. If neither of these things bother you, which I can’t imagine they would if you’re reading this page. Then do yourself a favor and try it out. With its age, it is on sale frequently for sub $10 pricing.\n\nOverall Rating = 87\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\nDrakesvg\n\nBulletstorm = How Long to Beat\nhttp://www.howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=1383","December 2, 2013","true","10.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dyufufrau/recommended/99810/","dyufufrau","Best Dad In The Universe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dyufufrau/","249 products in account","Bulletstorm is a visual novel featuring semi-static manhwa-style character images, and focused on shooting text logs. Using the mouse and keyboard, the player interacts with the Planet Stygia's main computer to shoot log entries, communicate with the AIs, and occasionally enter commands directly into the vessel's computer system. At any time in the game, the player can save their game, adjust options, etc.\n\nThe main user interface allows the player to shoot through various diaries and letters that reveal the game's backstory and insight into its many (deceased) characters. For the most part, navigating this interface is similar to navigating a basic e-mail system, in that messages are chronologically arranged and searchable. They are grouped in usually numbered "blocks", released to the player by *Grayson or *Ishi throughout the game. For the most part, the AIs release blocks "out of order", or do not release all entries in a block, forcing the player to assemble the timeline of events out of what clues they have, and draw certain conclusions independently until (or if) the AIs can be convinced to be more forthcoming. In most cases, the player can, after shooting a log entry, show its content to the currently active AI. This is the primary process by which additional information and message blocks are revealed. Players can also type in an entry's alphanumeric ID in the main log menu to obtain it directly, as long as its corresponding block is decrypted.\n\nCommunication with *Grayson and *Ishi is limited to choosing responses to polar questions; in the game, *Grayson explains that the planet's disrepair may have led to the language parsing systems to malfunction, forcing her to put the interface together from scratch. Though *Grayson and *Ishi almost never communicate directly, the player can act as a go-between, taking a list of direct questions from *Ishi to *Grayson. This is a major turning point in the game, as the player not only receives answer the questions, but has occasional opportunities to voice a third opinion on the events that led to the Planet Stygia's current state. The player can also access the Planet Stygia's override terminal, which can be used to decrypt data log blocks, switch between AI, change costumes for *Grayson, adjust the behavior of some planet systems (a key aspect for the meltdown sequence), and more. The override terminal works like a basic text parser system similar to Unix shell commands, accepting only a very limited vocabulary of instructions that must be typed directly and correctly.\n\nDue to the branching nature of the story, the game must be played more than once to unlock all logs to complete the game, as it is impossible to reveal all log entries and information from the AIs in one playthrough. A log system separate from the game's save files displays all discovered logs from all playthroughs, effectively tracking the player's overall completion rate.","July 12, 2013","true","6.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The gun sounds are lacking some kind of kick.\nStory: This is not the type of game you play for the story. There is one, it's not interesting, but it keeps out of your way enough so you can slaughter enemies.\nGameplay: They feel dated, even with the somewhat unique mechanic of being able to kick enemies away or pull them towards you, which you can use to send them flying into giant cacti. Seriously, those green ♥♥♥♥ers are everywhere. It's fun at first, but it gets old quick. Sometimes it's not a cactus but some electric cables. Further, the game makes heavy use of scripted events. You can't even jump. You can run and slide, but that's it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/capt_blakhelm/recommended/99810/","capt_blakhelm","Capt_Blakhelm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/capt_blakhelm/","1574 products in account","Note: Bulletstorm makes for a very hard recommendation since it requires Games For Windows Live which will shutdown in July 2014 and likely make this game literally impossible to play. Also, there's no multiplayer community and the multiplayer gametype REQUIRES good team work, so unless you have some competent friends willing to participate in team skill kills, don't bother.\n\nOtherwise, It's a linear, story based shooter focused killing enemies in stylish fashion for points. The points are less a upgrade currency, and more a stockpile currency as you need points to restock ammo. It is however, built in the story as a sort of judgement system, but you can't fail for a low score and is nothing like the Capcom style of system that ranks you.\n\nGunplay is very solid, and many guns like the revolver, sniper rifle, flail gun and drill gun (I forget the actual names) are very satisfying to shoot. The carbine that you're stuck with is a little less satisfying and doesn't have that spot on accuracy like you'd expect from shooting a carbine in most modern style shooters (a bit like the G36C in COD4, but without the accuracy you would expect if you shot semi-auto). It can however be annoying to try to pull of specific skillshots as some enemies can resist your lash and sometimes you can't kick an enemy to the exact spot you want. Because of this, most players will not be able to experience all the skillshots without looking up videos.\n\nI'm not a great reviewer of story, so I can't say "The story is good/bad", though story will be the secondary reason for playing this game since it's a relatively short campaign with no multiplayer base. The story evokes similarities to Spec Ops: The Line, but it feels less about blaming the player and more about blaming the character you play. Ending is a bit disappointing as it hints at a sequel and playing it this late, I'm pretty sure there's no sequel planned.\n\nI enjoyed my short romp with it and if you can get it real cheap (No more than $10) and intend to play it to completion before GWFL is closed then only in that case is it worth it. If you have it already and have it finished, it is worth giving it a decent play, as I was able to finish it in two sittings.","March 3, 2014","false","10.9"," 38 of 74 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","38","74","0","6"

The game mechanics are simple: big gun, brutal boot and electric whip. From there, you are rewarded for the 100+ ways you frag the AI. The weapons and dialogue are simply over-the-top and strangely, this juxtaposition of Urbandictionary-insults and beautiful set-pieces is very refreshing.","January 21, 2013","true","38.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Bulletstorm is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun as hell.  It takes the ridiculousness of FPS games, dials it up to 11 and just goes crazy with it.

Then this might just be the game for you.\n\nFirst off this game is fantastic; from start to finish I had unending amounts of fun. You should buy this game and enjoy the ride. The action s explosive from the get go, you literally kick the crap out of everything you see. No metaphor here, you actually kick people into walls, spikes, fires, pretty much anything that would kill them dead. And that’s not mentioning the ability to fling them through the air using some future tech whip.\n\nAlso the guns, they are crazy fun to use. Ranging from a simple, if not cool, assault rifle to a harpoon gun that fires drill bits that fling people to their doom and everything in-between. My favourite was the sniper rifle that lets you guide the bullet right into the enemy’s faces before making them explode killing everyone stood next to them. Every weapon has a super charge attack that lets you rain destruction down on everyone stood in your way. For the gunplay alone this game is fantastic.\n\nNow the “skillshots”, the game literally rewards you for killing people in inventive ways. Want to blow someone in half with a shotgun, do you want the top or bottom half. Do you want to melt people with a super charged bullet; can you get two at once? I loved it and hunting down all of them takes a while and a great amount of skill sometimes.\n\nThe characters are rather bland but they do have some memorable lines and the banter between them is pretty funny. I liked how they played out and interacted with each other yet they didn’t steal the attention from the action which is the real star of this title. The storyline is standard, a quest for vengeance and hope. Of course it takes place on an alien world in a tourist resort ruined by some and alien world over run by ex-cons and mutants, so a little different there.\n\nAs for the world itself, it is outstanding, everything is beautiful and I found myself just staring at the backgrounds and wondering what happened to this place. Also the ability to see the location of previous levels in the distance was something I loved; you could see your progress across the city. The set pieces are awesome, all of them stand out and I am sure you will enjoy just exploring the world around you as you trudge knee deep through the blood and guts of your enemies.\n\nGo out and buy this right now, load it up and play it as soon as you can and you will not be disappointed. If you love action, awesome guns and one liners you will love this game.\n\nHave Fun ^_^\n","May 22, 2015","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Upon booting the game up for the first time you might be concerned by the fact that Jason Statham is not actually part of the cast. If you give the game a moment you will find that Jason Statham is engrained into the very mechanics of the game.\n\n“The GDD for Bulletstorm was just a picture of Jason Statham’s face”\n\nBulletstorm actually encourages you to act more like Jason Statham using the revolutionary “Skillshot System”. The Skillshot system rewards you points to upgrade weapons by killing enemies. The points you earn are based on whether or not Jason Statham would be impressed with how you killed the enemy. For instance, lighting an enemy on fire and letting them die a slow painful death might allot you a handful of points, but if you want more points you need to get creative, you need to think like Jason Statham. Jason Statham would light that guy on fire, wrap him in explosives, and impale him with a rocket powered drill that would send him flying through the air eventually picking up a childhood friend before exploding off in the horizon. The more Statham you are the more points you will get.\n\n“Bulletstorm will hit you like a hefty bag of codeine”\n\nYou should definitely get this game.","November 26, 2013","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The landscapes are rich with graphical enhancenicity that actually entice you to stop and take in the sights. Excellent play control. Movement can be a little buggy when abutted against elevations or when sliding near impervious objects, and a lack of a jump button is noticable from time to time. The story is generic with no unexpected coiling, but the character acting is done well.  An excess of swearing may cause some discomfort, even among those with potty lids for lips, but at the end of the day it's all in good fun.\n\nWindows Live ruins everything it touches.

Not obsessed with "realism" like most modern FPS games.  If you want realism turn off your PC and bugger off outside.  Reality has no place in games.

The plot's a little hammy but no more/less than you'd expect from your standard action flick.  Most importantly, it's fun to play!\n\nMy only gripe is that this game uses the Games for Windows Live DRM. GFWL is the absolute worst DRM out there. Ironically MS put out a DRM client that their own OS hates..

The interesting "Skillshot" system is a blast to play around with as you find increasingly absurd ways to dispose of your enemies, and the lush environments and excellent fast-paced combat make for a rather enjoyable experience. Co-op "Horde mode" multiplayer and Echoes mode (where you go through campaign levels for high scores and fast times) add replay value to a fairly short (~8 hour) campaign. This one's worth looking into if you want an FPS that doesn't take itself seriously (though the storyline suggests otherwise).","April 7, 2012","true","8.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Stranded on a hostile planet named Stygia, you and your fellow cyborg-mate Ishi Sato try to hunt down Grayson's arch-enemy Captain Serrano. So, prepare yourself for a fast-paced 7-10 hours of pure fps gameplay.\nPlay it on normal difficulty and you won't have a single problem except a few levels where you die almost instantly and have to replay 3-7 times.\nEnjoy the variety of different weapons alongside the mediocre graphics which sometimes create really beautiful images on your monitor.\nThen again, do not enjoy the hideous log-in procedure through the wonderful "Games for Windows Live"; the levels in the second half of the game, as they begin to become repetitive; and do not at all enjoy the incredibly dumb ending which makes you face-palm and wish for the sequel (very unlikely to be released) at the very same time.\n\n7/10\nOverall, it is a nice game to play whenever you want to shut your brain off, as it is non-stop shooting/explosions. BUT, don't worry, it isn't anything alike COD. It's got humour! And also quite a few moments when you see things really refreshing you'll ask yourself why you haven't seen them in another fps game.","May 2","true","9.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The one-liners the protagonist has are probably the best I have heard in recent years! In addition to this, while this is a good-old, action-packed shooter where you really need to shoot everything that moves, the game rewards you for being creative.\n\nEarning more points is recommended so that you can buy ammo and upgrade your weapons. However, if you just riddle someone with bullets you only get 10 points. Do that after a kick while they are in the air and that earns you 25. Finish this with a headshot which adds an extra 50. Environmental kills give you high scores and when multiple enemies are killed at once that's also very rewarding.\n\nAs you make progress the game unlocks a list of new methods of kills you can perform. I like how they expect you to be more and more creative along the way. In fact, the game's 4-player co-op mode is all about this - in Anarchy you get to shoot enemies who come at you wave after wave. The expectation here is to be more creative so that you can get a higher score. As the new waves are approaching the score level increases gradually.\n\nStory-wise Bulletstorm is a tale of vengeance. Grayson and his bounty hunter fellows are tricked by a powerful general. Gray thinks it's now payback time and does a suicide maneuver with his ship. Both his and the general's ship crashland on an alien planet. While you are looking for the general with your teammate (the only one who survived) you need to get past the local, cannibalistic tribes and the various monsters you encounter.\n\nSome of the vistas the game has look gorgeous. Well, a lot of games use Unreal Engine 3 nowadays but here you can clearly see the extra attention and detail that went into the making of each and every level. The designers really did their best. Cutscenes are frequent, the music is good and Gray's one-liners are awesome!\n\nNow that we are having the summer sale Bulletstorm is a catch! Hope you can grab it, too!","June 21, 2014","true","6.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

This is a fun gimmick at first but once you realize that the core gameplay is based around it you start to feel the grind. Most of the time using your guns is a bad choice as simply shooting someone will only get you a fraction of what throwing someone off a cliff or into the mouth of a man-eating plant would.\n\nThe graphics are fairly decent despite the older engine but the dialog sounds like they were written by a 12 year old and the rather extreme amount of curse words feels forced and overdone.\n\nDifficulty wise it really feels like a console game. Playing with a mouse makes even the toughest enemies a breeze.\n\n5$ of fun in a 60$ game.","November 4, 2012","false","135.3"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","3"

The dialogue and presentation are way over the top but everything is wonderfully polished, beautiful, and gleaming. Sound is incredible, music is swelling and motivating, and the entire experience is exaggerated and ridiculous. For all that it is, it really is a very good game.\n\nUnfortunately it suffers from some console-centric design. There are no autosaves - checkpoints only. Subtitles and interface are huge. FOV is way too low and the mouse controls while aiming down the sights are uncontrollably sensitive. This was obviously a game that was promptly forgotten after launch and it suffers for it.\n\nIt's a very amusing experience but the poor PC port really does make it unplayable in many frequent scenarios. If you're not squeamish about editing config files and you have a mouse with adjustable DPI or a sniper button then the experience is passably good. Such a shame - this game could be legendary with just a tiny bit more polish but due to this series of tiny oversights most people won't have the patience to massage this game into a salvagable state. If you're a tinkerer then you'll have a good time with this silly shooter.","July 4, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Like Most FPS games, the develoeprs did a poor job of ending the game.  It is basically throwing a lot of BS situations at you, one right after the other in the last parts of the game.  However, up to this point it is a lot of fun.  One other mention is that the game has a fairly mature sense of humor which I quite enjoyed.\n\nThe co-op mode is just a survival death match type of thing, you and a friend vs waves of bad guys.  It is a shame they didn't do a co-op mode for the single player game.  The single player game almost seemds made for a two people to play it together.  Ill keep my eye on this studio for thier next game.","April 1, 2012","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's terrible. Very few redeeming qualities in the face of all the bad ones.\n\nPre-release, people hyped it up as a carefree shooter that made fun of super-serious space marine games but on release players saw the game turn into the very thing it was making fun of. Stayed away from on release but as time went on people started giving it more favorable reviews, saying that the gunplay wasn't terrible, and the space lasso was pretty fun. I missed when it was last on sale for $5 so I grabbed it for $5 during this winter sale. Maybe haters aren't completely evil people after all.\n\nThe guns all sound powerful, but do terribly little for damage. It was obviously shoddily ported over to PC considering the ludicrous default keyboard bindings. The intense bloom did nothing but cover up the muddy textures that Epic's games are famous for. The enemies are simply bullet sponges most of the time and the allied AI does nothing but aggro the enemies for you. They also have a habit of getting stuck in scripted areas, making certain levels impossible to complete because the character needed for the next scripted event is somewhere a million miles back in the last area. Oh and bloody screen, so real.\n\nSome of the adrenaline-filled on-rails/hyperlinear segments are honestly fun, though. Kicking enemies into spikes and hazards for a load of points is cool, but then it quickly turns into WOW GOOD JOB YOU SHOT MAN HERE 10 PTS POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND REINFORCEMENT. The intro and first few levels do feel like an off-the-rails RIP AND TEAR shooter where you've got a hundred enemies coming at you and you've got lots of power to kill them all, but the action quickly dips to a halt as the player progresses through the story.\n\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't even recommend paying $5 for this game. I'm probably stating facts plenty of people know by now but man this game just left me so angry and disappointed and seeing people say that "it's not bad" grinds my gears.","December 23, 2013","false","3.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

It also involves much creativity, and gives the player many options on how to kill the enemy. Aswell as an arsenal of guns you also have a 'whip-like' leash enabling you to pull and throw enemies any way you see fit. Enemies will go into slow motion once you leash them and then you can decide on how to kill them. Kicking enemies into plants, bombs, the sea, off cliffs, and into objects MADE this game.\nThe sniper rifle was also much fun. You got to fire, and then steer the bullet to It's final destination. That's something I'd like to see in future games.\n\nI was hooked on this game from start to finish, and my only regret was not playing it sooner. The storyline is pretty epic, and it ends well for Bulletstorm 2. Let's hope it happens one day.","November 8, 2012","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you're looking for yet another Iraq War simulator (BF, MW, CoD clone), then look elsewhere. Bulletstorm features a unique combat system that breaks up the otherwise fast paced gameplay with shooting-gallery skill shots and environment kills (using abilities similar to Force Push and Pull, if you will). Otherwise if I had to compare Bulletstorm to existing games then I would say that it feels something like mix of the first Unreal single player campaign (original, fun weapons and beautiful, exotic environments) and Gears of War (limited cover system, regenerating health, testosterone-laden characters). While the narrative is oftentimes simple, it is thoroughly enjoyable with some great scripted sequences – including some of the best boss fights that I have played so far.\n\nMy only gripe about the combat system is the lack of a deeper combo system (akin to SSX tricks); as it stands you are only scored on the last attack type that you performed, even though chains of attacks are possible. Multiplayer is limited to 4 player co-op in a survival/arena match where you attempt to outscore each other (while surviving); which is interesting but falls flat after a while. It's a shame that there's no co-op campaign, as this game seems built for one. While the game is a port from a console version, Bulletstorm is about as good of a port as one can wish for on a PC - and that's coming from me, probably the staunchest opponent of console-to-PC ports you will meet. It's a shame that the sequel was cancelled - as this game definitely deserves one, if nothing else to tie up loose ends in the campaign story.","May 27, 2012","true","10.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

However, there are some dissapointments. The main one being Games for Windows live. Really, I started this game and immidiately it started begging me to use the platform I hate oh so much. It was a lot of hassle too; asking me to login, update, then login to update, followed by update to login. At one point I started hoping Microsoft employees would run around and I would be able to brutally murder them (as you will A LOT in Bulletstorm). Also, it gets kind of repetive. Yes, it's all about ♥♥♥-kicking, yes it's all about being an inter-stellar murder machine, but after 2 hours of obviously shouting that to my face I GET IT.\n\nBut really, if 8 hour of ♥♥♥-kicking, violent murder and manliness is your kind of thing: buy it. It's painkiller good, and it's awfully satisfying. It might not be long, it might not be complex, but if you're anything like me (a real man) you'll absolutely love it. Besides, 8 hours of 'in your face' agression therapy; who wouldn't want that!\n\np.s.

When I first heard of Bulletstorm, it was in that "Duty Calls" parody video on youtube created merely to promote this game. While it succeeded in making me laugh, it also grabbed my attention and I'm a better man for it. Bulletstorm revolves around a very simple yet elegant concept where you are rewarded with points for creative, ludicrous-like kills. What I mean by this is start running, gain enough speed and go into a slide shooting enemies all around you eventually coming to a halt with your boot up the final enemy's abdomen as he sours through the air. That's not all. Make sure stick a couple of grenades onto him and when there's enough distance, light him up like the fourth of july. Don't worry, it's easier to execute then it was phrasing this paragraph. Also, did I mention your sniper rifle can curve bullets? Yes, just like Wanted. There's also other outrageous weapons in the game but I won't spoil the surprise. The points you can can be used to upgrade the weapons and turn them even more extreme.\n\nNow we can get onto the other portions of the game which are less notable (as they should be). You're just another typical run of the mill bullet absorbing space marine badass hellbent on revenge. You succeed in crashing generic antagonist's spaceship onto a deserted planet and the story takes off from there. There's a lot of crude humor, giant monsters, sci-fi, decent character development and story. They graphics lean towards the prettier looking side of the spectrum and the score is enjoyable although forgettable. Gameplay is a mix between Gears of War and Painkiller - fairly linear levels but they are straighforward fun and the world was pretty immersive for me. There's no multiplayer but there is a CoOp mode where you and a friend can rank in kills together. Altogether you are looking at 1-2 playthroughs before potentially getting bored and moving on. It's the standard ~8 hour game. This game also runs on Games for Windows application so be warned.\n\nOverall, Bulletstorm was one of the more enjoyable games I've played in recent memory. I'm giving it an 8.5/10. This game comes highly recommended from me.","March 8, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Kill with Skill, why nobody had done this before? Although pretty blunt and really fun, this is the true successor of the late Duke Nukem. As weapons are quite different and as you choose from a selection at start-up, the game has a good replay value so you can start by choosing different weapons such as for instance the head trap of the Saw movie (and make it explode). Or take fireworks to see the guys fly and explode into beautiful sparks. Each impact on the enemy is managed as well so you can shoot any parts of the body and have a different reactions (and various bonuses). The game is not too repetitive either in terms of worlds and different enemies, and there's a background story to discover. In short, a game very cool game to let loose!","January 7, 2012","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sometimes just blowing crap up can be fun, and Bulletstorm proves that quite nicely. With jokes involving male organs that generally backfire, and sarcastic remarks across the board it's a game that just doesn't take itself too seriously and is absolutely great that way.\n\nLike most titles with Epic's involvement it is crude, rude, and just something to laugh at. The characters themselves are fairly unlikable across the board (to which they should be, these guys aren't role models), but still prove to be amusing one way or another.\n\nThe combo system and point system is the center of what tries to make Bulletstorm a replayable game. Run through, get a better score than your other runs. Not a bad concept, but without the active competition brought on by seeing other people there, there's not as much of a rush.","September 25, 2011","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The action never stopped there were so many ways to kill the enemy. The game rewards you for the unique ways of killing. The story was great, the level artwork look awesome and great adds alot of detail to the game. You can wipe out a group of bad guys with a push of a button. Each gun has 2 firing modes, one charges the gun up for a devastating impact and the other just shoots as normal. The downfall with this game was it was too short for my liking, I wish there was more to the story since multiplayer is dead unless you have friends to play with.The changing of weapons took some time to get used to since you can have the main weapons and one other weapon with you at all times. There is a great deal of humor in the dialog of the game which made it really funny at times. There is a challenge mode were you face a bunch of enemies at certain parts of the story and see how well you kill them to become ranked on the leaderboards.

The pacing was perfect all the way through, the dialog and voice acting were as good as you could wish for given the somewhat ludicrous story.  Now I say ludicrous story, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing for this game.  It doesn't take itself seriously enough to be bashed for having a B-movie plot, and the character development of all of the characters more than makes up for it in the entertainment factor.  The graphics are fantastic when everything is maxxed out, no hiccups or glitches.  The controls have a good connected feel to it, not as much of a console-controller-port feel like a lot of games have nowadays.  Menus are snappy, levels load fast.  I'd give it an A-; it would have more if it had more meat to the multiplayer, or a co-op campaign would have A+'d it right away.","February 28, 2011","true","17.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's terrible. Very few redeeming qualities in the face of all the bad ones.\n\nPre-release, people hyped it up as a carefree shooter that made fun of super-serious space marine games but on release players saw the game turn into the very thing it was making fun of. Stayed away from on release but as time went on people started giving it more favorable reviews, saying that the gunplay wasn't terrible, and the space lasso was pretty fun. I missed when it was last on sale for $5 so I grabbed it for $5 during this winter sale. Maybe haters aren't completely evil people after all.\n\nThe guns all sound powerful, but do terribly little for damage. It was obviously shoddily ported over to PC considering the ludicrous default keyboard bindings. The intense bloom did nothing but cover up the muddy textures that Epic's games are famous for. The enemies are simply bullet sponges most of the time and the allied AI does nothing but aggro the enemies for you. They also have a habit of getting stuck in scripted areas, making certain levels impossible to complete because the character needed for the next scripted event is somewhere a million miles back in the last area. Oh and bloody screen, so real.\n\nSome of the adrenaline-filled on-rails/hyperlinear segments are honestly fun, though. Kicking enemies into spikes and hazards for a load of points is cool, but then it quickly turns into WOW GOOD JOB YOU SHOT MAN HERE 10 PTS POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND REINFORCEMENT. The intro and first few levels do feel like an off-the-rails RIP AND TEAR shooter where you've got a hundred enemies coming at you and you've got lots of power to kill them all, but the action quickly dips to a halt as the player progresses through the story.\n\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't even recommend paying $5 for this game. I'm probably stating facts plenty of people know by now but man this game just left me so angry and disappointed and seeing people say that "it's not bad" grinds my gears.","December 23, 2013","false","3.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Soundtrack\n+ Good Voiceactors\n+ A 2011 Console Port with great graphics for this time.\n+ It's the first game of the Polish Game Developer People Can Fly and for that it's not bad.\n\nContra:\n- Weird Dialogues with childish cursing and flatt lines\n- Grinding (Skillshots Farming) to imense. Less Skillshots would have been better\n- The Volume of Soundeffects, Prerendered-Videos and Ingame-Videos are often that different that you get a shock if somethin explodes and that you can't really hear everything what a char says\n- In the End: It's a classic shooter. So you have to clean an area and then move on. It's a little boring if in one area new enemies are coming for a couple of minutes.\n- Weird ending (in fact weird story)\n\nFinal words: So is it a good game? I would say no. Even i changed the difficulty while i was played. I think the game was to long (normal playthroughtime 9-11h, mine 15h). The story is nonsens, the grinding and some parts are to long, but the action is over-the-top and makes fun.\n\nOnly if you really like shooter (like me) you can play it.

Enjoy.\n\nPro:\n+ Good Keyboard Controlls\n+ XBox360 Controller fully supported\n+ Fantastic (!!) Soundtrack\n+ Good Voiceactors\n+ A 2011 Console Port with great graphics for this time.\n+ It's the first game of the Polish Game Developer People Can Fly and for that it's not bad.\n\nContra:\n- Weird Dialogues with childish cursing and flatt lines\n- Grinding (Skillshots Farming) to imense. Less Skillshots would have been better\n- The Volume of Soundeffects, Prerendered-Videos and Ingame-Videos are often that different that you get a shock if somethin explodes and that you can't really hear everything what a char says\n- In the End: It's a classic shooter. So you have to clean an area and then move on. It's a little boring if in one area new enemies are coming for a couple of minutes.\n- Weird ending (in fact weird story)\n\nFinal words: So is it a good game? I would say no. Even i changed the difficulty while i was played. I think the game was to long (normal playthroughtime 9-11h, mine 15h). The story is nonsens, the grinding and some parts are to long, but the action is over-the-top and makes fun.\n\nOnly if you really like shooter (like me) you can play it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/99810/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","Good gawd man! So metacritic gave this game an 82/100. Christ! What has this world come to? I've never played such a brain dead FPS with a who gives a fart worst than C-grade Hollywood storyline. I would personally give this game something below 50/100.\n\nI swear! I have never had to break up playing a game in portions before! It's taken me 11 hours to complete this game. But playing for 3 hours feels like an eternity! I must have played this game in approximately 1/4 portions. Taking a few months break inbetween.\n\nI don't want to be picky on the Unreal Engine for a gazzilionth time, but this game is the epitome of all your standard Unreal Engine crap. I haven't really played Duke Nukem Forever yet nor BioShock 2, but I have this feeling I won't even be able to tell the difference between these games and Bulletstorm.\n\nOne of the highlights about this game is the kicking right? I mean that's cool yeah? Well sorry to disappoint, but it's nowhere near as fun as kicking down doors or enemies in the classic game Return To Castle Wolfenstein. They got the "feel" of it wrong!\n\nThere are 7 Act's in the game. Each with a few chapters. Act 0 was sort of okay. But Act 1 till about 5 and a half was just an atrocious nightmare. Non stop corny jokes and attitude. I feel like a 6th grader wrote the personalities for the characters.\n\nThere are these things called "skillpoints". It's supposed to be a feature highlight of the game. This is a very bad idea. It's just a "tracking system". Without trying and so long as you constantly use multiple weapons, you'll achieve over 90 of about 130 of these skillpoints anyways. I didn't even give a fiddley fart about them.\n\nTo explain this game properly, imagine a 5 min combat scenario. You kick someone into spikes. You slide kick. You use your stupid electric whip. You use the secondary function of the 3 (out of about 6) weapons you're allowed to carry at a time. You use the environment to kick explosive barrels into enemies. THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO! Now ... multiply that 5 min combat round, a few hundred times until you've REPEATED IT FOR 11 FRIGGEN HOURS !!! YEEAA !!!\n\nGames For Windows Live is gone. Which doesn't make this game any better. This game is really broken without GFWL !!! But when it was around, I did have the opportunity to play the coop. It's basically like what I described in that 5 min combat thing above.\n\nThe only thing I can say that's been good with this game, is the nice environments. It's just a shame that you're just running forward that there's no time to really admire the level design. I'd even go as far as saying the level designers are victims somewhat.\n\nIf you like non-stop shooting action games like the single player of Call Of Duty 2 onwards and possibly the first F.E.A.R game. Then you may like this game. Otherwise stay away from this EA polished garbage. I've seen smaller game development teams that have created better than this commercial piece of crap! I mean seriously! It took hundreds of people to create Bulletstorm? LOL !!!","November 20, 2013","false","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","11"

The dialogue and presentation are way over the top but everything is wonderfully polished, beautiful, and gleaming. Sound is incredible, music is swelling and motivating, and the entire experience is exaggerated and ridiculous. For all that it is, it really is a very good game.\n\nUnfortunately it suffers from some console-centric design. There are no autosaves - checkpoints only. Subtitles and interface are huge. FOV is way too low and the mouse controls while aiming down the sights are uncontrollably sensitive. This was obviously a game that was promptly forgotten after launch and it suffers for it.\n\nIt's a very amusing experience but the poor PC port really does make it unplayable in many frequent scenarios. If you're not squeamish about editing config files and you have a mouse with adjustable DPI or a sniper button then the experience is passably good. Such a shame - this game could be legendary with just a tiny bit more polish but due to this series of tiny oversights most people won't have the patience to massage this game into a salvagable state. If you're a tinkerer then you'll have a good time with this silly shooter.","July 4, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am very glad I finally bought it. Sure it's an incredibly "bro" game, but whereas Epic's other series, Gears of War squeezes every last drop of "bro" from its steroid-pumped characters, and without the least amount of self-awareness, Bulletstorm is more like truckers in space, crossed with Firefly, laced with Unreal and garnished with an arcade 'trick' game. Its dialogue is entirely tongue in cheek and earns a few laughs. Game-play is rock solid, except for a few issues introduced by navigating uneven and cluttered landscapes.\n\nSuch problems are rare, and the game is all about creative and exhilarating combat. Yank an enemy towards you and then kick him in the air. Use that time to shoot his head off, or just let him be impaled on a nearby cactus or electrocuted on exposed power cables. Lasso an explosive barrel and kick it at charging enemies, or lasso your explosive enemy and fling him instead. It's a fantastic lot of fun. Just last night I lassoed an enemy towards me, kicked him into a carnivorous plant's mouth, but before he was swallowed, I fired an explosive bolo around his waist which I detonated soon after, earning many points!","January 18, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game has a fair amount of unique, upgradeable weapons as well. From pistols and shotguns, to explosive flail launchers and harpoon guns.\n\nIt's a fun, but short game.

It's like the video game version of a Jason Statham movie. It's loud, dumb fun with lots of over the top action. There's lots of swearing too. 'Son of a ♥♥♥♥!' The campaign is very linear, but that's ok because there are plenty of fun scripted events. I played all but a tiny portion of the beginning all the way through in one sitting. It took around 7 hours to beat the campaign. There's also a time trial mode where you can play sections of the game over again, trying to rack up points in as short a time as possible. It looks a like Gears of War, but it's an FPS where the main mechanic of the game is killing enemies in different, unique ways. It reminds me of Mad World in that regard. The graphics are fantastic. A good way to tell how much better PCs are than consoles now (and always, amirite!) is by comparing the pre-rendered cut scenes with the real-time ones done by the game engine. It's not even close. I strongly recommend Bulletstorm. It was a blast to play from start to finish!","December 16, 2012","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am very glad I finally bought it. Sure it's an incredibly "bro" game, but whereas Epic's other series, Gears of War squeezes every last drop of "bro" from its steroid-pumped characters, and without the least amount of self-awareness, Bulletstorm is more like truckers in space, crossed with Firefly, laced with Unreal and garnished with an arcade 'trick' game. Its dialogue is entirely tongue in cheek and earns a few laughs. Game-play is rock solid, except for a few issues introduced by navigating uneven and cluttered landscapes.\n\nSuch problems are rare, and the game is all about creative and exhilarating combat. Yank an enemy towards you and then kick him in the air. Use that time to shoot his head off, or just let him be impaled on a nearby cactus or electrocuted on exposed power cables. Lasso an explosive barrel and kick it at charging enemies, or lasso your explosive enemy and fling him instead. It's a fantastic lot of fun. Just last night I lassoed an enemy towards me, kicked him into a carnivorous plant's mouth, but before he was swallowed, I fired an explosive bolo around his waist which I detonated soon after, earning many points!","January 18, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The beginning was weak and the end was weak but the heart of the game shined.  Unfortunately, it was just a gimmick that grew tiring after  a while.  When i think of skill shots i think of the railgun from Quake 2 or 3 and pulling of a massive kill while jumping through the air and turning, only to leave someones giblets flying through the air......not pressing E to kick someone into a venus fly trap hybrid.\n\nI do understand the game isnt suppose to be taken seriously, and the humor is funny but juvenile, but i just cant recommend this game because after 1 playthrough, i couldnt make it through a 2nd.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/recommended/99810/","8799644","Vegetarian Atheist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/","507 products in account","Forget the laws of physics.\n\nok, initially I was reserved about this game, but tall my doubts have been dispelled.\n\nBefore I start, I'd like to say "yes", it is possible to disable those annoying points popping up whenever you kill someone in an ingenious ways. Perhaps, there are a few who care about that, but I was constantly afraid that those points would mar the gameplay for me and ruin the immersion - which is sorta what happened with Borderlands. There is no way to disable the crosshair though.\n\nAnyways, you play as vigilante turned space pirate. Well, it's a bit more complicated than that but they explain the reasons in the first 15 minutes of the game. Your character kinda looks like a raptor only with hair but at the same time he has a voice and personality, which is always welcome in shooters.\nStill, you have no body and cast no shadow so still you are, for the most part, just a couple of arms floating around. Maybe I should spend the next 5 years of my life studying programing and video game designing so I could get a job with some gaming company and be in charge of creating legs and shadow for the character you play in a shooter. You do get to see your legs when you slide though; So annoying...\n\nThe game is using Unreal Engine 3 which is considered outdated by many, even though it does the dynamic lightening thing, it's seems a bit too stale, the fire looks really outdated, the textures look like they are stacked on top of each other, plus I'd say that the physics need a little work. They used the same engine for Gears of War 2 as well the Singularity game, which wasn't for my liking to say the least. Even the electric leash you use in the game is sorta reminiscent of the hacking tool in Bionic Commando as well as the device you were wearing in Singularity. What's annoying though is that even if you disable auto-aim and aim assist, the leash would still auto-aim for you and pull your screen in the direction of the object being pulled. Both Singularity and Bulletstorm implement the slow mo sniper bullet time wherein you can actually guide your bullet towards the enemy.\n\nAlso, what I found unsettling is that you can use your leash infinitely. You can actually beat a large chunk of the game (minus the bosses) by using your leash and kicking enemies until they are dead.\n\nYou can also dash and slide for a long time. Like, REALLY long time. You don't get to slide on the floor as far as you can in Vanquish, however you are still able to slide for an unnaturally long time on rough surfaces and shoot at enemies, somehow. You actually move faster in the game by sliding all the time instead of running, which makes little sense. But that makes it harder for enemies to hit you and for you too hit them since you are sliding too fast; and there is no stamina bar. Hell, you can even slide uphill if that fits your fancy.\n\nThe kick. Well, yeah, the kicking ability really does augment the gameplay. But I wouldn't want people to consider this kicking ability to be something special and innovative, since I would like that credit to go to The Dark Messiah game which I am pretty sure was the first one to implement the kicking ability which always came in handy in kicking enemies off the cliffs and even in melee fights.\n\n\nIn the trailer you can see the enemy growling in agonizing pain after you shot him in his groin equipment. However, on hard mode, after growling for a few seconds, your enemy will recover, deal with the loss of the important male body part and then keep on shooting at you.\n\nBlood. Yes, there is plenty of blood leaking and bursting out of your enemies. And there's plenty of gore and decapitations in general. You will get to see some loose limbs lying around. It did get under my skin to see those giant plants eating the savages though.\n\nCursing, yes, there's plenty of that too.\n\nThere are no free weapons in the game. You earn new weapons by getting skill shots. You also get to upgrade them so there is incentive to kill enemies in different ways - just as advertised.\n\nThe enemies look nice. They look a bit too buff and too clean though for a wasted planet.\n\nOne major flaw of the game is that if you outrun your enemies, that is if you outslide them and choose to slide past towards your objective and venture too far then you will die. Supposedly, you get shot in the back which is what one of the loading screen tells you. So I guess that is how they fixed the problem of rushing in this game, well maybe they should made the game slightly more challenging and took away the infinite sliding ability.\n\n\nThe sidekick in the game is also quite interesting and intriguing. While the character you play is a hairy and smelly loud mouthed ego-maniacal raptor, your juxtaposed sidekick is quite different. His cold calculated decisions and logical unbiased thinking reminded me of Spock, I think that was a nice touch. It is fun seeing the two battle out the the classic fate vs. coincidence moments.\n\nI'm not going to say that the general gameplay of this game is flawless and that everyone will like it, but the pacing of the game is good and it will let you kill some time. The game reminded me of Borderlands on some occasions. You get see the giant skeletons of prehistorical creatures, just like in Borderlands.The AI is okay. The enemies rush, shoot, take cover, melee.\n\nOn the general positive note, the game has plenty of funny moments that are guaranteed to put a smirk on your face. Even when you can think of every possible classy quote, chances are, it's already been used and has become a cliche somewhat. However, this game does squeeze out quite a many memorable quotes that you probably didn't hear before. Some things are pretty innovative, especially the amusement park and some escape levels.There is never a dull moment and there are some memorable battle and escape sets and despite the strict linear gameplay, I still had fun feeling like an unstoppable killing machine in the world that makes little sense.\n\nRegardless, I felt the need to pick the game to pieces and poke fun at its inconsistencies and complete disregard for the laws of physics, but I nevertheless had a good time playing it, and I still do. It's highly probably you will beat the game twice.\n\nP.S.\nThe last two words in the game made my day.","November 27, 2013","true","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Once you finish the campaign, there is also a Multiplayer option where players can compete against one and other, but I haven't played Multiplayer yet, so I cannot review it.\n\nThe way the game works is by killing multiple enemies and earning "Skill Points". These skill points can then be spent on weapons, ammo and upgrades for your different weapons. To earn these points you can kill enemies in different ways by looking at the challenges and completing them to earn the points reward. The movement is fluid and fast-paced, however there is not much liberty in this field. For example, there is not a button for jumping and when you wish to jump down from things, that function is also not there either. The shooting is accurate, fast-paced and fun which means that you can shoot with ease. Also, the aiming down the sights on some weapons is very well detailed and every shot you fire, whilst shooting down your sights, is guaranteed to hit an enemy.\n\nI was running this game with these specs:\nAMD FX-4300 Processor at 3.8GHz\n8GB RAM\nAMD R7 250 2GB OC Graphics Card\n\nThe frame rate was always very stable and I had no issue at all with any frame rate loss.  Any modern computer from mid-2012 to the present day should run this game with no issues, but make sure that you check the minimum system requirement to see whether your computer can run Bulletstorm. The graphics are very nice at High (the highest setting, there is no Ultra setting) and like I said before, hardly any frame rate drops.\n\nWhen running this game for the first time, I had to sign into Games for Windows Live and sometimes when trying to run the game through Steam it would not open. By downloading the current version of Games for Windows Live I managed to get the game working, after that you must sign into a Microsoft account (I used the one that I use for my Xbox Live). Steam will pop up telling you the CD Key, when Games for Windows Live asks for it just put the code that Steam provides you with.\n\nI think this game deserves a 8/10 because it has a brilliant storyline and graphics but in my opinion, Games for Windows Live and the lack of liberty of movement lets the game down a little. However, if you like a game that is fast-paced, fun and has an amazing campaign, then this is the game for you!\n","October 19, 2014","true","7.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The gameplay is awesome very inovative with the whip. The weapons are very original as weel with a pistol with a flare as a secondary fire, and quad barrel shotgun.the mp is just survival but it needs deathmatch and such.

The formula is simple: big guns, lots of enemies, lots of gore, lots of fun ways to toy with your opponents like orcas juggling the half-dead bodies of cute seals. It uses Unreal 3, which is to say it looks like every other game written with Unreal 3: cheap, console-y and graphically dated by about ten years (pixel shaders anyone?) but, like all Unreal 3 games, it will run maxed out at 1080p on anything moderately more powerful than an e-reader, so the framerate is never an issue. There's also only really one boss fight, about half way through, which is a wasted opportunity. But these issues aside, it's mostly carnage and a bit of a laugh, so thumbs up then?\nWell, not exactly. The programmers, as usual, have done their best to scupper the game. The first half an hour is all cut-scenes and quick-time events - totally unplayable. While later cut-scenes are shorter and can be skipped, it frequently does the thing where it makes you walk really slowly to listen to the exposition: bad voice acting, terrible dialogue and a plot I'd really rather wasn't there. When you're not walking with tiny steps it lets you run, really fast, down long, long empty corridors. Shouldn't there be enemies in here? Things to do? Sometimes you run for so long, you carry on running even when you let go of the keys, and this usually happens during time limits - another pointless addition - when having enough control to open a door is somewhat essential. Still, at least the checkpoints are close together. So, still a 6 or 7 out of 10 then?\nAlas not. This game has a villain much worse than any man-eating plant: Microsoft, or more specifically, Games For Windows Live, which is essential for the game to run, even on Steam. Remember when you used to be able to tick the hidden box and create an offline profile? That's gone. It's online only, requires the GFWL client, two software updates, a keycode activation and a sllllloooooooowwwwww login each time. Truly diabolical. All us PC folks are reconciled to Steam now: its lows and its highs, but there is no excuse for this to be bodged on top, and Bulletstorm is impossible to recommend while this unnecessary gimmick is still active. 2/10","October 24, 2014","false","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That doesn't matter at all - you are not buying this for a dramatic story telling experience. What you are in for is an extremely well made shooter that manages to keep itsself fresh while relying on the same mechanics throughout the game.\n\nYou can:\n- Kick a man into a cactus.\n- Manually guide sniper rifle bullets.\n- Shoot a man in half.\n- Kick hotdog stands at people.\n- Tear a pilot from a gunship, then shoot him out of the sky in slow motion.\n- Slide towards an enemy at great speed and proceed to send him flying as a result.\n- Control a huge mining wheel, broken loose and rolling freely.\n- Pick up a minigun and seemingly dissolve enemies.\n- Shoot a fat man in his ♥♥♥♥.\n- Controll a robotic dinosaur.\nThis barely scratches the surface of the things you can do.\n\nThe game revolves around a mechanic called skillshots - most of the kills you make count towards points you collect - the more extravagant the kill, the more points you earn, and these points go towarsd buying ammo and upgrades for your weapons. Though you can only carry three weapons at a time, the world gives you plenty of oppurtunity to customise your loadout.\n\nThe other prime mechanic the game works on doesn't go by name, but is more the staple way of killing people - pulling enemies from afar with a wrist mounted leash, kicking them away, and shooting them in mid air. Most skillshots rely on kicking and/or leashing enemies, and while it sounds repetitive, they keep it fresh throughout the game, by changing enemy types, the environment and your weapons.\n\nIn terms of graphics, all of the NPCs are well modelled and animated, along with yourself. The environments, while set in the same planet, are kept fresh and interesting throughout the game, and the level design allows for every playstyle, and caters for every weapon. The graphics, whilst not top notch or very realistic, go along with the style of the game very well, and honestly, you only get a few chances to gawp at the beautiful landscapes before you get back to shooting people in the face.\n\nWhilst there are no negative points, nothing in this game is done to perfection either, but non of that gets in the way at all - you are far too busy having fun, kicking people into cactuses!\n\nBuy this. It redeems your faith in EA a little bit.","December 29, 2013","true","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You dont buy it for the campaign story. You buy it for the echoes challenges and the wave based survivor mode, have fun performing all the awesome skillshots trying to figure out the best way to combo them together, and get the highest score possible.\n\nI would really love to see a spiritual successor for this game. The skillshot game mechanic is great fun, has a lot of room for improvements and tweaks to make it easier to combo multiple skillshots together for maximum kill enjoyment.\n\nPersonally I think the game should have been designed from the ground up as a coop, wave based, survivor shooter. The horde mode thats in the game is great. Player(s) have to meet a minimum score requirement before they can move on to the next wave. That concept just works great with the skillshot system. I really think it could be expanded to have a lot more depth. ♥♥♥♥ aint ever gonna happen though.\n\nGreat game with an awesome concept. Sadly it may never be revisited. I doubt the original devs of the game would have improved upon it very much anyway.

Talking about killing ♥♥♥♥♥ while fighting on top of an exploding dam, or while riding a helicopter around and shooting Godzilla, or walking down the side of a building on magnetic boots, as a set of small examples. It's a very short experience, and definitely very much a corridor shooter. It would be a fairly boring FPS if not for the inclusion of skillshots. The game gives you points for killing enemies in many varied ways, like kicking people into spikes, or bouncing a cannonball around a room multiple times before hitting someone with it. It incentivizes this by making the points into currency, with which you buy weapons and ammo. I would recommend if you want Steve Blum's least insufferable game or just a nice cinematic experience.","January 12, 2013","true","7.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

For real though this game is amazing, I honestly forgot how fun it could be. It's like old school meets new school but instead of blending both in for a serious realistic adventure they turned it into a parody of other shooters which is just "epic."\n\nThere's plenty of good things say about this game first off the graphics settings are decent not the best but it does the job. Keyboard and mouse works great and is fully rebindable and a controller also works straight out of the box with no problems. There's heaps of hud options to turn off and on like the skill points etc. The gameplay is the best thing about this game it's unique and quite hard to explain but it's just so mindlessly fun! The game has 10 weapons while it is a small number the weapons feel unique and they don't end up bothering you at all. There's a decent story tucked away in the game itself it does it's job it's not the best but neither is it terrible... it's a good laugh at times though. The graphics and art are just beautiful, the landscapes are so shocking everything is damn unique in this game you won't go by things and say this is generic. There's plenty of enemy types as well and you won't get to a point and say ♥♥♥♥ please mix it up... for the most part you'll be playing the story but there is also a coop horde mode which mind you no one plays.\n\nThere's not much bad stuff to say about this game but still there are a few to be said like why does the game feel the need to have multiple actions on one key it works well with a controller but it sometimes gets in the way on the keyboard e.g sprint/jump is bound to the same action. The ai while challenging can sometimes feel so cheap they will never... I MEAN NEVER go for your ai teammates they will always run at you or shoot at you, it can get frustrating. The sprinting it feels good but it makes me feel so damn sick but I suppose that falls under personal preference. The game also doesn't have a fov slider which bugged me quite a bit. There was a huge opportunity missed for a coop story since the ai teammates are damn near stupid to do anything.\n\nI think the game is great it reminds me how much fun a new IP can be... it's a shame we'll never see a sequel but right now as the price stands for $4.99 USD it's totally worth it especially if you're looking for a new and unique experience.","December 23, 2015","true","12.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

People Can Fly managed to combine everything that defines a great old-style shooter - ludicrous gibs, state-of-art murder weapons with numerous uses and tons of ways to destroy your great numbered enemies. while at the same time getting it right with the modern at the time of release tendencies - cinematographic action and good linear plot.\n\nEnergy Leash, Trusty Boot (Duke Nukem style) and Skillshot system are awesome. Game is very rewarding when it comes to the most creative and violent ways that you use to kill the enemies. Shoot him in the balls and kick his head off - done. Put an alien type parasite on his head and electrocute the ♥♥♥♥♥er - done. Put all the enemies high in the air with the help of energy leash and explode them with the chain grenades that you've wrapped one of them in - DONE!\n\nBeing extremely fun in terms of gameplay, game developers chose the same way in the script writing. And it pays off 100%. The B-movie like plot of space revenge, giant robodinosaurs and redemption does not give you any chance to stop playing. It keeps you going just to listen to another word exchange  full of black below-the-belt humor between the characters. The main ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ General Sarrano with his black humor bullying and drill-sergeant-like manner of speaking remains one of my favourite B-grade villains in the gaming. It's not that easy to get such a high rank in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ness.\n\nSoundtrack is made in the same style as Painkiller OST - during the fight you'll mostly hear (aside from the explosions and dismememberment sounds) an adrenaline pumping rock track.\n\nI do recommened this glorious carnage and gibs fest to everyone. Especially to those, who, like me, love the games like Painkiller, Serious Sam, Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem. Bulletstorm is more linear and story-driven that mentioned games (less freedom of movement, more of freedom in killing to be precise), but just as fun.\n\nPeople Can Fly, you did it 100% right! I'll be waiting for a sequel.\n\n10/10 (Yes, seriously)","January 5","true","9.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

However, I have since located an unofficial patch to remove it from the game, allowing me to finally play it.)\n\nBulletstorm is a game that lives up to its name. You're a space pirate who crashes on a planet full of psychotic warriors, and you only have one chance to catch a ride out of there before the whole place blows up. Along the way, you will obliterate hundreds of people, fight toxic mutants, and dispense more hot lead than a medium-sized mineral refinery.\n\nIt's your standard OTT FPS affair, but with one difference: you get points for how crazy and brutal your kills are. The bloodier and chunkier your combat is, the more points you get. And since upgrades, weapons and ammo are unlocked with points, you're essentially incentivised to be as insanely badass as possible. There are traps and hazards everywhere, and a smart player can use them to wipe out entire squads of enemies in seconds.\n\nI developed my own technique called the 'Emasculator': shoot an enemy in both kneecaps, run up and kick him in the face, hit him with a rifle burst as he flies through the air, yank him back towards you, shoot him in the chest with a shotgun, and then step aside as he falls, screaming, off a cliff.\n\nOverall, a good game with fun execution and a gimmick that leads to some really kickass gameplay.\nFinal score: 7.5/10.","February 9","true","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Games for Windows Live is dying in the near future, meaning this game could become unplayable.

Don't get it for the story either, the devs get it out of the way as quickly as possible for the maximum amount of shooting. Story isn't bad, there's just not alot to it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serious_Zombie/recommended/99810/","Serious_Zombie","Serious Pony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serious_Zombie/","327 products in account","One of the most fun shooters I've ever played. People Can Fly managed to combine everything that defines a great old-style shooter - ludicrous gibs, state-of-art murder weapons with numerous uses and tons of ways to destroy your great numbered enemies. while at the same time getting it right with the modern at the time of release tendencies - cinematographic action and good linear plot.\n\nEnergy Leash, Trusty Boot (Duke Nukem style) and Skillshot system are awesome. Game is very rewarding when it comes to the most creative and violent ways that you use to kill the enemies. Shoot him in the balls and kick his head off - done. Put an alien type parasite on his head and electrocute the ♥♥♥♥♥er - done. Put all the enemies high in the air with the help of energy leash and explode them with the chain grenades that you've wrapped one of them in - DONE!\n\nBeing extremely fun in terms of gameplay, game developers chose the same way in the script writing. And it pays off 100%. The B-movie like plot of space revenge, giant robodinosaurs and redemption does not give you any chance to stop playing. It keeps you going just to listen to another word exchange  full of black below-the-belt humor between the characters. The main ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ General Sarrano with his black humor bullying and drill-sergeant-like manner of speaking remains one of my favourite B-grade villains in the gaming. It's not that easy to get such a high rank in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ness.\n\nSoundtrack is made in the same style as Painkiller OST - during the fight you'll mostly hear (aside from the explosions and dismememberment sounds) an adrenaline pumping rock track.\n\nI do recommened this glorious carnage and gibs fest to everyone. Especially to those, who, like me, love the games like Painkiller, Serious Sam, Shadow Warrior and Duke Nukem. Bulletstorm is more linear and story-driven that mentioned games (less freedom of movement, more of freedom in killing to be precise), but just as fun.\n\nPeople Can Fly, you did it 100% right! I'll be waiting for a sequel.\n\n10/10 (Yes, seriously)","January 5","true","9.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

However, I have since located an unofficial patch to remove it from the game, allowing me to finally play it.)\n\nBulletstorm is a game that lives up to its name. You're a space pirate who crashes on a planet full of psychotic warriors, and you only have one chance to catch a ride out of there before the whole place blows up. Along the way, you will obliterate hundreds of people, fight toxic mutants, and dispense more hot lead than a medium-sized mineral refinery.\n\nIt's your standard OTT FPS affair, but with one difference: you get points for how crazy and brutal your kills are. The bloodier and chunkier your combat is, the more points you get. And since upgrades, weapons and ammo are unlocked with points, you're essentially incentivised to be as insanely badass as possible. There are traps and hazards everywhere, and a smart player can use them to wipe out entire squads of enemies in seconds.\n\nI developed my own technique called the 'Emasculator': shoot an enemy in both kneecaps, run up and kick him in the face, hit him with a rifle burst as he flies through the air, yank him back towards you, shoot him in the chest with a shotgun, and then step aside as he falls, screaming, off a cliff.\n\nOverall, a good game with fun execution and a gimmick that leads to some really kickass gameplay.\nFinal score: 7.5/10.","February 9","true","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story of Bulletstorm isn't much to write home about, just about a soldier named Grayson Hunt seeking revenge on his employer. Graphics are quite beautiful on maximum settings with great lighting and textures.\nFor the gameplay, it's like any other FPS game except that you have a whip that you can use to pull enemies closer to you and a button to kick opponents, that sends them flying to the air in slow motion for a stylish kill. The more stylish the kill, the more points you earn to upgrade weapons, buy ammo and unlock additional things.\nSound is superb, capturing the "omph" of weapons really well and the voice acting is top-notch (with the main character and supporting characters voiced convincingly).\n\nIn conclusion, I'd give this game a 7.5/10.","February 19, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ever.  Not the hardest or with the most depth (though the game DOES have a suprising level of depth, under all the crass humor) but simply the most flat out FUN.\n\nI mainly just came here to say that, In November of 2014, on Windows 8.1, yes, Bulletstorm DOES work.  Everyone talks about GFWL being dead, yet you can still download the GFWL client from xbox.com, still install it, still login, and it still works just perfectly fine with Steam RIGHT NOW.  The only difference is that now it's called "Games for Windows Marketplace" but it's nothing more than rebranded GFWL and it works exactly the same with Bulletstorm.\n\nSo it IS up, IS working, and IS an awesome game.  Anyone who says otherwise simply doesn't understand how to install GFWL - which is amazing because it's startlingly simple.","November 1, 2014","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can often use your environment and most importantly, you don't just have your guns (which look awesome, by the way), but also kicking (important) and your leash (very important). By combining those four elements you can basically compose your own attacks, for instance pulling an enemy towards you with the leash, then kicking him back, maybe shoot a little, use the leash again and finally kick him into a cactus.\n\nBut this game not only has some nice fighting techniques, it also features an - ok, it's not that innovative - convincing story that suits the overall outlook of the characters. Although you only control the main protagonist, you also have a team fighting on your side and their AI isn't that bad at all. In fact, if you for instance don't open a door in a set amount of time, they'll do it themselves while mumbling something like "why the hell is this taking so long?". Granted, this AI also isn't revolutional, but it's nicely done and fits perfectly into the whole game. Especially after some events occur that have an impact on your fellow soldiers (I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil anything).\n\nSo to sum it up, the mechanics of the game work just as you would expect them to do and all the different elements give you a well-balanced mix of attacks to work with. But not only that, even after all those years, this game still looks stunning! Actually me and my friends play it on the big screen and while only one of us is playing it, the others just can sit back and enjoy the beautiful view this game is offering!\n\n\nSo my conclusion would be: If you haven't played this game yet and just slightly like playing FPS where you don't have to focus on tactics or stealth, but rather on style, you should definitely give it a try!","November 1, 2014","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played through the campaign a few times over the course of a few years because it's easy to get into and start messing s**t up! The graphics are good, the gameplay is responsive and fun, you get points for everything you do but the more creative/varied you are when killing enemies the better you are rewarded. There are multiple difficulties to keep your attention and it's challenging enough to stay fun consistently. The NPC commentary while you're playing is funny and entertaining. There are numerous quick-time events throughout the game but they don't detract from the fun too often. I think the cutscenes and especially the player animations are well done. I recommend anyone interested in the FPS genre give this a look.","November 11, 2014","true","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The mechanics and scoring system is awesome and the kills are over the top, in a good way; I mean, there are so many ways to kill people, either from shock pulling them, stomping, kicking, punching, shotting, all sorts of things. And the XP system in this game works in comparison to other titles that try to utilize XP without any RPG elements.\n\nToo bad the sequel was shelved. Only downsides are the cutscenes which have an ungodly low resolution/render output. I don't know why they didn't just use the in-game engine, it's certainly more than capable of outputting at higher resolutions.\n\n8.710","September 6, 2013","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's absolutely breathtaking. There were a lot of moments where i took a few minutes to admire the scenery, it was just that lush. I's go as far to say this is some of the most gorgeous art i've seen in a game, and i feel it was completely wasted on Bulletstorm. I would have loved to see an open world FPS RPG on this planet because i really wanted to explore.\n\nNow it's not a bad game at all, 6/10 is slightly above average and it gets that because of the unique gunplay it offers. The "skill-kill" system is a refreshing take on the genre and quite enjoyable. The problem Bulletstorm has is that isn't doesn't go any deeper than that. It's a very shallow game that wears thinner as you encounter the same "challenges" over and over again. I say "challenges" loosley because that's another problem, there is no challenge (on normal difficulty). There's also no incentive to try and pull off fancy kills because you easily get skill points (the games currency) through the non-complex kills. The upgrade system is practically non-existant and un-interesting, so you end up spending your easily earned skill points on buying ammo after you purchase the few upgrades there are. The game is also a very linear shooting gallery, with no moving away from the beaten track. This isn't always a bad thing if it's done well, and i have to say Bulletstorm does it well.\n\nSo it's not all bad, even though it's linear and scripted there are a number of cinematic and adrenaline pumping events that do keep you interested and encourage you to press on through the gameplay you've kinda gotten bored of. The combat is great in itself, especially the sniper rifle. Every shot allows you to control the bulllet as it flies through the air, it's damn cool. I even liked the characters and the story, despite the crude and easy humour i found it hard to dislike them and their cause. I never tried muplitplayer but i've heard it's practically non-existant, so don't expect any bang for your buck there.\n\nI would definitely recommend giving it a play, but for a very low price because it's not a game that leaves much of a lasting impression.","June 26, 2014","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It takes the Gears of War trope and relishes in its gorey conclusion.\n\nThe nastier enemies die, the more points you get to spend on weapons, ammo, and even more brutal ways to kill your foes.\n\nWith excellent controls, a not-too-terrible story, and a distinct lack of humility, this is a game that I may find myself replaying at a later date to relive the glory.\n\nIt's glorious, cheesy, over-the-top and an all-around funfest.

Even though the campaign is not super long (just under 7 hours for me on the normal difficulty setting), the number of collectibles and the huge library of skillshots make replaying it a very welcome prospect.

The visuals are beautiful and the weapons pack a real punch. The story is pretty forgettable and the ending is somewhat disappointing, but everything else is a blast. Essentially everything that Duke Nukem Forever should have been.","July 12, 2012","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Bulletstorm also prominently features a complex scoring system that MUST be mastered to stay alive. It makes each fight fresh and exhilarating, much more than just a raw, physical challenge. Although it was slandered because of this (also in part to its flavorful language), I can't recommend the game highly enough to every genuine lover of the genre.","April 30, 2013","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The enemies were fun, and easy to kill, and the combat was EXTREMELY enjoyable. Creative ways to kill people made this a unique and exciting shooter.\n\nThe story is present, the objectives clear, though most of the feeling is in-the-moment killing enemies and listening to the alcoholic main character come up with childish quips.\n\nThis game was not afraid to make fun of itself, and is one of the few games in which the main character is a complete meat-head-drunk idiot, which results in a lot fun. One-liners abound, and the dialogue is dominated by each character trying to come up with the most unique use of profanity. Profanity which is so overwhelming you can't help but to laugh at the stupidty.\n\nThis game is two things, stupid, and fun. It knows that, and it doesn't stray from it. Don't expect a deep and moving story, but rather an action-past giggle-fest with poop jokes, guns, swearing, booze, and explosions.","January 20, 2012","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gameplay wise, it's an FPS that plays a bit like a cover-shooter. However, while most cover-shooters can get a bit boring in the way they force you to spend most of your game crouching behind objects while your shields recharge, Bulletstorm keeps things interesting with its skillshot system which rewards you experience points to spend on upgrades by killing enemies in the most inventive and over the top ways imaginable.\n\nLikewise, the game also has more wit and charm than its "Big dumb dudes with guns" first impression might imply. If this were an action film it would be much more "Bruce Campbell/Sam Raimi" than "Nic Cage/Michael Bay." While some portions of the game are basically "on rails" the action set pieces are so inventive and the level design so well done that you're usually having too much fun to notice. In short: this is what Duke Nukem 4 should have been.\n","April 9, 2012","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just get into it like a new favorite movie.  Only takes about 6 hours to beat, but I kept wanting to play it after I beat it. The action is great and the guns feel great to shoot.  It has extra modes and mutiplayer coop arena mode but those feel tact'd on.  The real gold is the single player;  its a total blast.  Don't take it serious, It is not "deep" and you'll never get 30+ hours from it.  Unless you intend to play it again every 6 months; as I intend to play again in a few months.  If you do not like straight forward, linear pathway FPS action, then avoid this game.  For those that want one of the most fun, simple, and rewarding single player action game out at the moment (4/10/2011), I totally recomend it.

Combat is just a blast, almost non stop and very fast paced. The combat actually reminds me a lot of some of the Unreal Tournament games.

This game's unique scoring system is intertwined with game play that is quirky and unconventional; it may look like Gears of War, but it couldn't play its cards any more differently from it.\n\nOn the kaleidoscopic alien planet-turned-tropical tourist trap-turned-mutant mosh pit where Bulletstorm takes place, you don't cower behind walls and obsessive-compulsively look down your sights every five seconds; you slide into combat on your backside, kick a baddie head over heels, fire two grenades attached by a chain around his neck (from your two-grenades-attached-by-a-chain gun), electro-whip his friend next to him and push the detonate button for maximum skill points.\n\nThe skill points, and the systems built around it, are what make this game so compelling. The combat never gets dull, and never repeats, because the game consistently encourages you to do new things and hands you the tools and environmental dangers to accomplish them. If you're at all jaded by the monotony of modern big-budget shooters, I implore you to give this a try.\n\nThe dialogue's pretty funny, too.","November 22, 2013","true","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The action here is unparalleled. You kill enemies by pulling them towards you with a leash or kicking them away from you with your boot. Both ways trigger a short bullet time where you pump their bodies full of lead. Depending on how much style you have in your rampage, you get points for the different combinations. Points are used to upgarde your weapons and buying ammo. Again a great action packed game if you're into the genre.\n\nThe negative:\nIt is clearly ported from the consoles and therefore have some features the PC users don't agree with. An example is the jumping. Instead of jumping over obstacles, you just approach them and ,when prompted, press Space to climb over it.","November 27, 2011","true","17.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The guns and upgrade system are top notch, the voice acting is acceptable but far from amazing. The graphics are actually quite nice and the artwork fits the games theme very well. Combat is just a blast, almost non stop and very fast paced. The combat actually reminds me a lot of some of the Unreal Tournament games.

It's linear, but the set-pieces are well-done, the shooting's smooth and the points-for-skill-shots mechanic is well-balanced and pretty fun. The art direction is fantastic - they've created a very colorful sci-fi world. The cussing and humor is pretty sophomoric, but it's so winkingly over-the-top I stopped minding...and some of it's surprisingly funny.

I got it more as a curiosity, so I was surprised when I discovered it's one of the most solid, pure shooters to have come out recently. It's linear, but the set-pieces are well-done, the shooting's smooth and the points-for-skill-shots mechanic is well-balanced and pretty fun. The art direction is fantastic - they've created a very colorful sci-fi world. The cussing and humor is pretty sophomoric, but it's so winkingly over-the-top I stopped minding...and some of it's surprisingly funny. I think they may've patched some of the more offensive skill shot titles out, which was probably wise.","December 4, 2011","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The Energy Leash is an excellent feature too, it really takes your kills up to the next level.\n\nOn top of the fantastic boss battles, you'll find yourself against mini-bosses and a good range of normal enemies too (who will use a nice spread of weapons against you). Speaking of weapons, there are enough to cater to whatever particular bloodlust you're looking to sate, you'll quickly decide on your favourites and be amazed as you unlock something even more destructive.\n\nAside from the campaign, there are missions called "Echoes" which I am yet to try. There's no real multiplayer mode (just horde mode) but there is co-op. You can buy the 2 DLC packs from Games for Windows - LIVE in game (I believe the main feature of these is extra "Echoes"), though you do have to use Microsoft Points, to my knowledge there is no way to just pay for them outright.\n\nWhich brings me onto what is, in my opinion, the only downside to this game; the fact that it uses Games for Windows - LIVE. GFWL is fine after you get it working, you won't even know it's there (aside from the achievements popping on there, that's why there aren't any on Steam), but it's getting it working that is the issue. The first time I loaded up this game, my internet was not working properly and I had to play in offline mode - I got 4 hours in and left it at that so I could recover from the heart attack I was getting from the excitement. The next day when I wanted to continue, I discovered that it hadn't saved my game. You must be online for it to save, so it really is an always online game. Luckily the game itself is absolutely brilliant, or I wouldn't have bothered going back through those 4 hours of gameplay to actually finish the campaign.\n\nI could go on, but I want to get back to it.\nIn all, it's funny, smart, and absolutley revolutionary for FPS games.\nBuy it!\n\nAnd if any of you shitpiles disagree with anything I have said here, I will kill your ♥♥♥♥♥.","January 2, 2014","true","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Visuals are very nice, you will see some cool cenery throughout the game.\n2. The combat is really fun, expecially once you get the leash weapon which doesnt take long. When you get it, you are able to use parts of the environment to kill enemies. The weapons are fun to use to, I never get bored with any of them.\n3. The Story is pretty simple, however engaging. It's one of revenge but not so cliche as most are.\n4. You gain points to use for weapon upgrades and buying ammo. You gain points by killing enemies, but there are quite a variety of ways you can do so. The amount of points you get for each kill is bassed on "skill shots", wich are mini goals during combat. Some are quite challenging to get.\n5. The AI of your comrads can be a bit goofy at times. The only thing i'v seen wrong is that sometimes your teammate will stand behind a wall and shoot where the enemies are but just hitting the wall.

The game is just so much fun. The combat is fast-paced and exiting and the skillshot system makes you always find new and awesome ways to dispatch your enemies. In addition to the combat I also enjoyed the games dialogue. It was just waay too over the top and crazy, perhaps something you might find from an '80s action flick. I absolutely loved it.\nOne bad thing is however that the game uses Games for Windows Live which is a huge pain. Activating the game can be annoying in the beginning and you need a constant Internet connection to play.\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games and likes to have fun while playing.","June 23, 2014","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Visuals are very nice, you will see some cool cenery throughout the game.\n2. The combat is really fun, expecially once you get the leash weapon which doesnt take long. When you get it, you are able to use parts of the environment to kill enemies. The weapons are fun to use to, I never get bored with any of them.\n3. The Story is pretty simple, however engaging. It's one of revenge but not so cliche as most are.\n4. You gain points to use for weapon upgrades and buying ammo. You gain points by killing enemies, but there are quite a variety of ways you can do so. The amount of points you get for each kill is bassed on "skill shots", wich are mini goals during combat. Some are quite challenging to get.\n5. The AI of your comrads can be a bit goofy at times. The only thing i'v seen wrong is that sometimes your teammate will stand behind a wall and shoot where the enemies are but just hitting the wall. Thats the only thing i'v seen thats messed up.\n\nThis game is really fun.

The mechanics and scoring system is awesome and the kills are over the top, in a good way; I mean, there are so many ways to kill people, either from shock pulling them, stomping, kicking, punching, shotting, all sorts of things. And the XP system in this game works in comparison to other titles that try to utilize XP without any RPG elements.\n\nToo bad the sequel was shelved. Only downsides are the cutscenes which have an ungodly low resolution/render output. I don't know why they didn't just use the in-game engine, it's certainly more than capable of outputting at higher resolutions.\n\n8.710","September 6, 2013","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story of Bulletstorm isn't much to write home about, just about a soldier named Grayson Hunt seeking revenge on his employer. Graphics are quite beautiful on maximum settings with great lighting and textures.\nFor the gameplay, it's like any other FPS game except that you have a whip that you can use to pull enemies closer to you and a button to kick opponents, that sends them flying to the air in slow motion for a stylish kill. The more stylish the kill, the more points you earn to upgrade weapons, buy ammo and unlock additional things.\nSound is superb, capturing the "omph" of weapons really well and the voice acting is top-notch (with the main character and supporting characters voiced convincingly).\n\nIn conclusion, I'd give this game a 7.5/10.","February 19, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
