What I got was a really boring platformer. It has nothing to really seperate it from any other platformer except maybe the light? I didn't really notice a story in the first four levels (Level one, the extra level one, level two and the extra level two) and the platforming was incredibly boring, so I quit.\n\nAlo after each level I played except for the extra level two, the game went in to a white screen that I could not get out of without opening the task manager. It didn't do it the last level but damn was it annoying.\n\nI wouldn't bother with this game, regardless of how cheap it is. However, I'm sure this game will appeal to plenty of others and I won't fault them for that, I just personally don't think this game is worthwhile.","December 9, 2015","false","0.3"," 35 of 46 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","35","46","3","3"

They take a while to die. This gets really annoying when in later levels they are coming from multiple directions at the same time. It's not fun when you're toggling back and forth between the two ghosts.\n\n2) Collect all letters to unlock a bonus level. Sounds like a good relaxation after your work? Nopes. Those bonus levels are exceptionally tough. When a game's tough above a threshold it doesn't feel fun anymore. It becomes a chore instead.\n\n3) Die-restart mechanism + The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ jumps = Let's say you keep jumping around different platforms and keep making progress in the level. You jump at some locations. Die, then figure out how to deal with it then try again. But the catch is that you need to start all over from the beginning again and go all the distance again. And all enemies are alive again. It's like groundhog day. There are no checkpoints in this game. Die-restart-die-restart-die-restart. It quickly gets annoying.\n\nAnd a warning about the jumps. A lot of parts are just instincts - jumping the exact distance. No more no less. If you pressed shift (run key) throughout the jump then you overshoot and die. If you released it a little earlier you'll still fall on the edge and can fall down. If you released it at less than half the distance you'll fall before the ledge and die. The time to release it is too narrow. Combined with the game's die-restart mechanism these jumps become bad gameplay.\n\n4) Lastly the drops. You get each drop in about 2-3 hours. There are a total of 4 drops (aka Trading cards)","December 11, 2015","false","10.9"," 33 of 48 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","33","48","3","0"

Dense atmosphere, good sound effects, challenging puzzles and fluid gameplay. One of the most promising 3D plataform games i've played in a long time.\n\nThe strange thing about Face It is what happens after finish all available levels (in exeption of darkest world ones). I really don't know if it's just coincidence, but it give me really stange dreams. I don't remember it all, but in my dream i was chased by black smokes, quite similar to those found in game.

Now the gameplay feels much more intense (especially when ghosts are around) and camera doesn't jerk that much. Overall experience improved a lot. Controls still feel unresponsive and not tight enough (not sure why). When I'm jumping through saws, for example, it feels much more dependent on luck, than on skill, and it's hard to understand where I'm going to land. I understand that this is a subjective matter, but I wish jumps in this game felt more "precision based".\n\nControls are clunky and physics doesn't feel good, but that could be fixed - it's an early access game after all. What's hard to be fixed is core gameplay. That, and the main idea.\nMechanics are simple, approachable and clear, that's a plus. But I simply find them boring, with lack of depth and no way to evolve in something more intresting through polishing or new content.\nThis game tries hard at being meaningful. Sadly, it doesn't even try to create metaphors for player to make sense of. It just keeps shouting you in the face messages it's trying to deliver and repeats same enigmatic pretencious phrases over and over.\n\nIf you're looking for a simple, dark and pretencious puzzle - maybe you'll like it. Other than that - wouldn't recommend.","November 9, 2015","false","6.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","4"

I'm very Hypocritical when it comes to graphics on games. This games art is very well done. An for anyone who just plays a game to see the art i'd recommend this game. After playing over 100's of mmorpgs. I've come to only want to see a game that's easy for the eyes. Though to be quite honest this games in early access hopefully it'll add more content as i got to the second level so fast. It could easily be considered a finished game. I'd still buy it at 19.99 the developer has a great hook.\n\n\nPros - Great graphics.\nLooks dreamy\nGood music\nQuite easy but still challenging.\n\nCan't really list 1-2 word cons. But the only con i see is that some of the levels you can hop to the finish line just double jumping. It's a great game the voice almost feels like i'm being hypnotized which is quite unique. It's terrible unique in the sense that it's quite scary for me it's a new expierence exspecially for a horror puzzle game i've expierenced quite a few of them off-steam. An i can't say any are similar you've easily destroyed any similaritys though it's quite a scary game for someone who's had night terrors most of his life. When i play this game it feels like i'm reliving a night terror.\n\nThe game is completely smooth. The games overall polished, i'd deeply recommend it. It's definitly not worth as much as it's listed. I'd buy a game like this for 19.99 USD. Though with the lack of content i can see why it's so cheap. But it's easily worth alot more an should have alot more hype. 5Th review. Hopefully i'll see more reviews come in.\n\nIt's definitly a game to play overall 10/10.","July 15, 2015","true","0.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

You avoid spikes, jump onto moving platforms, jump off of blocks before they disappear, collect a key to open a door, etc. While doing all that, you also have a flashlight that you need to point at occasional ghosts that will try to kill you (they look pretty damn creepy).\n\nThe platforming is decent, however the camera is pretty irritating. First of all, to move the flashlight, you need to hold the mouse button down, as opposed to just moving it around, which would have been a lot better. If you're NOT holding the mouse button down and decide to change directions while walking, the camera is really janky and will jump around. It doesn't make the game harder in a good way, just a frustrating way. (EDIT: There actually is a way to toggle the other type of flashlight control by clicking the right mouse button. However, it isn't ever mentioned in the game, so it isn't very clear.) Despite that though, the game is pretty easy. I never really felt like there was much challenge, and it's quite short as well.\n\nOverall, I like the aesthetic, but the gameplay isn't very engaging. It is in early access, so it's possible a few of these annoying mechanics will be fixed, but the level design and general gameplay can't really be mended. It's good that it's a cheap game, so perhaps you could pick it up if you like the look of it.","October 12, 2015","false","11.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","9"

I personally can't get beyond this part as jumping seems to be a big part of solving puzzles in this game and it's just shoddy.

It is still in an early Early Access point, where it has only one world (they say it will have nine worlds) making it pretty quick to "finish".\n\nBut, it is also still very cheap, which is a good reason for you to buy it already at its stage. Really, the game deserve it.\n\nIt is a very atmospheric game, with a narrator that really immerses you in the gameplay and its poems. Yes, the game has some poems that serves to symbolic interpret the things that happen in the game.\nAnd, well, this game is pretty symbolic\nFirst, you're "ALONE IN THE DARK" (wrong game? Sorry, but still, the name, Face It, is also part of its symbolism) which, as soon as you see that the energy (like HP) in this game is represented by a light of a flashlight, and its recharges are called hope, you begin to see that maybe things are a bit more complex than just ghosts that chase you, they are, also, 'something else' that is represented in those ghosts.\n\nThe game plays well, the system of moving the light to illuminate the ghosts works well and it is not really hard. Which is pretty good is also the fact that if you collect every letter of 'curiosity' in the stage, you get that stage in a harder mode and it can also be challenging to those who want. The stages are a bit short, but it is in a very good size, since if you die you lose all the letters and go back to the beginning. This is one of those game that if you remember the stage it helps you to go faster in it. The music is algo good and helps to immerse you into the game.\n\nBut, it still has things to improve. The audio of the main menu can be irritating, some jumps are hard to make because sometimes the camera doesn't help that much (But you can move the angle, which is pretty good), and when you lose HP is hard to notice most of the time. Also, the narrator and his poems can be a bit repetitive, since he will reproduce the same poems when you do some things. But, overall, it seems a bit nitpicking, the game is already at a good stage of its production.\n\nLook forward to it, the developers already have a good game and this one seems like will add to that list.","November 5, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In its current state, it is a short platformer that was more fun and not very frustrating.   The full controller support worked very well for controls with an xbox360 gamepad.  The right thumbstick points the flashlight, the left thumbstick moves (and flashlight automatically shines in direction you are moving), right-trigger runs, A jumps.  The game is mostly platforming, and thankfully not as much about timing jumps perfectly.  You can collect letters spread throughout the level, or just go fairly straight to level completion.  There are hidden platforms that show up only when you are right in front of them, buttons to press, spring jumps, and moving platforms.  Occasionally there are ghosts that are defeated by pointing the flashlight at them.  In a few places it was a little challenging to fight off a horde of ghosts, but the best trick is to backtrack a little and just shine the flashlight at them all at once.  I beat all 5 levels in world 0, and as far as I can tell there is no more worlds (at the time of this review).  This was a pleasant surprise (3/5 stars).","May 14","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

From the beginning: In "Face It" you are a little guy with a flashlight. This little guy is in some puzzle look like levels with barriers and a dark, myterious atmosphere and he has to pass through the levels. Next to the puzzle structure you have to solve, there are also enemies, exact ghosts. While you try to finish the puzzle levels with jumping and running, you also must pay attention to the gohsts. When you get hit by a barrier or a ghost, your torch goes out slowly, and if the light goes out or if you fall into the darkness you have to restart the level.\n\nThere are just 5 levels to play, but 2 mods, so you can play 10 levels overall. There is a standard way to finish the levels, and if you collect all letters, which you can collect in a level, you can also play the "Dark World" mod. You can finish this 10 levels very fast, the game ends after about 2 hours playing. So if you ask me, a little to short. Besides the short playtime, there isn't a real storyline. You get some quotes ingame, quotes about light and darkness, but in the end just boring stuff. Also really anoying is the fact that the same intro and the same outro is repeated after every level.\n\nAll in one, yes, it's fun to solve the levels, but there are to few levels, the game is finished after 2h and some things get on nerves and are getting boring after a while, so I wouldn't recommend this game. I didn't think that the developer can make large cracks from this Early Access version...\n\nSummary:\n+atmosphere\n+level design\n+music\n-storyline\n-short game time\n-camera view\n-repeated intro & outro\n-enemies are getting boring after a while\n-no card drops within 2h","April 16","false","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Scare away ghosts with your flashlight, collect letters, avoid falling or stepping on spikes in a handful of levels. That's about it. For $2 (but no more until they add a lot more), it may be worth it if you're into that sort of thing, but the controls and/or camera angles are the most challenging part of the game. Since it's early access, I'm hopeful that they will work those issues out, and will add more challenging puzzles that don't rely on you falling off things.","October 7, 2015","false","9.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Not know that this was an early access game I threw myself in to it hoping for a fresh game, one I haven't seen before. So I did what I usually do... Not look at anything on the game. Well now I wish I would and finding out that it was early access after I had played it makes it worse. I already have a dislike to early access as most games get forgotten and unfinished and I don't like the idea of paying for a game that hasn't even been finished and the devise thought they could get a couple of bucks out of it before they actually bother finish it. I know this isn't every early access game but a lot are like this. This game from the looks of it was either rushed, not cared about enough, or by inexperienced devise. Im sorry if it's the last option but you will need some helpful criticism. First of all I noticed the controls for the torch, these are horrible you can either not do anything and it will snap to the direction you are facing which leads to very disorientating gameplay ad there is no smooth animation for the snap lock and leaves the player felling more or less dizzy, or you can hold the left mouse button the whole time to control the torch which is annoying while trying to do platforming but is much easier then the snap control. This was very annoying through he whole game as you do have to use the torch as a weapon and making it a prime function without taking much care for smooth animation is not done well. While trying to find an option to maybe have it as a consonant on the mouse control I found myself exiting the level which made me instantly dislike this game. First of all there was no are you sure you want to exit the level, second no indication what so ever through the game did it say if you want to exit the level press ESC, this may not seem like that big of a deal and it wouldn't be in any other situation but in mine I was near the end of the level with all the collectibles and I had exited and was forced to play the level again but this time I ha dlost interest in collecting the letters. Another issue I have is that there are no options, none what so ever, except when you boot up the game it asks what graphics you would like windowed yes or no and resolution, for the very basic of settings these are there is no way to change them in game. One other thing that really bugged me about this game is the ♥♥♥♥ing narrator, jeez can you come up with some different lines, every single level has the narrator saying the same thing over and over again, it's like a broken record, and I'm not kidding at the start of every level there is the same cut scene of the narrator saying some bull and during every level he says the same thing, and at the end of every level there is another cut scene. Not to be discouraging the narrator has a nice voice but maybe get him a few more then 3 things to say. Now one thing that really bugged me about the game play was that every time you die you go all the way top the start of the level usually this would be OK, it gives consequence to the players death but it is so easy to die in this game from the odd camera angle and the (let' face it) cliché platforming with no real unique aspect means you have to start the level again and when this happens you loose all of your collectibles. This is the most frustrating part because even though the platforming is hard simply because of other issue and not the way it is designed, a big portion of the game comes froms getting the collectibles and after dying a few time to some random issue I quickly lost interest in getting the collectibles which unlock additional levels, which I could not bring my self to even collect the letter to play because I found myself wanting to stop playing this game instantly. Another aspect of the game I didn't enjoy was the enemy if you can even call them that, there are two enemy's, white slug things that slowly move towards you and little white sperm things that move quickly towards you, for a game with the subtitle 'A game to fight inner demons' I did not find myself fighting any inner demons the most I got was having a good laugh at the ridiculous design of an 'inner demon' and the variation of these inner demons (the small sperm things) do not come in till the 4th level which is the second last level in the game. Which brings me to my next point the length of this game is ridiculous it is less then an hour I'm sure if you went through all the levels getting the collectibles it be a bit longer but no more then 2 hours it is ridiculous, if you are going to make a game with this kind of game play and non existent story telling at least make it long enough so people get their moneys worth. Another aspect I found odd was music or the lack of, the first time I heard music was in the last stage of the game and there was no epicness to it like in dark souls where music would only play during boss battles but dark souls made the iteration of music mean something, it made the player feel like they were doing something epic not bloody doing mundane platforming.\n\nSo if you are looking to buy this game I wouldn't bother the $1 price it is definitely not worth it in the sate that it is in now.","November 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","1"

Graphics are nice as is the atmosphere of the game. The mood is what really sells this.\n\nThe controls for jumping are not as sharp and polished as I would have liked, but also not terrible. It is still in Early Access and it looks like the Developer is listening to feedback, so I believe minor problems like the controls will be solved.\n\nOverall this is worth it, especially for that price (1,99€ right now).","October 9, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
