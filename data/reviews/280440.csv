You can see where everything is going, though, and the developer's reverence for Chromehounds is obvious.\n\nHe's been plugging away at this for a long time, and hasn't shown signs of stopping.

But having spoken to the game maker through the facebook page he seems commited to continuing to improve the game. This game deffidently could be an amazing strategy mech game in the future and even in this early developmental stage its still fun to play around with. So yes I would say putting the $20 in now is worth it especially if the game continues to improve on a regular basis.","May 1, 2014","true","2.8"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","43","51","0","0"

However, It’s still very much in Beta/Alpha, but it is still a lot of fun to play around with the mech building and then testing your creations. Also it does have a functioning multiplayer although it can get a little jittery at the moment, but it is still early beta. Overall this is an awesome game and I can’t wait to see new updates.

I've spent the years since then looking for another Chromehounds-like game; it captured a certain beauty in cooperative team play and customization that I haven't seen in any other game since. It was astounding to see that such an amazing gem of a game was being lost to time, with no new titles hoping to revive its unique play.\n\nIn looking for a new Chromehounds, I stumbled onto MAV a couple of years ago, when it was in very early stages. I remembered the name and checked back every so often to see how progress was going. After several months of forgetting, I came back recently, and was truly impressed with the progress so far; finally happy with the project, I decided to buy a copy.\n\nIt was a great decision.\n\nMAV looks and plays like it was designed by somebody who loved Chromehounds and is serious about creating a game that embodies what made it great. Customization is true to the original game, giving the player a handful of parts and full control over how to build them. Moving across the battlefield, controlling the cameras, manuevering the mech, lobbing artillery and missiles; it all feels like playing Chromehounds again.\n\nAlongside the clear dedication to reviving Chromehounds-style play, Bombdog Studios has provided some much-needed updated to the game design. Damaged parts no longer become shortcuts to cockpit damage; they are blown off the mech completely. Removing the (usually heavily armored) legs now completely destroys the mech instead of leaving them sitting and hoping an enemy comes by. Repair and reload stations have been added, where a player can restore a partially damaged mech after a tough fight - if they can get away from battle long enough to do it! New equippable modules add another layer of strategy, with players able to deploy walls, repairs, and communication devices on the field.\n\nAs it stands, the game is short a progression system; all parts will be unlocked on purchase. This will be streamlined when money and shops are added, providing players with decent progression and a slow introduction to the different parts to get used to them. Certain concerns that were big with Chromehounds, like balancing the cost of a mech's repairs and ammo against the amount that can be won from the enemy, don't exist just yet. That being said, it's very clear that the developers have other great ideas that are being implemented as the game develops, serving not only to shadow Chromehounds, but to use it as a stepping stone to create a better game.\n\nI am eager and excited to see what comes next. Thank you so much, Bombdog Studios, for ressurecting my favorite game with a passion and reintroducing me to a world I thought I would never see realized again.","April 6, 2015","true","15.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

It is still very rough around the edges but that's to be expected as features are still being added to the game.\n\nPro's\nExtreme customization (it's like playing with lego's again)\nBig stompy mechs (3~4 story tall)\nPlayer hosted servers so it won't go down forever\nGold paint doesn't cost $500.00 (Alpha-1 backer swag)\nExtremely awesome Dev, quickest patch response / fix is currently 1 hour after reported and he's always reading the forums / user comments even if he doesn't reply to everything.\nCurrent Con's\nMav Building in the Garage is still alpha stage\nLack of Maps (expecially compared to chromehounds 100~ some maps you never played on because of the war's flow)\nStill in early / mid alpha so features aren't all in yet like Campaign mode and lots of weapon types.\nSound system hasn't been touched much so it's extremely basic\nUsing an older version of unity due to the game being too big to compile on current newer versions of unity, we just have to wait for this one.\nCurrently no official servers, just mine and other user created ones.\nPretty much all of my cons center around the fact that it's still in Alpha stage and we're just waiting for updates to add missing or update older content to a much more finished state. Also if you want to play on the cutting edge try enabling the beta build (snapshot) to play on "unstable" releases as these are updated in a much higher intervals.","February 1, 2015","true","138.0"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","1"

Another weakness is singleplayer as dispite it's generous amount of maps each is just a very stale Deathmatch against bots (It's best to use Singleplayer as a test mode for your robots.) Lastly with the multiplayer community as it is. The only way so far is to annouce or lookout for a match on the forums and to arrive on the set time and day the match is. No jump in and play yet!\n\nGameplay is very solid. The movement of each type of robot feels alright and the way the guns handling feels acceptable too. But its saving grace it has is the customisation apart from the base (The robots legs) all parts can be moved around thanks to Spacers a lego like component which if done correctly can grant massive customisation options.\n\nWith Spacers you can place Guns, Generators, Armour plating and even your cockpit! almost where ever you desire. Have light armour cockpit but want protection? Rather than placing armour on it you can just use spacers to hid your cockpit behind your tank legs! Using your high armoured  legs as protection instead!. Spacers can truely lead to some interesting designs.\n\nFinally the greatest part is the weapon placement current cockpits can fire upto seven weapons at one time! if you had the time you could possibly create a super gun out of high powered sniper rifes and howitzers? ( Depending if you can control the recoil and master the fire spread) which could destroy anyone. The ability to mix weapons is up to you want a shotgun and flamethrower merely put them together and assign them to a robots many equipment slots and it's done.\n\nThough the gameplay of this game is limited the customisation certianly Isn't with many Builds and weapons combos to try building a Robot is this games greatest joy! So although it can't be recommend for its limited gameplay at this time it can be for it's truly fun Customisation.","July 27, 2014","true","27.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

Anyway…\n\nSustain:\n-Controls are smooth and easy.\n-The camera swap with the PiP for the alternate cam is an awesome idea.\n-The weight-based system for mech construction is cool and simple to learn. The real joy of the game comes in exploring the garage mode and making a mech within the constraints of weight, power, speed, and armor.\n-Footprints from the mechs – cool.\n\nImprove:\n-SOUNDS. The sounds are flat and very uniform. A giant robot battle with missiles, rockets, and many bullitos should sound as awesome as it…sounds.\n-Add more parts for the mechs. Add more variety to the look of parts (maybe ‘theme’ some parts – the different Gundam factions look a lil different from each other).\n-Add a boost or sprint mode for the mechs.\n-Add a heat/overheat system, so mechs can go beyond their power boundaries (use rivers, lakes, and streams as an external factor for cooling, as well as the environment conditions on each map – a snowy map will allow more sustained fire)\n-Add a lead-target circle. A spot for the pilot to aim to lead moving targets with the various weapons (this could be left out to force users to learn the various weapons, but I think it should be a toggle-option, at least).\n-Add a conquest sort of mode like Battlefield, where you capture flags and so on to control the map and enemy reinforcements.\n-Put a heavy metal soundtrack on during the battles (;\n-Dynamic environments that can be destroyed – terrain gets holes.\n-Add more to the HUD. Range to target, walking speed, weapon range, and other such things that would be relevant in a giant fighting robot.\n\nPiddly crap that will eventually find its way into a later version:\n-Add an interior vehicle (pilot) camera mode\n-Polish. The fonts, textures, details, graphics could all use a nice, robust makeover.\n-Campaign/Story modes.\n-More depth.\n\nThis game has much promise.

As of right now, the actual battle gameplay is quite solid.  Physics, movement, and weapons fire seem rather well polished.  As of now, however, there is no way to divide teams up how you want, the AI is completely inconsistant (sometimes it will actually attack or defend in a way that seems like it is actually trying, sometimes it sits there doing nothing, and sometimes it tries to endlessly drive through objects).  The MAV design section is quite capable of making some very intersting designs at present, but the controls and interface for that crucial section leave much to be desired currently.  That being said, you can tell this is a labor of love, and the developer has made fairly regular updates to it, so I still have hope that it will become the Chromehounds II that From Software will never make.

I love how many defferent parts there are to work with, even though, the parts in their subcatagorys are a bit similar the stats vary nicely.  I also have noticed how when parts connecting your chasy and cockpit become destroyed then your mech is destroyed, to help reduce this issue could there be more attachment points and even the option to load 2 chasy's if you say wanted to make something look like an ATAT from Star Wars or even a centaur.  The added conections could extend the lives of mechs and also change the ideal target areas from that spacer which almost instantly kills the mech, into, hit those cannons first so they can't damage you as badly on the chase.  With that being said i do have lots more I would love to add being a fan of chromehounds but I am merly a voice saying Thank you for starting this project my team and I are very excited to play anything similar to chromehounds and although robocraft is fun I like to feel like an adult in my mech (if that even really makes any sence) and as of yet this game still needs an umph in the right direction to make it a chalenging, and a fair based game.  A first person mode with gun cam/teamate cam would be a nice extra as I never really liked the targeting in 3rd person with cam box in upper right.  I am really excited to see what comes of this and as a last suggestion even though this may be impossible, have the option to link into teamates camera.  Could be handy for artilary or sniper mechs to be able to judge grid/distane if LOS will still be as short as it is now, current distance makes snipers just another pair of cannons.

It's still very much in it's beta stage, but it's already extremely entertaining to build mechs and fight bots/other players. It's as close to a Chromehounds 2 as we'll probably ever get since SEGA hates money.\n\nBuilding your mech will at first be very confusing, and the controls aren't too good in the garage, but once you get it down you'll be making different mech builds for different situations and then you'll notice you've made 15 different builds and you haven't even tested out a single one since you've been so busy building.\n\nPlenty of weapons, a decent selection of levels (thankfully with many more to come), plenty of styles of mechs to build (hovering, biped, hexaped, and wheeled mechs). Want to make a pizza boy mech? Don't worry, you most definitely can.[bombdogstudios.com] You can make some insane mechs if you want, or you can download other people's creations off the game's forum. Like this bizarre thing.[bombdogstudios.com]\n\nThe dev is planning to add a persistent multiplayer campaign, like what Chromehounds had. Everyone choosing alliances and fighting for territory. Sounds like it'll be a lot of fun! The dev is also planning a single-player campaign and 6 player co-op, as well as more maps.\n\nThe only negative I have to say about this game is that the framerate is pretty bad at times. When you're in the thick of a battle it'll drop down to 30-40 fps, and that's with the lowest settings selected on my decently beefy gaming rig. The developer says optimization is high on his to-do list, though, and the game is still plenty playable even when the framerate does dip, so I still highly recommend this.\n\nEspecially if you played Chromehounds and have been hoping for something similar after all these years.

Graphics, sounds, single/multiplayer improvements and even experience rewards make the whole game a lot more satisfying to play.\n\nVisually, the game has gone from having a somewhat poor appearance to actually looking impressive in many ways. Shooting individual parts off or seeing an entire MAV explode into a shower of weapons and modules is always satisfying. Shaders, lighting, and models have improved so that the everything fits into the environment more naturally.\n\nSounds have been added or changed for almost everything. This is probably my favorite improvement since it used to feel like you're fighting in a vacuum. Some tweaking can still be done, but it's already a little haunting to hear a teammate being lit up by an enemy.\n\nMultiplayer is essentially the same as in the alpha but given some major lag and desync improvements. More changes need to be made still, as you still have an occasional player that is highly desynced and at a certain point servers do slow down, but for the most part it's fine.\n\nProgression has been added and it's not the miserable grind that Free-to-Play games have made into the norm. You own the game already, so content isn't going to be witheld from you for an unreasonable amount of time.\n\nNot a lot of obvious changes were done with the maps. The notoriously laggy ones do run a lot better now and they do look better. The old alpha maps are still in the game and you're not going to impress any artists with them.\n\nI forgot to mention that the singleplayer is improved drastically. Still no story or campaign modes, but you have a full singleplayer settings menu and way better AI than before to make singleplayer skirmishes a lot more fun.\n\n\nOld Alpha build review:\n\nExcellent for those who are creative enough to come up with your own mech concepts. Things like the UI, sound, and graphics are still in alpha, but the developer keeps the community updated every few days with live streams and blog posts on what improvements are upcoming. The multiplayer community is small but they all get together at scheduled times during the week.\n\nIf you can put up with something being in alpha development I recommend it.

I've played and enjoyed most of them in video game, tabletop game, board game and card game formats. I however can't get behind this one. I was a contributor to the kickstarter and was hoping for something cool in this. There are no tutorials in game for anything. The guide opens a web page with videos. After watching one I figured out most stuff but there are indicators that create an invalid build but they don't say why its invalid. Things like weight and power are obvious but the guns are not. I was looking for a way to add in ammo, place them differently and other things. It turns out you have to manually assign the guns to a weapon group after adding them onto the mech. The auto generated mechs had this issue as well. That should be automatic but I could accept it if the gameplay and combat was good. Unfortunately it wasn't.\nI have a gamepad as a joystick that works perfectly in all other games. However M.A.V. treated the centre of the screen as the top of the sky whenever it is plugged in. There are no joystick calibration controls within M.A.V. and the one I used outside the game with Windows said it was aligned perfectly. M.A.V. disagreed.\nOnce I unplugged the joystick and restarted the game the centre of view was normal. Iit was still looking at the sky with no joystick attached until I completly restarted game.\nThere was bugger all strategy or options in combat. I tried a few base types (biped, track, hover) and found there was little option other than to run backwards whie shooting at your enemy. I couldn't outrun the AI bots, strafing was useless as the aiming controls were too slow and guns recharged too slow so I was absorbing hits. It was basically luck to see whos guns recharged quicker to ake out the armour.\nGranted, this could change with more time getting to know the controls and playing with different mech designs. However all the issues prevented me from wanting to spend time doing that.\nThis might be good for kids that don't mind tinkering with designs and learning clunky controls. But I have other games to play that are far better.","February 25","false","0.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","8"

Since the last time I played it, the UI has somewhat improved, as did the model assets. However, that is where the improvements seem to end. The game environments are about as bland and generic as can be, with levels of quality that would look bad ten years ago, let alone today. Optimization is poor to nonexistant, with my framerate staying below 30 even on the thoughtfully included "Minimal" graphics settings - which I shouldn't have to resort to while using a Radeon 390. While not much can be expected of a small game studio, this title is just not up to par with the likes of Robocraft or Mechwarrior Online.","May 2","false","1.0"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","23","3","13","3","1"

Sadly it's no where near finished, but the developer is very open to the players on developments. The customisation is fantasic, and provides the depth that's truely needed in a mech game. While I think the games a few years from being finshed, its still coming together very well.
