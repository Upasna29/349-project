"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/235720/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Cubetractor is an action strategy puzzle game where, you guessed it, you have a lot of interactions with cubes. The game was released in May 2013 and a lot of people will probably have this game already due to it featuring quite often in bundles over the past couple of years.\n\nThe game play looks very simple from the screenshots on the store, but there is actually quite a bit of depth to this little title. You are in control of a little robot who can move cubes around the map using his tractor beam, these cubes can either be used to out right destroy enemies, combined to create turrets or barriers and even be used to cause harm to yourself if you aren’t careful.  The blocks will continue to move in the direction you pulled them until they come into contact with something, so you have to be really tacticful with how you interact with them sometimes. If they don’t hit anything, they will tend to respawn after a few seconds in their original spot.  The game play is really pusating and enjoyable, some very fast paced action can be seen throughout your play though of this game.\n\nThe art style is really pleasantly presented. The 8bit theme is pulled off very well, along with some really nicely done animations and lovely sound effects. There isn’t any spoken dialogue, simply because it isn’t needed.\n\nCubetractor surprisingly has a very interesting story line. The robot you play as is trying to escape to freedom, you do this over the course of completing your exams for robot school? I would strongly recommend people read the dialogue between the main characters in the game as there are some great lines to be seen. Silly enough, the robots who built you failed to think about putting some sort of self-destruct feature in your build, so they are forced to sit back and hope you fail your exams and destroy yourself.\n\nThe game is difficult to say the least, once you complete the tutorial you are pretty much thrown in at the deep end. I might add that the tutorial is done very well and explains the mechanics of the game to a level which allows you to keep up with the early levels but also doesn’t hold your hand throughout.  Once you get past the first 10 or 15 levels, a lot of the game play is luck based and how quick you are on your feet with the amount of bullets flying around your screen from enemy turrets and mobs.\n\nI have been playing the game for about three hours now and have just finished the game. There is a side of me that thinks I will want to jump into the game at some point to maybe work on a few achievements given how easy the game play is to just pick up and play as well.\n\nI would personally say Cubetractor is a neat little indie title that could quite easily find a place in most people’s library. I would definitely say it is worth the £6,99 price tag, but you can quite easily pick this up on sale for much lower on other sites.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's also exceedingly cutesy.\n\nIf you're not, though, you'll probably get tired of this a few stages in like I did. Doesn't make it a bad game, just makes it not my cup of tea.\n\nOther cool facts: game has a ranking system which is pretty good and also doesn't expect you to get ALL THE STARS every time - the highest rank can be earned from minute one of the game, but clearly is designed for a replay once you've gotten good at it (they require obscenely tight timing + offing all enemies and collecting their batteries + never taking a hit).

Practically, the game is quite simple. You move your robot around the board and use the space bar to attract blocks toward your position. Once in motion, the blocks continue until they strike something causing damage, merge with another moving block to form a tower, or leave the screen. Cubes can be pulled only once (they will regenerate after a few seconds) and only in straight lines. The game is all about creating towers and striking enemies with moving cubes as you progress down the path toward freedom. The greatest advantage of this game is the story, you should read the entire contents during the game. On the other hand. the retro graphics of Cubetractor and the accompanying music start to bore very easily, although when it comes to music then you can always turn your own one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/235720/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Cubetractor is like a game of tug of war where the opposing team is throwing rocks at you. Except the rocks are lasers and nobody actually remembered to bring a rope.\n\nThough it borrows some tower defense staples, Cubetractor is primarily a puzzle game about pulling blocks around and making them bump into one another. The trick however isn’t so much in the actual pulling of blocks but in the timing and placement of them, each combination of two blocks producing a tower which is then used to destroy the pesky enemy towers that have been shooting you the whole time.\n\nIt sounds easy on paper, but Cubetractor is exceedingly good at taking its minimalistic design and turning it against you in ways that at times wager on the downright sadistic. More often than not though this only makes solving a level that much more satisfying, and because Cubetractor was built with symmetry of capability in mind it rarely feels as if you’re outmatched by your opponent. They just got there first (and probably cheated).\n\nI also found it hard not to enjoy my time with Cubetractor because the game itself is so enthusiastic. Sure, your little blue robot might be enacting a destructive rampage disguised as a particularly explosive form of self-education, but they’re so doggone happy about it who has the heart to stop them? There is an absurdist charm to Cubetractor that is often hard to pin down, but it’s pervasive joy had me continuing to come back for more even as I was cursing the seeming impossibility of a given level.\n\nThe only time Cubetractor falls apart is when its puzzles begin to turn into a monotonous war of attrition, requiring you to brute force your way through enemies rather than defeat them strategically. This mostly happens in the later levels of the game, but it’s a sharp and dramatic decline in the overall quality of level designs that is even more unfortunate given how the game up to that point seemed so conscious of avoiding tedium.\n\nTroublesome (and it should be said, optional) levels aside however, Cubetractor is a delight to unravel. It cleverly combines elements of more genres than are worth mentioning into a game that feels surprisingly fresh for all its recognizable parts. I was left feeling just slightly unsatisfied with the abruptness of the ending, but if it’s any indication of things to come, this isn’t the last we’ll see of the little robot that could [blow stuff up] and that’s not a bad thing by any means.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 13","true","6.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I honestly thought I would be doing more than this...  Welcome to Cubetractor, a game where you play as a rogue r*tarded robot that's obsessed with destroying everything, mistaking everything it destroys as some sort of "test".  Seriously...that's the whole story.\n\nThis is a frustrating retro-style puzzle game about timing and collisions building turrets, walls, shields, etc.   Sure it sounds interesting, but it will honestly remind you of Bomberman, which is honestly far more fun than this game.\n\nI'm certain you're thinking "Is it worth the price?".  The answer?  FRIG NO!!!  $10 for a game like this?  I'm betting most people would rather buy Undertale for the same price than to play this game and I don't blame them.

Can't argue with that\n\nI don't know what else to say, so let's get to the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n-Achievements\n-Leaderboards (I haven't still seen any...)\n-Challenging just about right\n-Extraordinary Optimization:\nGiven that my pc is a stupid piece of crap who can't even run a game called "Missing Translation" (check if you will) at stable 60fps, this game surprised me. If you check the specs they demand actually nothing, and it's true! I never had any problems with lag or sound lag, stable framerate and stuff. So if you have a piece of ♥♥♥♥ computer like me and wanna spend the time not awaiting for the game to go back at 15 fps (after it dropped to 5), this piece of gem is for you!\n\n-Designed for hardcore and casual gamers:\nThe game got these little extra tasks you can do if you want on the levels, which are not required to complete but mainly aimed to the hardcore community (or the achievement hunters, like me) to do it. They're super tough.\n-Decent artwork and soundtrack (given that this game was released on 2013 you can't compare to something like hyper light drifter....)\n\nNeutral:\n\n-Meh price, I'll get to that in a moment\n-The challenges for the achievement hunters are REALLY tough!!\n\nCons:\n\n-Overprice:\nThe game was featured on a load of bundles over the years, and on april 2016 it was been mass given away by indiegala. We can call the game dead, but it's kind of overpriced given that a lot of people got it for free and some bought it along with other games for only 1 dolar. Common, do some research and you might end up saving a hell of a lot if you plan on buying this game. Or wait for a sale (lol lazyass)\n-No trading cards for a game that has been mass given away ( :steamfacepalm: )\n-No workshop support for a game that would perfectly fit\n\n\nOverall, it's a really good game and you should definitely check if you're into 2D puzzles.","April 15","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has quasi 8-bit graphics, so retro!  It's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ offspring of two genres you would never think to combine: bullet hell and tower defense!  It's got to be awesome, right?  Yeah, not so much.\n\nI think the idea has potential: I'm a fan of bullet hell, and somehow turrets are always fun, so a bullethell game in which you had to place turrets instead of shoot at aliens would probably be fun.  The problem with this game is the problem with so many other action games: the controls are clunky.  Unfortunately, in this case, the clunky controls aren't a result of incompetence - it was a deliberate design choice.\n\nYou see, you create towers by smashing blocks together.  Smash different blocks, get a different tower.  This is really, really hard to control and it limits tower placement unnecessarily.  Far from being a heart-pounding action game, this game feels and plays more like a puzzle game.  Where did the creator want me to place the tower?

Despite being their first release, they have managed to craft an interesting title with a good mix of gameplay styles.\n\nStory\nThe game starts off with Endroi, the robot that players control, being given menial tasks like washing dirty cubes in the river using his ability to pull cubes towards himself. Quickly he goes out of control, using this skill to take down the walls blocking his way and then destroying even the turrets that were to stop his rampage. Endroi continues north, leaving ruin behind him, while thinking that everything he comes across is just another task he should deal with.\n\nPresentation\nThis game goes for a simple 2D style that works well. While not high resolution, everything is easy to recognise and has enough detail. Players will recognise each block and turret at a glance. The music is also very simple, and tends to loop maybe a bit too often, but its still nice enough. Nothing awful that would result in muting it has been found during gameplay. This game is however lacking in any sort of options, with only the basics covered, like muting the sound and toggling full screen, not even a different resolution setting available.\n\nControls\nThis game supports gamepad or keyboard controls, with only a few actions available. Endroi can move with the arrow keys, use the Z button to pull a block and X to remove a created turret. One problem with the game is the lack of changeable settings for these.\n\nGameplay\nAs already explained, the game starts off with players pulling blocks around. Over time, the player will learn to pull them into the paths of enemy towers and later to pull different blocks towards each other to form different allied towers, such as a defensive wall, a regular turret, a generator that boosts the fire rate of close by units and several others. While early levels will make this each, later locations will have blocks in difficult locations, so players must plan out what to pull on, while dodging enemy attacks all the while. The mix of action, puzzles and some tower defence does make for an interesting game, and most missions can be done in bursts of a few minutes, making this title suitable for those without a lot of time.\n\nLifespan\nEach of the primary missions has 4 ranks to earn, and even skilled gamers shouldn't expect to see a Master Rank after finishing each for the first time. The highest rank requires players to be fast and untouchable while still destroying every enemy in their way and collecting the items they drop. Gold or Silver ranks will be much more common early on. As well as the primary missions, players will also unlock side quests in which you must destroy every enemy and collect their item to complete each level, adding a bit more content to the game for those who enjoy the challenge.\n\nWhile this game doesn't stand out on how it presents itself, the gameplay with the mix of different styles works very well, though could drive away some players who don't enjoy all three.","November 12, 2014","true","1.2"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

The game is simple but hard to play. It´s easy to reach the next level, but if you try to make the best score which is possible you have a lot of work and also fun.\nI can say that every gamer who wants to play a perfekt run or game will defenetly have fun with this game.\n\ngreetz Gulaschkanone","April 20","true","37.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
