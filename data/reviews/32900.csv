But for those who like to play tycoon games where they are in control of everything in a restaurant, it gets pretty addicting to check profits and figure out how to reach the goals in each scenario.  The first campaign starts a bit hard because not everything is accessible and the player is expected to play with whatever the tutorial gives.  I had to fire more than 5 servers before I found two that wouldn't be rude to customers because I didn't have access to staff training yet.  Managing the restaurants is no easy task as the player is expected to know how to be successful in finances and food.\n\nPlayers could easily cheat by using codes that are readily available, but where's the fun in that?  Some might complain about the super bright glowing effects when they first play the game, but that can be remedied by turning off all glow features in "Settings".  Eventually, the player will be in control of what s/he wants to put in the restaurant as well as serve in the restaurant while keeping in mind of ratings.  There's a little bit of free customization for the floors, walls, and employee outfits.\n\nTime passes in a day in the game's universe, meaning the restaurant operates within 24 hours and every minute counts.  At the end of the day, whatever money that is generated is multiplied by 30 or 31 to represent monthly revenue or profits.  Therefore, the player should avoid wasting too much time by letting the minutes pass while deciding how to arrange furniture or improve recipes, but that's why the pause button is there!\n\nOverall, someone who is easily enticed by tycoon or management games can get easily stuck in his or her seat for a few hours trying to get perfect ratings or avoiding debt (at least... I did.)\n\n","January 1, 2014","true","36.6"," 72 of 76 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","72","76","0","0"

Placing the tables just right so there are no traffic issues.  That way people don't have to wait too long for their food.  Decorating the inside and outside of the restaurant so your place looks classy.  Entering the cooking contests to climb the chef ranks.  Being able to control every aspect of your restaurants and watching them make money is gratifying.\n\nThere haven't been updates or improvements to this game from the first Restaurant Empire.  Heck, you could probably consider this a long delayed expansion pack to the first one.   Armand, the main character is still wearing the same pants.  They were ugly then and they're still ugly today!  If you didn't like the first Restaurant Empire, you won't like the second one.  The AI of your employees is still really frustrating.  Your restaurants are still not going to be perfect.  And no matter what you do or how well you do it, customers are going to complain. They're never happy! (and I do mean never!)  Some of the scenarios can be maddening to try and complete.  Despite all this, the game does keep me entertained.","October 13, 2014","true","72.7"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","37","39","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trinovantes/recommended/32900/","trinovantes","Trinovantes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trinovantes/","120 products in account","This game has two storyline campaigns:\n1. An improved version of Restaurant Empire 1 where you build French, Italian, and American resturants\n2. The actual sequal to the first game's storyline where you build desert and coffee houses as well as French, American, German resturants\n\nThe scenarios were really easy to beat such as get X revenue/profit and/or Y customers in the allocated time. All you need to do is align your tables to maximize your servers' mobility and put a bunch of decorations everywhere to boost your restaurant's rating.\n\n---\n\nI've played a lot of tycoon games in my childhood and it's saddening to see this genre die. After playing this game, I can see why. The concepts are great but the execution is terrible.\n\nGameplay in a nutshell:\n1. Pause game\n2. Place tables and decorations in your restuarant\n3. Hire staff\n4.  Add recipes to the menu\n5. Save game\n6. Fast forward time\n7. ???\n8. Profit!\n\nMy biggest complaint with this game is that whenever you get access to a higher quality ingredient supplier, you need to go into EACH recipe to change your supplier. Once you've done that, you have to adjust the price of that recipe in EACH resturant. If you don't do these, your food rating will suck and/or your profit margins will drop. I guess the developers wanted to allow more micromanagement but it's annoying when you just want to update all of your resturants.\n\nOther things to consider:\n- There's no 16:9 support\n- The textures/models are outdated (this game was released in 2009)\n- The auto save for the campaign doesn't work for me\n- You have a finite number of chefs in the campaign so don't fire them!\n\nOverall, I still think it's a decent tycoon game. If you're bored with the other popular tycoon games (SimCity, Game Dev Tycoon, Eve Online), give this game a shot if it's on sale.","October 27, 2013","true","59.1"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","32","37","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mijatodd/recommended/32900/","mijatodd","Waffles©","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mijatodd/","254 products in account","Let me start with a story;\n\nA long time ago, back when Waffles© was just a wee lad, he had a grand total of ten dollars and fifty cents.  Being the spendthrift little boy as he was, he ventured into the local Walmart store to find a jolly old game to play on his parents computer.  Little boy Waffles© soon found a cheerful looking game by the name of Restaurant Empire that he immediantly began to want for.  The total price of the game?  $10.00 (and 50 cent tax).  He gleefully skipped to the check-out counter where he paid his ten and fifty and ran home to enjoy his new-found game.  Ohh but what fun he had playing this joy of a game!  Hours upon hours where spent building restaurants, organizing menus, and hiring staff.  The young boy who was Waffles© was overjoyed at this seemly limitless game!\n\nA dozen years later, grown man Waffles© browses the Steam store to find another game to review in a dire attempt to become noticed by the Steam community.  Startled, he runs across a familiar title: Restaurant Empire II.  What?  Was he being decived?  His childhood game had a sequel?  And was on Steam?  Thanking Gaben, Waffles© quickly bought the game instead of Super Noah's Ark 3D, downloaded, and installed it.  A couple hours later, here he is, ready to give his honest opinion on the game.\n\n\nRestaurant Empire II is a restaurant tycoon simulator where you take control of a young chef, fresh out of culinary school and ready to take on the Omnifood corporation.  The game plot is rather simple, and most of the mechanics are even more so.  The main goal of the game is to keep your customer satisfaction level high in order to maintain a five stay rating.  You do so by selecting dishes that have high ratings, updating your furniture to increase comfort levels, placing decorations to... well, increase your decoration level, and hiring and training staff to provide the best customer care possible.  In the sandbox mode, this is actually quite easy as you start out with a large building and you cannot start out with lower than $500,000.  I simply furnished the bottom floor, hired my staff and spent $10,000 a month on training them (after several months there were virtually no complaints about them), added only dishes that had a 75% or above approval rating, and decorated the floor so extravagantly that a four star rating was achieved in a few months in game time.  The five star rating took only about a year!\n\nReally, the main strength of the game is the original campaign which only gives you $40,000 to start out with.  Although you also begin with a fully decked out kitchen, dining room, and restrooms, you still have to add decoration, add dishes, hire staff, etc.  Several of the options (such as advertising and training) are blocked so the jerks who are your staff act all high and mighty for the first dozen challenges without the ability for you to stop them.  To throw a curveball when you least expect it, a well known character in the game gives you $250,000 to set up and maintain his nephew's new restaurant, which has no kitchen or restrooms.  Meaning you have to set up everything with the money you've saved up to that point.  The challenge is real and completing all objectives can be difficult but fun.\n\nBecause the mechanics are so simple, I really have to look at the game as a whole in order to give my full opinion on it, and frankly, there is not much to see.  Perhaps if the game had a fancy HD remastering, or an ambitious remake, the appeal would be greater.  The game feels pulled out of it's time in the steam market with fancy titles like Prison Tycoon, or Tropico V to keep it company, but without the aesthetic of it's counter parts it largely goes unnoticed.  Despite this, I wholeheartedly recommend Restaurant Empire II to the individual looking for such a game.  Maybe it's the nostalgia kid in me happy to play this game once again, but REII is a joy to play and quite simply a time waster for tycoon fans to enjoy.\n\nI rate this game 6.5/10, would loose childhood in again.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\nThe Older but not Wiser\nWaffles©","July 3, 2015","true","19.8"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","27","29","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/c00lizz/recommended/32900/","c00lizz","c00lizz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/c00lizz/","2086 products in account","Restaurant Empire II is the sequel to Trevor Chan’s Restaurant Empire which was released back in 2003 and although I have not played the original fans of both games give you the distinct impression that Restaurant Empire II is really just a glorified expansion to the original. Taken on it's own merits however, it's a decent enough management game that unfortunately gets bogged down in minutia and micromanagement rather quickly.\n\nThe game starts you off with the campaign from the original game, a new campaign based more around Desert House's and Coffee Shops and a sandbox mode. The sandbox mode however is pretty barebones and many of the staples from the campaigns, such as the minigames, chef reputation, cooking contests etc are removed. Add that to the fact that in Sandbox you start with pretty much everything already unlocked it becomes a rather futile experience.\n\nThe campaigns start you off as a small restaurant owner and slowly unlocks content and areas as you progress through various scenarios with pre-set goals. A small dash of storyline is thrown in but it can be safely ignored. Your goals throughout the campaign vary rather wildly in difficulty and it's often best to delay winning the easier scenarios until the very last moment so that you can use the extra time for your chefs and staff to get more skilled and more money to flow into your bank account.\n\nThe game at it's core is simple enough, you start a restaurant, place a kitchen, some bathrooms, furnish the seating area, hire some staff, pick a menu and off you go. However once you get going the game becomes anything but simple. The game will often tell you that you have trouble serving meals on time but doesn't give you any information as to why that is. Should you hire more servers? Hire more chefs? Move the tables closer to the kitchen? Solving problems with your restaurants quickly becomes purely trial and error until you get that perfect setup that you will never have to change. It doesn't help that the AI path-finding is nothing short of atrocious.\n\nAnd that brings us to the menu. As you progress through the game you will start to unlock specialty ingredient suppliers which allows you to increase the quality of your meals at a cost, however using these new high quality ingredient's have to be done individually for each recipe in each restaurant and likewise for changing the price making it an incredibly frustrating experience.\n\nAll in all Restaurant Empire II is a game with a few good ideas that are unfortunately marred by it's many design flaws and it's not really a game I'd recommend to anyone but extreme fans of management simulations. If you have a burning desire to play a game that lets you build and manage a chain of eateries I suppose this is really your only choice but if not, then you can find better entertainment elsewhere.","March 28, 2013","false","55.1"," 42 of 60 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","42","60","0","8"

I.... ok lets be serious now.\n\n\nI have played this game enough to know that this game is a master-game, so to speak. I see no problem with it, the graphics are ehhh but the gameplay and the campaigns are good, the ways and things you can make your restaurant is amazing and controlling the restaurant is even more amazing. The campaign Scenario's can be hard, but if you just want to play this game for killing time or something, you can go with the Sandbox Mode!! This game provides everything for every type of player. You can change the dishes in your menu, you can even give discounts when you want, you can increase/decrease the money you spend on a dish i.e you can raise or decrease the Quality of a dish. You can assign a chef to every particular dish and if you don't have time to do that any of your chef creates the recipe and serves it. You can hire people to work for your restaurant like Servers, and Captains who take orders, Receptionists etc etc... You can participate in a cooking competition. You can do almost EVERYTHING you can do in a real life restaurant as its owner. I really recommend this game, it's worth more than it's price. The amount of people who play this game is low because it's too old but i think if people become aware of this game, It could be in the list of the top sellers.","August 7, 2015","true","14.2"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","0"

We play through the basics of financial management, collect recipes of world cuisine and train other chefs to challenge the authority of OmniFood, a corporate firm that monopolized food industry years ago. Aside from side goals being a bit challenging to accomplish, the actual campaign is easy to get done. All you have to do is get things in order and wait till the end of month, which makes this game real casual and relaxing, more like a simulation even.\n\nSo far, I can count this game as one of my favorite tycoon games, aside from old classics like Theme Hospital or Zoo Tycoon. It gives you a perspective on food business and presents the basics of becoming a restauranteur. It is fun, and educating in a manner. Never have been a good cook myself, I get to stumble upon some really cool recipes that I'd like to try someday :) If you're into the subject, it's a neat game.","February 6, 2015","true","32.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

If you don't have a good restaurant layout, waiters and customers will get clogged up which will lead to slower service and complaints.  Cramming as many seats into a place might be your first instinct, and maybe it is the best thing to do, but it often ends up in a lower experience and rating overall for your restaurant.  These nuances are what make the game interesting and fun, well worth the couple of bucks.","July 10, 2015","true","155.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I feel like many of the actions doesn't seem to have a reaction. Sometimes, even though you tried all possibilities you have for certain specific points, they all return a negative feedback.  May be part of the game mechanic, but is a little frustrating.\n\nThe management part is not bad at all. You have to keep an eye in statistics and customer feedback. Need to find the balance between price and quality, accordingly to what your customers expect. This is the part of the game I liked.\n\nIn my opinion, the tutorial levels are a little exhausting. But I felt it was kinda necessary to give a good overview of the game mechanics, so it's ok.\n\nNot entirely sure I should recommend it, but I feel that people who like this type of game may want to play it.\n\n6/10","June 26, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Es un juego decente pero que ha sufrido de los estragos del tiempo, la interfaz es torpe, la cámara algo complicada y el juego pese a que tiene un centenar de opciones se resume en crear un menú de comidas y dejar que las cosas sigan su rumbo (no se suele notar mucho el efecto de todas las opciones que puedes tocar)\n\nLo recomendaría dado el caso que quieras un juego de simulación y no encuentres nada mejor.","March 5","false","1.6"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I had a crappy computer that wasn't built for gaming but that didn't matter to me at at the time and I played this game alot! I restarted alot and tried different techniques. it was awesome.\n\nNow when I saw it on steam I was really excited and happy because I never heard that they made it for steam or that they made a sequel so I purchased it right away and went right back into enjoying every second. I even stopped playing the game I was mildly obsessed with just to get back  into this game. I nailed every challenge perfectly and made it to my second resturant and saved the game so I could get my kids to bed. I was a happy camper.\n\nAs soon as I had enough time to jump back into my game I logged on immediately to continue my journey and EVERYTHING I HAD ACCOMPLISHED WAS GONE!  I had to start all over again and it's happened 3 times to it's safe to say I probably wont be playing this game again.....very disappointed.

Once you get your business running, it can be difficult to improve upon anything, as the feedback is minimal. Yes you may learn that one of your servers is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but that's about it. Or that your dish may be disgusting, but you may only pay for over-priced advice on how to make it better.\n\nIngredient tweaking would make this game better, as well as more options in terms of the business itself. Being able to actualy cook some dishes would be immense, and make this slightly more interactive. Even during cooking competitions, we don't actually make the food. There are minigames that are completed that may or may not even increase your chances of winning the competition. Being able to actually interact with the food only makes sense.\n\nBasically, you blitz through the initial set up of the restaurant, and then sit and watch your profits barely change. It's good for passing time, and on a whole its sort of fun, but it could be sooooo much better with some effort.","January 3, 2015","false","23.5"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"
