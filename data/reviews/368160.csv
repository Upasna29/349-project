Up to this point it has basically been the Anti-Wolf of Wall Street, because this is basically about a gigantic golden boot stomping on young 99%-ers trying to break out of economic inequality on an extreme free-market Moon.  Much of the following aspects of the review will reference events in episode 1 so I'll use spoiler tags.\n\nIf you're familiar with Spice & Wolf and liked it, you will enjoy reading WORLD END ECONOMiCA and should start at episode.01.\nIf you liked WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.01 and don't mind  Hagana's absence  , you're in for a treat.\n\nThey attempt filling the heroine gap left by Hagana by introducing a new heorine, Eleanor, who experienced a similar plight as the protagonist in the distant past and is dead set on becoming a public enemy to fight the power.  Our boy protagonist, Haru, is still fresh out of his trauma and much of his character arc for episode.02 pertains to him getting back into the game in his encounters with Eleanor and Chris. This a gripping "belly of the whale" arc that really got me jonesing for episode.03.  Oh, and our lovable anti-trap Chris  is carrying the team while slowly realizing certain feels for a certain protagonist.\n\nI remember there were a few people who had gripes regarding episode 1's translation in its early iterations, but I think they've been doing a great job taking advantage of having a beta (which is what I originally played) to mitigate such issues this time around.\n\nAlso, if you're still reading this and haven't even read WORLD END ECONOMiCA, again, you should definitely check out episode.01  which I also totally wrote a more proper Steam review for if you're still wondering if it is really for you.  Episode.03 really needs to come out already!","July 21, 2015","true","5.8"," 72 of 82 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","72","82","13","0"

But there was a humanizing element in episode one, and that humanizing element is made much more prominent in episode two. There are much less long infodumps about various qualities and characteristics of the stock market, and more scenes of interactions between characters who are all human and display strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe main character is now a traumatized 20-year-old, four years after the first episode, who is haunted by the memory of the grave mistake he made at the end of the first episode. He is definitely a lot less selfish and arrogant, but you can tell he still has yet to grow (which is why it is important to keep in mind that this is a trilogy).\n\nAll the characters from the first game that reappear here have changed, for me the most notable example being "Cerrow", whose name in the first game was Serrault. He lost his afro. That's a bummer. There is one notable person who's missing who will not be named, who haunts our protagonist throughout the story. The new heroine introduced is a wonderful reversal of the classical princess trope, who shows her own humanity and weakness slowly throughout the novel. That bedroom scene was pretty interesting. If you read this spoiler without reading the novel, it's going to be misconstrued.\n\nThere are still some weaknesses. Two new minor characters seemed pretty useless, Marco and Le Goff (Marco in particular; at least Le Goff was spotlighted as a prim and proper butler to Eleanor who was helpless to aid her in her quest for justice. Marco was just some pre-teen kid who had a crush on Eleanor. No characterization beyond that whatsoever.) but I'm hoping they'll be expanded upon somewhat in the final episode. There were a few spelling and grammar mistakes sprinkled throughout the novel, but I suppose they were probably itching to get this out and, despite the alpha and beta testing, couldn't get it perfect. I'm sure they'll fix it soon enough.\n\nOtherwise, this is a great example of a visual novel that does not need to guise itself in the form of a "pick the heroine you engage in intercourse with" to attract an audience. While romance is referred to, this is a story about growth and struggle. Of fighting against a machine focused only on keeping itself in power through money, and by keeping that power continuing to earn money. Of selflessness and justice against selfishness and greed.\n\nSolidly recommended.","July 22, 2015","true","6.6"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","26","31","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragunity/recommended/368160/","Dragunity","Drakaenae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragunity/","2713 products in account","WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.02 is a kinetic visual novel which is a continuation of episode.01. It is written by the same author who wrote Spice and Wolf. Unlike the first episode, the story does not mention too much about economics, thus a basic understanding of economic concepts is not required to fully enjoy the novel.\n\nStory: The story for this episode is okay. It talks about the events that happen four years after Haru, the main character, had suffered from the events from the previous episode. Not too much happens, mainly character development. The plot is mostly about how Haru struggles to conquer his past, and how he tries his hardest to help others so that he does not make the same mistakes as he had done in the past. I really missed the heavy amount of economics which is in the first episode, although this episode did talk about market bubbles and accounting scandals. I would rate the story 7/10.\n\nCharacters: Other than Haru, a few of the characters from the previous episode, Cerrow, Risa and Chris, returned to in this episode. I really like how the characters changed and matured after four years. Haru is a lot more mature and considerate, Chris is less shy, Cerrow has a job as an actual programmer now. A new main character, Eleanor, was introduced. Eleanor's character design was okay. I feel the princess/rich girl side of her was too cliche though. A few minor characters, Le Geoff, Marco and Rena, where introduced, but they did not really add to the plot. Rena helped Haru with his inner turmoil and helped him with some task after, but the other characters did not really do anything. Overall, I would rate the characters 8/10\n\nMusic: The music is okay. About the same quality as the previous episode. Some tracks were reused from the previous episode. I would rate it 7.5/10.\n\nArtwork: The artwork is pretty nice. I still feel there are a bit too many reused scenes, and too many times when the background was blank/just all black. It is an improvement from the previous episode though. I would rate it 7/10.\n\nOverall: I would rate it 7/10. Maybe it is because this is the second episode out of three episodes, but I feel nothing too significant happened, other than the introduction of the new character, Eleanor. The plot is still well done, tying up some loose ends from the previous episode. There are a lot more typos, and grammatical errors in this episode. I really hate how some of the names changed from the previous episode. I hope the developers fix the names and the typos/grammatical errors in the future.","October 24, 2015","true","11.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Isuna Hasekura's previous work, Spice & Wolf, revolves around trading. This time, WORLD END ECONOMiCA, revolves around Stocks and it's Market. I am amazed at how the author succinctly mixes different genres in this Visual Novel, much like Spice & Wolf.\n\nHowever, one should not compare Isuna Hasekura's Spice & Wolf and WORLD END ECONOMiCA, as the former is a Light Novel and the latter being a Visual Novel. Of course the manner of telling the story is significally different, as a Visual Novel introduces music and accompanying CG to maximize the tone of the current atmosphere and situation but with less words to further balance the narration of story by giving the personality to the CGs and sprites, while the words supply the story itself, unlike a Light Novel where the artworks are introduced at the start of reading, but it just introduces the setting and vibe of the story being told, with the descriptive narrative giving most of a Light Novel's shine. Nonetheless, one should not underestimate Isuna Hasekura, and one should know that the author would definitely give a story that is rich and fantastic.\n\nThis time, WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.02 gives more complex narrative and perfectly syncs the Stock Market into the different aspects of the story. This episode this time makes money seem very powerful, both for good and bad, which is awesome because it deviates from the generic sense that 'money is the root of all evil'.\n\n\n\nPROS:\n- The setting has been made more broad, which introduces many areas unknown to the first episode\n- The characters are mature than ever, which is an upgrade to their past personalities\n- New characters blend into the environment and atmosphere of the story\n- Character personalities are again, well-developed, and makes them stand out at each other.  Especially the Main Character this time. What an improvement\n- The Main Character's personality undergoes a drastic change. He is not the selfish and immature character that he was, however at a price (With what happened to him at the first episode, I wouldn't wonder).\n- Same soundtrack with that is refurbished and fixed this time, preventing the incorrectly looping that has occured in episode.01\n- The CGs are a vast improvement than the first episode\n- Length of the second Visual Novel is shorter than the first, but it's more complex and finely written\n-  Also made by Isuna Hasekura!\n\nCONS:\n- This is a sequel.  NOT READING THE FIRST VISUAL NOVEL WILL MAKE YOU VERY CONFUSED AND LOST . I suggest reading the first, or wait the third and the last one to be released, THEN reading all of them at the same time.\n- The explanation about Stocks this are  longer  and  more confusing . Again, I'd recommend everyone to have a very basic knowledge about Stocks,  and reading the first episode, obviously\n- The soundtracks are recycled (however looped correctly). This might not be a bad thing, but I'd wish a different soundtrack for the new areas.\n- Like the first episode, this Visual Novel does not yet support Steam Overlay, and its current engine does not yet support Achievements and Trading Cards (However, this will be also remedied later on)\n-  Sadly, there is AGAIN no Holo the Wisewolf\n-  ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING CLIFFHANGER!!! THIS TIME, IT'S MORE SEVERE!\n\n\n\nOverall, I would really recommend WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.02 along with episode.01. Please be reminded that there will be an update that makes it compatible with Steam Overlay, Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, though (Again, I'd advise you to wait for Sekai Project to release all the episodes, because then they would patch them to a different engine.) And this time, episode.02's story is a bit short, but that's based on how fast I read.\n\nHappy Stocking!","April 12","true","10.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

In the time between the main character has changed from the punk with attitude to a respectable young man who has learned his limits, and along with those changes he also learned how little he truly knew about the world back then. There is a clear schism between how this one plays out from the first. While the first episode felt fairly childish and cliched, falling back on common tropes a number of times, this one is focused on telling the more mature story the first one set up. The childish dreams were shattered, and in the place of those dreams the protagonist was forced by the world to mature. Not the arrogant "I'm more mature than you" mature that he was in the first, but legitimate personal growth. Because he was forced into that growth he was still not able to cope with his actions though, and the reader will get to see how that still affects him 4 years after the fact.\n\nIn this episode you can expect a few less walls of text attempting to inform the reader about stocks, and in the place of infodumps the reader is treated to a lot more character development and relationship building than the first. This isn't to say the infodumps that (fairly poorly) attempt to teach the reader about different aspects of the stock market don't exist, but rather that aspect of the storytelling has definitely been dialed down for the better.\n\nIn place of the explanations readers are instead treated with a continuation of the wonderful plot that started developing so wonderfully at the end of Episode 1 regarding all of the corruption going on. There are many victories and defeats for the protagonists along their journey and, the pacing of the ending picks up faster and faster leaving you begging for more as the credits roll just like the first one did. Unfortunately (fortunately?) the ending of this one leaves on a great cliffhanger (thankfully not wheelchairs and missing tsundere) that will have you waiting impatiently for the final episode to release.\n\nImprovements all around make this a must try for any fan of visual novels, but this is still WEE so if the first wasn't your fancy this probably won't catch your fancy either.\n\nOverall:\n8.5/10","August 25, 2015","true","12.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/368160/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","The second installment of WORLD END ECONOMiCA is an improvement over the first in almost every regard. The story picks up four years after the end of the first episode, and we're once again placed in appropriately renamed protagonist Haru's shoes. Where the first episode was in many ways a confrontation of Neoliberal logic and an educational piece about modern finance, the second episode is far more of a personal story, it's not quite about the vagaries of market logic and people's place within it as the first one was; instead, it is in many ways about living with guilt & regret, dealing with loss and what it means to struggle from a position of powerlessness.\n\nCompared to the first episode, the visuals in ep. 2 are better in every way - the character art in particular is much improved, especially in terms of proportions, and the backgrounds & CG scenes are well done and do a much better job of giving a more distinct feel to the sci-fi setting. In terms of sound and music, everything is still quite adequate (only adequate, mind you), but there could still be more variety & restraint in terms of music. Silence would have served the VN quite well in some moments. As for the story, it is, as expected, quite good: interesting and informative as always, and the emotional tone is something of a long slow burn, compared to the bipolar highs and lows and emotional gut punches of the first episode.\n\nAs before, I'd continue to recommend this series to its intended audience of political economy/anime nerds, as well as anyone else who might be interested. Really, the only black mark on this installment as compared to the first is a distinct and shocking absence of any autistic Jewish waifus.","October 11, 2015","true","10.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Multiple cities are under construction, and optimism is on an all time high. But behind the scenes the system is dysfunctional. The protagonist is working at a government office, uninterested in what the market is up to. But circumstances pull him back in the game, and he inevitably ends up investigating what’s really going on behind the scenes.\n\nA curious detail about the story is that it isn’t as futuristic as you might expect. It takes place on the moon, but the economic system appears to be on the same technological level as Earth today. This makes it easier to follow, as everything you learn in economics class it directly applicable to the plot. But as sci-fi it becomes a bit unbelievable that they wouldn’t have advanced to something well beyond this. Clearly a stylistic choice, which will make the story retro-futuristic in 5 years when our world leaves the game behind.\n\nI have a couple issues with game, one of the character relations is a bit too awkward. It felt like the author didn’t quite know what to do in some of the scenes, as the emotions come off flat, like an alien trying to describe human feelings. Thankfully toward the end those problems disappear, and the most important scenes are nailed. But before you get there, you’ll see someone’s eyes described as “beautiful” over five times. It gets a bit weird. On a positive note, everyone’s motives and wants are clearly defined. So even with the weaker parts, on the whole it does a good job at storytelling.\n\nI’ve seen people who feel Batman is outdated as a concept. Crimes today aren’t committed by gangs of goons robbing people on the street. World End Economica shows what modern crime is like. It all happens out of sight, and if you don’t look close enough it’s possible to believe it doesn’t exist. What I like most about it, is how it puts a human face on every party involved, both at the tops and bottoms of society, without losing sight of the main characters. The corporations committing fraud rationalize their actions by blaming the government, while they at the same time lobby to have the rules changed to allow even more corruption. There’s no need to physically hurt anyone to destroy them. Reputation is everything.\n\nThe episode is quite long, just like the first one, and it's well paced. Much time is spent painting a holistic image of the world it takes place in. On the way some characters get lost, as they seem to have no role in the story at all. But on the whole I had a great time, only noticing the obvious flaws after it was over. I’m looking forward to seeing how far it goes in the final episode, because here in episode 2 it sets it up for something big.","July 25, 2015","true","7.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

'Cause it's amazing. The game is full of references to the first game though, so if you haven't played or read that, you're probably going to be pretty lost for the first hour or so, upon which the information is reiterated so many times that you can probably piece together even if you didn't know that yes, there was a WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.1 even though this is episode.2. Really, if you've played one, then you might find the constant reminders irritating. I sure did after, what, the twentieth time?\n\nAnother minor complaint I have about this game is that the font has changed a lot from the first game. This is really personal preference, but I kinda found the bolded thick text less fitting to the game than the thin square text we had in the first version, plus the bolded text sometimes makes weird letters that's a bit irritating to read.\n\nApart from those two points, this was pretty much a perfect visual novel. The game takes a small bit of time to explain what happened after the first game, then jumps right into the plot. Dumps you into it, really. There's a bit of a slow period, which was kinda boring, but considering the circumstances it made sense. Somehow, the game makes you feel like the slow period ends up until the major plot stuff comes up and then you go "woah, when'd we get here?" Then it's just a straight shot all the way until the end of the game. Which, is at once both really, really good, and really, really nasty, since the ending is a huge cliffhanger. They didn't even wrap up the plotline they started in this episode!\n\nThe art is lovely, and since that's all you're going to be looking at for the entirety of the game, I think that's pretty important. The soundtrack was excellent as well, you listen to calming music for most of the game, right up to the last bit where everything just goes whoosh and the music also goes whoosh and it's beautiful and then boom credits\n\nYea, my main issue with this game is that it's a awful ♥♥♥♥ing cocktease and I swear the whole game was a conspiracy to make me start counting down the seconds until ep.3 is released.\n\nThough, there's European anime girls. You can never go wrong with European anime girls.","July 23, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

You've been warned.\n\nLike WEE1, this is a 'kinetic' visual novel, meaning no choices.  It takes place four years after the first game, with Hal (now translated as "Haru" for some reason, but whatever) trying to pick himself up from the ruins of his self-inflicted catastrophe from the last time we saw him.  Hagana is nowhere to be found, much to his chagrin--he's not over her by any means--but other familiar faces abound, along with some new faces who are well worth getting to know.\n\nWhat I loved about this game was the obvious growth in the characters.  Their decisions had consequences.  They changed a great deal not just from the first game, but over the course of this one.\n\nWEE2 is also better on the artistic front.  The backgrounds and character art are more detailed and polished, and there are fewer blank screens with only text.\n\nI won't spoil anything about the ending except to say that this is obviously the second part of a trilogy.  Don't expect anything to be resolved yet--you'll have to wait for WEE3 for that.\n\nBut it's well worth your time if you like stories about economics, society, and most of all lovable, flawed characters who try their best to overcome their foibles.","July 26, 2015","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A word of caution though, it might be better to hold off buying 1 and 2 right now; both cliff hangers are pretty emotionally taxing.

A well-balanced sequel about love, intrigue, introspection, and of course - economics!\n\nNew characters help the story progress forward in a new, broader direction, however Eleanor and her particular group all look quite striking compared to the overall art style of the novel. So much so that the novel itself pokes fun at said characters, but it's something you quickly get used to, due to how well-written they are, which helps them fit in immensely. Unfortunately, some new faces get a *lot* more face time than others, which is a shame considering how human all the other ones feel.\n\nThere are more places to visit on the lunar surface, but the lack of CG's in the first novel is compounded this time by the fact that, not only are there not enough of them still, but the ones that are there fail to stand up to the grandiose writing that describes these places. It's a bit jarring hearing a description of how truly massive the hotel in Clapton Square is, and actually seeing the single-CG they present to you. The novel still truly does suffer from what seems to be either a creative or budget issue in the art department.\n\nThe music score is expanded with some new tracks, most of them somber piano pieces which go with the game's now more grown-up, adult-ish theme. While they're good at setting up the mood, they sometimes unnecessarily bring it down for long periods of time. Some catchy tunes from the previous novel still make a comeback however.\n\nThe writing, like in the first novel, is what truly makes this one shine as well, so much so that it obfuscates everything else. This is not a bad thing: you're constantly left pondering about the emotional state of the characters (though this may be a bit overbearing by the end of the novel), and the intrigue that they're involved in at large. The one bad part of this is that you're no longer in the small-scale enviorment of the first novel, following the exploits of Hal as he tangles with the stock market. Part of the fun of the first novel was the scenes where Hal frantically performed trades and explained at the same time how he was doing them. The player could relate somewhat and experience the thrills Hal had at the time. This takes a backstep in the second novel - it's still present, but much less so, which is ultimately a bit dissapointing.\n\nIsuna Hasekura pulls another powerful story about economics, and throws in another engaging ending in as a bonus. A must-buy for fans of the first novel. Newcomers to the series are encouraged to purchase the first novel, as it is necessary reading to understand the second one.","July 29, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because this is probably just "a calm before the storm" (Which is episode 03), and there's this new interesting heroine that you shouldn't missed (  Eleanor   ).\n\nIn this Episode many things fixed, the art is very well-done compared to episode 01, more CGs, less typos, and less black screen.\n\nThe only regret now is that i have to wait for episode 03 to come out later in quartal 1 this year.\n\noh, the agony.","January 5","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Old characters are brought back (with the exception of Hagana) and are further fleshed out; new characters are introduced, the most important of which is Eleanor who faced a similar life-changing event as the protagonist in the years pre-dating the story.\n\nNo longer are there walls of text describing the inner workings of the stock trade that the first episode contains,though I found it rather enlightening. The story focuses mainly on the recuperation of the protagonist and how he gets introduced to and helps Eleanor in her mission of justice for her family business.\n\nDon't wanna give too much away, but if you liked the first episode you NEED to get this one. The story is shorter, but has enough bang for the buck to leave you satisfied. And the cliffhanger is nowhere near as frustrating as in Episode 1, this is a trilogy so there kinda has to be cliffhangers.\n\n10/10","January 6","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt drawn to the intensity of things in the Visual Novel - from its usual cold, calculating money-talk, to the very sparse burst of vehemently avid emotion. If you've gone through the first episode, you would somehow understand what I mean when I say that you're not captured by the emotions and that the series' selling point isn't any sort of feels; there are some, yes, but there's more to it than that - it's this grasping impact that you cant fully comprehend but can appreciate.\n\nIt is, by no means, an easy read if you intend to learn things about the stock market using this material (it covers newer concepts from the first episode), but at the same time this isn't one of those series that just uses a setting as a simple given; all the talk about flow of money and stocks, even if the finer aspects allude you, build the atmosphere and successfully convince you of the importance of the situation via its brevity and complexity.\n\nAs with the last one, I find myself rather unreasonably attached to the character and series, taking home a handful of wisdoms I already knew or heard from others but didnt sink in the same way as they did when it was told here. I can acknowledge that a very thinking-heavy novel might not be to everybody's taste, but I am very impressed by this series and would happily recommend it.","January 8","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A well-balanced sequel about love, intrigue, introspection, and of course - economics!\n\nNew characters help the story progress forward in a new, broader direction, however Eleanor and her particular group all look quite striking compared to the overall art style of the novel. So much so that the novel itself pokes fun at said characters, but it's something you quickly get used to, due to how well-written they are, which helps them fit in immensely. Unfortunately, some new faces get a *lot* more face time than others, which is a shame considering how human all the other ones feel.\n\nThere are more places to visit on the lunar surface, but the lack of CG's in the first novel is compounded this time by the fact that, not only are there not enough of them still, but the ones that are there fail to stand up to the grandiose writing that describes these places. It's a bit jarring hearing a description of how truly massive the hotel in Clapton Square is, and actually seeing the single-CG they present to you. The novel still truly does suffer from what seems to be either a creative or budget issue in the art department.\n\nThe music score is expanded with some new tracks, most of them somber piano pieces which go with the game's now more grown-up, adult-ish theme. While they're good at setting up the mood, they sometimes unnecessarily bring it down for long periods of time. Some catchy tunes from the previous novel still make a comeback however.\n\nThe writing, like in the first novel, is what truly makes this one shine as well, so much so that it obfuscates everything else. This is not a bad thing: you're constantly left pondering about the emotional state of the characters (though this may be a bit overbearing by the end of the novel), and the intrigue that they're involved in at large. The one bad part of this is that you're no longer in the small-scale enviorment of the first novel, following the exploits of Hal as he tangles with the stock market. Part of the fun of the first novel was the scenes where Hal frantically performed trades and explained at the same time how he was doing them. The player could relate somewhat and experience the thrills Hal had at the time. This takes a backstep in the second novel - it's still present, but much less so, which is ultimately a bit dissapointing.\n\nIsuna Hasekura pulls another powerful story about economics, and throws in another engaging ending in as a bonus. A must-buy for fans of the first novel. Newcomers to the series are encouraged to purchase the first novel, as it is necessary reading to understand the second one.","July 29, 2015","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having completed Episode 1 and really enjoying that, there are a few minor concerns but nothing that can't easily be fixed for the next game update.\n\nFirstly I really think there should be consistency between the 2 episodes on the spelling of character names when translated from Japanese. Too many characters names have changed in spelling (Hal->Haru, Lisa->Risa, Serault->Cerrow) that it has become distracting. please update at least one of the episodes to be consistent with the other.\n\nSecondly Please do a spell-check of the text/dialogue I've noticed a few minor spelling mistakes along the way.\n\nOtherwise these two episodes so far are the first visual novels I've played. I've been really impressed with the story and some of the conversations made me laugh quite a bit. The moral dilemas and consequences of people's actions in this environment have a very strong and important message about the good and bad things about the world of finance and investing today. Finance and Investing are not things I've ever been interested in until I read and watched Spice & Wolf, these worlds that look at economics as a way to tell stories with strong characters have been an absolute treasure.\n\nThank you Isuna Hasekura for these wonderful stories if you ever read this review!","October 2, 2015","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The engine has faced some improvements with font choice and text log (not rewinding as in the previous episode).\n\nIt continues four years after the events of the first episode. Stock trading takes more of a backseat this time around and while the world of economics is still the backdrop, more focus is had on the characters and their struggles.
