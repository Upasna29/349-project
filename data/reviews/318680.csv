It is a nice little treat if you look for a new adventure.\n\nThe story is set in Paris, following smart ♥♥♥ Remy on the trail of the notorious alchemist Nicolas Flamel which somewhat evoked an appetite to dig more into the topic of who Flamel really was. The lovely crafted setting is an interesting mix of fancyful set-ups, French-styled cafés, buildings and dungeons to crack your head over puzzles and solve the mystery of the inherited diary.","December 15, 2015","true","5.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
