When my grandfather passed away a few years ago I’d have expected tears, depression, the sort of symptoms you see in others that seem required to properly grieve. They didn’t come to me, or at least not how I would have assumed them to. There was just this feeling of something suddenly missing, having been taken away with no way to get it back. I found myself more angry than sad, wondering if that made me a bad person and then getting more angry of myself as a result.\n\nWhen my pets died growing up it was often my family that appeared more upset than myself, as I sat in solitude trying to block out the realities of the world with easy distractions. At the time I didn’t know what I was supposed to do with myself, failing to find the emotions others were clearly expressing in myself, like I was somehow defective or simply didn’t care about the person or animal that had disappeared from my life as much as I thought I did. It’s terrifying and disorienting, maybe more so than if I had just been able to open up and bawl my eyes out like everyone else.\n\nI didn’t expect to see this part of me in Gravity Ghost, or in any game for that matter. It’s a surreal space platformer, full of interesting mechanics, gorgeous artwork and a masterful soundtrack, but it’s the side of it that it never told you about that hit me like a train into a brick wall.\n\nFlying through the stars and landing on planets, you become wrapped up in a world full of analogies to one less abstract and impossible; a lighthearted blanket over the much more real and unfair reality underneath. Seeing this story unfold is a slow series of vignettes, often out of order and incomprehensible by themselves, asking you to draw the lines and outline the narrative underneath.\n\nWhen Gravity Ghost finally comes into focus it does so with alarming emotion and sincerity. It isn’t trying to manipulate you into feeling the way its characters do, it manages that by writing them as human and flawed the way we all are. Characters reactions and dialogues with and between each other are awkward and raw, but in a way that connected with me the way a articulated, perfectly timed script couldn’t have. People often aren’t eloquent, or tactful, and Gravity Ghost presents that side of us that often comes out during times of grief in a way that really resonated with me.\n\nGravity Ghost is a great game, certainly a more mechanically robust and sophisticated one than I would have expected, and you could play it for that side and come away impressed. You could play it because it’s beautiful and inspired, bursting with creativity and this sort of creepy but endearing sensibility to its extraterrestrial character designs. Or you could play it for its most unexpected and impressive side: a narrative that’s struck me emotional for what it was, and for how it managed to show that this part of me I’d chosen to ignore wasn’t something I needed to feel ashamed about. I’m not sure what Gravity Ghost will be for others who play it, but if it has anywhere near the same effect on them as it did me, that’s something worth experiencing however it might manifest.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 26, 2015","true","2.8"," 224 of 239 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","224","239","8","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/251490/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account","Gravity ghosts is a 2D long hair terraforming ghost girl star collector  simulator! The game can be completed under an hour in a speedrun however a normal run will probably take around 2-4 hours depending on how slow you go through all the content.\n\nStory\n+Saving pets bring out memories\n\nThe story follows a ghost girl collecting stars in the sky looking for not only her memories but how to help those in her past. Along her adventures she will meet many guardians who will challenge her for the planet cores. Upon returning the cores to the black hole thats formed in the middle of the galaxy, the planets will be return suspended in cryostasis state until terraformed by her powers.\n\nThe story was interesting to see unfold as the series of events clashed since I did it somewhat out of order though I was still able to grasp what happened, I redid all the memories at the main hub to fully comprehend the story. None of the characters were the typical good/bad types but rather humans who were trying to live their lives by their own accord. Collecting the memories was really worthwhile especially to grasp a better understanding of what was going on..\n\nProgression\n+Stars unlock doors, levels, and branches\n+Each branch requires only the power achieved within it\n+Heart levels give abilities to your character\n\nThe stars are the main way of progressing through the game. Once you start getting stars you will notice the dotted lines on the map becomes solid which means you can proceed onto the next level. The branches have optional ways to proceed, which results in the ability to miss abilities that could help, or memories to explain more of the backstory.\n\nNote: Only the planet cores are necessary to beat the game.\n\nHeart levels give abilities that are helpful in proceeding through levels with ease. The abilities range from being able to jump higher, making you weigh more, being able to float higher in the air, becoming immaterial, and having the ability to terraform without using hair. These abilities have a variety of uses throughout the levels and will generally be helpful.\n\nThe immaterial ability for example makes it possible to phase through planets, which helps get to a star or exist when normally blocked by other planets that you gravitate towards.\n\nHub\n+Gather all the planet cores/activate them\n+Memories can be replayed\n\nBringing back the planet cores earned from the guardians, to the black hole rebuilds the planet in a chronic state that requires you to use a certain element in order to awaken it. This element required is the same one you earned within the branch you also got the core from.\n\nThe memories unlocked can be replayed anytime in the hub area simply by interacting with the animals that are on the floating asteroids. Keep in mind there is normally 2 of them per location so if you happen to be missing any of them they should be indicated on the map with a skeleton.\n\nMechanics\n+Gravity between planets depends on terraform\n+Hair is used to terraform\n\nThe physics on the planets is pretty well done considering that there is a variety of effects you can achieve through changing the terraform of the planet. For example changing a planet to the extremely hot type will make you propelled further from it.\n\nPlaying around with terraforming is a great way to learn how to grab stars though its not necessary for the most part if you have been collecting those power abilities for your character.\n\nCollecting leafs will make your hair grow which is used to not only carry animal spirits but to terraform planets. Running out of hair makes you unable to terraform however you can go back and collect more leafs from any level since they respawn. This I thought would be useful until later on where I had the ability  to terraform without consuming hair than I completely ignored leafs altogether.\n\nThe game has some elements of a puzzle game however it felt more like playing a game purely for the atmosphere attributes and having fun with the terraforming abilities of your character when fight against gravity in order to succeed. I found myself enjoying the race against the clock the second time I played the game in order to try and get the achievement for beating it under 50 minutes. Sadly, I failed quite miserably but felt like I enjoyed my time and will attempt it again in the future.\n\nSoundtrack\nWhen first opening the game I noticed how good the soundtrack was when it went from the tick tocking of the night to a more tranquil space outwardly feel. The game features a soundtrack that ranges from indian music to space which is a nice mix of both the background of the character and the current situation she found herself in.\n\nArt\nThe game’s appearance story wise feels like a old style pop up book especially with the animations of the mouth. The voice acting I thought could be better however the overall presentation was pleasant. During the gameplay itself I enjoyed the surreal mix of indian and space appearance you took as a ghost the mix was somewhat comical but effective.\n\nConclusion\nI always thought what if Orbital Gear decided to take its gravity components and focus strictly on single player experience and I got my answer. A well made puzzle space game going through a journey and tale of a girl’s memories with mechanics that expand the experience that gravity has to offer.","January 28, 2015","true","11.4"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","30","32","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/251490/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","In each of the far corners of this dreamlike galaxy are the spirits of guardian animals, whimsical creatures that seem close and sentimental to a wandering soul of a young girl who explores ceaselessly through the cosmos. Floating between planets with the most graceful elegance and encountering this realm's many colorful entities, each with their own history and past of mysteries for the playful space girl to discover.\n\nEach node on our galactic map presents the player with a single stage of different planetary arrangements, some solid, some bouncy, some composed of water for you to splash through to the other side. Each maze of differently sized planet obstacles hides one shining yellow star to obtain and bring to the exit through skillful navigation and manipulation of gravity. Different plots on the sprawling and sparkling map hold the key to important elemental powers allowing you to become light as a feather and floating at a consistent level or heavy as a rock and plummeting towards the surface of a nearby planet. Successfully harnessing the power of these natural elements guides you easily through the galaxy.\n\nAll forms of inventive mechanics are slowly brought into play as the stages progress and they seem to add just as much to the colorful and calming visual appeal as they do the fluid feel of playing, from expanding circles of light that expand as you coast around their radius revealing new items to elegant clockwork puzzles of complex moving gears.\n\nGravity Ghost strikes just the perfect balance of visual wonder with fresh interactivity to keep your mind, heart, and fingers all equally busy. Some levels will test your reflexes and your accuracy with concentrated shots into clusters of small planets to reach that one important star, whereas other levels feel more relaxing in nature and entice the player into losing themselves in the flow of gravity and take in the sights and sounds.\n\nThe deeper you go and the more you clear, the more stars light up the interconnected galaxy and awaken the spirit animals whom reside in each of its corners. As you complete each level and free each lost animal spirit the pathways behind you glow radiantly until eventually the entire map is alive with the twinkling of stars signifying your completed trail. The sense of satisfaction from watching your cold unlit surroundings resurrect from the ashes into a beautiful booming system of lights is a most euphoric reward.\n\nScattered throughout each of the different systems belonging to a different animal spirit are the skeletal remnants of the once magnificent beings, and its your task to connect the wandering spirit with its earthly remains. You can then lead these now free spirits back to the center Blackhole hub where they stay giving life and color back to the galaxy, reminding us that death is not just a gloomy end but a hopeful start of new beginnings.\n\nGravity Ghost is clearly a game made by the free-spirited for the free-spirited, a potpourri of concepts so lighthearted anyone of any age or background could enjoy. You'll glide around effortlessly to the flow of gravity,  terraforming colorful planets to your liking and collecting bits of star to grow cosmically charged hair. Gather the remains of your spirit animals to reignite their creative energies in order to soar into the cosmos with new found powers.\n\nThe space-y and emotional atmosphere given by the music is strongly evocative of the sound in FTL, and if you were a fan of Ben Prunty's masterful soundtrack there you are in for a serious treat with the sounds of Gravity Ghost. Prunty has really outdone himself with the soundtrack and I feel like I can hear his growth as a musician into different styles since past works. We are treated with a much wider range of sounds and instrumentation beyond just the synth-y soundscapes, with natural elements presented from the strings of guitar painting colorful melody across this galactic landscape. This evolution in his style makes me insanely excited to see where his music is headed in the future.\n\nDespite the lack of any real threat, the lack of challenges or the prospect of death I was still heavily drawn into the gameplay in a way no other game of casual nature has hooked me. It could be the fantastically vibrant and psychedelic visions of a spiritual and magical Outer Space, or the fact that instead of the usual throwaway plots of casual games have been replaced with a deep and effective story containing rich characters ranging from the comedic to the downright tragic.\n\ntldr;\n\nForget brain eating zombies, forget lazer-blasting spaceships or epic boss battles. Gravity Ghost is a game that shines in areas where gaming should be all about to begin with; free-spirited fun with the freedom and expression of imagination. It's a display of pure creativity and has the power to stir powerful levels of said imagination in those who hold it.","March 1, 2015","true","10.2"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","31","34","4","3"

Going to talking about the game\n\nThe look and sound of the game reminds me of some shows (or a show) from Nickelodeon that I watched when I was a kid, and to me that's honesty kind of neat and I really like it. The voice acting, while some might find it in the low quality area, I find it extremely lovely, same with the art, same with the story.\n\nSpeaking of story, it's a simple one. It riles up a few emotions, but the most apparent ones were happiness and sadness. While the story is nice, it's not good at story telling, at least in the begging. I had a hard time trying to know what the story was almost half of the game, not until later on that I started to put pieces together and sort of figured it out, but once everything was sort of clear, I was happy with it and loved how it progressed and ended.\n\nThe gameplay is just straight out simple and fun, but not empty though. It's filled with a loads of levels to finish, and as you jump around from planet to planet, collecting stars to move on to the next level, the game gets more complex, and it also gives you new power to to help you finish levels, like the ability to stay afloat, or drop like a big boulder, dashing..etc, with other power that's connected to your hair in which you change the type of planet like from a water-based planet to an ice-based one, with each type of planet having their own unique passive ability that would affect you while you progress through levels.\n\nAlso, the music is great, filled with a sort of mystic and wondrous vibe to it, fitting nicely with the games setting, image, and with how it plays. Worth a listen and worth to be liked. At least I liked it.\n\nI didn't really have this game in mind until I was given the opportunity to get it and check it out, and after playing through it, finishing it, I was really happy that I did get the chance to play it. It's a wonderful game that's simple, relaxing, and oozing with charm. It looks great, plays great, and the story hits you right in the feels. Would definitely recommend Gravity Ghost to those who want to take a step back from all the complexities and the action-packed games that we get so much of.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","January 26, 2015","true","2.0"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","24","31","5","0"

This is great stuff.\n\nGravity Ghost is a "gravity hopper." Your character manuevers around in the gravity fields of systems of planets/asteroids. Your character gets more agile as the game progresses and can start to change the properties of the planets, while the tasks you have to accomplish in each system grow more complicated. The difficulty curve is quite smooth and gentle so far, at least for me. Plus there's no failure, you can keep trying until you get something right. You could even skip some levels, although you may miss story elements and/or achievements on that playthrough if you do. The core gameplay is fun, flying around with an extremely agile character that needs every bit of it at times.\n\nThe visuals are 2D with a very colorful hand drawn look. I like it a lot. You can easily judge for yourself from all the screenies around. The soundtrack is great imo. The script doesn't really lend itself to standout voice performances, but they're quite solid. And the story has been quite interesting so far, pieced together from scenes earned by doing clearly indicated stages. Plus the game just drips with atmosphere and cute factor.\n\nFor achievements, there are some that will almost certainly require extra playthrough(s) with a different pattern of collecting items. Plus there's a 50 minute speedrun that may be pretty difficult. Nothing broken or ridiculous though, and I don't consider extra playthroughs of this a problem. :)\n\nIn short, plenty of pros, no real cons to speak of. A very easy recommend. I'll leave the price point to buy at as an exercise for the reader, but it's a buy for sure.","January 28, 2015","true","4.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","1"

Even once you complete the game, there's still more ways you can challenge yourself, especially with a certain achievement, meaning you'll be going back to play this a few times.

The game follows a young girl named Iona as she traverses the cosmos to piece together memories that will ultimately tell her story. Gameplay revolves around (ha ha) making the most of Iona's ever-expanding control over the physical rules of the world. Some examples of her powers include becoming more massive to fall faster or becoming incorporeal to pass through objects. She also learns "terraforming" abilities that allow her to change the properties of the planetary bodies that form most of the game world.\n\nJust like the game, the story is a mix of whimsy and challenges, this time in the form of human interaction between Iona's family unit. The characters are voiced by several indie darlings such as Ashly Burch and Logan Cunningham. The story is told in snippets so at first it can be difficult to even understand the relationships between the characters. However, as you learn who they are and how they relate to Iona, you realize their connection to her celestial journey. The game's music is also noteworthy, as it is the work of Ben Prunty, the man responsible for the excellent FTL score. You can expect the same lonely and beautiful music in Gravity Ghost.\n\nI finished this game in one sitting (I clocked about 4 hours for 10% completion) so the game doesn't outstay it's welcome. The rate at which Iona gains new powers and abilities kept me completely hooked the entire time. I won't claim the story is mindblowing, but it is a touching tale of family and the way we, like the planets circling our star, have an invisible force keeping us together. I recommend it highly to fans of whimsical, innovative indie titles.","January 30, 2015","true","2.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

From the colourful, dreamlike hand-painted visuals, to the zany and meditative soundtrack; from the strange and peculiar worlds and creatures, to the dreamy child fantasy story; from the smooth animations to the interesting visual effects; and from the often seemingly offbeat voice-acting and narration to the carefree sensation of floating around in space, Gravity Ghost oozes with charm and is a product that is quite clearly crafted with love.\n\nIt may not be for everyone though. The game is pretty accessible in the sense that there is not much of a challenge aside from getting to grips as to how the gravity works, and it is kinda short (around 2-3 hours long), but neither of these detracts from the experience in my opinion.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, and I love it, but I can clearly see how this will also not be to everyone's liking. If you like charming indie games that are creative, and place more of an emphasis on the atmosphere and the experience of playing it, then you should get this.

I've been in the beta for the last week since buying in on this project in the early days. I mostly ignored development other than to catch a vid here or there, and thought it still looked like fun when it would be released.\n\nI was not prepared for how polished and fun the final product ended up.\n\nThe game is divided into a few-minutes-long levels on a mario-map style board. The wonderful teach-by-playing mechanic mean the game's pacing and introduction of new power-ups and gameplay elements is steady, while still allowing you to fully explore all the new mechanics by going for every bit of hair-growing flowers you can nab.\n\nThe art is just breathtakingly beautiful, and a lot of care went into making everything visually inuitive, from the colors and contrast, to the iconography (all relevant moving elements of a given board leave a motion trail behind them, so watching, learning and planning your jumps is a must if you want to proceed quickly!).\n\nPast that, the game is just chill as hell and FUN, with the goals being clearly articulated, but without the annoyance of death (you've been there, done that) or arbitrary "starting overs". Just enjoy the gravity, the superb voices, and the perfectly appropriate soundtrack. The sound design, while simple, works wonderfully and you will not tire of the effects the game uses.\n\nIntercut with the gameplay and gathering stars and elements and reuniting animal spirits with their bodies are wistful memories of the Ghost's past life, which have been beautifully drawn, and continue to give me a good laugh every time they show up.\n\nBut seriously, all you need to know is that you get to hug spirit animals and welcome them to the afterlife, and orient them to what life is like when you no longer have to poop anymore.\n\nJust fantastic.","January 26, 2015","true","1.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

Its gravity system should be familiar to anyone who's played Mario Galaxy or Kerbal Space Program, just much more simpler than the latter and more focused on puzzle solving.  The difficulty curve is well thought out, and while the game never gets frustratingly difficult, neither is it an easy unchallenging slog.  It's a game that you'll definitely want to play through more than once.\n\nThe story of the game ranges from cute, to silly, to quite melancholy at times, and the overall tone of the game is really on point.  It's rare that a smaller indie game actually has a well-written script.  The voice acting is wonderful, everyone sounds like real people, not wacky cartoon characters or untrained interns.  The voice actors themselves are very expressive and emotive in the few voiced cutscenes, and the animation expresses just as much when the script calls for silence.

The game has a strong visual aesthetic that seemingly uses southwestern USA influences (Pueblo?) that draws your attention but never distracts from the gameplay at hand. It's complemented by a haunting sound track that's not depressing, but fits the themes that the game is going for. The gameplay can be entertaining and frustrating at the same time: it definitely opens up once you get the float/dive mechanics to get more control over your character, and the use of both of those mechanics to whip yourself around the planets can be good old fashioned fun: even if it may have frustration for some precision you will need. It's a game that won't wow you on gameplay, but will wow you on charm instead, and it's a shame that the game was exploited in terms of scammers/people posing as youtubers (in a black market key investigation), because the game is a memorable one that may stick with those that have had people in their lives recently pass on. It's definitely worth picking up if you like stories with heart, and want some gameplay to boot.\n\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review (part of a collection video): https://youtu.be/mZnKPYCM5nk?t=598\n\nLists:\n+:\nA touching story about loss and acceptance that pulls on the heartstrings. Good writing and voice acting helps to set the mood, but it's also not overly sappy as well.\nStrong visual aesthetic that is unlike a lot of games out there. Has a child like feel to it and yet hits some heavy themes, but strong use of color is what stands out here.\nA haunting soundtrack that fits the themes here, and yet isn't depressing surprisingly. Feels appropriate at every turn.\nCore gravity mechanics are fun to just whip yourself around with not a care in the world. I'd make a joke about whipping your hair back and forth here, but let's be honest that meme is dead.\nHonestly, it's one of those things where you may not make any progress in game, but you can have the time of your life just floating around the map.\nGood addition of alternate mechanics like terraforming that are introduced at the right time to keep gameplay fresh.\nIt deserves mention that the developers seemed to have their hearts in the right place with the initial offer of a copy for friends, and even though they were scammed and hurt by people wanting to make a profit, still kept a positive outlook on things.\n-:\nDo wish there was a timer to register how fast you could do a level. It does have a skill element that has me which for leaderboard functionality, for once.\nWhen re-recording this, wish there was a easy way to record cutscenes.

It's a very unique take on the genre that has a ton of charm and wonder.\n\nEach stage you visit functions as it's own puzzle that will feature various gravity and physics based problems. You'll be going through stage to stage, unlocking stars, spirit animals, and an assortment of items and special powers. As you unlock more areas and gain new powers the story will start to unfold. Though it could be argued that Gravity Ghost is "arcady" at it's core, it does manage to tell an interesting narrative, which is something "arcady" games tend to lack.\n\nThe Puzzle like stages of Gravity ghost are mostly well designed, and offers a higher than expected degree of variety. When I first started this game I expected the game to get repetitive the more I play, but was surprised by how creative the developers were in designing each area. Though many stages will have repeating mechanics, they're offered in interesting and often unexpected ways to solve a puzzle. The puzzles them selves are very accessible as I never found myself stuck for too long, but still satisfied when I manage to solve it. The puzzles are well designed, and creative too.\n\nArtistically, Gravity Ghost shows an almost crayon child's drawing presentation. It's whimsical,and very easy on the eyes. It's one of the game's most attractive qualities and has the audio to match. Gravity ghost is a lot of eye candy, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nThough the game has a ton of potential, and I can safely say I've enjoyed my time with it, it's still not perfect. Gravity Ghost comes with the main campaign and that's about it. There's no bonus features, extra modes, or even a very good options and settings menu.\n\nOverall Gravity Ghost is a fun light romp, with a ton of charm. It's probably not going to appeal to those who is looking to meta-game and min-max, or twitch their way to victory, but for any one who is looking for a more easy going experience in their gaming Gravity Ghost would be a pretty good choice.\n\nPros:\n- Wonderful art and music\n- Good use of physics based puzzles\n- Inventive puzzle design\n- Very accessible\n\nCons:\n- Lacks features and options\n- Might be considered too "casual" for some","January 26, 2015","true","1.6"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Thematically it's about the afterlife, which becomes more and more apparent the further you progress into the game.\n\nYou can find the video review here: http://youtu.be/RqihY8BjYgg\n\nLet's first look at the game mechnaics: Ingame you can float around in space trying to collect whatever happens to open the door in the level and you go through the door, that's basically it.\nLooking at the game from this standpoint though sells it definitly short. The game is not here to be beaten fast or efficient. It's here to embrace you in it's world and environment.\nAnd when you let the game do that you get the full experience out of it, at least in my opinion.\n\nEven though the game has a set goal each level, it gives you the feeling that you are completely free to do whatever you want.\nAnd It felt wonderful to be free. I roamed around in a level for quite some time and it felt like no time has passed at all.\nWhat might help the game in that regard is the soundtrack, which is phenominal and composed by Ben Prunty, who some people might know from FTL: Faster than Light.\n\nBefore coming to a conclusion I'd like to repeat the point I've mentioned earlier.\nIf you are consantly focused on the objective and cannot let go of that mindset this game is not for you.\nI have taken myself quite a lot of time in some levels and completed all levels in about 3 hours.\nThat is also the only concern I can see for some people coming up, which is that the game is too short for the 15€ pricetag.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, you should not take length too much into consideration. Especially when the experience itself is of such high quality that I simply have to recommend this game.\nAnd I'd recommend to pick it up, download it, shut your doors, turn off your phone and internet connection and simply take some time and enjoy the game.","January 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","14","24","2","0"

You can get through most of the game just using basic movement, and that seems like a waste. The controls are pretty tight once you get used to the gravity wackiness, but the game lacks a sense of accomplishment that other platformer/puzzle games have.\n\nOutside of the gameplay, the story is excellent in some ways but not so much in others. Cutscenes don't really look quite right as they have really stilted and sometimes glitchy animation and voices don't always match character models. The art is quite nice overall, but when the cutscenes zoom in its easy to focus on all of the flaws in how the characters move. This is a really big con because a lot of the dramatic scenes don't hit near as hard as they should due to how wrong the cutscenes look. The voice acting is also hit or miss: some performances shine including the main character, Iona, while others have sound quality issues and just don't sound quite right. In-game, all of Iona's dialog and interactions with the animal guardians are touching and/or hilarious, it made me really want to get to the next guardian to see what's up. For all its flaws, the story did move me when it really needed to especially in the end.\n\nDespite how negative I sound here, I really appreciated what this game is and would still recommend it to those looking for a mellow platformer with a decent story. Just be mindful of what you are getting and split the cost with someone (you get a giftable copy when you buy it).","January 31, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morecake/recommended/251490/","morecake","ckjs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morecake/","238 products in account","Overview\nGravity Ghost is a physics based puzzle game. Very family friendly and\nchallenging (at times), you're likely to enjoy this game as much as the younger\nones in the family are.\n\nStory\nGravity Ghost is based around Iona (voiced by Ashly Burch of "Hey Ash, Whatcha\nPlayin?" and Tiny Tina of Borderlands 2), who, due to some tragic circumstances, is now a ghost.\n\nShe's off to find her BFF fox in the cosmos, piecing together the puzzle of her\nown death and filling in the blanks of her family and past.\n\nThe story itself is non-linear (you get pieces of it after finishing certain areas of the star map) and the bulk of it is told through animated cutscenes.\n\nMy only (mild) dislike of the game is here: There is a very disconnected art style between the cutscenes and game that some may find off-putting enough that it takes away from the experience. In retrospect, the story and its gravity (ha) still comes through, just not as fluidly as i'd like.\n\nGameplay\nBasic gameplay consists of: "How do I get out of this place that I voluntarily\ngot myself into?" -- to which the answer (mostly) is: Get the star! And get to the door!\n\nTo do this, Iona can terraform planets into different elements/properties (think: water,\nearth, fire, bouncy) and use her different abilities (often being gliding and juking).\n\nAlthough there isn't a boss level, or enemy in Gravity Ghost, pain comes from gravity. Iona never quite floats freely in space -- she's usually stuck to a planet or close to sticking to an object of some sort. This makes for intense gameplay when you're trying to grab that star that only comes around every other three seconds.\n\nThe maps themselves are creative with varied art styles, with some requiring\nspeed, timing and precision. Others require you to stop and use your wits. Guardian levels are often on a whole 'nother dimension of their own.\n\neh?\nOverall, Gravity Ghost is a relatively fun and fulfilling indie game. If you want a break from\nshoot-em-up look-at-my-score games and AAA titles, give this a try for something different. It probably isn't for everyone, and you'll have to grit your teeth at any flaws you perceive, but you won't know if you don't try.\n\nAlso, Erin Robinson and company probably like eating and keeping the lights on.\n\nSoundtrack\nWorth mentioning with Gravity Ghost is the soundtrack. Upbeat at times, cool and collected in others, it makes the game simply more enjoyable to play. It's available as a separate download and was composed by Ben Prunty, who also composed the FTL: Faster Than Light soundtrack.","February 25, 2015","true","6.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Colourful and vibrant, drawn with what looks like a mixture of pastel and crayons, the artstyle immediately stands out. You're greeted by a young girl and her fox companion resting on top of a planet before the fox slowly disappears into the cosmos while the girl beckons for him. You play as Iona, who realizes that a black hole has appeared in the center of her universe where she can see her friends and family back on earth.\n\nAt its core, Gravity Ghost is a tale of innocence. How children have boundless freedom without the constraints of consequences weighing on their minds. Iona was a rambunctious child, who befriended a wild fox, takes long journeys in the middle of the nights with no regard for her sister Hickory, who gave up her future to take care of the family after the tragic death of their parents. Iona throws blames to those who care for her, desperately trying to hide her pain, acting out in ways that hurt her loved ones. As you watch through the wonderfully drawn cutscenes, it conveys to you memories that all adults can relate to through their childhood. Newfound emotions and how much they can impact a child for the rest of their life. Gravity Ghost does this with such relative ease that it can make you forget that Iona is just a drawing on a screen, as well drawn as it may be.\n\nGameplay consists of physics based puzzle platforming where you control Iona flying through space and navigating past all different kinds of planets that affect the push and pulls of gravity while dancing back and forth like clockwork. Each level has a star piece that lets you complete the level, how you decide to grab the star piece is all up to you. This is where the game holds most of it's charm as you fly around in limbo, there are no deaths to be had here, no frustrating moments, just a zenlike experience that's as relaxing as it is soothing with it's wonderfully crafted soundtrack reminiscent of the composer's work on FTL crossed with the childlike joy of Yann Tiersen's earlier work.\n\nAs you travel through star systems, through the overview of the map the game uses it's artstyle with small markers to clue you in on levels that will progress the storyline or add to the mechanics that Iona can use to alter gravity. Iona can find spirit animals scattered throughout the galaxy and it's only with her help that they can return to their bodies and find the peace to move on. Anytime you help an animal move on to the afterlife, a cutscene is shown depicting life when Iona was still on earth with her family. These cutscenes slowly reveal the circumstances that lead to Iona becoming a ghostly spirit alone in space. Iona contemplates these unlocked memories and laments over past actions and words that she now regrets. It's the Guardian Spirits who guide her forward, each spirit being a representation of a loved one in her past life.\n\nIona gains the ability to terraform planets by finding different elements unlocked through solving labyrinth puzzles. Terraforming planets changes the gravitational pull depending on the element. Fiery gas planets are explosive, pushing you up and away like a volcano and hesitate to pull you in. Water planets allow you to swim within its atmosphere and have a heavy pull making it hard for you to leave it's atmosphere with no momentum. There are seven elements in total, each with it's own unique gameplay element and giving you the opportunity to use any of them as you see fit to complete a level.\n\nGravity Ghost is refreshing and a breath of fresh air in a medium where killing zombies reigns supreme. In Gravity Ghost, failure isn't a gameplay mechanic, giving you the liberty and freedom to take your time and play with the levels as long as you'd like. It's the signature music that really drives the experience that you are child in awe of your surroundings. Her surroundings are playful and vibrant just like her imagination, allowing you to see through her eyes as if they were your own. Iona's tale is emotional, a cry for help in the endless vastness of space but in the end she finds her place in the cosmos. I highly recommend Gravity Ghost to players of all ages and experience, every purchase nets you two copies for yourself and a friend so you can share and enjoy!","February 23","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After each stage/level/room, the game returns to the main map, Unfortunately, when it does so, the camera always starts oriented "north" on the topmost part of the map, and then quickly pans and rotates to your current position.

Gorgeous hand-drawn graphics, excellent narration, a solid story and responsive gravity based planet-navigating puzzling, there is a lot to like here.\n\nThe game follows Iona (voiced, as are several other characters, by the amazing Ashly Burch) as she traverses a galaxy in ghost form, solving puzzles, terraforming planets, reuniting animal spirits with their skeletal remains and eventually gathering the parts of her world that were scattered around the different branches of the galaxy.\n\nThere is a lot more depth to the story, which is primarily revealed in flashbacks, and what is there is still excellent.

Took me about 2.5 hours and I assume the game is basically in a finished state since it's so close to the release date.\n\nAnyways, this game is an amazingly beautiful physics-platformer that is a lot like a 2D Super Mario Galaxy. Great music, an interesting story, and fantastic gameplay. Difficulty-wise, it's extremely easy - don't expect to have any trouble except for one or two levels. In addition, the game's only 2.5 hours long, and I beat all of the levels (didn't collect all of the flowers though since those don't seem to be tracked anywhere). If they added the ability to include custom levels (as well as restrict your powers within those levels), this would just about be the platformer of the year.\n\nThe main criticism I have with this game is its difficulty. It is extremely easy throughout. What should be levels of increasing difficulty are made easier by powerups that are basically unlockable cheats. The game would be way better if those powers were disabled throughout and only unlockable after you beat the game. The game also makes you think that you'll need to manage your energy (hair), which is used up when you transform planets, but the flowers that replenish it are abundant, and the cheat-powers make it so you never need to terraform after you get one of them. Basically, the game needs to be harder.\n\nAside from that, it's a really enjoyable romp through space. You never fight any enemies or encounter hazards that would make you restart the level, but that's not a problem - the game would feel weirder with enemies. The atmosphere of the game reminds me of Endless Ocean and games of its type. It's relaxing and the story is interesting enough to keep you playing.\n\nThe voice acting isn't the best, but that's definitely a problem with the director, microphone, and post-processing rather than the voice actors. It doesn't detract horribly from the game. What does detract from the game is the random 6-year-old-level silliness in the dialogue - it feels unnatural. This is one of the few games I would say desperately needs to take itself more seriously rather than less so.\n\nDespite that criticism, I had a huge amount of fun with the game. With support for user-created content, it would definitely be at the top of my list of platformers on Steam.\n\nEDIT: I would like to revise my criticism - upon further reflection, the voice actors really did do a good job. Most of the writing is also fantastic; it's just a couple random bits which seem a bit out of place (not really a pattern).","January 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For me, it did this exceedingly well where I would call it a classic. Just like the story, the game is simple, but it evolves the complexity as subtle and elegant. Tie that together with an amazing yet soothing soundtrack, and it instantly becomes a top game of the year contender of 2015 for me.\n\n\nAt first glance, I was unsure what the target demographic was for the story. After I played a few more cut-scenes, I quickly threw the "Just for kids" assumption out the window. If I were to compare it to something, I would probably say the narrative is most relatable to a good fairy tale in a clever and compelling game format. If I were to be more precise, or rather relatable to my 1990s childhood, I would say comparable to an excellent G rated movie (albeit short, old Disney classic), reminding me that subject matter can be literally any audience without beating a "happy happy, children always be happy" theme into you. Nope, the subject matter is much more diverse with some of it being a little grim.\n\nIt literally strung me and my emotions along in wonder as the story unfolded in a somewhat mystery-memory format. Much of the happiness was expressed through the game-play as I traversed through this beautiful universe. While short (roughly 3-4 hours), I found myself traveling through all the levels just to get that (optional?) cut-scene out of my own intrigue. As a mystery-esque story, the scenes are not linear and you can view them in any order to understand who the protagonist is, what made her who she is now, and what she needs to do next.\n\nThe game-play centers around collecting stars (progression), flowers (terraform resource), and animal spirits to return to their original skeletal bodies (which triggers a narrative piece) in a 2D space platformer. In order to traverse around, you will be using the gravity physics through jumping, free falling, along with gravity's effect on momentum. However, further progression will allow you to do more with extra abilities like gliding, force falling via increasing your gravitational pull, dashing, air jumping, etc. Obstacles are various elemental planets (platforms), which you can change with your terraform ability, given you have enough "hair resource". Each planet-type is unique in how it behaves as an obstacle and can assist you in traversing to the destination, or collectible, you are trying to reach.\n\nYou cannot die in this game, only progress. Replayability is somewhat limited to just achievements, but I personally was immersed enough to know I will be revisiting this hidden gem from time to time. It just was too memorable of an experience to forget.\n\nIf the developer decides on creating a sequel, I certainly hope they put as much love and care into it as they did this one.

The way you move in this game is using the concept of gravity and orbiting. As you progress you can unlock abilities like make yourself heavier or lighter to change the effect of gravity which will give you more ways to complete the levels. To collect the stars you will also sometimes need to "terraform" a planet, change a water planet to a fire planet for instance. That's because each planet type has some specific feature: fire planets let you jump higher from the surface, water planets let you get inside them etc...\n\nThe 94 levels of the game are very short, some were almost immediate to complete. The most i took on one level was 1-2 minutes. The whole game took me about 3 hours to complete. The levels are easy to beat, although are very enjoyable, and there's a lot of variety between them. It shows that the developers put a lot of effort, passion and creativity on each level. I never felt like i was repeating things, the levels were constantly throwing new situations at me.\n\nThe game also has a story, given to you through cut-scenes, some of them related with the levels you play.\n\nThe art and music are also fantastic. It's a very colorful and pleasant game to look at.\n\nMakes me happy that games like this exist. I recommend this game to anyone, even at full price.","February 20, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It just isn't quite good enough for what i hoped to get out of a 15 euro game.\n\nMy main problem with this game is the gameplay. Almost every level is one of two things, either it is easy to a point of being boring or it is annoying. The powers you get early in the game just make it so that you can get almost anywhere pretty easily, and the times where it isn't easy, is when you are fighting the controls because the movement in the game is chaotic.\nAnd even when there is a level wherein it is difficult to get the star, the best strategy is of often just to jump at it and hope for the best. It isn't a puzzle, you just try and often succeed. (And yes there are proper puzzles in the game but they are few and far between.)\n\nI found the artstyle to be wierd and not that good. But others seem to like it, so take a look at some of the screenshots and judge it yourself.\n\nThe story is the main positive of the game, and it was the only reason why i felt compeled to continue playing. I just dont think its good enough to be the reason why you buy the game at full price.\n\nIn summation. The best strategy for almost every level is "jump at it and hope for the best" which make the gameplay boring. The story is good, but not quite good enough.

The story as a whole works very well at telling the story of family and dealing with loss.\n\nYou use the gravitational pulls [and other physics] of various types of planet to collect the spirrits of animals and return them to their bodies so they can be at peace, all the while attempting to right certain wrongs in the physical world. Combining various physics puzzles, mazes and other interactions there is a wide variety to the various levels.\n\nContolled by mouse / keyboard / controller, this game works well with whichever mode of control you desire.\n\nThe graphics in this game are in a "painted" style, which works very nicely at setting the atmosphere. Similarly, the music in this game is wonderful. All together it really fits well with a spacey-spiritual feeling.\n\nWgile the game itself is quite short, it is nonetheless worth playing.

Most noticeable for me when starting to play through the game initially was the soundtrack which was done by Ben Prunty (of FTL soundtrack fame) - the music is very similar to that of FTL which though made the composer very easily recognisable, I feel the game is so different to FTL it would have been nice to have had the soundtrack sound a bit more unique as good as it still is.\n\nVoice acting was undertaken by Logan Cunningham (who was Rucks in Bastion - one of my favourite characters of all time in terms of voice-acting), Ash Burch (who has been a voice-actor in Adventure Time, Saints Row IV, and Borderlands to name but a few), and Sarah Elmaleh (who voice-acted in Gone Home, a great narrative driven game).\n\nGravity Ghost is a short physics based puzzle game in which you play as a young girl named Iona who is flying through a version of space that is revealed as being an analogy for purgatory.\n\nThe story for Gravity Ghost is relatively straight forward, and is revealed to you through a variety of animated cut-scenes that play as you progress through the levels. I will not go into the story here as I think with this being such a short game (with around 30mins worth of cut-scenes detailing the story) it would detract from the revelations that happen as you see it unfolding first-hand.\n\nThis game has a Mario Galaxy feel to it as you fly from level to level, solving puzzles to collect stars to unlock yet more levels. There are also spirit animals that you can reunite with their bodies/bones, and geoms that you can collect which are basically a variety of power-ups.\n\nEach level within the game contains a star, and the world-map is rather impressive. There are 94 stars in total to collect. Each 'branch' of levels is unlocked with every 10 stars collected.\n\nThis game was a delight. Though it can look a little child-like in animation style, and it is about a young girl with flowing hair, and I guess could be classed as a rather 'feminine' game stylistically, don't let that deceive you. I've seen reviews from guys who have thoroughly enjoyed the style of this game, and the story line though comical in places is quite dark also and has, I feel, something for everyone.\n\nI did, at times, struggle with the physics/mechanics of the game, and found 1 level in particular particularly difficult to complete towards the end of the game, but that did not put me off wanting to stick with it.\n\nI do feel £10.99 for 4hrs of gameplay may seem a little steep. If you were going to play through another two/three times to get all of the achievements then this is maybe not too bad a price, but I would say to definitely give this a try, but maybe wait until it hits an inevitable Steam sale. A great game, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it.","May 8","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music is fantastic and the characters and voice acting are great.\n\nThe Game itself follows a young girl through an adventure through the afterlife/time/space. At it's core it is a basic physics platformer/puzzel game. The physics work off gravitational pull of the planets around and you build momement from playing off your own jump/momentmun and the gravitational pull of the spheres around you. Definetly takes some time getting use to, its unlike any motion control or movement you've done in a video game before. As such, it offers a great refreshing take on the genre and video games in general.\n\nSeriously the art is so amazing alone.

Beneath its pleasant scenery and deceptively simple gameplay, there's a stirring game about love and loss and shifting heaven and earth - literally - to help your loved ones.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it. The art style is magnificent, and has a wonderful hand-drawn storybook feel throughout. The characters pop and the galaxy dances along. Ben Prunty's soundtrack provides a wonderful counterpoint, feeling spacey and grand without feeling too isolated, and the voice acting is solid across the board, particularly Ashly Burch's performances.\n\nThe gameplay itself has a lot going for it, focusing on physics-based challenges involving the masterful manipulation of gravity. These challenges feel good on the whole and most of them should be doable within a few tries and there are no consequences for failure, leaving you encouraged to take another swing at grabbing that star.\n\nThe story is excellent, though I hate to say too much about it for fear of any spoiling that may occur. Settle in and enjoy it.\n\nHowever, there are some negative aspects to consider as well. First, while the art style is gorgeous and the gameplay animations are smooth, there are times when the cinematic animations get a bit messy. Maybe this was just my computer, but occasionally a character's mouth would lag behind when their head was moving. A minor issue, but it brought me out of the universe of the game for a moment.\n\nAlso, while the forgiving gameplay helps prevent frustration, it also contributes to a short playtime - I grabbed all of the stars and finished the game in under 3 hours. There's still a few more things to explore, but don't expect a 10-hour game going in. This game gets in, says what it has to say, and gets out.\n\nAlong those lines, I'll wrap up this review by encouraging you to give it a try. There's a lot to like in "Gravity Ghost" - I think you'll be glad you made the trip.","January 26, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Others and myself equate it to 2D Mario Galaxy in a way. You also can't fail a level, all you can do is just take longer to do it.

This game is uniqe,creative and one of a kind .There have been other games with similar mechanics but nobody else took the effort of including cutscenes,story and voice acting making it a complete package .\n\nHowever I feel that this game is more like a work of art that tells the story rather than a good platformer .Its hard to predict where you move because there are many objects that effect gravity . I feel like i am just pressing buttons to get me where I need to go . It creates a feeling of lack of control .\n\nI am a little biased toward LivelyIvy because I was a fan of her games for many years . Its so awesome to see a small team create something mainstream and get good feedback .\n\nI think this game is great if you looking for relaxing experience and something different .","February 20, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of the 90-something levels ("100+") take mere seconds, while others employ the finicky controls to frustrate you for a bunch of minutes at a time, ideally involving some horrendous HOG-esque 'puzzle' requiring you to rotate a bunch of wheels that also move each other until all are set to the correct rotation. To help you spend more "hours" on this title, there's a stupid speedrun achievement to mandate additional playthroughs.\nAs expected from a Unity game, even this title (with its very modest amount of realtime physics or other complexity compared to classic Stutter Simulators like KSP or Habitat) manages to occasionally stutter like hell for no apparent reason. Glitchy achievement distribution is also in the mix, with me having to restore an older savegame and complete some endgame tasks in a different order in order to properly be awarded two cheevos.\n\nGravity Ghost has maybe 3 hours of actual content, including a few achievements that mandate moderate masochism for no reason (essentially: avoid the story videos until you collected all collectables), and it's priced at $15+. The Mario Galaxy titles this is for some reason compared to by many launched at ~$50, now cost ~$20, and provide some 15-20 hours. You do the math.\n\n\nMost inspiring dialogue line:\n(In the afterlife,... )   "You'll get used to not pooping."\n\n----\n\nThanks to Lilly both for lending a review copy as well as co-enduring the entire length of the game.

Thank you for your understanding.\n\nThanks to someone who replied, I had the idea to try something else. The controls, he said, are clock-wise and anti-clockwise. Well, on a keyboard that's doesn't exist. I have a left and a right arrow. That's it. While playing I had the, perhaps bad, habit of using the up and down keys when I shouldn't, which I believe had a negative impact to my experience.\n\nBut what if I used... a gamepad? You know what? It's actually much better. By using the thumbsticks on a gamepad you feel better feedback as to how your character is floating in the air. However, this doesn't solve the issue I have with the magnetic planets. You character is attracted to them and this can make some levels extremely irritating, adding an artifical level of difficulty which is not really present.\n\nThe game claims to have over a hundred levels and that might be true but they are all very short. There's no real puzzle or questioning elements in this game. I've played well over 20 levels by now, and I might play more to see if the game gets better as it goes on, but as of now, the only thing you do is spin your character around until you grab the star and repeat the process until you can get to the door to leave the level. That's it, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe visual style while playing is fairly good. There's some quality here and I think this is by far the strongest aspect of this game. It could use a little bit of AA here and there, but that's a minor personal complaint.\n\nThe cutscenes however are the complete opposite. It looks like they were made with the brush tool in MS paint. They have this weird thing where they zoom on the characters and it makes them extremely blurry. It's not something that should be done with low resolution art assets.\n\nThe voice actors are great but are let down by a script that does not make any sort of sense. So far I have no sense of a story whatsoever, I'm just going planet to planet collecting stars. The script is not deep and doesn't really make any sense, it feels like it was written by someone extremely inexperienced. It might make you laugh the same way an Adam Sandler comedy does: it's not funny, it's just ridiculous and you find yourself laughing anyway.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-9RDzarFCI\n\n** The issue I had with the soundtrack has been resolved, I have to give credits to the devs: they work hard and care about their game and their customers. That's a rare quality and I respect it. Even if I don't like the game that much, I'm glad to have supported those guys.\n\n* People seem to find this review unhelpful. I have improved it many times and will continue to try to make it as helpful as possible. If you click the unhelpful button simply you don't like my review, don't. That is not the question you need to answer, it's this one: Could this be helpful to someone who wishes to purchase the game? I hope Valve will improve the system, but for now I'd like it if you kept to answering this question.","January 26, 2015","false","2.0"," 67 of 175 people (38%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","38","67","175","4","11"

For every Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV there are a thousand half-♥♥♥♥♥ "retro platformers" and games about geometric shapes getting into fights with each other. If it weren't for the recommendations of a few friends, I would've immediately written off Gravity Ghost as one of those trying-too-hard games that are in fashion lately.\n\nI would have been wrong and missed out on something amazing.\n\nThe graphics are fairly simple to render, but the artwork is beautiful and perfect for the game's environment. Importantly, it maintains a consistent aethetic throughout. It looks fantastic.\n\nThe music is beautiful as well, and contributes to the unified whole of this excellent game. Listen to it instead of putting on a playlist from something else-- you won't regret it.\n\nIt even has an eerily mysterious and surprisingly compelling story, with good voice actors.\n\nAnd, most importantly, the gameplay is phenomenal. I'm not even sure what to compare it to. While I have played other games with gravity-based mechanics, none of them have been combined with the creative platforming elements in Gravity Ghost.\n\nThe controls are based on applying impulse to an orbiting body under gravitational influence. Obviously that doesn't sound fun, but the way Gravity Ghost is designed causes you to slowly build an intuitive feel for things. That sense of growth of skill, of learning how to Do A Thing, are key parts of playing Gravity Ghost.\n\nAs a friend recommended, play it when you have a long time to focus on playing it. Listen to its music, take in its visuals.\n\n100% recommended.","January 31, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're like me, you'll be scratching your head at the cut-scenes trying to figure out what the heck is going on.  The more you play however, the more the story begins to take shape.  Levels are quick and easy: collect stars to beat levels and collect flowers to grow you hair, the latter of which acts as an energy bar for special abilities.  It's charming, though it does lack sound sliders in the options menu and only will last you about three hours at most.  I'm not sure $15 is the right price for this title based on what it offers (I'd personally wait for a sale).

I took it as a sign. The art style drew me in, but other than that I went into this game blind. There have been countless times where I would watch and read all kinds of reviews on games, buy them, and still feel unsatisfied with the purchase, so I've lately been a bit skeptical at buying games. I just really wanted to play this.\n\nThis game is remarkable. It celebrates everything that makes indie games unique and offer experiences that no big titles ever could. There is a lot of soul in this game, as you will discover within the first minute of playing it.\n\nIf you're after technicalities of the game: it plays beautifully. No frame rate issues, no crashes, no unresponsive controls. Game looked stunning at 1920x1080. Kudos to this small team of devs doing what, for some reason, huge publishers are unable to do: realease COMPLETED games.\n\nSo, what is Gravity Ghost? It's a small tale that unravels itself slowly to you, leaving your imagination to fill in the blanks of the mythos and history surrounded the story (and I mean that in a good way). The way the story is told, and the pacing of it, is perfect. Is this an epic story that will knock you off your seat? Nope. But it IS a very well thought-out tale, that once it's revealed to you in full, kind of makes you go "...woah". It is haunting and it is beautiful, and I found myself teary-eyed once everything came together.... still not sure if that was out of sadness or just being so thrilled with this experience.\n\nFrom my understanding, the devs spent their savings on this game, and I think that's why the quality was so high. They did it because they wanted to. No kickstarter, no abandoned beta's, no shoving empty promises out the door in order to make a quick buck - how many times have we all put good faith in devs who promise the world, and leave us with unfinished, uninspired, betas... or sometimes not even that?\n\nThe point is, these are the kinds of people we should be supporting. And I thank them for letting their integrity be put above profit.\n\nIn any case, do I recommend this game? Absolutely, without question.","January 27, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For every Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV there are a thousand half-♥♥♥♥♥ "retro platformers" and games about geometric shapes getting into fights with each other. If it weren't for the recommendations of a few friends, I would've immediately written off Gravity Ghost as one of those trying-too-hard games that are in fashion lately.\n\nI would have been wrong and missed out on something amazing.\n\nThe graphics are fairly simple to render, but the artwork is beautiful and perfect for the game's environment. Importantly, it maintains a consistent aethetic throughout. It looks fantastic.\n\nThe music is beautiful as well, and contributes to the unified whole of this excellent game. Listen to it instead of putting on a playlist from something else-- you won't regret it.\n\nIt even has an eerily mysterious and surprisingly compelling story, with good voice actors.\n\nAnd, most importantly, the gameplay is phenomenal. I'm not even sure what to compare it to. While I have played other games with gravity-based mechanics, none of them have been combined with the creative platforming elements in Gravity Ghost.\n\nThe controls are based on applying impulse to an orbiting body under gravitational influence. Obviously that doesn't sound fun, but the way Gravity Ghost is designed causes you to slowly build an intuitive feel for things. That sense of growth of skill, of learning how to Do A Thing, are key parts of playing Gravity Ghost.\n\nAs a friend recommended, play it when you have a long time to focus on playing it. Listen to its music, take in its visuals.\n\n100% recommended.","January 31, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're like me, you'll be scratching your head at the cut-scenes trying to figure out what the heck is going on.  The more you play however, the more the story begins to take shape.  Levels are quick and easy: collect stars to beat levels and collect flowers to grow you hair, the latter of which acts as an energy bar for special abilities.  It's charming, though it does lack sound sliders in the options menu and only will last you about three hours at most.  I'm not sure $15 is the right price for this title based on what it offers (I'd personally wait for a sale).  Price aside, this is an easy recommend for those who want a peaceful and serene puzzle/platformer experience.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmqHhzLTMk0\n","February 1, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The character development has kept me caring for everyone on screen and the art & sound ties it together nicely. It's a healthy meal of a game totaling around 3.5 hours with more, or less, depending on your maneuvering skills.\n\nIf I were nitpicking, then I would say that level design caused me some frustration, but not much. This occured mostly on the levels where the use of the orbiting concept was required (or where you use the main tool of gravity to slingshot you into a satellite-like pattern around a planet). I want to say that the game doesn't ease you into these stages like it does for other concepts. You can solve many of these levels in many different ways, the concept of orbiting one of them, but I never really opted for it until it was required. This is the big scary of level design that is hard to overcome in the development of any game, ensuring that concepts can be grasped by ALL of your audience in a way that doesn't overly frustrates them (or frustrating them to the point where they close the game).\n\nEdit: I also nearly forgot to mention, PLEASE add button rebinding as I know that a lack of this ability can alienate a good chunk of gamers.\n\nHowever, that's just me nitpicking, the concept was executed really well and it's an overall great game to give 2015 a good start!","February 3, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game doesn't have a great soundtrack. It has a serviceable soundtrack with questionable sample quality that is a little better than the things you'd find on newgrounds at the boon of flash games, but it is by no means "great" and I cannot recommend paying extra for the soundtrack edition. This is coming from someone who collects VGM and usually opts for the soundtrack edition of most games, but I'm glad to say that I decided to play this game before spending the extra $5 on the soundtrack.\n\nThat's my only real gripe, and I could go into why, but I doubt most people care. I find it interesting that the person who made this OST is apparently known for making the music to other games though, and I find that more than a little disappointing.","January 27, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The planet terraforming effects and the flowing of Iona's hair as she loops around the pull of a planet's gravity is very pleasing on the eye. I love just swooping around the Gravity Ghost universe. It can be tricky at times, trying to orient yourself to catch that star or doorway - especially when they're moving - but always a joy. There's something intensely liberating about fluidly slingshotting around the planets.\n\nThe voice acting and sound design is also top notch and really makes the whole experience. The music in particular fits the different levels really well. It's a very relaxing experience overall.\n\nI liked that the levels are accessed from a constelation-like hub, with a lot of freedom in the order you complete the levels. This does mean the story is delivered piecemeal, which may be confusing, but I think this is appropriate here and intentionally keeps a few surprises hidden away. The story itself is sincere and well-written, and the dialogue is very amusing from the start. Like LivelyIvy's earlier games such as PuzzleBots, the characters and story work wonderfully.\n\nI've just finished my first play through and will definitely go back and try to get as many achievements as I can.

One of the most relaxing games out there, but don't for a second get the misbelief that its boring."\n\n\nThe story is lived out in reverse. As you are collecting the animal spirits and terraforming planets you will relive the backstory about the little girl and her animal friends. For this kind of game it's a really good way of telling the story, because the intresting plot does not lie in what happens next, but what happened earlier, before you wake up as a ghost. You will also meet some guardian animals thatr really stand out. The game deliver it's message while still managing to keep the humour.\n\nThere is basically not an options menu. There's resolution and subtitle settings and that's it. I'm not sure it needs a more detailed graphical menu because of the simple yet good looking artstyle, although it would be nice with some sound sliders. Any computer should be able to run this with no problem.\n\nGameplay wise there's not much to talk about. You use gravity as a tool to gain flowers to extend your hair (yes you read correctly) and collect stars aswell as animal spirits and planet parts. The atmosphere is very calm and serene and you can't die (obviously because you're already a ghost...), which makes the game very relaxing. It is the perfect game if you had a rough day and don't have the energy to play anything complicated.\n\nI really reccomend that you give this game a try and also, if you like the game you can spread the love because you get a gift copy to give to a friend for free when you purchase the game.","August 24, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rascus/recommended/251490/","rascus","Rafiki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rascus/","188 products in account",""A quirky little game about a ghost girl using gravity to collect the spirits of her dead animal friends in her extremly long hair. One of the most relaxing games out there, but don't for a second get the misbelief that its boring."\n\n\nThe story is lived out in reverse. As you are collecting the animal spirits and terraforming planets you will relive the backstory about the little girl and her animal friends. For this kind of game it's a really good way of telling the story, because the intresting plot does not lie in what happens next, but what happened earlier, before you wake up as a ghost. You will also meet some guardian animals thatr really stand out. The game deliver it's message while still managing to keep the humour.\n\nThere is basically not an options menu. There's resolution and subtitle settings and that's it. I'm not sure it needs a more detailed graphical menu because of the simple yet good looking artstyle, although it would be nice with some sound sliders. Any computer should be able to run this with no problem.\n\nGameplay wise there's not much to talk about. You use gravity as a tool to gain flowers to extend your hair (yes you read correctly) and collect stars aswell as animal spirits and planet parts. The atmosphere is very calm and serene and you can't die (obviously because you're already a ghost...), which makes the game very relaxing. It is the perfect game if you had a rough day and don't have the energy to play anything complicated.\n\nI really reccomend that you give this game a try and also, if you like the game you can spread the love because you get a gift copy to give to a friend for free when you purchase the game.","August 24, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfesbrain/recommended/251490/","wolfesbrain","Wolfesbrain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfesbrain/","217 products in account","A straightforward physics puzzler that places you at the whim of gravity and tasks you with catching stars and reuniting animals with their skeletons to reveal story cutscenes. I'm not entirely sure why the animal reuniting was the delivery method for the story, but it was a touching story. The delivery was kind of confusing but it never detracts from the game. I think I'd've liked the story better if there was an easy way to watch all the cutscenes in order.\n\nThe gameplay is what really shines though. As stated, it's a physics puzzler that has you standing on planetoids, jumping between them and orbiting them to collect stars. As the game progresses, it introduces new planet types--ice planets that you slip and slide on, gaining a little more speed/momentum when you jump off, gas planets that you bounce off of, etc.-- skills that affect your mobility, and powers that let you terraform planets. 94 levels, most of which are about two or three minutes long unless you're like me and just uncoordinated enough to mess up your run by hitting the wrong direction because you forgot to take your orientation and nearness to a planet into account.\n\nThe art style is beautiful; flat 2D, chalk or pastel type drawings that are just so pleasant to look at. The soundtrack is amazing.\n\nAll told, a great physics puzzler with a good, if oddly presented, story. Some people think it's priced a little high for how long it takes to play, I say it's well worth it. It's the kind of game you'll play and put away, and then come back to in a few months or years in between other games.","March 20","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buyer be warned. The game is immensely short (3 hours tops) and in no way challenging at all. The only thing that might get you to curse are the controls. No, they don't suck, but due to the nature of the game (gravity manipulation) you don't have direct control. You can jump and then float through space, using gravity to get around (i.e. the mass of planets). There are different planets (and thus elements) in the game that you can use, altering a planet's element will change its gravity properties, however this is not required to win the game, just to get all the stars, which you don't need (you need 60 out of 94 or so). All you really need to do to win is find the guardians and complete their objective. Again, those objectives are not difficult, they simply require some fiddling around. You'll get it eventually and you can't die.\n\nThe story is a sad one and told in hand drawn cutscenes, but ultimately forgettable. Might be a cool game for younger people, though. I DID have fun with the game, don't get me wrong, but it's neither a puzzler nor a platformer. It's a mix of both without being any of those genres. Also artistically interesting.

The game is very easy and lacks challenge, except for a couple stand-out difficult puzzles. It's very casual and could be considered cute. However, being able to navigate orbital space with shifting gravity fields, I never really felt in control; I used the controls as they were progressively revealed, but they surprised me in their ineffectiveness. Having said that, the game is generous in providing new controls that easily solves every new problem. Progression is fast: I could beat some stages in a matter of seconds. Finally, I came to this game on the recommendation of the music. I thought that the game soundtrack was okay but it wasn't noteworthy or enhance the gameplay experience. It's an amateur game that could be easily dismissed. It plays on the romantic theme of ghosts being able to affect the living world, which is nonsense if you don't believe in that sort of thing.

Magic?\nSteam Achievements are a reasonable level of difficulty. I don't want to throw my keyboard while trying to accomplish them.\nGraphics are OUT OF THIS WORLD. I'm sorry to be ignorant of what actual belief system is utilized (if there is any real world correlation), but the visuals are an interesting mix of mythos akin to Day of the Dead/Australian aboriginal artwork, with the animals' skeletons showing and patterned in bright colors, and Japanese "kawaii" aesthetic, with the cute little planets and stars and such. It just WORKS.\nI could listen to the soundtrack on loop for days; it is that gorgeous.\nThe story is simple, and yet it's very unique. I don't want to spoil, but it's the sort of story that would be pretty particular to a child, something you WOULDN'T think to use for a media story, and that's why I like it. I also like the juxtaposition between the story happening in the mundane, boring-grey-and-brown real world with that of the fantastic Afterlife. Grounding parts of the plot in the real world somehow made the Afterlife all the more surreal.\nThe plot is revealed slowly over time, and this built up the anticipation very well.\nEthereal, otherworldly, sacred atmosphere while still somehow reminding me of childhood pretend games where my imagination was running all over.\nCons:????\nNone???\nSometime's there's a level that's a little frustrating, but when you finally get it, it's so rewarding.\nToo short? But it's a complete experience, so not really?\nOh! I wish there were more options in terms of saving. The fact that I had to quit to save was a bummer.","January 15","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very easy and lacks challenge, except for a couple stand-out difficult puzzles. It's very casual and could be considered cute. However, being able to navigate orbital space with shifting gravity fields, I never really felt in control; I used the controls as they were progressively revealed, but they surprised me in their ineffectiveness. Having said that, the game is generous in providing new controls that easily solves every new problem. Progression is fast: I could beat some stages in a matter of seconds. Finally, I came to this game on the recommendation of the music. I thought that the game soundtrack was okay but it wasn't noteworthy or enhance the gameplay experience. It's an amateur game that could be easily dismissed. It plays on the romantic theme of ghosts being able to affect the living world, which is nonsense if you don't believe in that sort of thing. It dabbles in science but relies on feelings. It's smart but stupid at the same time.","January 5","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluestKazoo/recommended/251490/","BluestKazoo","Studious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluestKazoo/","182 products in account","This game is something special. Gameplay is solid, and it sticks to its core concept: using gravity to collect objects. Over the course of the game, you get more tools to help you on your way. The levels combined with the mechanics are good enough to stand on their own, but where the game truly shines is the story and the art. The story is told like a book. It starts at the end, and you need to piece together what happened as you play through the game. The crayon art style meshes very well with the childy outdoorsy tone.\n\nAt first, I wasn't thrilled by the gameplay. I remember it being an adjustment. The mechanics and the themes that built up over time did leave an impression on me, however. I know a humble indie project when I see one, and gravity ghost makes the best out of what its got. After a while, I found myself gleefully soaring from orbit to orbit. It's that childlike freedom that really ties in together with the story. This game does present some serious subject matter towards the end, which leads into a very nice ending that ties everything together.\n\nGravity ghost may not be the best designed game, or the most attention grabbing, but there's a lot of merit in making what you have work.","May 1","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
