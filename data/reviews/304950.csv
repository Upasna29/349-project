No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nAn iOS port brought to Steam, Castaway Paradise is a game very, very similar to Animal Crossing. You play as a villager who has washed up on an island and are introduced to various other castaways. Together with them, it's your job to turn the island into a veritiable paradise! A very casual game, Castaway Paradise has a LOT of content, items to collect, and things to do.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nLike Animal Crossing, Castaway Paradise has a lot of the same features. You are able to customize your character with clothing and accessories, catch bugs, fish, decorate your home AND the island, and buy/sell items. There are also quests, which are given by the other villagers. They'll always have something for you to do, whether it be fetch them some items, deliver something to another villeger, catch fish, or some other request. These will reward you with different items, clothing, gems, and puzzle pieces.\n\nGems are the currency of the game, and are used for nearly everything, including buying/selling items. They can also be used to instantly complete quests or refill stamina, provided you have enough. This is generally not worth it, as you will be paying double, triple, and even quadruple what you would get as the reward, and stamina refills on its own very quickly. But it is an option if you are trying to hurry something along. Puzzle pieces are an extra item that are used to solve small 9 piece-puzzles which serves as the lock to extra portions of the island. Pieces can be slowly earned via quest rewards or bought outright at the puzzle panel for a hefty price. Again, not worth it, but it's an option!\n\nThere are a lot of different themes for clothing and furniture, such as Classical, Tropical, Chinese, and more. There are lots of tools for you to use for various tasks around the island. A hoe for farming, a shovel for digging holes to plant stuff, a watering can for watering crops and trees, a net for catching bugs, and a fishing pole for....well, fishing. Bugs and fish caught can be donated to the museum for your collection, just like in Animal Crossing.\n\nRemember how I said this was an iOS port ? Well, it uses some of the same mechanics from its mobile counterpart. When you water a crop, solve a puzzle, or order an upgrade on a building or structure, a small timer appears. The building won't be finished or the crop won't be fully grown until the timer runs out. This probably could have been altered for the Steam port so it appeared as less of a mobile port. What's even more glaring is that remnants of the microtransactions of the iOS version remain, even though the transactions themselves are not present. In the iOS version, you could buy VIP status using real money, which gave you access to more rooms of your house, more items/clothing/tools/upgrades, and got you free items every so often. Instead of buying it in the Steam version, you automatically receive the status once you reach level 15 at no extra cost.\n\nSpeaking of level, nearly everything you do earns you small amounts of experience points. At every level, you unlock more items and clothing for purchase in the catalogue. You can access the catalogue at any time with a single click.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThis game isn't very heavy on graphics. Everything is a little blocky and low-poly, but it's cute and charming nonetheless. There's enough detail in everything to where it looks very nice, and when you finish decorating your house you will want to take screenshots to show it off despite the blocky textures! Everything is vibrant and very colorful. Despite the obvious blockiness, it's very beautiful.\n\nOne nice option included is the ability to zoom in and out a bit. As a mobile game ported to PC, everything feels a bit...large, being originally formatted for tiny mobile screens. Zoomed in. With this option, you can move your view out just enough to get rid of that feeling. To me this was a godsend, as being so zoomed in like that on my monitor for too long would have given me a headache. Zooming out to the max distance allowed helped allievate that problem.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nCastaway Paradise has some very upbeat, cheerful tunes--perfect for relaxing after a long day and playing a casual game such as this. There's only a small handful of songs, but they are all relaxing and lighthearted, even if they do loop a bit too often. Sound effects sort of pop, and are very distinct. When something happens, you hear it.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThis is a very light game, and most users should have no issues running it. It ran at a seemingly steady framerate at all times. Shadowplay could not display the FPS as it usually can in this game for some odd reason. Nonetheless, the game ran pretty well.\n\nController support is more or less non-existant here, which is understandable considering the game's origin. I used a mix of keyboard and mouse to play, although you can play solely with the mouse if you wish.\n\nMy one gripe with the game is that the escape key closes the game entirely. Because of this I accidentally closed the game while playing one too many times. Despite this little flaw, your progress is saved each time, so nothing is lost. Perhaps this can be fixed in a small patch? If not, it's not a huge deal since progress is still saved, but it is a little annoying at times.\n\nNo lag, stuttering, or anythign of that nature was observed. Smooth sailing!\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nCastaday Paradise is the closest thing we'll get to having an Animal Crossing title on Steam. At least in the foreseeable future. It's certainly a genre thats potential has remained untapped here. Having spent over 1000 hours on Animal Crossing: New Leaf, I'd certainly play more games like it if other titles were released. If you enjoyed any of the Animal Crossing titles, or the iOS version of Castaway Paradise, you will enjoy this PC port. A great casual game to fill in the gaps between other more hardcore games, and to help relax between slogs through longer games. It's definitely worth trying out, at the very least!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/P1_jsgHpEv4\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 23, 2015","true","12.5"," 80 of 95 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","80","95","0","4"

Areas unlock as you collect Puzzle Pieces.  You can decorate and expand your home.  There's a Museum you can submit collectibles to.\n- She has already collected everything the Museum needs in 20 hours playtime, which leads her to the impression that there's not a lot of content overall.  Of course, with the game in EA state, this is expected to change.\n- She does not overly enjoy the questing system.  Most quests reward you with a pittance of currency and restoration projects to expand the city cost thousands.  They are also repetitive and sadly necessary to make any progress (Growing crops take real-time hours and net little money, too; in addition collecting things from the shore or ground reset each real-life day, so there's no other way than questing to make your cash - at least this is her belief).\n- She gets frustrated at the time barriers, but has come to accept them, as Animal Crossing does the same.  The only difference here is that she can *cheat* in Animal Crossing by changing the date/time of her Wii or 3DS.  Although we haven't tried changing the PC time and relaunching Castaway Paradise, such an action usually has far more consequences than doing that on a console.\n\nAt the end of the day, any complaints aside, she does keep launching it and playing it each day and that's good enough to get a positive review.  If a game keeps drawing you back, then it's worth it.","June 10, 2015","true","20.6"," 71 of 87 people (82%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","82","71","87","41","6"

To my surprise, however, Stolen Couch Games actually listened to user feedback and ultimately removed the pay-walls entirely from the STEAM version. Because SCG knows that the F2P microtransaction model is far more profitable than the premium model, the fact that they still chose to go premium is that much more commendable, and deserves a lot more attention than it is getting.\n\nIf you like Animal Crossing, buy this game. Hell, even if you don't like Animal Crossing, buy this game just to support honest developers, and show that good games are sustainable, without the freemium model.\n\nKudos to the entire team at SCG for having artistic integrity in what is turning out to be a fantastic game.","May 14, 2015","true","16.8"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","38","42","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/304950/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4010 products in account","What is Castaway Paradise Complete Edition?\n\nCastaway Paradise, for short, is a casual game where you land on an island and just help rebuilding it. For that you earn gems and puzzle pieces that you can get by doing various actions. Since there is no real objective to the game, it is very much a decoration sandbox game where you can unlock parts of the island and decorate everything at your will (provided you have the gems first).\n\n\nControls:\nThe game is completely controlled with the mouse and in most cases this goes very fine. When it doesn't, you just need to be careful. There are cases where icons appear that you would not want to click - for example, after digging a hole the game usually suggests you to plant a bug you caught earlier in the hole, instead of the flower seeds or fruits. So you must click one or two times extra. No big deal, but annoying.\n\n\nGameplay:\nThere is no way to permanently mess up, and so there are also no missable achievements. When you first start the game, you get a tutorial quest series, and you will want to just do quests for a while to learn all the basics of the game. There are various activities you can make, such as catching bugs and fish (and donating them to a museum), planting and harvesting vegetables, growing fruit trees (and of course also harvesting them), and rebuilding bridges, gates and houses. On top of that, you can decorate the island at will.\n\nThe game is definitely not made for someone who wants a deep story or gameplay, but aimed at a more casual audience, although it will require quite some time to achieve everything.\n\nI heard comparisons to Animal Crossing, but as the versions I have I didn't play much, I can't tell.\n\nHere is only one example, the most rewarding and involved of the various things you can do: You come across a field of 4x3 squares. First you remove the weed and stones (only once before you use it). Then you rake the field and plant seeds in it. You get seeds by buying them in the shop or the store menu. Everything is bought with ingame money, and even the VIP status is reached by leveling up enough. Conveniently you can access that store at any time - and that means also while you are at the field and just looking at the raked square, so you can buy and plant seeds with one click (two or three if you must choose another seed first) without having to enter the actual store menu. After that, you need to water the plants. Then it takes some time for them to grow. Then you water them again. Possibly you repeat that once more. Then you harvest the plants (or at any step before but then they give less plants), go to your silo and sell them (again, conveniently without having to go to the actual shop). You can expand your silo to hold more plants, which is highly recommended at least once. As a tip, I found peppers to give the best reward (508 gems profit per field in 30 minutes, possibly plus water refill time or minus water refill gems if you have many fields). You read the last sentence right - instead of waiting for the water to fill up in your can, you can also buy that with the ingame money. Convenient!\n\nOf course you can upgrade the can to have more maximum water or deliver more water at once. When you get to the VIP status by reaching level 15, you have infinite water, but delivering at least 3 water at once still is useful.\n\nOn top of everything, the game doesn't take itself too serious - the characters are over the top, and that is a good thing. The always grumpy Angus who hates flowers, the partying Mayor Viktoria, the francophil baker Gustave - the characters you meet are all lovable!\n\n\nMusic and Sound:\nUnfortunately, at the music it falls badly. Sure, the sound ingame is nice, but the music is too few. You hear the same music over and over - especially noticeable when entering and leaving a building.\n\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are in two distinctive styles. First there is a 3D blocky style for most objects and subjects, without ever getting pixelated as in Minecraft (see the screenshots on the store page for how it looks like), second there is a 2D style for the rest, such as flowers and the ground. With everything it does, the game looks not bad but could be better. Probably it was made to resemble the abovementioned Animal Crossing games.\n\n\nRecommended?\nIt is really hard to give you advice. I love the game, but I also see that beyond the humor the mechanics are relatively simple and shallow. For me it was worth the money (I paid around 5 Euro in a sale), and I got over a dozen hours out of it so far and will spend more, probably until I have all achievements.\nIf you want a game that you can return to every now and then, but then also are willing to invest some time to do the daily quests (that are optional but help you, and also reward you with badges not gotten otherwise for an optional collection), like half an hour for three or four times a day, then you have a small gem that can give you joy.\nIf you however want to explore a lot, do epic quests, save the world, have battles - no, this is not for you then. Go back to Skyrim! Here you can only save a small island and spend all the time on it.\n\n\nPS: From some of the ingame things it is obvious that the developers might have wanted to make a F2P game ot at least modeled some mechanics after that. It is good that they didn't. There are no real money transactions inside the game, everything is bought with ingame money or - the VIP - by just leveling up, i.e. playing the game. It is only the second game from the developer that I find on Steam, and the first one that is a major project. The developer loves this game, he makes events for it, gives out free DLC every now and then. So as far as I can tell by this review, it would just be worth buying for that reason, just like Nation Red was back in the day.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/304950/discussions/0/458606877329466148/\n\nAs for the recommended price at which to buy, I can't tell. Personally I feel fine with the 5 Euro I paid, but depending on what you expect and how much you get involved in such games - or if you like it at all, it is as much a hit or miss at all or at any price I would tell. You must decide for yourself.","January 27","true","20.6"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","1"

Only a few vestiges of the original mobile iteration remain, but they're pretty glaring -- energy timers on most actions and a progressive level cap on the shop catelogue.  You'll be actively hampered by the former until level 15 and can't complete the latter until level 34.  The PC version may not have cash IAPs, but still uses mobile tactics to gate content.\n\nThe handful of NPCs populating the island are such helpless simpletons, they actually amplify the feeling of being marooned on an island Tom Hanks style, except you're surrounded by sock puppets instead of volleyballs.  Without any crafting system, farming and fishing become a repetitive grind for EXP and currency.\n\nOn the positive side, the devs are fairly responsive and post in the community hub regularly.  I don't know how many more (if any) player suggestions they plan on incorporating since leaving Early Access.  They do roll out seasonal/event updates and limited edition item sets, but the majority of LE sets are holiday-based and only appear once a year.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nUnderneath the grind, Castaway Paradise boils down to a reductive decoration-sim.  It lacks the depth & breadth of genre heavy-hitters like Farmville or Harvest Moon.  I bought this on sale for 50% off from the Humble Store (so no refunds).  I really wanted to find more depth in this game, but even with so much time sunk, I still can't strongly recommend it in one direction or the other.  Perhaps it's better that there's no neutral option, because I'd say ambivalence is damning enough.","November 5, 2015","false","96.7"," 59 of 87 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","59","87","3","2"

However, I don’t think I will retire or complete this game in a near future and I believe it deserves more attention, I just write down some thoughts now. May edit later.\nAt first glance, Castaway Paradise resembles the famous Animal Crossing game a lot. They indeed have serval things in common, but CP has its own selling point too, like farming and its unique square art-style.\n\nGood:\n+ A lot of furniture and outfits to get/change. I really mean a lot of. XD\n+ Free DLCs and festival updates. These introduce new contents, including items, island decoration and more, in the game and are often time-limited. I myself is busily farming gems to buy all the Thanksgiving items now.\n+ Various ways to make profit. You can farm seeds, grow trees, catch fish, water flowers, sell stocks or help out the island dwellers. By doing so, you are well paid back.\n+ Daily challenges: This is by far my favorite part. Completing daily challenges to get new dress, gems, and even new bandages. Why not? And even better, bandages can be displayed in the mysterious room now! I’ve always been curious what function that room will serve.\n+ Easy control. I play Animal Crossing on 3DSLL and also tried CP on phone. But Steam version is far easy to control. I usually use both keyboard and mouse.\n+ Colorful art-style which makes me really happy.\n+ Welcoming comunity and responsible devs.\n+ No microtransactions or social media accounts needed.\n\nWhat I think will be better if added/modified: (Some of these features are beloved ones in Animal Crossing)\n- Multiplayer. It will be much better if we can visit our friends’ islands.\n- Larger fish/shell/bug variety. Seasonal fish or bugs.\n- Ability to decorate more houses. Like town house and other dwellers’ houses.\n- More dwellers.\n- Use the boat to travel to other island.\n- I want to be the mayor! XD\n\nIn sum, this game is fantastic especially for casual gamers! If you are into cute and colorful things or if you have some minutes to spare or if you like farming/decorating/dressing, give this game a try. It will amaze you.\n\n9/10 for me.\n","November 25, 2015","true","29.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

Well let's find out. So far i have around 4 hours of play time in this game. Not a whole lot but for such a game that would give already a good impression on what to expect. Story wise the game is pretty simple, you are stranded on a island and the villagers need your help. Cause like every other game they cannot do anything them self. So during the course of the game you will preform many quests to earn XP and Gems. The higher you level the more items become available to you. Which you can then purchase with Gems.\n\nBesides those quests you can also plant crops, flowers, trees and so on. Catch some fish or bugs and rank them against other players around the world with their online leader board. All these things work very well.\n\nHowever, the game misses a couple of points/features that would have made the game exciting for the long haul, and i am gonna compare it with Animal Crossing(as the developers do as well) The main reason why that game is so successful is the aspect of collecting stuff. You go around finding new fish during certain seasons or catch bugs, and then you bring them to the museum. Here you catch them, and they will end up in a museum but there is no real sense of collection. no catalog to keep track of what you got, or no sense at all when something will appear or where.\n\nAnother thing that is missing is new members joining the island, or the fear of someone leaving the island.  Here you have a handful of NPC's that walk around and not doing much, no interaction with other NPC's or any interaction with the world. They walk around and that is pretty much it. In short it could have felt more alive if they where doing something.\n\nSome other smaller things that i would have liked to see is a day and night cycle that for all i care is linked to your computer clock or the servers, to make the world feel alive. Also a missed thing is not being able to swim and dive up stuff. There is a boat and submarine docked at your island but for now those do not do anything. perhaps at a later level. Also events, the game has them, but as far as i can tell it's just store items you can buy to make it more seasonal and again no real exciting things (could be wrong here, just seen the mothers day event)\n\nIn the end i can say that Castaway Paradise is a solid game, and for it's price worth it. However i do fear that in the long run it will become boring with the lack of interaction and collections.","May 10, 2015","true","5.8"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","24","29","2","1"

The island has multiple NPCs who all give you quests, often of the type of 'collect three apples' or 'plant four flowers',  and the occasional fetch quest.\nThis is very much a mobile port, all the controls are done by big buttons and there are cooldown timers on just about everything, but the developers have removed any microtransactions and there is a lot of free DLC.\nThe development team is also active on the forums.\n\nIt has a cute art style and soothing background music, there is no voiced dialogue but there are good soundeffects to make the world seem more alive. As usual for games in this genre there are a lot of incentives to keep you playing, free items, lesser cooldowns, etc.\n\nAnother nice feature is that the game continues playing when you're logged out, so if you have to wait for a particularly long cooldown you can just quit and come back later, to find it completed.\n\nI like what I've seen of this so far and will keep playing it for a while.

Much like it's inspiration, you go around your island home, doing various tasks, such as gardening, clean up, fishing, and quests for your friends. Through these activities you'll gain XP and currency to help progress, and customize both your character and your island home. It's a pretty simple premise and should be pretty easy to grasp for all gamers of all age and level.\n\nThe game isn't hard to learn, and it's not one I would say it's focused on player skill. Rather, it's fairly relaxing, and could be argued as mindless, but I'd like to call it simple. The controls are all through mouse clicks, from moving your character to watering your plants. Accessibility is one of the game's biggest strengths and the learning curve is very easy going and should be able to be enjoyed by even the youngest of audience.\n\nThough the game is simple, I do feel it to be fairly satisfying. Earning xp to unlock the next set of things to customize my island and character with, purchasable with the ingame currency earned, there's something really addictive about this formula. I found myself endlessly checking on all my plants, constantly chasing the next quest, and doing it over and over again, Castaway Paradise has mastered the endless loop design of Animal Crossing. Because of this, it's arguable that the game can start feeling grindy after a while, but I don't think it was designed for long stretches of play, rather, like it's inspiration Animal Crossing, really meant to be visited for an hour or just a few minutes each day.\n\nIn Animal Crossing there is a pile of incentive to keep playing, or at least to visit each day. You can unlock mini-games, trigger events in game during real time holidays and celebrations. In Castaway Paradise I've yet to see any of these elements. I've only played for about 3 hours on the game's launch, so since this genre requires real world, time commitment over months, if not years, it's difficult for me to say if these elements are apart of the game. I'm of course hoping that these interesting tidbits spearheaded by Animal Crossing is also included into Castaway Paradise in some way. If there is a lack of mini-games to be unlocked, or if it isn't real world holiday sensitive I feel the game would be lacking some of the most charming elements that made Animal Crossing so memorable. Again, these are elements that I simply can not comment on for Castaway Paradise, as I do understand will require time to fully flesh out, if it's there at all.\n\nOverall Castaway Paradise is a charming little Animal Crossing-like, that seem to be doing a pretty good job at emulating it's inspiration. Only time can tell the true quality of the game, as this genre is really meant to be played over long periods of real world dates. But speaking solely from the 3 hours I've experience, it won me over.\n\nPros:\n- Charming visuals\n- Addictive gameplay\n- Lots to unlock\n- (so far) does a good job at emulating it's inspiration (Animal Crossing)\n\nCons:\n- Can be considered grindy\n- Might be too simple for some","May 20, 2015","true","3.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Sadly this game has neither the charm nor the fun of any of it's predecessors.  Most of the aspects of this game are unnecessarily grindy and tedious with little reward.  I realize this had once been a Free2Play microtransaction nightmare, and the one thing going for it is that they removed the real money payment type but they left all the extra time sink requirements in.\n\nAs far as a farming and life sim goes, the controls are just too awkward to make doing anything a pleasure.  The targeting is a chore, especially if you are trying to put down a fence behind a house that you can only barely view behind.  And the farming and planting takes just a few too many clicks to select your actions all so that after a 10-12 min wait (and a few extra clicks) you can harvest a vegetable from a plant and then turn around and sell it for exactly what the seed to grow it costs.\n\nThere just isn't enough personal customization to really make doing all the chores (tasks the other inhabitants want) and waiting around to be able to do more chores, worth it.  Everything on the island is already in its place and just requires you to raise gobs of gems to fix up and make them useful.  The house you start out with is a tent and requires another gobfull of gems to turn into a house, but when you go inside said tent, it's just an interior of a house with the back rooms already visable and just roped off with an "under construction" sign.  If I'm living in a tent, my room should look like a tent so that the reward of raising all those gems really adds up to something.  Somehow the whole thing just feels like a community service simulation executed in real time.\n\nMaybe it's because there are no good Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon Games available on Steam that this game has gotten such raving reviews, but this game just didn'y scratch that simple, life-sim itch like it's 3DS predecessors do.","January 19","false","26.7"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

Nothing it would seem.\nUnless I'm missing something, the bakery has no purpose.\nYou can walk around inside, but can't interact with anything.. and Gustov (as well as the other Citizens) never enter\nany buildings either.\n\nAlso little things like no day/night cycle, as well as times where there will simply be nothing to do,\nbecause you're waiting for something like a building to finish building, creatures to respawn, plants to grow, etc.\nThat being said, I think it does a bit better job than Animal Crossing in that respect.\nOn Animal Crossing I found myself coming on for about 30 minutes once per day to do my daily 'chores'.\nHere most things respawn in about an hour, so you can come online every hour to harvest your stuff, etc.\n\nThere are also some other cool game mechanics, like daily rewards for logging in each day, buying Stock,\nand 'investing' your money at the bank (basically storing it there for a set period of time to gain a % increased return).\n\nSo overall I am really enjoying the game, but there are 'empty-feeling' areas in the game as well.\n\nA good sign though, is the Dev's are very active on the forums, taking suggestions to put on to their Wishlist.\nAnd promising good improvements to the game that I greatly look forward to.\n(As of writing this there's a patch coming out soon I am very much excited for)\n\nSo yes, as a fan of these sorts of games, it's hard not to recommend.\nBut of course these sorts of games aren't for everyone.\n\nI don't usually like giving ratings, but if I were to, I would put this at about a 7.5-8.0.\nPending improvements to the game, I would push the score higher, even up to a 8.5 or 9.0.. but we'll see how these improvements come along and if they live up to the players, ahd my own somewhat high, expectations.","May 5, 2015","true","22.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","1"

There's no real story behind that. There are others living on this island, all of which are talking animal-people. Not much story here, but then you don't really need one unless you're morbidly curious as to why there are a bunch of "castaways" trapped on some island and no one is trying to rescue them.\n\nMoving on, you control your new islander using the mouse. You can use the space bar as a sort of short cut to use the tool in your hand, but otherwise everything is mouse-driven. Your daily tasks include dusting cobwebs, planting trees and flowers, fishing, catching bugs, collecting shells, and decorating the town as you see fit. There are online leaderboards for things like finishing quests\n\n+Daily quests and rewards. They're a reason to drop in at least once a day.\n+Online leaderboards are neat. They're certainly a reason to do more quests and collect more things.\n+The writing. It's quirky and zany--not to mention funny. I actually take time to read the other islanders' "chit-chats."\n+Ability to decorate the town. You can pop down whatever decorations you see fit and make the island your own. It's a nice touch and the decorations are fairly varied.\n+Dress up! I love customizing my character. An outfit a day keeps the doctor away... Or something along those lines. You can also change hairstyles, though not your facial features.\n+Cute art style. Everything is vibrant and cartoony.\n+Regular updates. The devs keep adding content, which is always nice.\n\n-The game plays much like one would expects an iOS or Facebook game to play: you check in, do some stuff, and log out to wait for time to pass before you do more stuff. The game breaks this up a bit by offering a slew of quests that the adorable island residents give you, but even some of those cannot be done immediately.\n-There are also some quests that cannot be done immediately because you were a go-getter and cleaned up the entire island without knowing that a quest later down the line would require you to break rocks or collect trash. So you can get stuck with certain quests unless you pay to complete them with the in-game currency.\n\nBoth are very minor gripes.\n\n.Bottom line.\nIt's entirely enjoyable. Maybe not for the 14.99USD price tag, but I got it on sale for somewhere around $5 and I can't say I'm dissatisfied with my purchase.","April 7","true","20.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

This means that it is still in development and the game is subject to many changes. The points you read in this review may not reflect the current state of the game. Another review may be done when the game leaves Early Access.\n\nCastaway Paradise is the PC version of the hit mobile and Facebook game? I put that as a question because I’m not sure how popular it is as I’m not very familiar in the mobile gaming community. So for this review please remember that I have never played the mobile version, so I will not be making any comparisons to a version I have never played.\nMade by Stolen Couch Games, the first thing that drew me to Castaway Paradise when I saw it sat in my inbox was the colouring of the screenshots, the game is very vibrant and genuinely made me happy to see. It looked like a game where you can just sit, relax, and enjoy. The second point was that it was being advertised to me as being like Animal Crossing which I love! Is it in the same league as Animal Crossing? Or even in the same sport? We’ll see.\n\nCastaway Paradise starts you off as a person who has been washed up on shore of an island after a terrible storm. Many of the buildings on the island have been destroyed, as well as some of the scenery. The Mayor has appointed you to the position of fixing it up, rebuild the city! To rebuilt each building you need to save up a bunch of gems which can then be spend on said rebuild.\n\nYou are given a nice little tent to live in, until you can afford to upgrade it to a house. They should call this tent the Tardis, as from the outside it is tiny, but inside has multiple, massive rooms! Similar to Animal crossing, you are given free reign over how you style your house, with a massive catalog where you can buy all your goods (the PC version has no microtransactions) using your gems.\n\nTo earn gems you can become a farmhand, armed with a rake and some seeds you can grow many vegetables that can be sold. The farming and many other aspects of this game are very similar to how most mobile games work - you plant the seed, or do a certain task, and you then must wait a required time before the action is complete. For example, plant a seed, water it, you then must wait 5 minutes for it to grow. The time limit will increase depending on the difficulty of the task, if is a vegetable that is worth a lot of money, it will take longer to grow. You could spend your gems to waver this time, but this was removed on a later update.\n\nThis is one of the main ‘urgh’ things for me on this game, I generally don’t play mobile games because they do things like this - this is the sort of game where you do a bunch of tasks, bugger off for 15 minutes and then come back a bit later to collect the rewards - and to be honest, I don’t really like that in a game. However, I know many people love that aspect of games, but generally in mobile games because you can quickly pick it up on the bus to work, and then get the rewards in your break. I’m not sure how much people will like this mechanic in a PC game, but personally it’s not for me. That’s not to say that I don’t enjoy the game, I do -it’s just not a game where I can sit down for a few hours and play non-stop - it is a game where I will play little and often.\n\n\nThe characters you meet in the game each have their own quirky personality, and will often say things that will make me laugh. The issue is that each play through will get the same characters, with the same personality. This is where Animal crossing does it better, characters will move in and some will leave the town. In Castaway Paradise, the characters are there to stay, no matter how much you ignore them whereas in Animal Crossing I made sure to regularly talk to the characters in hope that being friendly will keep them living in my town.\n\nYou will be issued many quests while playing, this will range from delivery this to X character, buy X product from the catalog and place it in X location, or grow X tree/vegetable. The variety isn’t large, but at least you have tasks to do that will give you rewards -which Animal Crossing lacked a little. If you don’t feel like doing quests, then there are plenty of other things you can be doing. You could go fishing, similar to Animal Crossing (I don’t like to keep comparing Castaway Paradise to Animal Crossing, but it is one of the only games I can think of that I have played -and the developers do market their game as being like Animal Crossing) you are issued a fishing rod, you can see the shadow of the fish in the water where you can throw your line and hope for the best - buying fish food will increase your chances at catching bigger fish. You can also use your net to catch insects and other bugs. One of the great things I liked about all this, is that there is a weekly scoreboard for the largest fish/bug caught by other people (what makes it even better is that I got in the top 10 for some of my fish/bugs) It adds a bit of competition which is always fun. Collecting these fish/bugs also means you can place them into the museum.\n\nCatchy music. It WILL annoy you that it is extremely catchy. I found myself whistling the song all day! I say ‘song’ because it is one song on repeat. It’s a good song, but a larger variety would be a great addition and might stop people from stabbing their ear drums as to not hear the same, catchy song again. (Is is a great song)\nSome of the things that are missing from the game that I believe should be added is a day/night cycle - at the moment it is always day, and there is only so much sun I can take! Adding a day/night cycle would be great. However, I would not like this based on realtime - I only really get a chance to play at night-times, so in Animal Crossing the shops were always closed without using the time change cheat.\n\nI’d also like the NPC characters to do something. Anything. So far they stand around in generally the exact same place, pacing back for absolutely no reason - they never enter the buildings (am I the only person who uses the shop?!) It would be great to mix with the day/night cycle and have them go into their homes and to bed.\nMake it so the island changes on each new game. I don’t want to start a new game just to get the same NPCs, the same shape island, the same building locations. I can understand this is something that could be difficult to program (I’ve dabbled in game development I have you know) but it would really make a huge difference.\n\n\nThis has been a very hard review to write, mainly because the developers keep updating things! Serious props to Stolen Couch Games - they are putting a lot of effort and listening to the community with additions and changes they make If you are worried that it is early access, don’t - this is early access done right. I have seen many people posting into the forums asking for X change (such as adding WASD movement, and it was done quicker than I could get this review written)\n\nCastaway Paradise may be a little pricey (£10.99) and it very much feels like a mobile game, but it has a charm that will want me to keep playing it every now and again when I want to relax and smile.

It works overall, but it's annoying\n\n-villagers are forgettable overall, as are their dialogues\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=548915531\n\nCastaway Paradise works well as a sandbox thanks to the huge amount of content it throws your way, you're simply free to do as you wish whether it's fishing, farming, hunting for bugs to donate to the museum or decorating your house: the random quests are generally easy enough and provide a steady income for you to invest on the island, a few ones (like catching a certain fish or farming one of the crops with long timers) can be a bit dull but can always be skipped with currency.\n\nIt's charming graphics and light-hearted take on the genre also makes the game perfect for a younger audience especially considering its gameplay is easy to learn and open to letting you be as creative as you want with how you put objects, flowers and trees in the various areas.\n\nAll things considered Castaway Paradise is a good purchase if you like the genre especially considering there's not many games like this one around on PC: it'll provide a good amount of content to keep you-and any family members- busy.","November 6, 2015","true","25.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

There's also an inbound economy rebalance, plus the developers are still actively weeding out cheaters on the leaderboards despite CP being an older title now.\n\nEasily good for 40 hours of play, but once you hit around level 25 it becomes a major grind to reach level 34 and unlock the final flower to complete the Steam achievements, most of which could be obtained several dozen hours prior to that final one.

You get your own residence, you can chop down, plant or grow almost anything you want. You are assigned a small farm plot for crops and the residents will offer you different types of quests. Fishing is very easy to do although I never found a use for upgrading the fishing rod, its a slow process so I almost always had 7+ charges remaining and the fish are very scattered so its hard to use up all the charges before finding more fish. Items have a charge limit on them for example the water can starts off with 10/10 and when you use water it goes down but recharges overtime at 45 seconds per unit. This can be frustrating while trying to grow more than 2 tomatoes which can require 7 water units per tomato. I had my water can fully upgraded and everything required water, I was constantly waiting for it to refill as paying 3750 to refill it seemed too pricey especially since I built the TOWN WATER WELL!!! This is no longer an issue once your 15 so avoid farming things like tomatoes early and sve yourself the headache.\n\nI do love this game though, I was always baffled that no one made anything like Animal Crossing for the PC. This game fills that niche and does so very well. Give it an hour and see for yourself, if you dislike it request a refund but you will probably end up staying like most everyone else :)","August 14, 2015","true","87.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/compujosh/recommended/304950/","compujosh","compujosh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/compujosh/","807 products in account","I'm very close to giving this game a recommendation, but I think it needs a few tweaks/more content to be worth it, even on sale. I'm a long time fan of the Animal Crossing franchise, so I was excited when I heard that a clone of it was available for mobile and PC. I grabbed the mobile one and got frustrated with the f2p junk but had a good time for a while anyway. Then I grabbed the steam version cheap, had fun for a few hours, and then got bored. (Update: it's fun for an hour or two at a time still)\n\nCastaway Paradise has all the right features, but they lack depth:\n\n-I can upgrade my silo to hold more food! But why would I want to when all I can do is sell it anyway? I can't get more seeds, I can't use it as fertilizer, and I can only use it for quests once in a  while. It'd be nice to be able to choose between selling, turning into seeds, and something else.\n-There's a catalog where I can order most items I need right away, which removes the challenge from it. Even a minute wait with a delivery animation would be nice. Also I don't see much point to using the shop when I have the catalog everywhere and I can sell all my items for the same price in many different places. Cheaper prices in-store would be nice, as well as specialized vendors who will pay more for certain items\n-I like how fruit is automatically added to my inventory when the space is occupied by flowers or something, but it would be nice if I didn't have to click the green check mark every time I pick a fruit. It would probably be best if the green check mark step were removed altogether.\n-There's a nice selection of items, but I don't just want to look at my house, I want to interact with it too. I can't even sit in my chairs or bed.\n-The VIP section of my house looks nice, but it's totally out of place inside of what's supposed to be a tent... and why is part of MY house roped off? Give me a model home to tempt me and make the VIP section an upgrade like the other (but still needs VIP to unlock). I'd like to add more space to my rooms and add rooms, not just remove stuff blocking existing rooms.\n-The stock market is very cool, but 3 stocks isn't enough and a buying limit of 20 is too low. Make it a single screen/chart with lots of stock options and/or add 2 stock tables for less advanced players.\n-[Edit: This has been fixed/added] The graphics look nice, but could use an update considering this is PC. At least let me run it in a window\n-I like the idea of the investment system, but needs rebalancing. I don't want to wait longer for less interest, either increase the % as time goes up or show the difference in terms of gems to make it feel like more time=more money.\n-The high score table is kinda nice, but when people have maxed it out just in the past week for every insect/fish, it could use some work. Add a greater variation and increase the rarity of getting a really big one.\n-It's nice that tools are separated from my inventory and can be upgraded, but I don't want to use the axe often, let me store it or something so it defaults to the water can when near a tree\n-High scores seem to be the only multiplayer feature. Please add online multiplayer at some point\n\nI think this game would work best as a mobile, time wasting game. Make the mobile version the same payment model as Steam (one purchase, gems instead of gold, VIP unlock at level 15) and I'd recommend that instead of the Steam version. Make the other changes I mentioned above, and I'd highly recommend either version.\nAs it is, I'd say just stick with Animal Crossing New Leaf.","January 19","false","15.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I mean it even says so on their website.\n\nHowever, don't let that dissuade you from giving the game a chance though. There was a lot of work put into this game by the developer and I'd like to point that out.\n\nFree to play games on a mobile platform tend to be frowned upon, however, you have to remember that this is a business. There is just more money in a freemium version of a game and the reach it gives is ten fold. Allow anyone to jump in and get something out of a game for free, then setting up options for a way to accelerate at what ever pace they're comfortable at is perfectly fine.\n\nNow, this becomes an issue when porting a mobile freemium version of a game over to a paid platform like pc. When you charge for a game you have to remove all that. Which is what Castaway Paradise does.\n\nEverything that was once a paid for option is available in the game, you still have to earn the money to purchase everything, but it's there. (Insert applause track) so many games don't do this. They still try to keep the pay to play options in WHILE charging you. Which the folks at Stolen Couch Games didn't do.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/WvpIJRRhzaQ\n\nOnto the gameplay!\n\nCastaway Paradise is a fun 'Animal Crossing' like game. If you like exploring, farming, questing, and just generally living an alternate life like you're a traveling salesman with a family in Albion and Pittsburg then you'll be right at home.\n\nYou wash ashore as a lost hopeless human on an island full of anthropomorphic creatures and must assimilate to their ways. Plant flowers, catch bugs, do whatever you feel like doing at the moment.\n\nThe controls are a little janky, but I have faith the developer will work that out. As they've already patched in a way to zoom in and out.\n\nIf you need a little Island of Dr. Moreau in your life and like 'Animal Crossing' then Castaway Paradise is your game.\n\nFor more Reviews check out http://www.EarlyAccessMedia.com, http://www.EarlyAccessPodcast.com and http://www.youtube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","May 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","1"

At the time of my review, the main parts of the game seem to be all finished. However, the developers are very active and are constantly fixing bugs, adding content, and taking suggestions from its players seriously - this is a very welcoming addition!\n\nAs stated, it pulls a lot of its ideas from the very popular Animal Crossing game, and I would go as far to say Harvest Moon as well. However, this game does manage to stand apart from both of those with its own little specialities. The game is very easy to pick up and play, and also very easy to step away and come back to later. It gives players incentive to log in daily for special rewards, and incorporates a Leaderboard system with finding collectables.\n\nI would rate this an 8/10 in its current state.

I've never played Animal Crossing, but I have played Farmville and Castleville on fb. This is quite similar. I love games like this even if I do have to wait a few minutes for flowers to pop up or quests to be done. If you're like me though you just find other things to do while you're waiting. But you can do quest after quest for hours. There's always something to do.\n\nCon about this game? The walking.... I've never spent so much time trying to walk around, finding people and accepting quests. Sure you can zoom out and see where they are, but it takes FOREVER going back and forth. I wish they would just have a feature where the quest explains itself right then and there, so you don't have to keep wandering to accept them.\n\nA little tip for this game, when you pick up trash, find bugs, fish etc. Keep them for a while before selling them. You don't know how many times I've accidentally sold something and then find out I needed it for a quest. One quest asks for seven tires, and I've sold a lot already. So now I just have to run around and wait for some to respawn which could take days. Quests I could have finished early, I had to wait to finish because I was trying to make some extra gems >.>\n\nOther than that, I do recommend this game. I'm not sure if it's worth the entire $14.99, I bought it for $10.

I don't want to compare it to Animal Crossing since this gives me a whole different feeling, although it takes at least 80% of its ideas from Animal Crossing, down to even the 'tear drop' fish texture, which is nice. (Before continuing i only ever played Animal Crossing up until New Leaf so, if im wrong, help me out XD)\n\nThis game gives more of a reason to progress by giving the player a 'VIP' status at lvl 15, multiple areas to open up and heaps of furniture to unlock and buy at will rather than collecting like in Animal Crossing, which can be both a good or bad thing depending on personal opinion. but PERSONALLY i'd rather it be a collectable thing so i can show off the furniture i got over heaps of returning to the games shop and finding it in there.\n\nThe game looks very pretty, (and i saw something about a HD Retexture in the future?) the art style is so modern day, GameCube Animal Crossing, which is what originally made me want to buy the game.\n\nThere is a large variety of furniture and decor to put everywhere so you can really make the entire island themed to the way you want to theme it, which is awesome.\n\nSome things you may want to note are; The NPC's in this game, are so dull and boring. you will talk to them alot for quests etc... but you wont ever use the standard, random dialogue option, as it's usually pointless and boring. so don't buy this game expecting to get an emotional bond with any of the NPC's, to my knowledge they aren't random, so you will have the same people every game. The wait timers can be a little annoying, but there is an option to speed it up using gems. (This is not a paywall game, it seems like it once was due to all the features left behind, but they have completely removed any form of paywall and everything is VERY easily accessable using all in game money and time etc... )\n\nTL;DR This game is an awesome game for both casual gamers and die hard fans of the Animal Crossing series. the wait timers seem to make sense since you are growing something, and it gives progression to the game. pick it up on sale if you aren't sure, but if you like all the things mentioned above, then you should definately pick this up.","April 15","true","13.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

You care for a village, plant stuff, do tasks for your people etc. As a fan of AC I played all the versions, from the Gamecube to the Wii, not forgetting the handheld versions. Somehow the Harvest Moon series never 'clicked' for me, didn't like the very tight schedule (you sneeze and it's nighttime already! Wow!) and the marrying thing. My World, my rules.\n\nSo yeah as a 'veteran' of those casual no brain farm games, I highly recommend Castaway Paradise. You'll be planting, harvesting, chatting, pulling weeds, fishing, catching bugs, filling a museum etc The graphics are lush and colorful. The blocky look is very well done, it looks like a Lego world made 10 times more beautiful, or like a MySims in HD. The camera is fixed and you can only zoom in and out - but it's way enough. You mainly play with the mouse, can also move with the arrows. The world looks alive with bugs flying by and the NPCs walking around, it's really fun to watch. The system uses the internal clock just like Animal Crossing and each new day new stuff appears: herbs, trash, rocks, there's also a daily tasks system which is really well done. The map is very handy, scrollable and animated.\n\nYou can only have 3 quests at the same time - plus the daily tasks which are numerous - and each villager have quests more or less specific to his character. The best one is definetly Angus, a grumpy ape, because some of his specific quests are the opposite of what the other villagers ask you to do: destroy flowers! (That others required you to plant!) He always give you bonus trash - which you can sell, or dump! The quests texts are all fun, the birdie character always reminding you that she has no opposable thumbs so it's up to you to do her shores, Angus always nagging about the others, the mayor who keeps partying all the time... Really cool. They all feel totally different, with different texts.\n\nSure it has flaws: For one it lacks a lot of sounds, like when you walk or when you talk to someone; I often think there's a problem with the settings and go check the options. And unlike Animal Crossing there's no night and no weather (except snow on the ground). There's no celebrations for events like for Christmas for example but there's special sets of items available and deco spread out - like snow, Christmas trees, snowmen etc. There's also no move-in or move-out: your population is static.\n\nReading some other reviews I was worried of the mobile version leftovers like time counters and limitations, nag screens and such but didn't find anything hair pulling: yes the tools have to 'reload' their charges/uses but they reload really fast - in fact it makes so much sense that it's disappointing that the reload is removed at level 15, they should have left it in until the end. Plus you can upgrade your tools if you really want to have a faster reloading before that level 15 (just buy them at the shop). All the prices are reasonable, and just like AC you'll soon be wading in dough. Sure, it's not Animal Crossing, but hey it's not Nintendo either; it's an indie game, and those devs surely deserve some money and recognition!\n\nI really like it, it's relaxing and lighthearted. You'll launch it for 5 minutes and still be playing an hour later :). No zombies, no super mutants, no dreadful choices to make; just some trees to shake and fishes waiting for ya, silly texts to read... It's the perfect game to unwind. Plus there's a LOT of stuff to find and collect, you'll need a lot of time to find everything!\n\nSimilar casual game on PC: Wandering Willows. And 'somehow' similar series: The Island Castaway, MyTribe, Virtual Villagers, Island Tribes, Farm Up, MySims. It's hard finding this type of game on PC, it's more tailored for console games.","January 1","true","22.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/304950/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","* Key provided by the developer.\n\nCastaway Paradise is sold as an RPG, but really, the only RPG element I see in it is the questing. I would compare it more closely with a social game or even a mobile game than any actual RPG. There’s no enemies, and no story beyond “You’ve washed up on the shore of this island and now you can help the people rebuild and make it your own home”.\n\nThe menu is lacking in the same way mobile and social games are, there’s no sliders for volume, just mute or unmute things, no windowed mode options, though alt+enter provides you a window the exact same size your resolution.\n\nStarting the game, the music was decent, but repetitive. What sound effects there are are also rather typical of the kind of game. I also wasn’t completely sold on the graphical aspect of the characters, which is an undecidedly blocky 3D version of animals/humans, but I did like the aspect of the island/items/everything that wasn’t characters and clothes. The clothes designs were cute, but I still didn’t like the characters shape, which really ruined the looks of the otherwise cute designs.\n\nOn Castaway Paradise you can take quests from the villagers, farm crops, catch fish and bugs, shake trees, plant trees and flowers, cut trees, pick up weeds and trash to clean up the place, dust off cobwebs, upgrade buildings a couple times and decorate the island and your home, and then some I probably forget. There’s also a bank that will allow you to earn some extra money for using it, as well as a mini stocks market that’s not really too difficult to use at all. You can also unlock new spots to visit on the island, which isn’t overly large to begin with.\nIt’s all rather nice, and I appreciate that it has something more to do than just plant crops or just do quests, but it doesn’t feel terribly fulfilling until you start decorating the island and your house.\n\nThe crops and things you plant have a timer on them, as with all social games, which means you can’t play when ‘you’ want but have to wait around until the game decides the crops are ready.\nSome of the tools have a ‘stamina’ meter, a certain amount of times you can use it per x time, that refills overtime. This goes away when you reach level 15 and become “VIP”, which was their way of removing the need for micro transactions. This also unlocks more shop items, cheaper items (“discount”) in the shop, etc.\n\nThe game does have something kind of addictive to it, and I did enjoy my playthrough, which is why I recommend it, but despite it, it ends up being boring and, at the risk of sounding redundant, repetitive. Why? Well...\n\nStarting by the fact that the quests are all the same: plant x of this, pick y of that, take this to z, talk to w; rinse and repeat as there’s only so many characters. The rewards they give (xp, sometimes items and pieces to unlock new areas of the island, and gems/money) are not really worth the time. The money you make from them sometimes ends up being more than what you need for the quest - for instance: Decorate the island, where you have to place two chairs that are worth three times as much as the reward. Granted, you can pick up and resell if you only want to finish the quest, but you only get part of the money back.\nThe quests can also not be cancelled, at least not that I’ve seen, thus you’re stuck with either gathering enough money to buy the things they want you to get so you can finish the quest (or waiting however many hours for crops when you want to play NOW), or gathering enough money to pay off to “fast finish” the quest, which is also kind of expensive. Since you can’t really preview and accept or reject the quests, and since you can only have 3 going at a time, it gets really boring.\n\nPlanting and selling crops also doesn’t shield much money when you take into account some of the crops take 11+ real time hours to be ready… on stage 1. Some have more than 1 stage, though you can choose to pick them while they’re smaller rather than let them grow to its fullest.\n\nMeanwhile, upgrading the buildings and purchasing things is quite pricey in comparison. It’s not impossible, but it’s kind of annoying. In the long term, it almost seems more worth it to stand by the stocks and wait for them than wait for crops and do quests, and neither turns out being overly fun after the first few rounds. Even catching bugs or fishing, which are the most interesting aspect, get tiresome.\n\nThere is a little annoying ‘bug’ that if I try for my character to go somewhere else while it’s running an animation, it will get “stuck” in that direction and when it stops doing the animation it will walk the way he was looking instead of the way I’m telling it to, but it’s hardly game breaking. I do, however, wish you could stack things to do (so do this, then water crops, then come over here kind of thing).\n\nOn the upside, the game has some free DLCs that add a bit of (shop) content, and they also run events. They have leaderboards for the collectables/bugs/fish you catch, and it is kind of a cute game, all things considered, but it is the kind of game you go onto for an hour or two and then get tired with.\n\nRecommended: Yes, if you like social games and don’t mind it being terribly repetitive after the first few quests (which I guess you don’t, if you like social games ;) )","October 11, 2015","true","11.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Buildings are predeturmined and in shambles and visible until you finish building them. Farming currency is a game of waiting for your watering can to spawn more water.\n- The UI is still optimized for the phone and is thus needlessly large and clunky.\n- With the exception of wasd for walking you must use the mouse for everything.\n- All items are available from your inventories 'catalog', rendering the town store pointless.

Think animal crossing mixed with some Farmville mixed with some harvest moon.  Don't expect the addictive game play of Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing.  Those games have deeper characters and game play where you feel personally attached to the game and characters, this game makes me feel more like an errand boy who washed up on an island where people are more concerned about their own inability to get simple tasks done instead of why you washed up on the shore covered in seaweed.  The game feels like it is a money grabbing Facebook game like Farmville, but I have yet to hit a wall where I have to buy anything with any form of "premium" currency.  So far it feels more like someone had me pay upfront to unlock all the premium items instead.  Two things that REALLY makes it feel like a Facebook game more than a purchased game, for me at least, is that you get a daily login bonus and you have to wait until a higher level to become a "VIP".\n\nThe game play is pretty basic, and at times the "quests" seem pretty repetitive.  There will be times where one character asks you to deliver an item to another character who is literally standing 3 steps away, but I can't fault the game for this because the character wander freely.  I do wish there was some more diversity included with regards to crops, tasks, other aspects.  Don't have me run back and forth 80 times delivering items from one random character to a different random character while I'm waiting for crops to grow.\n\nI also don't really like the fact that actions (like watering) is limited by "stamina" that regenerates at a rate of 1 per 50 seconds.  This seems trivial of me to pick on, but I feel like the reason I paid for a game like this was so that I wasn't stuck waiting on games that Facebook has for free which limit your actions due to energy or stamina.  You can refill "stamina" by using standard in game currency, but it gets a little frustrating.\n\nI know so far I mentioned a lot of negatives, but there are also positives.  The game itself is cute.  It's a good concept that mixes Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, and Farmville.  I like that you can buy things from a catalog instead of waiting for items to randomly be in stock at the store.  I also like that there are areas of the island to unlock as the game progresses.\n\nI have to also say it was nice to play a game of this style where you aren't stuck at the beginning playing a really long tutorial or having to hoard items to reach the next point.  Goals (such as upgrading buildings and unlocking areas) are easily attainable so you can enjoy the game more than worrying about hoarding an item just to get to the next part.\n\nI have to say that the game has it's positives and it's negatives.  If I had played this game first would I have still purchased it...... maybe if it was on sale for a bit more off...\n","May 20, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Almost 600 hours on Animal Crossing New Leaf and counting.\n\nIf you are an Animal Crossing fan, you will love Castaway Paradise. While it's not exactly AC, its very similar. I just start playing and get surprised at how much time I play in every session. It's a kid and casual friendly game that you can play at your own pace, so it makes it very relaxing. The graphics and characters are nice, maybe not very appealing on the beginning, but they become more charming once you get into the game. Now with the PROS and CONS list.\n\nPROS\n-Lots of clothing that don't require storage/inventory space. You can have EVERYTHING.\n-Being able to place furniture inside and outside your house. You can decorate all the island with furniture.\n-No Micro-transactions. Really. If it had them, I wouldn't have bought the game to start with it. It was requested during the Greenlight process. And devs listened!\n-Free DLC items every now and then.\n-Daily gifts just for playing.\n-Unlocking zones, clothing and furniture through gameplay.\n-WADS Controls. Despite being a mobile/Facebook port, you can use keyboard and mouse to play instead of just mouse.\n-Very responsive Dev team. Stolen Couch Games is doing great in comunicating with players, solving bugs and implementing realistic player suggestions -even saying if some aren't reachable at the moment-.\n-Different settings that allow a better playing experience -for example, you can toggle on/off the option to bypass farming timers by paying Gems, the in-game currency-. When it comes to options, the more, the merrier :D\n-Easy farming system.\n-Quests. Simple questing that helps you level faster. Similar to AC's errands.\n-Neighbours don't go away if you don't play every day. Never!!\n-You can have up to three game slots. So if you feel like restarting the game, you aren't forced to delete your main character.\n\nCONS\n-You can only have three active quests at a time. I don't like using Gems to complete quests, though I don't mind waiting until more weeds respawn (daily), but if I have two quest asking me to remove weeds... I guess you get my point.\n-Too few neighbours. Would like to see some more.\n-Only one face for your characters, and no hair color selection -you can buy different hair styles, but each one has its own hair color-.\n-You can't choose a different skin tone. Would be nice to have a few more options -just one more pale and more dark could do the trick for me.\n-It could use more music. Game has only one song. Probably this is because it has a mobile/Facebook version.\n\nDespite the few CONS, I would definetely buy the game if I hadn't already made it. They don't make the game any less enjoyable and the PROS outweigh them. Also the game was on sale for 50% despite being in Steam only for a month or so when the summer offers kicked in.","June 22, 2015","true","134.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After starting out though I fell in love with the game.

Just like you would the fish, bugs and fossils of the former.\nYou get rid of weeds, can grow and harvest different fruit trees to sell just like in the former as well.\nThe main difference that makes me love this game though is the slow build up. You slowly do quests for the villagers, making money that in turn lets you unlock sections of the island one at a time. From there you also use the money to rebuild and furnish the island. The quest feature is really nice and it's an enjoyable change that gives the game a greater feeling of depth than what Animal Crossing did on its own.\n\nI got this on sale and I can see some people maybe not liking the price, but if you love Animal Crossing and quest time features and tasks like some Facebook games have, then this is the game for you.","June 26, 2015","true","22.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can also customise your character with different costumes and outfits. Upgrade your home from a tent to a mansion. You will always b busy.\n\nThe major point that drew my attention to this game was the fact that they are not putting microtransactions into the Steam version. You can play this for free on android devices etc but they include the IAP's. This versioin doesn't and according to the Devs it never will.\n\nSo if you like a casual game inwhich you grow an island and do a little farming then this may just be for you. It's not an action packed thrill ride but it's very addictive and nice to play while chilling out.","November 3, 2015","true","12.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordicco/recommended/304950/","lordicco","Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordicco/","203 products in account","I wrote a review for Castaway Paradise awhile back, but it's since then updated, so I'd like to renew my views on it. Originally I don't think I posted anything worth reiterating, but my main point is this: I do believe the Steam edition is the best edition to follow. I'm not sure if the Facebook and iOS/Android version still contains microtransactions, but this version does not. Nor does it contain an energy bar as of recent updates!\n\nThis is a game I was looking forwards to for quite a few years. Originally, I was very pleased with it, and for reasons I totally forgot, fell out of love with it very quickly. While it still needs a lot of love to be a nice Animal Crossing substitute ((especially now that rather certain popular farming + dating simulator game has come out)), it's not half bad. It still needs quite a few things to have a nice polished feeling, but over the years and lots of free DLC and nice seasonal updates, it's changed a lot since the last time I've poked my head in.\n\nI haven't gotten waist-deep yet, but it's nice to have something that isn't counting down the seconds and forcing you to preplan your in-game days. It's a nice little collecting and decorating simulation with the option to quest.\n\nThese are some recommendations I have for future development, some of which are already in development or been recognized by developers. But I'd still like to bring attention to them:\n\n-Villagers could have the same set spawns for their houses, but interchangable, which would give a slight illusion of "random" villagers. This would save the developers time considering it wouldn't be randomly placed homes that would cause obstruction of objects.\n-Multiplayer.\n-The chatroom feature of the mobile versions would make this game livelier. Perhaps having a minimizable, or completely optional, universal chatbox?\n-Footstep and dialogue sound effects would greatly enhance the immmersion of this game for me.\n-Seasonal fish and bugs, and overrall more variety.\n-Rainy days, and night and day cycle. In my eyes, this is one of the most immersive aspects of Animal Crossing and simulation games as a whole.\n-More music variety.\n-I know it's on it's way, but controller support.\n-More villagers would be nice!\n-Updated and less mobile-like UI. At times, actions can be unresponsive or finicky.\n-Being able to sit in chairs or lay in beds!\n\nHonestly, it's nice to mute the music ((since there's only one track seemingly)), put on an Animal Crossing playlist, and do the dailies, quests, cleaning up the island, fishing, etc. It's not too in depth and I would agree that it's an "Animal Crossing lite" of sorts. And while I've, like many others, mentioned the AC-title multiple times in this review, it does seem to stand on it's own.\n\nMy TL;DR would be, if you can look through the rough, you might find a diamond, but it's still in the process of being polished. I like Castaway Paradise though!","March 29","true","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can plant fruit trees and flowers, catch bugs and fish, decorate your home, change your appearance. You earn gems that can be used to upgrade your home and fix up the island.\n\nMy biggest gripes are that there is no day/night cycle (as of yet), and there is only one song, which really starts to grind on you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisizeful/recommended/304950/","chrisizeful","chrisizeful","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisizeful/","1137 products in account","Summary:Castaway Paradise is a game that offers Farmville / Animal Crossing style gameplay with beautiful visuals. There are many quests and activities to do, such as farming, fishing, building, catching bugs, and more. Your ultimate goals are to repair the bridges connecting all three of the large islands, repair all of the buildings on the islands, and complete the quests given to you by the NPCs. The only downsides are that there are a few bugs, some quests can be a bit boring, and some tasks have too long of a wait time.\nThe Good:    Good music.\nAchievements.\nMany NPCs with their own dialogue.\nLarge island. There are three separate islands, all connected by bridges. You start on one of the islands and can unlock the others by repairing the broken bridges once you have enough pieces, which are acquired by doing quests (or by purchasing them). They all have many things to do on them.\nLots of different quests. There are four main NPCs that give quests, and another one that is DLC. There are plenty of different quest types that offer a variety of entertaining tasks.\nMany activities. Such as planting trees or food, chopping down trees, mining rocks, catching bugs, repairing buildings, talking to NPCs, fishing, and more.\nNo micro-transactions! Previously, micro-transactions were included in Castaway Paradise, however they have since been removed!\nBeautiful colors, visuals and animations. The graphics are very bright and nice looking. They are quite appealing to the eyes.\nFree DLC. The DLCs include purchasable in-game furniture, with different themes, and a new villager that can give you quests.\nContinuous support and updates. Even after the initial release, the developers continue to put out frequent content updates and patches.\nCharacter customization. You can dress up your character with stylish hats, glasses, shirts, pants and shoes.\nCustomizable house. You can expand your home, and buy a bunch of different furniture to decorate it.The Bad:    Some very bland quests. 'Catch this certain, very rare, bug / fish.' 'Plant some crops.' 'Run and talk to this guy.'\nHard to get enough money sometimes. While saving up for different things in the world, such as a house upgrade, rebuilding something, or buying new cosmetic items, it can take quite some time.\nBugs and glitches. A very, very annoying bug that happened to me while I playing was that one of the main characters teleported over to a non-accessible area. I restarted the game and he was still stuck. This prevented me doing a lot of quests and progressing further into the game. After a few hours he teleported back over.\nLong wait times. Whenever you do a task, you must wait a certain amount of time for it to be completed. The majority of these times are fine, but some are just ridiculous.","September 7, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

An obvious copy of Animal Crossing.\n\nIt's amazing that not even partial controller support is present, given the type of play. However, there is enough charm and busywork here to look past that.\n\nThe world is charming, and there is enough to do. It's geared toward casual gamers, and should serve them fairly well. It's funny that you can't customize your character in the beginning, yet there is a ton of customizing everything later on.\n\nVersus the price point of under 5 bucks (I bought it on sale) I would give it a thumbs up. Versus the 14 bucks it normally is? I'd say it's iffy. And yes, I do include the price point in considering my review. I think it matters.\n\nOverall this is a borderline time waster for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Creamette/recommended/304950/","Creamette","Emiko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Creamette/","705 products in account","[TL;DR at the bottom]\nSo I have not played much of this as of yet, but this was a rare occassion when I played. Let me explain. You see, I'm the type that gets bored with things quickly. It's hard to keep my attention, so I'll play games 1 hour at a time, usually. But this game? I thought I had been playing for 2 hours, had been playing for 4 hours.\n\nBut anyhow. I'll be doing this review with things I deem as pros and cons, you may not like some of my pros and may like some of the cons. There will also be 'Ehs' which are ~. These things have pros, but cons too.\n\nPros:\n+For starters, the artstyle is just.. MWAH! Is sublime ladies and gentlemen, you can see it from the screenshots. It's just perfect for a game like this.\n+Collecitbles! Again, perfect for a game like this, especially when you can put 'em into your house! Speaking of which...\n+Your house isn't started off being a big house. It has 3 tiers. You start off with a tent that has a smallish room and you can see the rooms you can unlock. You spend gems (the currency) to upgrade your house to a house. Then once you become a VIP (which I haven't gotten to yet) it can become a mansion.\n+Fairly big map\n+Varied NPCs\n+Great game to play in short bursts\n+Amazing timekiller\n+Great soundtrack and SFX, they perfectly compliment the artstyle.\n+Nice amount of outfit customization and furniture.\n+Ability to decorate the island how you like is pretty damn cool.\n+Fishing and bug collecting is done well I feel.\n+The leveling and XP system is cool, makes alot of things feel rewarding and worth doing.\n+Daily 'log-in' rewards. Gives you a reason to keep coming back everyday, always like that.\n\nCons:\n-A bit too grindy. It takes quite a while to get gems and most things cost quite a bit. I personally like grinding, but it's a tad too much as it is.\n-Parts of the map are locked off, but if you asked me, it feels like too much of it is and it takes too long to get to. You see, you have to collect 'Puzzle pieces' to get to other areas in the map. To get to those areas you need 9 of these puzzle pieces which you can get from certain quests (which aren't too common) and by paying 2500 gems. But as I said, gems aren't easy to grind so again - a bit too grindy.\n-As with all games, I say the same thing, it's always a con if it doesn't have character creation unless there's a set character story.\n-There are 'waiting periods' where you have to wait for actions to go through, like waiting for a tree to grow fully or a building to upgrade. It makes sense, but I personally think there should be some way around it, like paying gems to speed it up.\n-From what I've seen so far (if someone can confirm/deny this it'd be appreciated) there seems to be no night/day cycle. Always day and also no seasons.\n\nEhs:\n~'Stamina' So you have tools to use in order to do things. Axe to chop trees, watering can to grow plants and saplings, pickaxe to remove rocks, etc. But they have uses, for an example - the pickaxe. By default, the axe has 5 'Stamina points' as I'll call them, which are essentially 'uses' It takes two uses/Stamina points to remove one rock. You can 'refill' your points once you've used them all by using gems, but it tends to be expensive. They regenerate overtime, but I feel it takes a bit too long.\n~Farming. Now farming is actually a fun thing to do on the side and works well with the waiting periods, BUT I feel like the rewards from doing it make it not worth it. I don't feel like it pays off enough.\n~The UI. I dunno, just don't know how I feel about it, it's just.. 'Eh'\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI will possibly update this when I play this more and reach the VIP tier (which I believe you get at level 15).\n\n[TL;DR]: It's essentially the closest damn thing you'll get to Animal Crossing on PC without an emulator and I know people will disagree with this, but I think it's done better than Animal Crossing in quite a few ways. So if you're a fan of Animal Crossing and/or looking for a game to spend time in just wasting time, there's quite a bit of content in this. I'd recommend it, BUT it's definetly not for all gamers, of course.","September 7, 2015","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I still don't like that you can access the catalog and buy anything from anywhere (making the shop redundant). But most of all I hate that the PC version of this game still has the VIP mode in it. Essentially if you play the game, when you reach level 15 you are awarded with a bunch of perks. The first perk being quite a lot of items which, although would be nice if you got one of two as a reward, is just too many for such a measly achievement. Another perk is that you have unlimited water in the watering can and infinite stamina for the pickaxe. I think this is stupid and completely takes the work and graft from the game. By that I mean, although it takes the same amount of work, it is much faster to do things which ruins the pacing of the game (and is also completely unnecessary for PC). It also give you a 20% discount from the shop and free items every week. This seems stupid and actually makes the items and gems in the games seem cheap and less desirable. I still recommend the game but I do wish that the developers take heed in the reviews and can make changes where necessary to ultimately improve the game and make it worth buying of PC without ramming a bunch of items and gems in our faces.","November 2, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each NPC's that inhabit the island has a different personality and the random dialogues make me smile mostly of the time because of how casual and silly they are.\n\nThe NPC's also gives quests to you rewarding with items, gems, puzzle pieces and xp. The quests are very simple, like growing crops, delivering things to another NPC's, catching specifics bugs/fishes and so on. So it's perfect for that time you want a more casual thing to play. The game incentive you to logging everyday to receive awards like more customization packs, items and etc I'm not fond on it but in the end it doesn't bother me because the developers keep adding more and more content in the game, like seasonal events and theme packs all for free.\n\nIn the end I'm having a positive experience with the game, it's fun, colorful and my young brother likes to play it with me so that's a huge plus for me.

Now that's a nice person, she grabs a old tent and bang you have a place to live (and decorate). You have so many other characters around, Gustave, Amelia, Angus, Francis and many others, but the storm that caused you to be shipwrecked also tore up the island. Can you show your spirit and help get things back in order? Sure you can!!\n\nCastaways Paradise is a fun little game for all ages. It gets it base playability from Animal Crossing Genre. All the characters you interact with are a animal of some sort. Each of course with their own unique personality, and each with a TON of jobs that need to be done. Of course since you the new resident you decide to help them. The jobs may be as simple as pulling up weeds and planting crops or flowers. To fishing and catching bugs, and collecting Seashells.\nThere is even a museum that can be accessed (after you repair the bridge) to help start making collections of these items, so the residents of the island can enjoy looking at all the varieties (and there are a lot)\nSo much to do, So many seasons...what you say, seasons? Yes the game actually changes over time as the real world calander progresses.\n\nThe developer has made this a specific point that this version of the game has  NO MICROTRANACTIONS.  So no additional cash layout for the base game. Another thing is that since the game has been released the developers have released not one, not two, but FOUR (so far) totally  FREE DLC  packs for this game (with more on the way).\nShow me another developer that has done that. Once you get to level 15 in the game you become the coveted V.I.P.\nWith this status you now get even more FREE goodies plus have access to a larger area of your house and can purchase (with in game gems) special items that V.I.P.'s only can get. Oh by the way, did I mention that for just playing the game each day you get FREE stuff, and with V.I.P. status you get special stuff free each week.\n\nWell this game gets my THUMBS UP.

Offers similar gameplay mechanics suchs as fishing, farming, shopping, socializing with townspeople, etc. Recieves free DLC and updates on occassions and the developer communicates well regarding upcoming features, fixes and addresses and listens to feedback actively. Most importantly, no microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It seems worthy of a purchase as the features of the Free to play alternative hidden behind a paywall are NOW available to ALL via the reward system by simply progressing through the game on the Steam (PC) version. Not a cent to pay outside of the game's initial asking price.\n\nHowever, if I had to point out a negative, I'd say the game suffers to a great bit from repetitive quest system, which is used as a method of introducing and advancing the world for the player (you earn rewards, such as gems, in-game currency, to pay to build, unlock the rest of the island and other cosmetic items - no microtransactions!), despite the fact I think that, in theory, this is a nice system of rewarding the player and ensuring a longer playthrough of the game, the quests themselves are repetitive fetch quests and lack any originality and become somewhat tiresome. I feel these could be renovated with more variety to create a more diverse experience by introducing more varied objectives and a deeper backstory to help aid the quest system and maybe offer more depth to the world and characters, to help make them stand out further and help ease the player through and motivate them to care about completing these objectives for the character instead of doing it for gems (or optionally skipping WITH paying gems).\n\nI definitely think the game could stand to take more notes from Animal Crossing. This is a great game at the moment, but still lacks the depth by comparison and I think needs to add more dynamic to the island and it's characters, such as characters moving out and in to the town, weather system, day/night system, and other dynamic features as it will eventually become stale once you've completed played through enough of the games current content and a few changes here and there might work well enough to hold you on for a bit longer.\n\nNevertheless, the developer has promised to add more features and fixes to the game and listens to feedback. Maybe this review will even help. Who knows? I am still pleased with the game, despite it's flaws and missing features by comparison to Animal Crossing and hope that in time it grows to become a worthy competitor and offer even more depthful gameplay mechanics.\n\nIt's a cute, fun game and it does the majority of what it does well, but could stand to make the game better as it has massive potential for more.","August 26, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Also, you have an experience meter that levels up by solving quests given by the characters or doing simple chores like pulling weeds, breaking rocks, planting flowers, trees or vegetable seeds; the more you level up the more you unlock goods and even other parts of the island. But there's also plenty of Animal Crossing "touches" there, like anthro animal villagers, several themed clothing pieces and furnitures or a wide selection of bugs and fish to catch and sell, donate to a museum or use any other way you like.\n\nBut of course, the game has its own identity. The mouse + keyboard control is practical and works wonderfully. The game is filled with great humor, with lots of popular culture allusions too. One of the strongest points is the indoors and outdoors cutomizing freedom: the majority of the items and collectibles there are not limited for use only in a certain place. Too bad you can't interact with them (so far, maybe).\n\nBottomline, a worthy title for life sim or just casual gamers.","August 28, 2015","true","72.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

That's not to say this game is bad, far from it! However, this game seems more suited to be a Facebook or Tablet game than a Steam game.\n\nYou play as a boy or girl character who has washed up on an island inhabited by Animals. You are given a tent, and told to live life on the island. Similar to most openings of Animal Crossing. The gameplay involves your character performing tasks around the island on a Stamina based timer. Now, this isn't a bad thing, as it makes you feel the need to come back later and do more tasks, however, the Questing system which usually involves you doing these same tasks, is VERY repetitive. You will be given a task like: Farm 3 items, or Collect X Items. This let's the game down in my view, as this really doesn't offer much variety.\nTasks you can perform can range from Fishing to Farming. Fishing, Bug Catching and Farming are your 'Money makers', but don't expect to roll in the cash instantly. Farming is on a timer, similar to Farmville or similar Farming Apps. Fishing and Bug Catching relies on the game spawning  random insect on the island for you to catch. Same for Fishing. Fruit can be grown on trees, which again, is on Timers. You can donate Bugs, Fish and now Shells to the Museum (Once the bridge is built and you pay to rebuild the Museum) for fun, much like AC. You can rebuild Villager homes, but... This really served no purpose in my views. Some quests you are given seem to cost MORE to complete, yet, you can pay to skip the quest with your game currency and save thousands on the costs of items you had to buy. Overall, the game gets very repetitve and becomes boring, but again, this is only an opinion. Would I recommend this game? Yes. This game does have it's qualities and can be fun to return to daily, but until more content is added, there is very little to do once you have experienced everything. 7/10","August 29, 2015","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You might find this challenging your boredom tolerances if you're grinding to level 15 to have infinite use of your tools.\n\nI am really impressed with the satisfaction of gameplay, no major bugs for a game this early in development.\n\nNot so keen on quests which ask you to do stuff like clean up trash etc when the whole town is sparkling because you don't like seeing it a mess; meaning you have to wait a day for rocks, cobwebs and trash to respawn.\n\nIn a nutshell, its a somewhat entertaining freemium game with infinite use - no paying real cash to speed up events or ridiculous long waits.\n","January 8","true","65.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But like I say in my videos - I am still playing it. Unfortunately there is only Yes or No when it comes to reviews. If I were to give it a numbr value it would be about a 5.5 out of 10.\n\n\nOLD REVIEW\n================\nI loved Animal Crossing. It was a neat little game. This game seems to take all the annoying parts of that game expand on them. It takes so long to get anywhere. Hours and hours.\n\nThe NPC's get stuck on the inaccessible sides of the island so you have to restart and hope they end up back were you can access them and get your reward. To unlock the other parts of the island you have to get puzzle pieces. This would be fine if you received puzzle pieces every time or even every other time you complete a task.\n\nAnd you have to unlock all these different places. It just seems to drag on.\n\nI thought I would try the Facebook version to see if it were a little more faster paced. But I couldn't load it in Chrome and when I tried to run it full screen on my little Windows tablet in IE it choked.","September 10, 2015","true","31.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

This game has both the bug-catching and fishing elements, as well as a farming element which is quite enjoyable as well. Although some of the character and town customization options aren't exactly up to par, they do have quite a nice selection of things to choose from. The only downside is that after a certain point, the only way to unlock some of these things are to continue playing ie: logging in every day/week, and after you have run out of things to do it is hard to keep up with it.\nOnce you reach level 15 you have unlocked VIP features, which opens up access to a lot of different items but also limits your incentive to keep playing. I do still like to pop in every once in a while because I really appreciate how the developers keep updating the game. The villager designs are also incredibly adorable even if they are very few of them.\n\nOverall, it was worth the price with the amount of time I've invested in it. It is a great PC alternative to Animal Crossing and an excellent casual game to kill some time with.","July 21, 2015","true","47.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In fact, that's what people are constantly comparing it to. I was excited to get it on sale for like five bucks, but...that excitement didn't last long. I had most of the island unlocked within a day of playing, and after that, things get very repetitive.\n\nPros:\n* It is a lot like Animal Crossing, which is nice because it's a familiar gameplay mechanic. You run errands for the other villagers (quests,) catch bugs and fish to sell (or donate to the local museum,) and scavenge fruit and washed-up shells.\n* You never run out of quests, whereas in Animal Crossing it can be very hard to get the villagers to give you errands.\n* You can also farm crops, which is pretty neat.\n* Very intutive interface, so there's no 'oops that was the wrong button' moments.\n* Nice graphics that don't seem to take much to run--my computer is a joke and I've never once seen this game lag.\n* I like that, the more you play, the more furniture packs you unlock. It's also nice because you get additional prizes for logging in every week.\n* There's a banking/stock market system which, while simple, is pretty fun.\n* You can unlock other villagers, and the developers are pretty good about adding DLC packs, which, as far as I can tell, are always free.\n\nNow for the bad part...\nCons:\n* You run out of stuff to do ridiculously fast. Once you unlock the other parts of the island, is pretty disappointing to realize that there aren't any more.\n* There aren't very many villagers, which is a disappointing. I think the most you can get is six, and that's including a DLC that you have to download.\n* There aren't many fish or bugs, although I think the devs are working on adding more.\n* Your house is pretty small, even when you unlock all the areas of it.\n* Although I laughed when I read another reviewer saying that the character interactions lack depth when compared to Animal Crossing, it's actually true. In AC, when you talked to a villager, it could be engaging or at least funny. Castaway's Paradise interactions are kinda bland. Also, there are several typos in the dialogue, which is pretty cheap in a game that costs 15$. And they're stupid types like confusing 'to' with 'too.'\n* The island's pretty small, with not much to explore.\n* There are ships off the pier that have no purpose--maybe the devs are planning on makng it where you can visit other islands?\n*Timing seems to be unbalanced. It takes ten minutes to upgrade a neighbor's house, but 24 hours to grow an Artichoke to full size.\n* Given that the furniture in your house can't be interacted with at all, it makes decorating kind of boring and pointless.\n* Villagers can't move out and be replaced, and the buildings are in awkward spots.\n* There's no weather/day/night cycle, which seems a little cheap  considering the game's potential.\n* The statues all over town are in the absolute worst spots.\n* The villagers' quests can be contradicting. One asks you to plant four flowers, the next asks you to dig up six.\n* The music is a little annoying.\n* And this would have to be my biggest criticism--the price. I got it for five bucks, which, yeah, that's a good price, considering it's worth about seven. But this game's full price is $15 dollars. Honestly, it's not worth that. I may change my mind if the devs ever add new content, but as it stands, this game is full of untapped, overpriced potential that leaves the player wondering 'why am I even playing this if I'm this bored?'\n\n2/5 Stars.","February 15","false","30.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Is not as quirky and downright adorable as its source of inspiration, but it has a charm of its own that works well enough. One of the main problems is that it was originally developed for smartphones, so the PC port doesn't translate well with its interface and timed actions. It doesn't have microtransactions at all and all of its updates are entirely free, which says a lot about the development team. Worth the price if you can understand that it's not meant to be the next Animal Crossing, but rather a charming tribute with enough cotent to keep you coming back.","January 3","true","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They have unique personalities and they don't say the same thing over and over again, and sometimes they're even funny.\n\nDon't buy this unless it's on sale though, for the love of god.","April 3","true","10.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

However, I think this game needs a lot more polishing before I can recommend it to others.\n\nOne thing I like about the game is that you can buy anything you have unlocked at any time, which allows for easy freedom in decorating. However, there simply aren't enough furniture styles to make decorating interesting. For example, there's only one fridge style and one style of other kitchen furniture to match it. There just aren't many options if you like to color coordinate. Even with the theme packs obtained via DLC or daily login, decorating options feel somewhat limited.\n\nOne of my favorite Animal Crossing features is collecting all the critters. Fortunately, Castaway Paradise also allows collection of bugs, fish, and shells. Unfortunately, collecting them all is much too easy, as there are not many to collect and they are not limited to certain hours or seasons. I wish I could keep critters as pets too, but they show up on little mounts when you place them. :( (And they can't even go on the wall.)\n\nI was excited that a farming system was included, but honestly, the clunkiness makes it more of a chore than anything. There's no real benefit to growing a variety of crops, since you can't do anything but sell them. You can't cook them, eat them, or give them as gifts.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be an affection system with villagers either. The animals have rather flat personalities and seem to like (or tolerate) you just the same whether you ignore them and dump trash on the ground or talk to them and complete their quests religiously. There's no real reason to chat with them more than a few times. You can't give them gifts, and their houses never change. The lack of multiplayer contributes to the dullness of interactions within this game.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the game feels so grindy that it's just not an enjoyable journey past level 15. The quests are often too annoying to bother with, e.g. "chop down your trees and destroy your flowers!", and there's no way to reject them. Money is difficult to come by, so I feel like I have to be stingy with decorations so that I can afford to get through quests. Tool stamina is annoying and expensive to upgrade. The game is essentially Waiting Simulator, as you might expect from a mobile game (which Castaway Paradise originally was).\n\nOverall, this game just feels unfinished. I feel like I'm beta testing rather than playing a complete PC game. A price of $15 is considered unreasonable for most mobile games, as it is for this ported one. Castaway Paradise has a lot of potential and I really hope it improves to become a quality title that can compete with similar games.","January 31","false","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I initially didn't think that I'd care much for Animal Crossing, being an adult, but found it strangely addicting for a while.  Eventually that wore off to the point where I'd check 'changes' for a few minutes every day, then sliding to roughly once a week, then once a month, then several months the stopped.  I never tried any of the online components of DS Animal Crossing so I'm looking at castaway paradise and animal crossing as single player games.\n\nThe play from what I recall is very similar, upgrading house, weeding, picking up junk, etc. Let me tell you letting AC go for a few months and there were weed EVERYWHERE.\n\nThe quests in CP(castaway paradise) are pretty basic, and really seems like it would be a decent game for younger children who would probably play it more regularly as I can see myself again like in AC stopping playing so regularly after a while, but I suspect that children might play it more regularly.  It seems to be pretty safe as I haven't come across anything objectionable in the dialogs, text messages, etc.  However any child would have to be able to read or have someone else to explain things to them if they can't.\n\nSo for the price it's good and if you're looking for a PC game VERY MUCH like AC this is your ticket.  Additionally the devs still seem to be actively working on this game which in of itself is pretty rare.  By working  I mean that not only are they bug fixing but also still adding new content, which MAY help with how long I actively 'play' this.\n\nSo mostly this game is all positive for me, the only negative if you can call it that would be the quests that require puzzle pieces, 9 at a time, and those pieces are pretty rare so far IME.  You can also buy them at 2500 gems(the game currency) a pop.  Money is fairly easy to come by by picking up some trash, fishing, collecting bugs, etc. and selling it all off. Lastly I'm not sure why they call them puzzle pieces as there doesn't really seem to be any puzzle to solve.  You just click on the box, it uses a puzzle piece if you have one, and the box turns into part of a picture\n\nAh I've thought of one other possible negative.  Many larger items take a relatively LONG time for things to.  IIRC the first bridge that I unlocked via puzzle had a timer of c. 1h IIRC before you could again click on it and create the bridge.  Other mechanics in the game have similar timer mechanisms ranging from 1m at the low end I believe to 24h(so far) at the high end(bank interest mechanic). [EDIT] Again, I neglect to note that in most(all?) cases this can be circumvented by paying gems(game currency) to complete immediately... [/edit]\n\nAnd another, OK now I have 3 negatives.  Unlocked another part of the island and had a quest to unlock an arch.  Unfortunately there are 3 arches(I think, difficult to tell) on that part of the island and NONE of them are labelled -> worst case scenario to get the correct arch(and maybe miss 2 quests but it seems to let you autocomplete IF you've previously accomplished the quest requirements) would require 27 puzzle pieces: 3 arches, 9 puzzle piece a pop -> 27.  Early in the game you'd have to buy them, as as I've mentioned puzzle pieces are rare and not many are given at a time(2x was the max for me IIRC). . [EDIT] I'd forgotten the 'map' view which does label things I suppose well enough to pick out specifically which arch/etc. is meant by a particular quest... still the paucity of puzzle pieces is annoying...[/edit]","January 29","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Currently you can grow flowers, crops, catch fish and insects, collect shellfish, rebuild townies' houses, increase the size of your own house, go on quests for townies, buy outfits, furniture, carpets and wallpaper. All of these activities have level locks on the complete range of content, so depending on how you feel about content gating you'll either enjoy the farming of experience to unlock or hate it. Personally, I enjoy it.\n\nMost meaningful actions, like growing crops, have timers attached. For instance, if you save up enough money to fix a bridge to another part of the island, you'll have to wait an hour for it to be constructed. When you evolve crops, you'll have to wait whatever minutes these take to evolve after watering them. It tends to space out your experience of the content, which is fine with me as I play it maybe half an hour in one stretch. I should mention you can pay your earned gems to skip the timers, but I've never done that... yet!\n\nBasically your enjoyment of the game will come down to whether you find the townie characters charming, how much value you place on earning money to unlock/decorate the environment, and also how much you enjoy tasks like pulling weeds and watering plants.\n\nWhy I like it\nChore-based game with a community focus. The reason I come back is for helping out the island and the townies.\n\nCool bits\n+ Townies are cute and have good written dialog. If you like little in-jokes about animals and pop culture, you'll enjoy reading what your townies have to say.\n+ Some of the furniture pieces are really cool, and the devs seem comitted to adding more items/themes.\n+ Decent variety in what you can collect and farm, as well as weekly leaderboards for fish and insects.\n+ Seasonal changes, as well as holidays with special items to collect.\n+ You can place furniture and floor tiles not just inside your house, but out on the island!\n+ Devs that respond to the community hub, so who knows what might change later on?\n\nLame bits\n+ No day/night cycle. It'll always be the same time of day, which makes the island feel a little less 'alive'.\n+ Holidays and events seem to only affect the items available to purchase...\n+ Aside from giving quests, townies don't do much. You'll never find them in their house, or hanging out together.\n+ Only one music track that loops, which is a shame, since different theme music helps create an emotional connection in a game like this.\n\nUgly\n+ Being able to place floor tiles outside, but not being able to put anything on it, like a chair.","February 4","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game however, almost hit the spot.\n\nIt doesn't have the same production value, and bugs abound; but on sale for 5 bucks is exactly what you need to spend to get a decent AC demo.\n\nTL;DR: A good Animal Crossing clone 7/10","January 26","true","62.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I think this game needs a lot more polishing before I can recommend it to others.\n\nOne thing I like about the game is that you can buy anything you have unlocked at any time, which allows for easy freedom in decorating. However, there simply aren't enough furniture styles to make decorating interesting. For example, there's only one fridge style and one style of other kitchen furniture to match it. There just aren't many options if you like to color coordinate. Even with the theme packs obtained via DLC or daily login, decorating options feel somewhat limited.\n\nOne of my favorite Animal Crossing features is collecting all the critters. Fortunately, Castaway Paradise also allows collection of bugs, fish, and shells. Unfortunately, collecting them all is much too easy, as there are not many to collect and they are not limited to certain hours or seasons. I wish I could keep critters as pets too, but they show up on little mounts when you place them. :( (And they can't even go on the wall.)\n\nI was excited that a farming system was included, but honestly, the clunkiness makes it more of a chore than anything. There's no real benefit to growing a variety of crops, since you can't do anything but sell them. You can't cook them, eat them, or give them as gifts.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be an affection system with villagers either. The animals have rather flat personalities and seem to like (or tolerate) you just the same whether you ignore them and dump trash on the ground or talk to them and complete their quests religiously. There's no real reason to chat with them more than a few times. You can't give them gifts, and their houses never change. The lack of multiplayer contributes to the dullness of interactions within this game.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the game feels so grindy that it's just not an enjoyable journey past level 15. The quests are often too annoying to bother with, e.g. "chop down your trees and destroy your flowers!", and there's no way to reject them. Money is difficult to come by, so I feel like I have to be stingy with decorations so that I can afford to get through quests. Tool stamina is annoying and expensive to upgrade. The game is essentially Waiting Simulator, as you might expect from a mobile game (which Castaway Paradise originally was).\n\nOverall, this game just feels unfinished. I feel like I'm beta testing rather than playing a complete PC game. A price of $15 is considered unreasonable for most mobile games, as it is for this ported one. Castaway Paradise has a lot of potential and I really hope it improves to become a quality title that can compete with similar games.","January 31","false","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would have been nice if there were more different kinds of quests and some more variation along the way, but then again, it's not like it's a puzzle/platformer game.
