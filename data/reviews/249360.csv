It has a great 'board game' feel to it and it has all the components for a good game. Unfortunately, it breaks down pretty quickly once you start playing.\n\nFirst off, you can't assign people equipment unless they're moving to a location. I can have the greatest gear in the world, loaded up with a fire axe, motorcycle clothing, and even guns, but my patrolling people will still go outside naked with a pocket knife and then complain about getting mauled. The gear they will use seems to be pretty random too, as survivors just grab whatever they feel like when they need it. Did a zombie break in? Well, let's just shoot it with the irreplaceable crossbow bolts instead of using the silenced pistol with a million rounds of ammo, or the perfectly good fire axe. The will use armor on defense, but only against zombies.\n\n"Who else might attack them", you might wonder. Well, how about your psychopathic survivors? Every. Single. One. Is a psychopath, one bad mood away from murdering someone in cold blood. I don't know if it's a bug or if this game is in KKK central, but murderously racist characters are the most common characters around. There's also a lot of class division, and any and all quarrels are solved by violence. They'll even interrupt important jobs just so that they can wound each other, and then have the gall to be upset when the corpse pile they were supposed to dump came back to life to attack them. And this isn't because they're cooped up too long in one place, they'll start up this garbage the second they're left in the same building. Maybe it's social commentary about what the makers think would happen if you could murder people without police involvement, but given that even the former police officers in this game are cold blooded killers, I really can't say.\n\nWith all this hostility to work around, your best bet is to separate your characters into two or three groups. This would work great, if it weren't for the fact that the zombies are psychically drawn to your survivors. If you barricade fast you can fight a losing battle to keep them out, but having to juggle two or three groups will result in stupid injuries (due to refusal to use logical equipment) and inevitable break-ins (since you rarely have two survivors in the same place to watch each other's backs).\n\nWith all of these negatives noted however, if you can get a pair or more of survivors in the same place without anyone killing one another, you can actually see some of the potential shine through. There was some serious promise in this game, and if you could assign equipment to people then I would actually recommend this game. Because you can't, you'll get buried underneath the inevitable endless horde of psychic zombies who will wear your stupid naked survivors down until you lose, as you can't really expand or explore when you're having to constantly stay on the defensive. If they ever patch out the insane, murderous survivors so that you could have a proper party together, I'd recommend this game. Since they seem to have abandoned the title though, I'd recommend you play something else. This is definitely not worth $10.\n\nToo long, didn't read: Insane survivors who kill each other at the drop of a hat combined with a lack of an inventory system make this a bust. There's better games out there for $10.","November 7, 2014","false","0.9"," 123 of 143 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","123","143","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaemoon/recommended/249360/","xaemoon","Riddle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xaemoon/","352 products in account","The premise of Zafehouse Diaries is pretty straightforward: Guide a group of five survivors through a zombie apocalypse and attempt to escape the neighborhood.\n\nAs you can probably tell from the screenshots, everything in the game is represented through journal entries, photographs, and a few miscellaneous objects used to represent the characters on the map (bottle caps, pennies, etc). This presentation allows you to use your imagination to fill in the blanks, and is overall fairly effective.\n\nThe real problems begin once you start advancing through the game. Let's talk about some of the more frustrating mechanics that make the game so hard to enjoy:\n\nEach character is assigned a random occupation when you create a new game. This means that sometimes you'll get a great group of survivors with a lot of varied skills, but sometimes you'll end up with a group full of people who have no useful skills at all. You might say that's realistic, and you might be right, but all it really does is encourage you to start over, which brings us to the next (and BIGGEST problem):\n\nSurvivors hate each other. I mean, they really want to kill each other. No matter what. When you start the game, you can immediately check the compatibility of the group through a nice little color-coded status screen that shows you how everyone feels about each other. However, these feelings are purely based on race, gender, and social class. There isn't really any way to change these feelings, either. Random events and rumors can cause a temporary boost in their relationships, but someone will eventually make a rude remark for no reason, and then you're back where you started.\n\nNo matter what happens, you will get two or three people who hate the other members of their group for being a different race, a different gender, or a different social class. This means that the only way for everyone to get along is to have a group of people who are all identical (5 rich white girls, for example). BUT, even IF you were to create a custom party of rich white girls, it wouldn't matter, because random events cause everyone to hate each other anyway[/i].\n\n"Someone else took a shower when I wanted to take a shower! I hate them now."\n"You beat me at chess! We are now mortal enemies."\n"Nobody wants to play cards with me! I hate everyone in the house!!!"[/i]\n\nThis gets VERY tedious, because it affects how well the survivors work together, which is an absolute requirement to succeed in this game.\n\nZombies know where you are even if you make no noise and never leave the house, and the horde becomes increasingly larger and more aggressive as the game progresses. Despite the fact that you can fortify a location into a badass stronghold, it's not worth the time because you'll eventually be overrun no matter how many precautions you take.\n\nYou can't control how your survivors use equipment. They seem to just randomly use the best tool/weapon available at their current location. You can't give someone a gun or a baseball bat and have them just carry it around. No. You need to check the inventory of the location they're at, and make sure that something useful is in the list of things available there. Half the time, the survivors pick something inferior from the list and get themselves hurt or killed, though.\n\nCombat is just a bunch of random rolls, and you have no strategic control over what occurs. Your survivors act completely independently, and their relationship to one another is the deciding factor in whether or not they fight together (which they never do, because they hate each other).\nIf some of these problems balanced out, the game might be a bit more enjoyable. As it is, you might find the game interesting for a few hours if you can purchase it on sale, but there's little to keep you playing beyond that point.","November 25, 2014","false","7.9"," 73 of 82 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","73","82","6","0"

This is the question posed by ZafeHouse Diaries as you are placed in charge of guiding a group of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to safety in the midst of a zombie apocalypse.\n\nZafehouse: Diaries certainly had potential and is enjoyable at times but the game is bogged down by questionable design choices and clunky in-game mechanics. Add onto this the fact is that there are now better games available that offer a much more fun experience like Rebuild.\n\nThe game IS a lot more enjoyable if you import your own characters into the game, since this is the only way you'll be able to inject any sort of likeability into your survivors. I mean, who wouldn't want to see if Hulk Hogan, Pope Francis and Wolverine can survive the apocalypse? However, doing this disables acheivements, so you'll be s.o.l. if you want to form an emotional attachment to the default group. The default group and their biases are randomized, and you'll be stuck with a random racists, homophobes, bigots and sexists. As you can probably imagine, this doesn't exactly endear them to the player right off the bat. Add in the virtually non-existant character development that occurs throughout the game, injury debuffs that never seem to go away and a penchant for NEVER coming through in the clutch and you will still not care about them when your survivors all die after playing for an hour.\n\nAt the start, you have to try and effectively manage everyone by both playing to their strengths and avoiding conflict with each other. However, one well planned rumour can make your life a lot easier and it's entirely possible to get everyone to like each other by the end of the second day. However, conflicts will still happen on rare occasions and your survivors will get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about inane ♥♥♥♥ like having to wait to take a shower or not having anyone play chess with them.\n\nDora from JayIsgames put it best when she said, "You have nothing to go on other than the simple formula of incompatible traits, and it feels less like tempers reaching a boiling point and more like a bunch of variables behind a computer screen flipping you the bird." Sadly, this "bunch of variables flipping you the bird" is not limited to the relationships aspect of the game.","July 4, 2014","false","40.9"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","49","60","2","0"

Those that have played the excellent Flash game, Rebuild, will get the basic idea - you have a small group of survivors and you spend turns trying to survive and win. Standing in your way are ever-increasing hordes of zombies (depicted with their dazzling animation of... a still-frame blood splatter) and your survivors who snap at each other because of their race, gender, and music-playing.\n\nAll games are randomly generated. With three modes of gameplay, the replay value is good. Be prepared to lose the first few games, as there is a lot to absorb, and the fact that your survivors are ravenously hungry, fragile and dumb. With the default settings, the game is indeed quite difficult, but learning what's worth the risk and what isn't is part of the fun.\n\nThe interface is rather minimalistic. As best I can tell there are less than 10 screens in the whole game! For the most part it does its job. For a good few hours I didn't know how to breach or assault a place because there's no tutorial and I didn't know you could click on the tabs up top on the investigation screen. There's an online manual, but who clicks on that?\n\nThe ability to customize your own survivors with your own photos is a nice touch. I appreciate that a lot, as I was a lot more connected to the survivors with my own pictures. You can also create custom jobs, but this is very easy to abuse and makes the game far too easy if used (and consequently disables achievements). Speaking of achievements, even though I disabled all custom content, I was still unable to get any achievements, so I don't know what's going on there.\n\nAll your actions are recorded in a "diary" that can be saved upon game completion, but honestly, those records strike me as... uninteresting. I don't care to reexamine my escapades, nor would I want to read someone else's. It's not a bad feature, but it just feels... I dunno, wasted?\n\nOverall I had a good experience. I'm giving it an 8/10, knocking points for its almost lazy interface, occasional events with no positive outcome, and incredibly dumb survivors in a life-or-death situation. The big question is, is it fun? Even after completion, I went back to play it some more.

Agressor dilemmas are perhaps a little more regular than you'd like, and its easy for your group to fall apart as a result of arguments and disputes. However, when you actually get into this game and develop a strategy, the majority of these things are either avoidable or fixable with a little effort.\n\nWhilst there are plenty of FPS zombie games around (dear lord, someone make it stop), survival and reclaiming games such as this or Rebuild 3 are rarer. This game is very clever in forcing you to depend on not just your supplies but also the status of the members in your group to stay alive, providing a much more realistic post-apocalypse survival experience.\n\nOf course, your group is varied every time in terms of background, age, gender, sexual preference, fitness and abailities, and with a randomly genereated map each game, no playing experience is like the one before.  This variability gives the game an epic amount of replayability and - should you complete the three main campaigns - the game has an easy to use in-game  custom content creator. Want to survive the apocalypse with your friends or the characters from your favourite TV show? Go ahead! Add pictures, careers, skills and personal abilities to your custom characters, playable in an endless sandbox game or on the campaigns.\n\nMany reviews on here will complain that the group argues too much which causes everything to fall apart - cook a large meal and everyone will get along. Don't have enough food for a large meal? Break into a store. Dont have the weaponry to break into a store? Modify your weapons to create spiked bats and double barreled hand guns so that you CAN breach the store. Create a stronghold at the police station, steal medical supplies from the hospital. THIS.

Anyway, in Zafehouse: Diaries, you are tasked with guiding a band of sniveling, hateful survivors into scavenging and sneaking their way through a zombie-infested town in search of supplies, ammunition, and scrap with which to barricade out the onslaught of hungry dead. Hide too long without taking up arms and you'll have an undead army on your hands, but make too much noise blasting the dead and you'll just draw the entire town population right on you. Unfortunately, your survivors are pretty small-minded; each comes with a particular sort of person they just really cannot abide, be it a racial group, sexual orientation, or gender. Keep the party together too long and the petty annoyances will eventually erupt into inter-party combat; split the party too thin and you'll fall prey to Zed in short order. Although you get only a general management degree of control over your team (go search this building, hunt zombies around this area, whip up some vittles, etc.), there is a healthy variety of tasks you can set your party to, and careful decision-making will go a long way toward keeping your merry band together.\n\nAlong with the basic sandbox style of gameplay in which you must gather survivors up and avoid death for as long as possible, there are also two more difficult challenge modes available. In one, you must restore a car to working order and hightail it out of town, and in the other you must simply survive for a week. Both of these modes crank up the difficulty tremendously, and once you've learned how to eke a modicum of survival out of your hateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, they're fun (in a horribly aggravating sort of way).\n\nUnfortunately, the game falls apart a bit in the area it seems most proud of. The eponymous "DIARIES" it shouts about are the prosey bits of horror the game uses to let you know how your team is doing. This is written in the first-person from the perspective of... someone? Some unportrayed member of the team no one else seems able to observe? Who contributes no labor toward the survival of the group? I guess this explains how the writer manages to find the time to scribble it all out and scrap-book in grim polaroids in discrete hourly doses.\n\nWhile there are some nice touches here (injury reports result in splashes of blood covering the page, and as night falls, it becomes more and more difficult to see the page), the text gets repetitive fast, especially considering how easy it is to lose the game repeatedly and fly through half a dozen false starts. Once you manage to survive for a while, you start encountering special unique events that spice things up, but it's a bit of a trek getting past the early difficulty curve.\n\nZafehouse: Diaries is not without its charms, and it can be a solidly addictive time sink for a couple afternoons, but don't expect Z:D to make your list of favorites. When everything's added up, I'd be tempted to cautiously recommend it, but the Z in the title just cannot be overlooked or forgiven.","October 7, 2013","false","6.9"," 75 of 119 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","75","119","0","0"

There's not much of course because you're meant to be reading from a diary not looking at characters performing actions. But you still get to see Polaroid pictures of like houses or items found etc. It's nice.\nThe animation is actually really cool for this game. Instead of just making a diary you read from then choose actions based on the scenario you're reading, you select an action then read the outcome. The devs did a really good job of creating this unique play style and I really enjoy playing it. There's an animation for when you get hurt; blood will splatter on the screen. When it turns night time the brightness level of the game decreases then brightens again when it becomes morning in the game. When you travel to other parts of the neighborhood you location is marked on the map. Little animation details like this really made the game for me and I'm so happy I bought it.\n\n*Sound: 7/10\nThe sound is yet again a win for me. When you're building something in the game you hear the construction sounds. When zombies are near or attacking you, you hear them as well, etc, etc. My only criticism for this is when you're fighting a lot of zombies at once the zombie sounds can be repetitive and annoying after the first day and a half. Other than that over all pretty pleased with this category as well.\n\n*Hours to complete: 10/10\nYou can play this game until you get tired of it. Infinite hours of play time = more for your money.\n\n*Story Line: 8/10\nYou play as a randomly generated survivor trying to.. Well.. Survive. Not only that you're also trying to rescue other survivor and guide all of you to safety. I took off of points because the story line is the same as every other zombie themed game, movie, or book out there. I didn't take much off though because that's actually kind of uncontrollable. But I also like how this game goes in depth into the characters you can play. You'll have a Polaroid picture of what your character looks like then if you click on it, you'll actually get a brief description of what that person is good at, their background story, age, etc. So the things they could control to make the story line different from other zombie themed things they did. Which makes me one happy customer.\n\n*Game Play: 9/10\nThe game is a heavily focused survival turn based RPG. It's challenging even on the easiest setting. Which by the way, there's only 3 settings. Easy - just an exploration learn the basics/mechanics unlimited time type of game play. Then you have your normal which is like an actual story line mission game play. Then you have the most difficult which is timed with a mission. Such a cool game I love every minute of it. Well, except for when I do something stupid that makes a lot of noise and attracts zombies to come kill all of my survivors.. But if you have more common sense than I do you won't rage quit nearly as much. (jokes.. Kind of.. I really do rage quit this game sometimes)\n\n*Price: 10/10\nAs of right now it's $9.99\nTotally worth it in my opinion. If you pick it up on sale, you're getting even more for your money. I'm such a die hard zombie game/movie/book fan that I'm easily pleased with this stuff, but I also expect quite a bit from them so that being said, my standards for zombie games are pretty high. I enjoy every minute playing. The only possible boring part is waiting for things to be built or when you're waiting for something to be made or explored and that's not even "boring" to me. Anyway I'll stop rambling now. Next category!\n\n*Over all\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes:\n-Zombie anything\n-Survival games\n-Zombie books\n-Cheap but awesome games","November 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

There are 3 different modes with different difficulties, that ultimately have the same goal, survival. Towns, events, items and survivors are all randomly generated. You can customise a survivor with your own story and backgrounds, which will then be randomly generated from a pool.\n\nYou interact with a diary that displays all the events that are happening during each hour.  When I first played the game I was alittle put off by the fact that you interact with a diary. However as I played I fully understood why the interface is how it is and it is surprisingly informative. You can assign tasks for each survivor that they will try to acomplish to the best of their ability depending if they are any good at it (i.e. scavenging, barricading, cooking, etc.).\n\nThe game has quite alot of depth to it and some deep mechanics. A good example is that it might be wise to get one of your survivors to scout that motel a few doors down to see if there's any zombies, so that your group have somewhere nice to rest. Or maybe that hospital crawling with walkers has that bandage you so desperately need.\n\nIt also runs pretty well, even on them old toasters that are years old.\n\nI did a mini Let's Play series on it that covered some of the newer updates, you can find the playlist here","September 23, 2014","true","0.9"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","31","51","0","0"

I got it as part of the blink bundle, which before a week ago I'd never even heard of. When I saw screenshots of the gameplay, I was very skeptical of the rather simplistic diary view, and the whole concept of a game being based entirely on diary entries was a little odd to me. However, as soon as I started playing, I began to see just how fun and engaging it really is. Even without fancy graphics, this game manages to engross you in a zombie infested world, and you'll find yourself being easily absorbed into the addictive gameplay. The easy addition of custom content is just the icing on this deliciously zombie infested cake, and allows you to effortlessly add you and your friends into the game. You can even add your own location photos to take it one step further, allowing you to truly act out the apocalypse in your own home town.","March 28, 2014","true","5.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

At times, it even throws a curveball at you when you think you have things under control. Sure, it can be punishing in the beginning when you are unsure on what to do, but once you have become a "seasoned survivor" (i.e. you get used to the game), it really isn't all that difficult, and most of it, is common sense. For example, before trying to breach into a building with unknown zombie population, it would make more sense to investigate / assault it first, to make sure your whole party don't end up dead. No, having a full party with good weapons does not guarantee that your party would survive a breach when you are surrounded by an entire horde of zombies. Makes perfect sense.\n\nAs for the complaints on relationship management, keep doing the right things and the relationship statuses would eventually improve. The rumour feature is just to help out if relationships become really bad. Also, as with real life, if two people don't get along, it's best not to get them to do same activity together, especially in stressful situations and when they are tired (and cranky).\n\nIf you are like zombie themed games, as well as text-based games, this comes highly recommended. A solid 7/10.\n\n","July 17, 2015","true","23.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/recommended/249360/","senorsantiago","(PoA) ¿Señor Santiágo?!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/","666 products in account","Zafehouse: Diaries is rare not just for the unusual creation that it is (a mostly-text, indie, turn-based strategy survival simulator set in the zombpocalypse) but also for the fact that it makes generous allowance for the player's imagination to engage and enhance the experience.  That imagination factor is a feat which the majority of videogames - in striving for linear, accessible stories and/or impressive visuals & audio - leave little or no room for.\n\nScrewfly Studio's work here is admirable considering it was a startup with only two guys.  Their next planned project, Deadnaut is a similar game set in space.  If they do carry over and improve upon the mechanics from Zafehouse, I am definitely picking it up.  For context, I got Zafehouse on Good Old Games a while back, but over time it's been patched into better shape.  My 11 or so hours played as of this writing reflect the time it took me to replay every game mode, grab the achievements for a perfect game and fiddle with the custom content a bit.\n\nZafehouse has three modes that scale in difficulty from easy to hard:\nOngoing free survival mode\nVehicle repair escape scenario\nHelicopter rescue escape scenario\nThe game randomly generates your survivors and the town map, then you direct them to essential tasks while progressing one hour at a time.  The story is as barebones as zombie apocalypse gets but there's decent replayability thanks to the gameplay, at least until such time as you've mastered the mechanics on the standard modes and played out custom scenarios to your satisfaction.  Gameplay is a finely tuned balancing act involving staying alive and safe, keeping survivors happy (or at least not at each others' throats) and finding/managing scarce resources while accomplishing objectives within the mission parameters.  The relationship system really does add flavor to the experience and I would love to see more along these lines in gaming.\n\nPerhaps it's not so finely tuned as we would like, but as far as I know this game is one of a kind and the formula can only be improved upon over time.  I'm willing to overlook some design and balance issues as well as lack of depth & complexity in mechanics.  What visual and audio does exist is also limited - serviceable, but not awe inspiring.  There are no technical issues or bugs whatsoever and the game is very low resource, which is unsurprising given that it's a small game.  What you see in the screenshots on the Steam store page really is what you get.\n\nOne thing that I had tons of fun with was the custom content manager which I used to create a group of survivors based on my family & friends.  Dropped them into a town with locations based on my own favorite hangouts, and imported pics for all of it.  As I said initially, this is a game that encourages the imagination, and that is all the more true when you get to play out the apocalypse scenario with familiar people and places.\n\nI recommend Zafehouse: Diaries if, as in my case, this game immediately caught your eye as something different in the genre and potentially fun.  Normally I make no comment about price or promotions, but I would probably pick this up while it's on sale.  The biggest red flag to be aware of however is that the game information is provided to you in diary form.  The journal provides 90% of the information you need to play the game.  I realize that's not for everyone, but for those who aren't revved up at the prospect of reading a wall of text, I will just say by the time you're familiar with the mechanics, you'll be skimming through it very quickly and painlessly.  In closing my reviews I usually provide a few tips but I'll keep that light here, since the fun of Zafehouse includes learning and mastering aforementioned mechanics.\n\nTIP: Items can be modified multiple times (e.g. Silenced handgun ---> Silenced scoped handgun).\nTIP: Items can be scrapped by left clicking them from the Supplies view, which is useful if you're trying to get a survivor to modify a specific item; just scrap the superfluous inventory.\nTIP: Traps do make noise, which attracts zombies to your location.\nTIP: Searching a new area once for "anything useful" should be enough to discover mission relevant info/items, if any exist at that location.\nTIP: Splitting up survivors instead of keeping them all together is a viable strategy and particularly useful in certain situations, but also comes with higher risk of injuries or deaths from zombie attacks.","November 6, 2014","true","11.8"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","0"

Save frequently. One thing I've also done is moved the Zafehouse Diaries folder in My Documents to Dropbox. Making a NTFS junction from the original location to the dropbox location means I can technically restore back to any point as long as I have been saving frequently.\n2. Events can be cruel, hence tip #1. I've found that sometimes an event is unwinnable but if I reload it enough, sometimes the event doesn't happen or can be mitigated.\n3. Your survivors will eat way too fast. Searching for more supplies quickly and efficently is a must.\n4. Assault a location before trying to breach it. Assaulting lets you kill more zombies than patrolling does.\n5. Having more than two safehouses is useless in my opinion. The time required to secure a location is long enough when done quickly and noisily. Going slowly and quietly can take forever. Hence, I tend to secure two locations on opposite sides of the town right away. If I find the zombies getting too thick nearby, I can move.\n6. Guns are useless. They just make alot of noise and draw the zombies.\n7. Move your survivors as a group. More people during the assault makes it safer, during the breach too. After a successful breach, you'll want one person patrolling (to thin the herd outside attracted by noise), one person watching (to ensure that the zombies breaking in don't surprise the group), and one person searching (for food, medicine and vehicle parts) at a minimum. If you're in a factory, have one person improving gear (defense, breach/assault, searching).

Everyone else was happy, but eventually starved to death after a few weeks because I was intent on upgrading/modifying all the items in my warehouse instead of scouting. 11/10 realistic simulator.\n\nI got this game in a bundle and was very excited to try it because I've played countless zombie games on gaming websites like Kongregate and Newgrounds. I was very satisfied with my experience.\n\nIf you like text-based games, the zombie post-apocalypse theme, and crafting/strategy-based gameplay, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good, there are pictures of items you find and the delivery of the gameplay is very nice - given in the form of a journal with text/picture entries. The game is solely text-based, so do not play this if you do not like reading (or this genre). There are 3 game modes, one of which is endless (easy). The randomized character backgrounds and random events are well-done, however, one complaint I have is the very (seemingly) arbitrary way the character relationships is determined. More on this later.\n\nThe controls are simple and there is a brief tutorial to show you how to play. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with survival strategy games. The most challenging aspect of the game is balancing your actions (scout, search, fortify, etc) properly to maximize your chances for survival. You can modify a few elements like how often resource-generating buildings appear and  whether or not characters can get injured from in-group fighting.\n\nThe gameplay consists of performing specific actions every hour (equivalent of one turn). Actions include fortifying the building you are in, searching for items, building traps, etc. You can further specify the actions by clicking on keywords that are highlighted in green - for example, you can specify an order to build "traps," "experimental traps" (indoor), or outdoor traps. Certain actions generate noise that will draw in progressively larger groups of zombies. You can counteract this by sending survivors out to patrol, or by sniping surrounding zombies (trade-off is your use of ammo and potentially drawing in more zombies). If the building you are in gets completely surrounded, your characters will be severely restricted in the actions they can do. During the night, visibility is lowered and overall danger is increased.\n\nYou can either start with 1 survivor (easy mode) or 5, however, you can only gain new members in easy mode (which is also endless mode). The survivors will have randomized stats - these are given no numerical value. Stats include social economic status (poor, middle-class, rich), job, overall personality traits, and proficiency in actions (better at cooking, scouting, etc). All characters will also have a negative attribute, such as racism or distrust of the opposite sex. You can try to mitigate this by spreading rumors - one each day, and only one of each type. Rumors can be things like a cousin relationship between two characters or a charitable act for certain people. Rumors act as a double-edged sword - it will usually increase the relationship between the associated characters, however, it can also polarize survivors that do not like the associated characters (causing them to like each other even less). The relationship mechanic is crucial to survival because characters in conflict will argue and fight - dropping the overall morale of the group and potentially injuring people. Actions are also completed significantly slower when characters in conflict are near each other, so a good idea is to send polarized characters to different areas (or even sacrificing problem survivors). You can increase relationships by having feasts, but this requires a lot of food and will draw in zombies.\n\nThere is a randomized map with different structures in the city to explore. Special buildings yield bonuses like increased security (banks) and better loot/modifying (warehouses). Once you fully secure a building, you can further fortify it - eventually adding things like watchtowers, fences, and sniper posts. Fortifying takes a significant amount of time and will most likely attract larger groups of zombies. A downside of securing/fortifying a building is going back inside it - you will always need a survivor inside to let others in. If you leave a secured/fortified building with no one inside, you will have to break back in, however, there will never be zombies within.

This game looks at an interesting balance between control and simulation. You can give tasks to your survivors according to their ability and relationships, but there is little control over how they perform, or even what supplies they use. To an extent, this removal of control acts against the game, but it gives the game a layer of complexity, depth, and free form that isn't present in most simulations. It's difficult to see this game as anything other than a simulation, and anybody longing for more control over their characters (such as in XCOM) will find this game lacking.\n\nWhat I've said is bad about the game, mostly. Describing the game's qualities is difficult to interpret in words. It possesses a dynamic feel, where everything connects to everything else, and challenges players to focus on the intricacies that aren't specified. The game is unforgiving and extremely challenging, which I feel accurately represents a zombie survival situation more effectively than most other games.\n\nSome ideas for updates would make this game really awesome. One idea is to present the player with a floor plan of each building, showing which rooms have been searched, as well as the locations of doors and windows. This will allow players to think much more strategically. Another idea is to provide some form of gameplay, maybe even minigames, which would allow players to have more control over the outcomes of certain events, such as assault, barricade construction, or defense. While the simulation feel of characters doing these tasks on their own is fine, without some form of control in these areas the majority of the gameplay revolves around text.\n\nOverall, a very good game, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a realistic simulation of a zombie survival.","February 27, 2014","true","15.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Free flash games like the last stand combine the hunting for items and fighting zombies aswell, way much more better. The controles are clunky and way too complicated. There is also too much micromanagement that is no way fun at all.\n\nThe gameplay sucks and is only based on randomness. Even when someone is equipped with high end gear you can still have problems with 1-2 zombies. Also a person could take even 24 hours to just pull (1!!!) zombie corpse from the living room away. You cant equip items a person directly , what is really annoying.\n\nZafehouse tries to get the player by having unique gameplay features like spying/looking into windows to see how many zombies are inside a building or being able to have your survivors guard your house or give them work like dragging zombie corpses away from your house. But still, the gameplay is just unbalanced and is too short to give even more fun than 1-2 hours of gameplay. After that you have already seen pretty much everything, except the random encounters of course, that just feel that the dev. just wanted some decision making inside the game.\n\nWouldnt recommend it in any way, but had potential if the game had either be more focused on balance,>(and more content aswell) or having an actual gameplay, not just managing randomness where you have just slightly controles about the happening.\n\n3/10","January 10","false","1.9"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","1"

I took a bit of time to create a few customized places, survivors, and professions before starting the sandbox mode, and if you have any interest in that I'd highly recommend it. It was extremely easy and, at least for me, added immensely to the game.\nIt did take me a few tries to get the hang of surviving (on my first start I ended up with a giant horde of zombies around me within the first 24 hours, second start I wandered into a hospital trying to get medicine and learned the importance of scouting), but I had infinite patience once I saw how frequently the survivors I'd created appeared. It added quite a bit more motivation to keep things running smoothly! Imagine my surprise and delight in one game when the starting character (who happened to be the one based off me) came upon the next survivor who turned out to be the character I'd made for my favorite celebrity! We were quickly surrounded by a giant horde of zombies with no weapons, no barriers, and very little food, but I got such a kick out of finding us together that I had to find a way to make it work.\nOne gripe would be it takes so long to build the barriers (certainly longer than would be realistic, although to be fair they do give you many more supplies inside to build barriers than is realistic) and sometimes even when you're being slow & quiet the lookout will say you're making so much noise you're a beacon for zombies. Haven't quite figured that out yet. Traps haven't seemed to really have a benefit yet either.\nBut I think that's it. I intended to play for only a little but I found that, even though it paused every turn, I found that I couldn't step away.

So...where to begin? For every game, it will have its pros and cons. For every player, it's up to them to decide what a game's pros and cons are. This review was made to (hopefully) make you decide whether you should buy this game or not. So without anymore delays, long and interesting sentences, long agonizing vocabulary words, and delays...  Let's start with the pros of the game!\n\nOverall, this game is astounding, repetive, and challenging. This game is based on strategy and randomly generated scenarios (mostly RNG).  Every desision you make can and will affect the situation your survivors have in any way possible. Whether choosing to inject yourself with a zombie "cure" (if you find it) or not, to let a little girl inside your safe house or not, or to kill one of your infected surviors or let them live in hopes of finding that cure (RNG could just straight out kill them if it wanted to). One of the best things about this game are the customization options. This game allows you to create your own survivors. Not only that, you can also customize and create your own occupations, locations, even gear! In my opinion, the best thing about this game is the idea of reading your survivors' story/diary. Whether they became trapped and met their awesome demise, or became one of the lucky ones who made it out of that dreaded city alive to tell the story. Now, I believe this game has the capabilities of being a best seller, however like every game, when there are pros, there are also cons.\n\nFirst of all, you must be accustomed to the fact that you will lose... a lot. It is a tendency to lose in almost every game you will play. No matter how "good" your group is well armed or skilled, you WILL lose. I, myself, have played this game hundreds of times... HUNDREDS! And out of those dreadful hours of losing and preparation, I only beat it fairly... ONCE. And by fairly, I meant getting the achievements I earned so far in this game by using the characters the game gave me, and abusing the save system like a ♥♥♥♥♥. Even if I would use my generated characters and their OP skills, my group would somehow end up being mauled by zombies, shot to death by crazed survivor groups, or being infected and dying from the virus. Survivor relations are also an issue because of the constant stress, arguements, and paranoia that will diminish one of your group member's relations with the rest of your group into hating each other instead of the zombies.\n\nEvery so often, I check the statistics of this game (which I will put the link below) to see what the average win/ losses are worldwide. Some days I read that +40% of people killed an old lady that offered to trade supplies with them. Other days, +30% players had their group ditch one of their members in a room full of zombies to save the rest. These statistics show the amount of frustation, determination, and willingness to survive and complete their objective, even if it means to screw other people if it risks killing the rest of the group. Personally, I would have quit my current game or reverted to a previous save if a survivor died because it would just seem wise to do so (also because I'm a perfectionist)\n\nOverall, this game has pros and cons in terms of game play and survival. If I would rate this game, I would rate it an 7/10 because of the interesting factors and potenial. However, success in each game is heavily weighed on RNG.\n\nLink to Zafehouse: Diaries statisics: http://www.zafehouse.com/bodycount/","April 6, 2014","true","73.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are also other issues like some characters won't eat even when hungry and food is available.\n\nHaving said there are problems with this game, I still find myself obsessively playing it.

The game is similar to a rogue-like in its random nature; the town is randomized, your survivors are randomized, loot is randomized, etc. so that no two playthroughs are exactly the same. Or so it should be.\nYou'll find yourself in the usual boring, dreary town with a bunch of useless, racist, janitor survivors that will break each others arms and legs for refusing to play a game of chess (Not kidding). Even worse, you can even end up with Survivors that aren't good at anything at all, and you're stuck with them. If a Survivor dies, they are dead, and you wont be getting another. Expect to be given the short end of the straw many times, and to see the same stock photos for your survivors over and over.\nThe game is too randomized. Everything you do feels like a roll of the dice in the zombies favor. Trying to fight a number of zombies above ten, even with all your survivors armed to the teeth, is certain suicide. Chances are slim you'll be able to clear the hospital or police station, with the horde's numbers varying from 10 to 20, and even higher. Even then, trying to clear out locations is a hassle. First, you must send out a scout to check out how many zombies are outside and how many zombies are inside. You'll have to go by what they say, because even though they may have seen eight zombies inside, there are actually twenty-three. Now that you have the place scouted out, you'll need to Assault it. This consists of your survivors trekking over to the location through the city, and the murdering every zombie outside and shooting through the windows inside. More than likely, you wont get all the zombies inside. Finally, you'll need to Breach. Your survivors will go back to the location for the third time and make their way inside, where they will proceed to most definitely die - Or kill the zombies if you are immensely lucky.\nOverall, the game just feels unfinished and unfair. There isn't much to do besides explore buildings, clear out buildings, try to escape, and survive. Weapon variety is dismal, with most melee weapons being absolute garbage and ranged weapons being entirely too risky to use, lest more than ten zombies surround your 'base' and you have no way to get out. Zafehouse Diaries is a good idea, but it  still feels like an alpha game and not a complete product.\nThe only thing I really, really enjoy about the game is the journal, although it's severely flawed as you will see the same messages over and over again. When it rains, the journal pages get wet and the sound of rain on the roof fills your ears. When it thunders, light flashes on the screen as it storms outside. When you fight, blood splatters the pages.\nGood ideas but with poor implementation. I strongly advise you to buy this at a largely reduced price, at least 4.99.","January 5, 2014","false","27.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It's all too small and simple, even though it is a TEXT-BASED GAME. You would expect lots of complexity and story and detail set into the game, but no, it doesn't have that. Anything they attempted to be complex, is just a problem throwing a lot of info into your face, but then it has a simple solution.\nAnyway, time for the normal: Pros and Cons.\n\nPro's:\n-Rather addictive\n-Hard and challenging, along with time consuming\n-Able to customize with in-game workshop\n-Pictures and random events are nice\n\nCons:\n-Zombies are freaking weird, I killed 12 and got killed by 4 within 2 hours in-game\n-Way too simple for text game, you see pretty much the entire game within about 2 hours\n-It freaking crashes at random times\n-Extremely difficult without creating overpowered ♥♥♥♥ in workshop\n-Relationship system is retared\n-You see pretty much the entire game within about 2 hours\n\nI don't recommend this game solely for that fact that it is $10, it is not worth it at all. I would be a lot more understandable at maybe $2, but at $10, I feel cheated out of my money for a game that had the potential for a hell of a lot more.

I saw a lot of people complaining about difficulty and unfinished mechanics. Like any other game this one stops being crazy hard after You learn how to play it. About unfinished mechanics - argument is valid but It's not something that breaks the game or make it unplayable at any point. I get it that small developer like Screwfly has to manage it's time and resources carefully, they went with creating new game instead of supporting this one - no problem for me as in my opinion this didn't impact the amount of fun I got from Zafehouse Diaries.","April 18, 2015","true","42.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are multiple survival modes. Each type of building within the town you survive in is unique with usualy realy good, realy bad, and sometimes creepy Benefits/Consecuenses.\n\nIssues: For me the game has crashed consistantly about every 20 minets, and if you dont manualy save pariodicaly it'll lose all data for that game.

There's enough randomised elements to give players quite alot of replay value if the game is up their alley, with the snapy pace of it also meaning it is rather easy to pop in and out of playing the game, trying to craft a new story each time.\n\nZafehouse is most certainly flawed, although it is a sign of a... good game I guess where the flaws can on occasion help the game. For example I would say that the relationships shift far too quickly from positive to negative between people in the game however it sure as hell does help the tension as irritating as it may be.","April 13, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some people like that sort of thing, I'm not among them. A lot of actions I felt could have been simplified, and it took me a good couple hours studying all the mechanics of the game to work out everything I needed to do in order to actually play. I had trouble figuring out how to do anything with equipment but scrap it for the first few rounds playing! Once I was in, the concept reminded me a lot of Rebuild 2 on Newgrounds, which, although there's less detail and customization involved, is easy to get right into.\n\nOkay, so I've complained enough, let's talk about some high points in this game. The fact that you can create a completely custom character with uploaded photos and customized stats puts a smile on my face. It's not every day you can make a group of zombie apocalypse survivors that includes yourself, the Egyptian god Set and Captain Picard. Another thing that caught my fancy was the fact that the characters had their own prejudices and insecurities, causing them to quarrel amongst themselves, a concept I feel isn't touched on enough in similar games. Just like in real times of crisis, the greatest danger can be the person sitting right next to you.\n\nSo, in conclusion, this game definitely needs a bit of work to simplify things a little. I really hope it gets that work as time goes on, because it'd be a shame if a game with this much potential ends up overlooked by many because they were frustrated before they even got into the game itself.","December 13, 2013","true","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In this game you control 1-5 survivors, by giving them different tasks, in order to survive.\nThe course of the adventure is displayed in the pages of a diary. Every looted item, every killed zombie, every breached building, all the things happening emerge in the form of letters. I thought this must be boring as hell, but its not.\nTheres certain amount of excitement when you anticipate next moves of your survivors, who are most certaintly annoyed of one another, and they will fight each other. You can release the tensions in your group by spreading rumours of certain persons charity work or affiliation in crime or you can have bottle of spirits, maybe even a chess board or guitar in inventory.\nThe gameplay area is randomly generated, with several different buildings. There are also rare random events, with positive and/or negative side effects.\nThere are 3 different game modes, easy being the "easiest", where you start with only one survivor, so you could die in the first building you venture into, if not properly geared up. But you have infinite number of other survivors finding their way to you, and your only objective is to survive, with no timelimit. Some buildings also generate resources.\nIn normal mode you start with 5 survivors, and your task is to find a vehicle, and then find several parts to repair it. There is no time limit, but there are more and more zombies spawning in the town when time passes. You cant replace survivors.\nHard mode also starts with 5 survivors, who cannot be replaced, and must find an evacuation point. Time limit is set to 1 week.\nAs a fan of zombie games, this 1 is a fresh breeze and welcomed addition, in the evergrowing line of zombie games.","September 3, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Trying to manage the people however, I find is very difficulty and quite often they ended up at people's throats, but that could be just me failing at this game and I'm tempted to re-visit it.\n\nThe idea is you and a group of other survivors try to survive and find out where the helecopter will be landing in town to rescue survivors. It's certainly not a easy game as you have to watch out for food, barricading off buildings your survivors are living in, managing your ammo, making life-or-death decisions that can either end up with losing no-one, one or two or even the entire group as what happened with me in one playthrough.\n\nAs you can imagine there is a time limit in days as to what the helecopter is arriving so you need to get all the clues, get to that location, clear out any undead there, board up the place and make sure you have enough food to survive, but one realistic mechanic, which I personally found irritating, was how peoplee have prejudices and hate to other people. Some will have things like "Mr. X claims he isn't racist, but he doesn't like the look of Mr. Y and Miss. F" and others have hatred against rich, poor, middle-class, educated, uneducated and so on. A few times my group fell apart because even if you have the groups doing seporate things, sometimes there will be events where someone two people are laughing, the guy who dislikes them thinks it's about him, they get into a argument and nothing is done on either side.\n\nHowever there are ways to try and stop this. You can spread Rumours to improve someone's relations by comparing to other people's backstories. For instance, if you have someone who has difficulty getting along with two people because the hatred comes from them you can say "Mr. X worked in a ___" and you put Charity as one of them used to do charity work and then for the next part the other likes the poor, so you choose poor and the sentance turns into something like "Mr. X worked in a Soup Kitchen where he fed the poor." at people's attitues will start to change, however you will get conflicting personalities that might land him in the neutral zone with two people, but have another one hate him so you need to do a lot of balancing.\n\nNot a  easy game by any strech of the imagination, but certainly rewarding if you can get to the end. I havn't yet, but who knows.\n\nnote: I bought this game off the company when I came across it on Greenlight which is why I appear to have 0 hours played on it on here. Same can be said for 1 or 2 other games I own on here having got the retail edition first such as Kotor or The Witcher.","September 12, 2013","true",""," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","5"

You decide where you hold up base, and survive the onslaught of zombie "X"'s on the map. But they aren't the only one's you'll be fighting out there... The game comes in three different modes, an easy mode which gives you one survivor, and no objective. You're able to signal for others to join your cause and live as a small little group for as long as you can. The medium and hard mode add objectives, as well as a time limit that you need to keep track of - among other problems. The biggest key feature in this is that you can add just about anyone you know into the game - slap in a picture and a persona and you're set! All you need to do after that is spend hours creating your own weapons and armor in the creator menu. Good luck my friend!

Moving from house to house, planning things out and buildin some tools and traps.  Dealing with personalities of your peeps, making choices.\n\nThat all works, but here is what doesn't.  A game that is mostly text based should not be so repetitive.  You don't exactly need to spend 10 hours programing to add in a couple variations on flavor text.  But you will read the same few pages every game over and over again.\n\nAnd it's almost all pointless anyway.  Every character boils down to "Here are his stats, here are the races he is a bigot towards."  In fact, I don't know if this game was made in the 1960s south or what, but the assumption is that the minute zombies show up everyone will reveal incredible racism and sexism which eventually bubble over and destroy us.

Far from it - but it's got some of what I want in a zombie game... none of them ever seem to pull it all together though so I can't complain... too much.  This one's got barricading locations, scavenging for loot that you NEED to survive, tension between the survivors, and permadeath.  It's kind of a tense game, even though it's mostly text based.  I breached a buildiing before scouting it - that was one big mistake.  One final, big mistake.  I sent three in to breach with what I thought were decent weapons and a good chance to make it back out.  Wrong.  So I send in the cavalry with upgraded guns and lot of ammo.  The three from the first group had fallen as the two remaining, wounded (why I didn't send them initially), survivors made it inside.  Then they quickly became - well... not survivors that's for sure.  Oooops.\n\nSo, negatives.  Yes, the above "story" isn't a negative.  Far from it.  My fault for not scouting first.  With "improved' binoculars... bringing me to a negative.  Modifying normal items to be "better" at what they're built to do in the first place.  It's stupid.  I can "upgrade" a butter knife.  You mean sharpen it I hope 'cause anything else is going to make it less good at ... buttering.  You can upgrade binoculars.  In a zombie apocalypse.  You can upgrade... binoculars.  Who the fudge has extra powerful lenses laying around for binoculars?  You "upgrade" firearms by making them "steady", or some other adjective... yeah, think the manufacturers did that already... so yeah, I hate the upgrade system.  Can't pick an item directly either, just upgrade a category of items and you get random bonuses.  Stupidest one I saw so far was upgrading, and get this, weights.  Yup... weights.  How the heck do you upgrade weights in the middle of a zombocaplypse? (that means a zombie apocalypse... it's obvious)  Food consumption and resting are random, as are playing chess, solitaire, drinking, etc.  Not much self control there people, plus they never get along, and I find the relationships to be rather cryptic - plus the "rumour" system could be useful to some degree - but I find it clunky.\n\nI recommend this for what it is, just make sure you know what this game is before you buy it - and try to get in on sale for crying out loud.  Steam ALWAYS has sales.  Heck, it's 50% off right meow.\n\np.s. I wish I could combine several parts of this game in a blender with DayZ, 7 Days to Die, Rust, Rebuild 1 and 2 (if you haven't tried these, check out Sarah Northway's brainchildren.. and Rebuild 3 on the way), Dead State and State of Decay and have the perfect zombocalypse (I know, not a word - but I like it) game pop out.","December 22, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

First of all before we start the game isfully custimizable you can add your own survivors or items like mountain dew or a north face jacket. You can even add yuor own buildings like starbucks or your own house! It was just me when i started out alone with pills a bennie and a coca cola botle with some doritos. I ended up meeting my mom and this random black guy. We cleared out gamestop and my real house. When we cleared out my real house i got a scrach. I enede up infected so i could either get killed or keep me but i would use up most of the meds. So i killed myself and the black guys was sad but pewdiepie didnt care! Then they met some guy who i didnt make he came with the game. For a while my house was great traps and even a watch tower. Than ♥♥♥♥ went down real fast. My house got overrun i tried to get pewdiepie to the other house to create a distraction so they would go to that house instead.But pewdiepie died in the process! I tried to get the random guy to go on the watch tower to try and snipe some of the zombies but they got to him to! So then they broke through the front door and the turned random guy took a chunk right out of my moms neck! Black guy then cleared all the dead corpses because our food was rotting fast! than i tried to get the black guy out as soon as possible he didn't make it to the nieghbors house! I tried to get my mom to the neighbors house but right when she got inside she died from a concussion lol. This all happened in less than 1 and a half hours!

In my opinion this game is a good buy. It can be a little repetitive with certain events but I can almost say with 100% certainty that you will not see every event for along time. If you don't believe me when i say this game is difficult check out the statistics on the website.

You do not directly kill zombies nor there is any strategic element in killing zombies. You are, for the lack of better word, the team spirit of the survivors and everything is more or less left to chances.\nIt is a semi-realistic take on a zombie genre... in third person, which gives you the illusion of control along with the frustration that comes with it. You must watch the relationships between the survivors, food level and medical supplies among others. You must guide the survivors through the zombie infested town towards their salvation, which often feels like herding cats.\nI am not saying Zafehouse is a bad game. Zafehouse is an unique game that offeres a very different experience from other zombie games. It is just not for someone who expects more traditional zombie killing games. I can see how this game can be fun and engaging for some gamers but if you are a casual gamer who just wants to kill zombies like myself, do not buy this game.\nIf, however, you are curious about this game, I suggest that you download the demo version before purchasing this game.","January 1, 2014","false","9.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The concept itself is really great and somewhat different from the usual zombie games but unique doesn't always mean great.\n\nThe basic premise is to lead a group of randomly generated survivors through various gamemodes and reach the rescue vehicle in order to surive the apocalypse. In order to fulfill your goal you have to overcome various challenges. You need ressources, materials, weapons and supplies. Taking care of your group is a vital aspect because each one of them has their own motivations, political views and character traits which sometimes can cause major trouble in your group. The player has to scavenge various buildings and fight off zombies. Everything is an text based form accompanied by a great interface that feels nice and polished.\n\nWhat makes this game bad is that it's outright boring, the lack of any visual presentation is a really disapointing. The sound assets are weak and there is no real music and just some generic sound effects. There is no atmosphere to speak of or anything exciting. Furthermore the game is outright frustrating, it's really hard to actually complete a campaign. Your strategies and choices always lead to death and it's hard to win even with a group of very good survivors.\n\nOverall this game is really boring and doesn't offer anything special. It might be a more realistic approach to the zombie genre but it doesn't deliver. Despite having some customization options, it's not that amazing. Perhaps if you're really into text based rpgs or adventures.","February 3, 2014","false","1.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

The fact that every single character in the game has a violent outburst every few days if they hang out with someone they kinda don't get along with is a lazy way to show conflict and character interaction. Not to say the game is without merits; some of the customization options are fun to fiddle around with, but overall it's just another game to add to the pile of 'meh' zombie survival simulation games.","December 15, 2014","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zafehouse: Diaries expands this, adding survivor skills, qualities, and the horror of a group collapsing in on each other. The greatest qualities are the randomization of your map, the three successful difficulty variations, and the personal customizations you can add to each time you play. Customizations like creating your own survivors and their occupations, locations on the map, weapons and tools to assist in your survival.\n\nNow the few issues in this game. The inability to assign equipment can be an issue when defending or going on patrol, slightly annoying but it is best to stay quiet and hidden from zombies anyway. Another problem is the unrelenting force of zombies that'll attack after accidentally using unsilenced fire-arms, forcing you to relocate and wait until the coast is clear before returning for left behind supplies.\n\nBeyond those two issues involving equipment usage; I can't see any other issues with the gameplay. The game runs very smoothly and I haven't had any issues between my computer and the game itself. Easily one of my favorite games out there, I recommend it to anyone whose looking for a strategy game with a simple goal and challenges to test your resolve to achieve that goal.","December 17, 2014","true","58.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In concept, it seemed like a really good idea, but poor implementation and terrible features really bring the game down. The story isn't very interactive, the choices are rare, and it's more like just reading a story than playing a game.\n\nThe most annoying thing: By default, the game is windowed. Not even full screen windowed. XGA 1024x768 4:3 ratio in all its 1990s glory. Its "experimental" full screen just stretches the game to fit 16:9/16:10 screens, which just distorts everything and makes it look blurry. For a game published in the last year in a half, this is really a let down.\n\nThe interface is not every intuitive and feels like it was put together as a game for mobile devices or Facebook and not really a PC game. The game modes make no sense. For example, starting an easy game only gives you 1 survivor but starting a normal game gives you 5. The game is a lot easier with multiple survivors.\n\nEven for $3.39 on sale, I regret buying it.

I've been a Zombie nerd for almost 7 years now. I was a zombie fan before zombies got really popular, not to sound hipster. This game is one of the finest zombie survival games I have ever seen. It plays more like a text based adventure, so there is a lot of reading, but that just adds to the flavor. You control survivors trying to accomplish some sort of task, Survive/Fix a vehicle/Escape, and each challenge is its own difficulty. You control what they do, where they go, and it's just a blast. Nothing is more harrowing to send a survivor off to check a house and find that some helpful person left a map and a crossbow just lying around. I reccomend this game fully, it's one of my new favorites.","November 29, 2013","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zafehouse: Diaries expands this, adding survivor skills, qualities, and the horror of a group collapsing in on each other. The greatest qualities are the randomization of your map, the three successful difficulty variations, and the personal customizations you can add to each time you play. Customizations like creating your own survivors and their occupations, locations on the map, weapons and tools to assist in your survival.\n\nNow the few issues in this game. The inability to assign equipment can be an issue when defending or going on patrol, slightly annoying but it is best to stay quiet and hidden from zombies anyway. Another problem is the unrelenting force of zombies that'll attack after accidentally using unsilenced fire-arms, forcing you to relocate and wait until the coast is clear before returning for left behind supplies.\n\nBeyond those two issues involving equipment usage; I can't see any other issues with the gameplay. The game runs very smoothly and I haven't had any issues between my computer and the game itself. Easily one of my favorite games out there, I recommend it to anyone whose looking for a strategy game with a simple goal and challenges to test your resolve to achieve that goal.","December 17, 2014","true","58.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have three difficulty options ranging from a casual if still deadly walk-through to a complete Walking Dead, doing everything it takes to survive difficulty and accordingly the challenges you will face are more difficult too to match the level.  The game premise itself is fairly simple, you start off in a building and are required to fortify it, while fighting off hoardes of zombies, other survivors, and each other and are required to search other buildings for supplies, and information about an impeding escape or for parts for the car you hope to fix up to escape (depending ont he level you play).  It is a interesting addictive gameplay, one wrong move can mess up you're game and decimate your survivors but then too cautious  and you risk starving to desk.\n\nThe ability to customize characters, professions, items (you can find) and some of the in-game pictures is a really great touch too, and while it would be nice to have a few more customizations to add categories of items in it doesn't detract from the variety you have through the customization. Added to this is the is the ability to edit your diary after the game ends which allows you to add a few more details too.\n\nWould recommend this game if you're looking for something different to play and hope.

This game is only for the "rough and tough," those individuals that would actually survive the days after the "zombocalpse." This game is one that requires thought, planning, and a balancing act between the attitudes, skills, and oftentimes prejudices of survivors. Something interesting to note is that a survivor's personal bias isn't represented by how another character appears. Example: A survivor might be racist, but that isn't related to the randomized picture of the survivor. While I played, each survivor was different, with different skills and abilities, and frequently the stockpiled items weren't always the same. In one game, I had a solitary character who was distrustful of women. As it happened, a woman showed up who happened to be distrustful of (and not attracted to) men. They were able to work together, though, and after they got disgruntled with one another, I was able to spread a rumor (but since there were just two of them, more like sharing background) that had my male character think more highly of his female co-survivor. There were times when the game didn't seem very intuitive, but there is an online "step-by-step" manual offered by the game designers that I found helpful. After playing I also learned that although there were tasks I could have my survivors work on, I didn't need them to work "24 hours a day." Rather than constantly be making noise building more and more barricades, they could quietly reinforce their position. And the game was "warning me," but in a roundabout manner. I think this is an incredible game and the interactions between characters, tasks, and difficulties are quite reminiscient of a very popular American television series with similar themes that as of this writing (10/23/2015) is now in it's sixth season.","October 23, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No real control over what happens. After some time spent in the game the impression is that random events are just that: random.

Developers provide complete and long guide of how to play the game; while going through it, I felt some satiation, like "how much more rules should I learn to play this?".\nAfter I finished the guide and another 30 minutes passed... well, that's when involvement began.\nA few weekend days spent in this game. For me it's not the common thing. Even now I can't imagine my morning without 30 minutes in Zafehouse.\n\nIt's the game that makes you feel like you're reading great book and writing it at the same time. It plays with your imagination, it makes you feel things. And it almost certainly sets you up to fail... and you learn a mistake and give it another shot, with new survivors, new city, new relationship grid, but the same aim: survive another day.\n\nSounds easy, huh? Well, you try to make it in Zafehouse: Diaries, when your destiny hates you, plays jokes with you, and your survivors ain't no Rick Grymeses, but ordinary people with their own prejudices, fears, feelings, weaknesses and exhaustions.\n\nThis game is hard, sometimes annoying, but it certainly makes you a smarter person.","February 29","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game is basically selecting commands from the list of available ones and advancing time to see the results.\n\nMost of the times results are not satisfactiony, and your survivors are very likely to die very fast for the reasons like a house having 30 snacks, crossbow, shotgun, dozen of tools but no single bandage or bottle of disinfection liquid.\n\nUnbalanced.

You can barricade up a house, modify all your weapons and armor, breach a building that only 1 zombies been spotted in and end up fighting a horde of 20 that slaughter everyone.  You can't retreat, you can't make any decisions in combat, you just read what happened that turn.  On the other hand, sometimes a single survivor with a bat will kill 9 zombies on patrol.\n\nAll you really do in this game is look at the map, give up to 5 people orders such as being a lookout or search the building.  You can also secure a building, this is about as in depth as the strategy goes.  Once your done with the building, travel to another location on the map and hope your people don't get massacred when they arrive.  Also, an annoyance, each survivor can only carry a few pounds...  So 5 survivors might only get to carry 16 lbs of items.  Traveling back and forth to move items from a secured house to your new secured location is very tedious and without much reward.\n\nThe game has not been updated for a couple years, the forums seem empty, and the game is buggy.  The programming in it seems very old, it doesn't autosave and saving/loading is not intuitive.  In fact the GUI is quite lacking but since it's not very complex it's pretty easy to figure out.","June 4","false","28.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
