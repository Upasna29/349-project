Rarely does a soul shackled by evil redeem itself, just as rarely does a lackluster game suddenly gain appeal. That does not mean, however, that we should always turn away from possible redemption cases. Those few that manage to turn the page can inspire a belief that anything is possible, and that only death (or game file corruption) is the true end of a of a once-vile creation.\n\nThe world-corrupting demon overload Ruin and his trigger-happy minion Rack may never find the redemption we hope for them, but the game based on their misanthropic misadventures is a true example of making good on second chances.  Rack N Ruin, an adventure shooter starring a demon anti-hero and a lot of laser shooting kittens, is a game that was neutered while on console and has found a new life on PC.\n\nRack N Ruin tells the story of a evil little killer demon named Rack who travels the universe destroying world after world with reckless abandon. While Rack loves to destroy, his ruler, Ruin, is more interested in enslavement. Ruin sends Rack to his next target, Earth, with the specific instruction not to destroy, but to enslave. When Rack arrives, he soon learns that his assignment to Earth is a death sentence rather than a job, and all of his demonic powers have been stripped.  Rack, ever confident, strides ahead towards his goal of complete human shackling.\n\nA top-down adventure game that plays more like a space shooter than a typical adventure title, Rack N Ruin is an interesting amalgamation of styles that sets the tone for a game that teeters on the brink between two extremes throughout. The game provides a lot of action without being overpowering and allows you to progress at a good pace.\n\nThe gameplay on PC can be two ways, of course. Those using a controller will quickly find that, like with Rack N Ruin’s console release, Rack moves with a numbing slowness and attacks can only be performed in the eight standard directions. If you are using a controller, stop immediately and go back to the ol’ keyboard and mouse. Using the mouse and keyboard makes this game feel like an entirely different experience. Rack moves gracefully and can fire in any direction with use of the mouse and cursor. Everything is just smoother and quicker and more precise, the difference being almost unbelievable that the two could be the same game. Counter to most every game on the planet, Rack N Ruin should only be played with the keyboard and mouse.\n\nWith the overarching problems of gameplay no longer existing with this latest version, Rack N Ruin starts to look like a really nice and underrated title. The boss battles are intense and challenging, but fair. The enemies are varied and the game uses projectile patterns akin to top-down space or plane shooters that adds an extra element of challenge and variance to the overworld exploration. There are some detection issues with attacks from certain enemies, particularly with melee. Melee attacks that you use also remain completely useless and will get you killed every single time. Those issues are sour notes in an otherwise pleasing demonic gaming melody.\n\nThe game’s style is very hodge-podge but overall positive. There is a storybook quality to the backgrounds and the character design, and it is combined with this gross-out 90’s cartoon quality that paints a fitting picture of a cliche story corrupted by something vile. The colors really pop, and while not everything is well designed, most of the game is thoughtfully created and passes the eye test. The music is pretty standard, and it certainly isn’t going to stick with you, but it is pleasant enough and doesn’t become a negative issue.\n\nRack N Ruin redeems itself with a second showing on PC, but only if you abandon your controller for the ol’ fashioned keyboard and mouse. The black comedic story of a demon set to enslave the earth pops with colorful backgrounds and challenging, fast-paced gameplay and finds redemption in its PC release.","December 8, 2015","true","8.5"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

The game play starts off slow is it teaches you a basic fireball spell, and how to corrupt the first bit of land. Of course this is all thanks to a little ghost; a former demon that tried the very same things you did.\nSo like Navi from Zelda the bugger follows you about, and although not as annoying we can finally put an end to him later on by having him banished. If only that was possible with Navi....\n\nAs you progress you find out that a Champion is on a quest to find some legendary items to trap you, typical of heroes trying to ruin fun. So in a flip of scenarios you're going to try and kill them before that's all possible.\n\nEach area is very unique, the music great and of course the  art style wonderful and whimsical. Even after you corrupt the land the music and art stay great, although look like something from a Tim Burton movie at times.\n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun although can be very punishing if you didn't backtrack at times and explore as much as possible. So some advice: explore everything thoroughly. Especially if you've corrupted the land. I've missed so many part because of that, which I only discovered after getting stuck on a puzzle and going back.\n\nThe combat can get very hectic, as ole Rack is not the most nimble or strongest of demons, so you have to be sure to read the descriptions of your items and use them to your fullest.\n\nThe main crutch of the game for me is the puzzles. Often times obviously easy that you might miss something, some are so darn convoluted that you might spend and hour backtracking through areas trying to find something to help.\nThankfully there aren't too many, and are usually only needed at major checkpoints for areas, which is where they can become very annoying and break your momentum.\n\nLittle Rack also doesn't move very precisely, it's not an issue most of the times; but on occasions you might need to navigate a tight area where touching something means death. This is where the little massive head demon is the weakest, he simply can't make tiny movements easily. Although I was playing with a 360 controller so this might be the culprit.\n\nOverall I simply adore the game. The art and music is sublime and whimsical; even when dark and supposedly evil. It always tries to maintain its humour, and as such stays extremely fun throughout its story despite the issues I've mentioned.\n\nConsidering it's low price I'd easily recommend it to folks that want to try a be evil fantasy spell flinger.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfaQ7SNd6rY","September 5, 2015","true","4.5"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","18","24","2","0"

That being said the writting is very medicore, and cliche in  many ways. That being said there is a great amount of content for the price\n\nI am playing the game in the Normal difficulty. I have died several times, but it wasn't because the game was incredibly difficult, but rather just because of bad decisions, and lack of attention. On normal, the game is rather easy.\n\nThe puzzles are simplistic, but they do add to the exploration to the game. They are generally just moving block puzzles, with a few exploration puzzles involve opening doors by finding new paths.\n\nThe world is very beautiful. I think the graphics are very well done, and the transitions from the light graphic sets to the dark ones feels good. To a degree, the evolving world stuff is essentially a recolor of the map and monsters, with a few changes to monster mechanics, and the paths are slightly different.\n\nI enjoy the gameplay. There are light bullet hell elements, and some Zelda style rpg elements.\n\nOverall I would give the game 7/10","September 12, 2015","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rack N Ruin is a fusion of a top-down action adventure game and a classic arcade shooter. Take control of Rack, a maniacal demon wizard with a gleeful appetite for destruction, and embark on a grand adventure across a world filled with magic and wonder. Then transform the once enchanting world into a hellish nightmare. As the world falls deeper into darkness, Rack's power will grow, and the champions of good will rise to face him.\n\nEngage the legions of good in fast hectic combat that gives Rack N Ruin a special action oriented twist unique to the genre. Explore a vast open world filled with treachery and secrets at every turn. Then dive into delicately crafted dungeons, each with distinctive themes and foes to conquer. The entire world of Rack N Ruin is lovingly hand-crafted, and uniquely laid out. Every bit of the game is hand-painted in detailed high definition.\n\nStory: Sitting atop his throne, the dark lord Ruin rules over much of the known universe. His demon lords march outward into the cosmos subjugating planets for Ruin's ever growing demonic empire. One such creature is Rack, a small, sharp tongued, and diminutive demon lord. Rack's talent for destruction and conquest is unmatched amongst Ruin's legions. However, Rack has one issue that infuriates his dark master. He doesn't subjugate, or enslave any world he is sent to conquer. He just blows the planet up, and moves on. Planets turned into asteroid belts make poor slaves, so Ruin is giving Rack one last chance to conquer a world without jump starting the apocalypse, or be cast into the eternal abyss. Will Rack obey his master? Absolutely not!\n\nFeatures: Burn through hordes of foes with 4 core elemental weapons.\nUnleash death with an array of 24 spells, items, and contraptions.\nInteractive items that allow the player to create unique item interactions and combos based on the elemental weapon type.\nWeave through complex bullet patterns while smiting titanic bosses and over 30 unique enemies.\nExplore an enchanted benevolent world, and then transform it into a nightmarish image of its former self.\nRansack castles, pillage dungeons, escape prisons, navigate gloomy caves, and awaken ancient evils.\nMeet a charming cast of townsfolk, and collect their souls.\nUpgrade your weapons by selling the souls of innocents to an ancient wizard.\nUnravel devious puzzles, and scour the land for over 100 secrets.\nPlay on Windows, Mac, and Linux completely DRM free like the Gods and Demons meant PC gaming to be.\nCustomize your destruction with fully remappable controls for Keyboards, Mice, and Gamepads.\nAnd, of course, destroy the world. - Highly Recommended!","September 26, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

The problem for me is, I just don't seem to have the kind of brain that can figure these things out. My progress in the game, after about 5 hours, has been stunted by my total inability to figure out one of the puzzles without looking up a guide or asking for help on the forums. For some players, that's a great challenge and they'll enjoy it and the subsequent "♥♥♥♥ yeah" moment as they finally get the solution. I just simply don't have the patience for it, it's a personal failing and not the game's fault.\n\nMy main criticisms that I think the game DOES fail on however, are the map and enemy respawns/persistence. The in game map is not terribly useful, and doesn't show exactly where you are, only which area you are in, and there is no mini-map which means you might get lost fairly often. Enemy respawns can make getting around a bit tedious as going through areas a dozen times (lots of backtracking in the game) means you will have to clear out the same enemies over and over, you can dodge past them easily enough but it's a nuisance. There also seems to be a lack of persistance with the things you do, puzzles will unsolve themselves as you progress, making you do them again if you backtrack, saves don't seem to save you where you are, rather at a nearby "checkpoint", and loading can also see puzzles reset. It makes it feel like what you're doing is pretty futile.\n\nMy favourite thing about the game is the interactions you have with the other characters in the world, the writing is funny and snappy, and there's even a bit of lore thrown into the mix. Combat is also reasonably satisfying, although I recommend playing on hard as it's not super challenging. I only managed to fight the first boss, but it required tactics and good use of the items to beat.\n\nDespite my criticisms, the game is a fun top down shooter with lovely artwork and witty writing, I just wish I had the patience to bash my head against the puzzles and finish it, but I don't. If you fancy a Zelda-like puzzle game with some almost bullethell-esque combat then give this a try.","September 9, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The premise is sort of hit or miss depending on if you like being the evil doer and the cartoony humor that is everywhere in the game. The artwork is nice to look at and has a sort of painty style to it.

Story is so critical to single-player adventure games, and yet it feels like the devs just gave up on the dialogue. You get a plethora of consumable items, but most of them don't have any semblance of a satisfactory description. One of them is a phoenix feather, which you'd imagine resurrects yourself if you take fatal damage and are obviously hard to come by. Then why the hell are you able to equip use and waste them? Worst of all, there's a lot of hidden secrets and caves you blow up with bombs like in Zelda, which sounds pretty neat. Thing is, most of the time though you need keys to actually get the loot which is usually just more garbage consumables, and damn do you need a lot of keys. You can blow open an unmarked cave to find an empty room with a locked door, and if you're all out of keys there's nothing you can do. Pretty much "Rack N Ruin"s the satisfaction of exploration.\n\nIMO, with some respectable polish to the writing if nothing else this game would be stellar. Right now, meh.","December 29, 2015","false","1.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
