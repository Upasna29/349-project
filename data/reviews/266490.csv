What greeted me instead was an almost childish flower-picking simulator with the most gorgeous artstyle I ever saw.\n\nAnd I didn't mind.\n\nI bought this game, like some other people, because of the screenshots, and the promise of reliving some of the charm of the games of my childhood. I'm not normally a person who cares much for graphical fidelity in games so long as the gameplay is fun, however in this case? Quite the opposite. Something about the graphics style just makes me innately happy whenever I look at it. It puts my mind to rest for a while, which as a person with depression and anxiety attacks is a bloody godsend. The entire game is very colorful, vivid and nicely stylized, with very fluent animation, adorable little details and an overall just... happy feeling to it. It's easily one of the best-looking games I've played in my life, and it does so not through polygon count, but clever, passionate stylization. Don't get me wrong, though, the models are still pretty high quality.\n\nWith the graphics out of the way, though, let's address gameplay. This is where I initially felt cheated by the storepage claiming such close resemblance to the Zelda and Psychonauts games. I imagined adventuring, clever puzzles and dangerous trials. What I got was "Flower Picking - Collector's Edition", with the 'Collector' being quite literal. This is a game about collecting things and smashing pots. Collect flowers. Collect money. Collect conversation. Collect Collectibles. Every so often you'll fight a spirit, where the term 'fighting' is used much in the same way the term 'Discussion' is used for having a 12-year-old squeak into their microphone online in your FPS of choice. The spirits run away from you, because apparently a 16 year-old hipster florist apprentice is more dangerous than a mystical, 7 feet tall nature spirit with magic powers. Once you've caught up to the spirits, the fighting is technically a long, randomized QTE. They grow flowers from their backs. Sometimes they're good flowers, sometimes they're bad flowers, sometimes they're bombs. A button hovers over them and the game wants you to press the button that hovers over the thing which won't harm you like a parent presenting three hot stove plates and a plushie to their three-year-old and telling them to think fast.\nOccasionally the gameplay is broken up through quests you get from talking carpentry accidents that more often than not involve walking to a specific place or talking to a specific person. Sometimes you need to defeat a certain spirit, which you would probably do anyway sooner or later.\n\nWhat makes the quests, and the game in general interesting are the conversations. Despite the childish flair of the game, the writing is actually enjoyable for the most part, offering some casual humor around every corner. The characters are all quirky enough, and while not exactly believable, are enjoyable to interact with and had me talking to them over and over again to see more conversational options. Whether that was because I actually enjoyed the quirkyness of it all or simply because there's not much else to do I'm not quite sure, but it's lead me to finishing the game and doing so with a smile, so whatever it was, it worked!\nOn account of the writing, however, and the general presentation, in this case of the main character, I'll have to give a bit of a cringe-warning:\nThe game likes its references. Which is all fine and dandy, many games do it, and to great effect, usually in the form of little trinkets hidden here or there, or a quest resembling the story of a classic. Lili has a slightly different approach to that in some points, "slightly different" meaning "IN YOUR FACE". The game enjoys repeating how much of a gamer the main protagonist is, and how much she knows about casual video game trivia to the point where it had me sit in my chair, squeeze my legs together and groan.\n"Look at us!", the game keeps saying, "We're gamers just like you, haha! See? We played some video games!"\n"Alright, that's cool!", I replied with a smile and went on with my business.\n"Oh hey, did we mention how much we love gaming? Hey, we're just like you! Gamer bro fist, haha!"\nAlright, game, I get it. You guys made a video game, I kind of figured you'd probably have played one or two before.\n"Hey look at how much we know about games! Man, games, am I right? We love games so much. We should hang out now because you play games, too!"\n\nOne last thing to consider before a purchase is the length of the game. I've completed the game with all sidequests in about 4 hours. It's not a terribly long game by any stretch of the imagination. You can beat it in a single afternoon if you're so inclined, and there's little reason to go back to it afterwards unless you just need a breather from grey reality and want to delve into a colorful, gorgeous fantasy island again.\n\nAll in all, however, it's a minor itch and completely ignorable. The game, while about as casual as a stroll through the park on a sunny spring day, was still enjoyable and while I would not recommend it for the full price, it's certainly worth a look on sale. Whether you're feeling down or just long for something lax to play while listening to a podcast or letting the day fade out, it's sure to put a smile on your face if you don't mind an experience that's more focussed on presentation than gameplay. It's an immensely impressive starting project for BitMonster and I'm looking forward to their next games already.\n\nPS: BitMonster, if you guys could make another game with the same art style but more engaging gameplay, I would love you forever.","November 4, 2014","true","4.1"," 333 of 342 people (97%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","97","333","342","28","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/recommended/266490/","mikeoliva","Motoki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/","4610 products in account","Lili is a short, casual, visually exceptional 3D adventure game that's heavy on atmosphere and charm but light on story and variety.\n\nPros:\n- Visuals are gorgeous. It does not look at all like a mobile port and has some of the best visuals I've come across in an indie game.\n- Fully 3D world that you can wander around in at your own pace.\n- Nice atmosphere. The island is populated with lots of whimsical characters and the game oozes charm.\n- Non-violent, suitable for children old enough to have a fair degree of reading comprehension but also accessible for adults. (I realize this may be a con for some who are looking for a more meaty sort of game)\n- Unique. It's a bit different than pretty much everything else out there.\n\nCons:\n- Not the greatest value considering the price to length ratio. I like short games but $20 for a few hours play feels a bit steep to me.\n- Game play is rather repetitive. You do the same few things for the entire game, namely collect items and play the same sort of quicktime mini game in lieu of actual battles. This is somewhat forgivable given the very short length of the game however.\n- The 4 zones are small and there's not much interaction with the environment.\n- Story is rather thin and there is no intro; you just get plopped in.\n- Only partial controller support. The developer states full controller support is in the works. At present you can run around the world, collect items, check your map and talk to npcs with the controller but going into menus and playing the mini game battles requires keyboard and mouse.\n- Full controller support has now been added. Sort of. They basically did a virtual mouse pointer that the left analog stick controls but it feels very shoehorned in as an afterthought rather than controls designed around a controller. Control directions in the UI still don't reference the controller when you are using it either.\n\nNeutral:\n- RPG elements are quite lite. That's not a con. The game is what it is, but calling the game an "RPG hybrid" while not technically incorrect, may give an inaccurate impression. There's some very minor leveling and skill progression but don't expect hitpoints, skill trees and such.\n- No voice acting. The game is fine without it but I feel it would have added that extra bit to draw you in even more. Also it would allow for younger children to play. As non-violent games are somewhat rare, it seems especially suited for young children but the amount of reading creates a bit of an age barrier.\n- Feels like a missed opportunity in some ways. The visuals and atmosphere are excellent and the game well done as is, but part of me feels like it could have been so much more with more variety and length.\n- A couple of aspects still feel like a game created around touch input, namely the mini game where you pull flowers which is a major part of the game. Also the level up menus with the big wide buttons to hit and just the general sort of largeness of the UI. These do work just fine with a mouse though.\n- The battle / mini games on the keyboard and mouse have a totally different feel than on the controller. The former has a more tactile almost Angry Birds type of feel with pulling while the latter feels more like DDR. I'm not sure which I like better. They're very different.\n\nI enjoyed Lili for what it was, a unique, short, charming and visually stunning adventure game but part of me wished it to be more than it was, that it were much longer, the quests more complex, that Lili had companions, there were more choices etc. The game does end leaving future adventures for Lili a possibility so perhaps a sequel could be based around the PC platform from the beginning this time and more complex. It's a fun possibility to contemplate.\n\nThis isn't to say that Lili is incomplete. It's not, it's just a short and casual game. Sometimes it's nice to have those as a break or when you don't want to get into huge commitment with a new game.\n\nThe $20 price point I feel is a bit high for the short length of the game but if this sort of game appeals to you I'd recommend it when it goes on a sale.","May 11, 2014","true","5.7"," 364 of 378 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","364","378","0","8"

I've never had such a fun time collecting flowers and strange garbage from chests in a long time. Just don't go into this expecting Zelda-like combat or something similar to Banjo-Kazooie. You're simply plopped onto a charming little island that can simply be described as something out of a dream.\n\nHere's a Quick Look video to see what the game is like, since it's hard to describe with words. But if that's not your thing, then just read my quick and concise review below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/E2t3cuWZZs8\n\nI'll begin by describing the basic mechanics of this game. You play as girl named Lili who is an explorer, and she comes to the island to collect flowers for a report she's doing. You get these special flowers by finding spirits--basically human logs with masks--straddling onto their backs, and plucking white flowers that pop up on their backs until you reach the red one that you need. A fun little mini-game that's somewhat challenging if you're going for the best rank. The other things you'll be doing to progress the story are exploring the village, talking to the inhabitants, and generally exploring for neat things to collect.\n\nBut what makes this game so charming? The game's art style is truly breathtaking. It makes the game's main feature of exploring even more enjoyable when there's so many interesting things to see. I even enjoy scaring away birds and laughing at the rainbow turds they leave behind occasionally. Even talking to the local inhabitants is a joy. They have no qualms making fun of themselves and enjoy pointing it out to you. I found it very refreshing to actually WANT to talk to every NPC and find out what their story was. Not many games can pull something like that off.\n\nOther neat features the game has is the ability to chose how you want to upgrade yourself. You can choose to upgrade your speed, grip, or stealth however you wish to suit the playstyle you enjoy. You can also purchase upgrades in a wide range without much restriction. Personally I chose to get a map and key early rather than items to help me fight spirits since I just like exploring more. But if none of that is your thing, you can also just unlock different color swaps for Lili to make her look even more adorable. The choice is yours.\n\nHowever, this game does come with a few negative.\n*I found a game-breaking bug early on. I had collected all of the flowers on the map before hitting up the trainer, who wanted me to collect 5 FRESH flowers. And since none were left, I couldn't progress the game. (I've found out another work-around for this is just quiting and loading your save again. However, I still think it's an issue if you have to do such a strange thing just to continue the game, so I'll leave this as a negative.)\n*Because of the above, I also found out that there isn't multiple save slots. I had to delete my old game if I wanted to start fresh.\n*There isn't an voice acting besides the occasional "Hi" and what not. While it's not really a big deal for me, I'm sure some people might not like the fact a game with such interesting characters in it aren't voiced. It could've added a lot more to the experience if they found voice actors to bring more life into this already vivid and imaginative game.\n*While you can use a controller to play this game, it hides the fact that you can use it. And unfortunately, you can't even use the controller to play certain parts of the game. Sometimes you have to use the mouse to click off the screen when you collect a new relic. Or when you mount a spirit, you have to switch to the mouse real fast to play the mini-game.\n*Some people may take issue with the price of the game since it's cheaper on the iOS. However, you're not getting the same experience as you will here, and you can always wait for a sale. But still, I'll list this as a negative just so people know.\n\nBut even with those few minor negatives--and I say minor because it was only the beginning of the game where I had to start over--I highly recommend anyone to pick up this game if they want a laid-back adventure with good humor. This game makes me feel like a little boy again. I was just curious about everything, and it's been a long time since any game has done this for me.","May 9, 2014","true","7.0"," 125 of 147 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","125","147","0","4"

You're going to explore the different locations of the island and try to free the creatures from the bad mayor.\n\nThe locations are divided into semi-large hubs, which you can explore, find collectibles, hidden chests and solve smaller quests. The locations have a broad variety and do look very different and have their own charme.\n\nThe graphics and artstyle are very beautiful in my opinion, which is a great strength of the game.\n\nThe overall gameplay is rather simple and casual though. There is not much "puzzle solving" involved, you rather run around the island, explore the locations and stumble upon secrets without a bigger challenge.\n\nBut even if the gameplay is quite simple, i had my fun with it and enjoyed playing it.\nThe main storyline is rather short, i guess, though you do have some collectibles and achievements which might keep you busy for a while.\n\nI'd also recommend this game for a younger audience, as it's rather easy and casual and violent-free.\n\nThumbs up!","October 3, 2014","true","9.0"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","58","63","0","2"

It's a mini game that was intended for tablets and phones, but still translates decently to mouse controls and is easy to pick up. Various challenges are thrown in when picking the flowers, like prickly thorns to avoid and timed bombs to fling off. It can be a bit repetitive though as it's the same minigame for each spirit.\n\nAll in all, Lili is a charming adventure in a beautiful and creative world.

It was successfully ported to steam and is developed and published by BitMonster, inc.\n\nYou play as Lili, a young protégé of her father (who is a professor), who is sent to a mysterious island thought to be abandoned long ago in order to collect rare flowers for a project. It turns out, the island isn't abandoned as she had thought. Throughout the island are tree spirits, who have taken over the ruins and installed themselves as the leading caste of the place. Beneath them are the wooden constructs they have built to live in servitude.\n\nYou are... in a way, thrown into the wooden constructs rebellion, as their champion, undermining those dirty wooden spirits every chance you get by ripping the flower blooms right off their backs and creating mass hysteria among the elite of the island.\n\nPros + Graphics are very beautiful, and although childlike, are exceptionally polished. Being that it was originally a mobile game, it is not surprising that most of the funds went towards the graphics.\n+ While the world of Geos is relatively small, the game boasts a few areas, all of which are beautiful, and blend seemlessly together into the larger picture.\n+ The game has "easter eggs" in the form of collectable hats which pay homage to some of the most popular and iconic games in the video game industry.\n+ You get to vandalize things. Yup, you get to break into locked houses, break vases, steal flowers off other beings backs. And it's done in a way that makes the entire thing look innocent.\n+ The game allows for small character customizations in the forms of different styles of glasses and outfits.\n+ Most of the achievements are easy to beat. In my first play through of the game I had 83% of achievements unlocked.\n+ The game has no excessive language, which makes this game perfect for children, while still mantaining an enjoyable atmosphere for adults.\n+ The game is optimized for full gamepad/controller support, and is easier to play with said controller.\n\nCons - The game can get pretty repetive very quickly, especially when aiming for the 1000 vases and flowers achievements. Be prepared to kick vases over and pick flowers for quite a long time.\n- Limited voice acting. When I mean limited, I mean limited; most of the time all you hear are random sounds the characters are making instead of actual words.\n- Little replayability other than to attempt to unlock 100% achievements. While there are different modes to the game, the story is so linear and there are no choice and consequence type of scenarios within the game.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis game is one of the best ported games that I have played on Steam. Most ports are make it or break it, and the transition to PC was done smoothly. The addition of the full controller support is nice, as it made it easier for me to enjoy. The graphics are stellar, and one can easilly tell that the developer spend most of the money on the 3d models.\n\nThe storyline, although rather linear, is solid for the most part, and stands out as one of the few games with RPG elements that does not have a gorey combat system to it. Instead of actual fighting, you climb on the back of the tree spirits and pluck flower blooms while wrestling them to stay on them until all flowers are picked. The non violence of this game is refreshing.\n\nThe faults I had with the game are not complete dealbreakers to me, and I can easilly recommend this game to those who enjoy light RPG games... HOWEVER... I strongly advise any interested in this game to get it on a sale.","June 20, 2015","true","8.5"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","41","48","3","0"

There's a conscious, snarky kind of wit to it at times that I think is one of the major strengths in this game. It's very much aware of the type of game it is trying to be and I've always had a fondness for games that break the fourth wall so there's definitely no complaints from me about that. I love it. Give me more of it.\n\nLili? I actually really liked her as a main character. One of the main reasons I kept playing was to see what kind of sarcastic, funny little thing would come out of her mouth. The rest of the characters as well (and there are a lot of them that you can talk to) were great fun and I loved going around and talking to all of them. This is definitely a game that made me want to explore.\n\nThat being said...the actual premise of the game was pretty grating and got boring way too fast. Almost the entirety of the plot is made up of what is best described as a mini-game where you pick flowers off of villain characters. It's something that I can see working well on an iPhone game but as a computer game it is a little obnoxious. Even the side quests really amount to nothing more than open up a chest that is easily found and return the item in it to the person who mentioned it offhand.\n\nThe in-game menu can use some work too. Your quests/side-quests are listed in the most basic manner without really giving you information about it. And honestly, it's just...clunky and awkward looking.\n\nYou can tell a lot of love went into this game and I can see it easily becoming something wonderful but at the moment it's just in an awkward place between iPhone game and computer game and it suffers greatly for it.

If you still think you want it, go ahead, but don't say you weren't warned.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, the world is beautiful, the character and object designs are really nice, and there's even a hint of a decent plot in there. So where did it go wrong?\n\nWhen it comes down to it, this 'game' is pretty much a flower-picking simulator. You can have as many textures, shaders and polygons as you like but when your core gameplay consists of picking flowers off the backs of tree sprites, you have a problem. Had this been a 3D visual novel or a point and click I'd probably be able to give it a straight thumbs up, but I just cannot get over that fact that this game's core 'gameplay' element is flower picking. People compare this to Zelda, but it's nothing like Zelda, there's exploration but there's no real puzzle element to it, no tools or weapons - just free roaming, talking and flower picking.\n\nI get the impression that this 'game' was made by a 3D modeller to show off their work rather than someone who makes video games. This is one of the massive downsides of modern game making tools, anyone with next to no experience in making games can create a game, but because they don't have experience it falls very far from the 'masterpiece' they are dreaming of. It's like a paint brush, in the hand of an artist it creates masterpieces, in the hand of a child it makes a mess. This is almost the opposite of that - give a 3D artist the tools to make a game and they create a beautiful work in which not much happens. This game proves definitively that games should be and are much more than just good graphics.\n\nI can't bear too much of a grudge because I got it on sale for about £3, but I feel like this 'game' is something designed to sit down and gaze at lovingly rather than actually be played. Whoever did the art for this game is definately a true artist, even better than the artists for lots of popular, well selling titles. But whoever came up with the gameplay should either spend a long time evaluating what they think games are about or just not be allowed to manage gameplay at all.\n\nAll in all it's pretty tragic really, because this game could have been a real masterpiece. Instead it just leaves me with a very empty feeling, somewhere between admiration and regret, like a beautiful rose being picked before it could bloom or a promising young life cut short thanks to a tragic accident.","April 11, 2015","false","0.7"," 68 of 95 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","68","95","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/266490/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Wow, the graphics for this game are just adorable. Colorful, cute, plenty of detail in the environments and (mostly) sharp textures.\n\nBut gameplay wise you can tell it was designed with mobiles in mind, because there's a mini-game where you have to use the mouse to pluck flowers and the gameplay and story are rather shallow.\nThe player has to find red flowers by chasing spirits and solve mini-quests ('quests' would be too big of a word, since they usually take a couple of minutes to complete), among other things (like plucking white flowers and opening treasure chests). That's all there is to it really. There isn't much to do, except for a couple of small sidequests.\n\nYou can also level up the character in several ways, but these character upgrades are mostly useless because I didn't seem to experience much of an improvement. Experienced gamers in general won't find the gameplay difficult anyway. There's no health bar, you can't die. The only thing that can happen is that you get thrown off the back of a spirit and even then you can try again without any problems. And there are also potions that you can use to speed up your character, make her invisible or that allow you to throw a bomb in order to stun enemies.\n\nLili Child Of Geos also isn't a long game. I was able to complete it in 2-3 hours. Which was more than enough because the gameplay becomes very repetitive after these couple of hours.\n\nI still think the game is worth the money, if only for the beautiful graphics and for the first few areas. And who knows, maybe they can flesh things out for a possible sequel, make things a bit more interesting ? I'd like to see one, in any case.\n\n[Rating: 76/100]","May 15, 2014","true","6.5"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","35","43","0","0"

After playing through the first two areas (so far), I must say I am very pleasantly surprised! The art is very nice, as I expected, but the detail is far greater than I expected. Such a lovely atmosphere! The world they've created is one that I am thoroughly enjoying exploring. You can tell a lot of love went into this game just from looking around.\n\nBut enough about the wonderful art. If I had to classify this game I'd say it's a point-and-click with some (very limited) RPG elements and quick time events.\n\nThe game's story is... well, it's silly, but it's interesting enough. The humor is where it really shines. From conversations to item descriptions, this game has a lot of laughs packed in.\n\nGameplay is a bit rough. I feel confident in saying that this game was made with touch screens in mind, so the controls are a little clunky and the "battles" can be tricky--after all, you only have one mouse instead of a handfull of fingers. Still, you'll get used to it pretty fast. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and I can usually get 3 stars (the max number) on my first try, and I am by no means a hardcore gamer. I've only played the first two areas, though, as I said, so it will presumably get harder. Still, I'm sure this will be a turn-off to some, so I feel the need to mention it.\n\nNo major glitches so far, just some camera twitchiness when you talk to people as it switches from "world view" to "conversation view", and once where I could read a sign through a wall.\n\nMusic is adequate. Nothing to write home about, but works well with the atmosphere and isn't irritating.\n\nSound effects are good, but the random dialogue bits (the game isn't fully voice acted, but sometimes people will say a few words of their text) are sometimes odd. Such as Lili saying "Hello!" when she's actually saying goodbye in her text... or just randomly in the middle of a conversation. What up with that, Lili?\n\nAll in all, I am pleasantly surprised and really enjoying the game. Do recommend.","October 29, 2014","true","2.4"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

The game itself is a charming little piece of entertainement, but after reading the steam-description i just expected something completly different. I would not say that it's an RPG ( but some might call it one); To me, it just doesnt look like an RPG, more like a game that's made to have some points an RPG needs while beeing a mix of puzzle, minigames and collecting stuff. For example: You get something like a "Skilltree" but it doesn't really matter where you put your points, since you won't get any new abilities. As I said, the game is okay, its colorful, it cheers you up when playing it, but it is not what steam promises you.\n\nThe game itself is, as i said, a mix between puzzling, running around, minigames and collecting stuff (a lot of stuff). If you're into that, you'll be just fine, but if you hate spending too much time running back and forth while collecting items that add absolutely nothing to the game, then you'd might regret buying this.\n\nThe Graphics are pretty good, but I was told to have low standarts. The Characters are lovely designed and you can feel that the developers really cared about every single friend or foe you face throughout the game. However, the story is rather basic. I don't want to spoil anything, so just let me say this: The story feels like a weak version of another game (if you know what i mean.. you probably don't.) There's just not much depth in the story, you spend way too less time with the characters to really get into it. When I first saw the game i kind of expected a heavy story, so i was a little disappointed. But again, not every story has to be deep.\n\nThe gameplay is very repetitive, but this does not matter that much because the game is rather short. Just let me tell you, the "quests" you get sound all the same, you have 3 items you can use and every "battle" is exactly like the one you fought before.\n\nOverall Lili; Child of Geos is a game to play when you don't want to start a biiiig, looong game with a deep story. Its a game you choose to play when you have little time but still want to enjoy a good game. I personally give it a thumbs down because it is a fine little game, but nothing like you'd expect after reading the description.","May 10, 2014","false","2.9"," 134 of 220 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","134","220","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/266490/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Oh, Lili, where have you been all my life? It's hard to argue with anyone that might label this as a port of a casual, mobile, kid's game; you'll play as a young woman on a field trip wandering around an island, picking flowers, making friends and not really being challenged all that much. But while all that may be true, to be so reductive is to a do a great disservice to an amazing hidden gem of a game.\n\nThe most obvious strength of Lili: Child of Geos is its visuals, as there's a glowing radiance emitting from every individual pore of the world along with everything that populates it. But what's less obvious is the writing that backs it up. I feel like the dialogue in a lot of games is there merely to facilitate moving the player to the next objective or set piece, and I guess that's fair enough since actual game play is typically going to be the feature that gets top billing while the story is little more than connective tissue to form vague context for your actions. However, I think people sometimes forget gaming is an entertainment medium, and there's lots of other ways to entertain besides pure play, a fact this game thankfully does remember and arguably makes its greatest triumph.\n\nThe story is a strange mix of being playfully throw-away and surprisingly thoughtful and philosophical. Lili travels to the island of Geos in search of its unique floral life as part of a final school exam, but once there finds it is inhabited by Spirits and their workforce of slave Constructs. These large, wooden homunculi must tolerate the bullying whims of their masters lest they cease to exist upon failure to serve their purpose. I probably make it sound much heavier than it really is, but it does at least dabble with notions of free will and life choices and prioritising the things that are really important to us, which are bigger issues than most titles will ever dare to approach. As it transpires, these Spirits have the most exotic flowers, which also gives them their power over the Constructs, setting the scene for several hours of roaming Geos searching for Constructs to help and Spirits to deflower.\n\nGeos is made up for four medium sized districts that are unlocked sequentially as you rid each one of its Spirits. The game and its world may not be huge, but that just allows them to focus on populating it with beauty as every inch of the environments are lovingly crafted with a wondrous level of detail. In many games you'll find yourself wandering into some stranger's house and find the entirety of their personal dwelling is made up of a table and a few chairs, or maybe a bunk bed and a fireplace if they're lucky, that sort of thing. I love how every single house in this game looks properly lived-in, with bedrooms, kitchens and even bathrooms, which really sells the illusion that this is a real world being inhabited by real people... or wooden slaves and freaky tree spirit things, in this case. I really wish more games would take the same effort to make the peripheries of the world just as interesting as its core like this one does.\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to game play, that's where I'd probably have to admit the game is at its weakest. You'll spend the majority of your time here either picking flowers, smashing vases, looting chests, talking to people or ambushing Spirits, with the amount of time you spend on each of these things pretty much depending on the type of player you are and what you decide to make your goals for this game. There's no combat as such, and you can't die, the only real challenge being trying to jump on the backs of the game's 50 Spirits and playing rodeo with them as you pluck their flowers off. Otherwise it's all a very leisurely affair, the only other complication being upgrades to help make your plucking experience a little easier.\n\nSo, yes, it's kinda short, it's arguably shallow in some areas, and it isn't massively challenging, but there really is so much warmth and charm and personality exuding from every part of this game that I feel like it more than makes up for any other shortcomings. Lili herself in particular is the very embodiment of this as she's an incredibly lovable foil to the rest of the cast and a perfect example of a well-balanced female lead that's entirely capable in her own right rather than lazy developers falling back on sexuality to sell a character. I think there's still great depths of enjoyment to be drawn from Geos, and especially from Lili herself, and I can't wait to join her again on her next adventure.","October 4, 2015","true","14.1"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

An lushes island filled with friendly characters called Constructs. You play as Lili, a girl who traveled to the island to find rare flowers for her school project.\n\nDuring your stay you will find out that the friendly constructs are being oppressed by the spirits, and mostly the Mayor of the island who is also a spirit. It is you job to help these constructs out and collect flowers and other collectibles a long the way.\n\nWell i will leave it at there story wise, cause we would not want to spoil to much. While the game originally came out on the iOS, it does not feel like a mobile game. The graphics look amazing and you get really sucked in to the world of Geos. There are 4 parts of the island you can explorer, each with their own unique look and feel. You are free to explorer the island as you wish, and help the inhabitants of the island.\n\nGameplay wise you have to collect flowers and find loot on the island. You go around explorer and kick open chests or break vases, while also grabbing every flower you can. For people that are really into collecting items, and exploring every nook and cranny of games, this would be a must have for you. Picking flowers can also be done by jumping on the back of spirits and plucking all their flowers of their heads, to find the rare red flowers. A fun little mini game to spice things up with a bit of action.\n\nThe 4 hours i spend so far in this game have been awesome, and i really like the experience of it, by doing something different and bringing the story in a funny way across.

Ten if you intend to complete everything. No no, it's not a problem and sometimes I appreciate a short game. Then again, because there's a template of mobile game, you can immediately notice it. The gameplay revolves around fighting enemies with tap and drag combination mechanic - a pretty much suitable one for mobile. Not to mention the simplicity of the puzzles for game progression. Well, after all, this is aimed for casual game, so if you want more challenge forget it.\n\nMoreso, there is no voice acting and so it's kinda annoying to see 'Hi' 'Hello' 'Hmpphh' being used all over the maps. This is for me a major negative score for Lili.\n\nStory is... err... very forgettable.\n\nThe Developer took care and added gamepad support. Most of the times I'd use controller whenever a game supports it, but for Lili I'd rather go with KB/M - much quicker and precise that way. The control schema I used was WASD/MMORPG-like, and it was smooth enough for the whole time I spent here.\n\nStill, for a buck I spent on it, I wouldn't complain. I got my money's worth (after all I've beaten the game, that's an... achievement by itself), and I'm sure you would also if you can find a bargain elsewhere.

There's no real combat, in lieu of that there's a minigame where you run after spirits (or take them by surprise using enviromental cover / invisibility potions), climb on their back and try to grab their flowers.\nIn defense the Spirit grows thorns and bombs. You have to press the buttons that are attached the flowers (more flowers) and to the bombs (less explosions in the face) whilst avoiding the buttons attached to thorns (because they're thorns).\n\nIt's not the deepest minigame ever, and you'll be playing it a lot, but there's a charm to it too, as there is to the entirety of the game.\nThere are 4 gorgeous areas in the game, a beachside town, a night-time town, a forest and... another town. They are decently sized, and filled with a variety of constructs to befriend and help out with little quests (~3-4 per area).\nAmong the way you'll be collecting flowers that grow around the area, smash pots to find gold and items useful for the mini-game, use keys (also found in jars or traded for flowers) to explore sealed off areas and find treasure chests containing a sizeable amount of gold and a Lore Item (collectible with a bit of backstory / reference).\nThat all sounds great, so what's the catch? The game is short, and you'll be doing just the things written above. An area can be cleared in ~20-40 minutes, clocking in the total game length at roughly 2 hours.\nOther than that there are some technical hiccups, mostly related to achievements not triggering but I also got stuck a few times where the objective didn't tell me the correct next thing to do. Some of the older reviews actually mentioned problems so severe they had to restart to continue, this has since been patched out but it's still not the most flawless piece of code.\nIt was done by a team of five people though.\n\nSo, to summarize:\nPro:\nGorgeous world and presentation\nGreat protagonist\nGreat secondary characters, both 'good' and 'evil'\nA plot that keeps you entertained\nCons:\nShort, like really short\nTechnical hiccups\nSomewhat monotonous\nAll in all I'm super happy I picked up this game, and I look forward to what the developers will come out with next.\n\nMara.","August 7, 2014","true","5.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Of course, flowers collecting goes first, then we have talking with inhabitants of a tiny world (which, by the way, looks just wonderful), then goes pots smashing, chests smashing, taking away flowers from local antagonists.

Actually, that's all.\n\nOn the one hand Lili: Child of Geos is rather simple, but on the other hand a player, familiar with its essence, doesn't require anything more as the game is very unobtrusive. You don't need to do anything else except pressing a couple of buttons. You should just launch it and admire the fabulous design and stunning graphics, greatly improved in comparison with the mobile version.\n\nConsequently we have a beautiful exploration game, perfectly suitable for children and for those players who don't have enough free time. However, if you are a hardcore gamer, then consider your choice carefully, because it is quite possible that you will have to buy something different.\n\nAs for me: I played the game on my tablet and now I look forward to complete it in Steam and earn some achievements which, by the way, are rather easy, but will take some time.","August 9, 2014","true","2.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","6"

The island is full of life, its characters witty and charming where I couldn't help but laugh at some of the dialogue that was exchanged.\n\nWhere its similarities between Zelda lie are based around the Islands and town hubs which you would find in a Zelda game.\nImagine taking those areas from Wind Waker and putting them on this island. The exchange of dialogue is something you would find straight out of a Zelda game. Don't expect voiced characters but instead small sound bites like "Hi", "Bye" and other gasps throughout the dialogue.\nDon't expect to be crawling dungeons and having a boss fight. This is not where its comparison with Zelda lies.\n\nThere are lots of Easter eggs to discover throughout the Island in treasure chests that reference some classic Nintendo games. Another character will throw some Video game trivia at you, asking you to guess what game it is referencing. "Praise the Sun".\n\nHats can be found in treasure chests and by doing services for the locals. Masks can be unlocked by beating Spirits.\n\nAs a collectathon it has similarities to Banjo-Kazooie. Achievements are awarded for smashing pots, finding treasure and picking flowers.\nFighting in the game is composed of hopping on the back of a Spirit and attempting to pluck flowers from its back while they put obstacles in your way such as thorns and bombs.\n\nThere is currently only partial controller support, with the mouse really only needed for the Spirit fights and closing menus. I'm sure adding a button binding for B to close menus will soon come in an update. I am unsure how Battling the spirits with a controller will work though.

In Lili’s case, though, “fighting” is replaced with a minigame where you ride hectically running spirits and pull flowers from their backs (it makes sense in the context ^_^; ), which requires some precise clicking but not hard overall.\n\nIn regard of game’s length, completing the game will likely take you some 5 - 7 hours, depending on how through you are with exploring everything and completing achievements.\n\nThe Island of Geos is a small place, with only 4 areas to explore. However, what little of game world there is, is thoroughly detailed: every place is unique and each of 4 areas, despite being a part of the same island, has very distinct feel to it. It is complimented by beautiful graphics, which makes exploration of the game world truly enjoyable.\n\nIf you are looking for a simple lovely game to relax with, there is a good chance that Lili is just what you need.

I enjoyed it much more the 2nd time, even though I thought it would be a chore to play through again. The characters were still amusing, the art and model work were still beautiful, even the 'fights' were more enjoyable than they were on the first playthrough. I have no idea why this would be, perhaps it's because I knew what not to expect from it 2nd time round. (I didn't really want to make my review any longer, but since my first impressions kind of sat on the fence, I thought it only fair to update it.)\n\n*edited as I feel my 'not so good  things' list was worded a bit more harshly than intended, also added to the good things list*\n\nGood Things:\n+It's beautiful, no doubt about that.\n+The character models are really well done.\n+You can collect stuff. (Hats and pets and masks are usable.) (Lore items are useless they just go in to a collection page, but the descriptions can be fun to read.)\n+Some of the dialogue is very humorous, and I have genuinely laughed out loud a few times, which I think is quite rare in most games. The humor feels very natural and not at all forced.\n+some of the quests are well thought out and very enjoyable to do.\n+most of the characters are quite memorable. I quite like the information fish.\n+Haven't come across any bugs at all, it's as well polished as it looks. (UPDATE: achievement bugged for the locked doors)\n+ Rematched 'fights' will spawn the opponent in the zone you're currently in.\n\nNot so good things:\n\n-My number one in this list has to be the motion sickness.\nThere's currently 2 choices of camera movement ...\nfps style is bad if you suffer from motion sickness.\nmmo style is better but the camera still swings enough and there's a motion blur to the sides when you turn that may make you feel ill if you have this problem. Sometimes Lili runs into things you weren't expecting and the camera can stop in a nausea and dizziness inducing way, so if you're one of those people affected by this I'd keep in mind that this may be a problem for you before buying it. For me this is ok to play in short bursts.\n\n-you can buy 'new' outfits, but they're not new, they're just recolors of the original one, which given the attention to detail in the landscape and models made this a bit disappointing when I first came across the shop, although I do find it hard to imagine Lili wearing anything else.\nPerhaps if there was another area of body customization like accessories (bangles, necklaces, leggings, face paint, belts, hair accessories etc) even the same outfit but a patterned shirt, logo on the shirt, butterfly on the shorts....anything, instead of just being recolored, and ideally, for me, these items would drop with a fairly low drop rate (instead of being bought) to make vase kicking and the associated achievement more fun.\nThere wouldn't be that much work involved in altering the mesh to turn the shorts in to a mini dress either, which I think would quite suit Lili. (edit: I see at the very end you unlock an outfit that is exactly this, which is a shame since it probably means we'll never see this mesh recolored or retextured since it's a "special" item.)\nI'm a fan of loot and stuff to equip, what can I say :P\n\n-"Fights" are unique, but I don't enjoy them as much as I enjoy the quests, and since my play-time is limited due to the motion sickness, I've taken to ignoring them at this point (which isn't as game breaking as it sounds) and just doing the quests instead. I'll get them done eventually just for the achievements and the masks they drop (which are wearable) if you beat them with 3 stars.\nI'd love to have the lore items be usuable as some kind of limited use tool in fights which would also make the collecting of those items and the fights themselves more entertaining.\n\nConclusion\nI think the developers are still adding things to the game, so I'm going to go with recommend as there's still a chance of new things being added, and hopefully a 3rd camera option that's motion sickness friendly =D\n\nFor me, to be worth it's full asking price, it really needs more usable items and, given the lack of a real talent tree, some more variation in ways you can play to win the fights, like I said previously, I'd use the lore items to achieve this, giving them a purpose in the process.","July 6, 2014","true","20.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Most of the game is collecting flowers, breaking vases to pick up coins and entering people's houses to find lore items. There is no combat, instead you engage in mini games in which you defeat enemies by plucking flowers off of their backs.

COLLECTING FLOWERS?\nThe concept seems rather boring, but put some quirky characters, interesting world design and beautiful visuals on the mix and thus is born Lili: Child of Geos! A mixture of Yume Nikki and FEZ on a 3D environment, Lili's journey to complete her degree in something quite close to botany is not only a banquet for the sight, but also an entertaining non-violent alternative to not-always-so-subtle gaming references and somewhat-intelligent humor. However, as most indie games that try to inovate, the title has remarkable flaws or raw concepts.\n\nThe story is not impressive or captivating, but the funny and varied cast of characters sure compensate to what could be a dull, uninspiring experience with a cute message that didn't stick because the road to it was so "meh". Although the game has no voice overs (despite a few heys, yep and "SOUP, SOUP SOUP!"), the dialogues flow smoothly, soon making you feel like you know the pers... no... construct you're talking to.\n\nGameplay-wise, there's not much on store. First, there is no such thing as full controller support (if you want to play with a controller, that is) as the store page implies. This is actually a partial controller support where you'll get to use the analog sticks to move the mouse cursor on menus and get XBox controller inputs only during the "fights", making you get used to how 1, 2 and 3 translate on an XBox controller or simply use the keyboard when those item slots are necessary. After the early struggle, you'll soon find that the only interesting thing about the game is its "unique" way to deal with enemies -- which is actually a far more simplistic and fast paced Shadow of the Colossus, but with smaller enemies. Simply put, you jump on their backs and try to cope with a swarm of commands indicating where you can pull flowers, thorns or bombs, carefully not to dry the "grip" matter as that will make you fall off the enemy. With a decent score you get to collect that enemy's unique mask and learn about it. Other than that, running (walking is exclusive to houses), collecting flowers and the few RPG elements are clunky and raw. There was a lot of room for improvement, but clearly the developers wanted to seel a gorgeous game with that one fresh feature that you won't even get to play that much.\n\nSpeaking of features, content is another thing Lili: Child of Geos lacks. There are no puzzles at all, unless the game giving you the answer to stepping on buttons is considered a puzzle now days. For an exploration game with no actual combat, puzzles could make the experience far more enjoyable! The world layout is entertaining, but soon falls flat as the areas are pretty much narrowed corridors without much places to go. No no dear, you cannot jump or swim to anywhere you want to explore -- not that there are many places you think you could jump to anyways. You won't have to work much to get the god-mode items (e.g. the skeleton key and the treasure map), either, so instead of having the slightest hint of challenge on a casual exploration game (because even though it's casual, doesn't mean it can't be challenging), you can just keep running, collecting flowers, kicking vases and collecting flowers from the back of spirits. As for the outfits and hats, considering how short the game is and how useless they are (only there for cosmetics and eventually some lore relevance), there could be a larger variety -- like letting us use the Mario collectable hat as an actual hat instead of hinting on a reference-NPC that doesn't even exist.\n\nPros:\nGorgeous graphics\nRuns smoothly at highest settings on a medium rig\nInteresting designs\nQuirky, funny characters\nNice music\nSome subtle and funny references to the gaming world\nAn exploration game with few RPG elements and a weak focus on flower collecting\nCons:\nPartial controller support instead of full\nGameplay feels clunky at times\nNo puzzles\nThe only inovative mechanic is uninteresting and might become a burden if you're not a fast catcher\nThere could be more hats\nThere could be more pets\nFlowers could be more relevant\nThere could be more items and shops\nSome game references feel stupid (if I can call the Portal 2 thing a reference)\nExtremely linear considering what an open world can offer\nExtremely short considering the potential it had (you can clear the game and most of the achievments on a single day, maybe two if you decide to take on the 1000 vases and flowers)\nAll in all, Lili: Child of Geos is a funny one-time experience with a lot of wasted potential. Gorgeous graphics and funny characters, but poor controller support (considering the developers promised full support), lack of content and short playthrough. Doesn't justify the full price, but worth checking out at a nice discount.","April 7, 2015","false","5.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

It's not a shoddy port though; on the contrary, the graphics got a gigantic overhaul and it's very pretty to look at.\n\nHowever, it is way too easy and very light on content. You are picking flowers, open chests for items (which have no value whatsoever aside from just collecting them) or kick pots for money (flowers can also be traded for money). Even the "combat" is a flower picking game. The money can be used for items that aid you in the game but it's so easy that it hardly matters at all. Quests are about going from A to B and back or finding something. That's about it. Even if you take your time in 4 to 6 hours you'll have found and seen about everything there is (that includes all side missions).\n\nMy other gripe is with the story / dialogue, which is inconsistent. Some of it is complete nonsense, and/or seems to not fit at all. Other parts hint at much more going on than what's actually happening, but there's no plot twist or real surprise.

You follow Lili on her quest to free the citizens of Geos from the Spirits by gathering items and collectibles. There's really no point in the game than to immerse yourself with the wonderful cartoon fantasy world while discovering hidden items and collecting flowers - white ones which you can get anywhere and red ones which you need to fight some spirits to get it.\n\nI really enjoyed this game despite of the lack of gameplay and the linear story line. What makes this game so much fun is the great art style and the graphics, this runs smoothly on my 3 yr old gpu, and I can appreciate that.  There are collectable items in the game like hats, pets, and masks. It's a nice addition, but the dresses are just a change in color. It would've nice to see something different.\n\nThe music is perfect for a game like this but sometimes it gets a little annoying, I would have liked it to be a little subtle while im exploring and want to hear more of those ambient sounds.\n\nI can highly recommend this to someone bored of the usual games and just want to chill out and enjoy the fantasy world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/recommended/266490/","OneHandedSquire","OneHandedSquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/","168 products in account","There's a lot going on in Lili: Child of Geos.  Too much to slap you with a witty pair of sentences and run away giggling.  So here's some proper paragraphs for you kids as I lead you on a bold coming-of-age adventure where you learn to part with three to five of your dollars but no more than that; an adventure where you learn if great art direction with a bit of humor can make up for some flawed gameplay and a very basic story:\n\nYou will take control of Lili: a young crossdressing botanist with daddy issues on a quest to "deflower" a population of anthropomorphic gardens.  Okay, okay.  That is only technically true, you cheeky reviewer, you.  It's a very inclusive, cheerfully bright, and quite original game, although the daddy issues still stand.  And in fact they stand in the way of me giving this game an unqualified recommendation.\n\nI'm talking not about Lili the character, but the game itself.  It is so proud of its roots that it spends too much time placing them on display rather than nurturing its uniqueness to blossom into a memorable classic.  Lili brings a lot to the table, but what's ultimately going to keep you playing (or not) are its story, characters, and setting.  Lili: CoG tries to follow the likes of games like Monkey Island by having a story-focused game supported by a strong sense of humor.  The story itself is unchallenging, boiling down to: bad guys are bad guys and it's up to you to put things right.  Bless it, it tries to do more by giving Lili a personal dilemma that comes into conflict with her objectives, but when it comes time for her to choose, there's really no consequence to the choice you make.  Although, I guess we can hand out a gold star for at least letting the player make a choice.\n\nOkay, so the story is middling, what does this have to do with that whole roots/blossoming/flower-metaphors-for-a-game-about-flowers  line you were banging on about?  Well, presumably if the story is lacking, it could be supported by its humor.  And the game has some wonderfully funny moments.  Unfortunately, you might just stop playing before you ever get to them.  A lot of the jokes in the first areas of the game you explore take the form of references to other games and the games industry, and praise toward the games that inspired Lili.  And, as many of us know, references aren't really jokes, especially since you have to have a pretty broad knowledge of games to appreciate most of them.  I did get a grin or two out of these, but it wasn't until the second half of the game when the earnest chuckles came; when Lili started being Lili instead of her various daddies' girl.\n\nI know anybody reading the length of this review is probably ready with their metaphorical throwing produce if I don't get to talking about the gameplay soon, but this is a very hippy-dippy, rainbow colored, mostly non-violent, interactive experience and there's a bit more to be said.  This game.  Is.  Beautiful.  No, really, it is.  The birds even poop rainbows!!!  It could sell itself alone on its art direction (it's a shame it comes a bit too close to doing that).  Without an army of artists and polygons, Lili creates a vivid, bright, painterly world that is going to stay good looking for decades.  The environments feel very open, engaging, and wholely Lili's own.  Lili is a realistically proportioned human exploring a luminous world populated by wooden robots and grim-looking masked spirits none of which are short on personality.  It's got a bit of a Miyazaki vibe to it, but it's ultimately Lili's own world, and it's truly charming.\n\nRight, gameplay.  In Lili, you chase down spirits, jump onto their backs, and try to yank off the flowers that sprout up with your mouse, while avoiding hazards that threaten to knock you off and let the spirit escape: interesting, arcadey, surprisingly challenging as the difficulty ramps up.  It's refreshingly different from many other adventure/action/RPG hybrids that will mostly have you swinging a sword around at the things you want maimed.  It isn't quite perfect, though.  It works okay with mouse controls, but does feel imprecise at times and can get a bit frustrating when the things you want appear in dense clusters of hazards.  It seems designed with touch screens in mind, but I only used the mouse, so I can't comment on that implementation.\n\nThe RPG elements, especially, seem misguided.  Upgrades are handed out at odd intervals and never seem essential, especially with items providing boosts that don't so much compliment your skills in running fast, stealth, and hanging onto enemies, as render them completely irrelevant.  The increments from leveling up and getting items aren't entirely unnoticeable, but the RPG elements could have gotten cut and nothing would have been lost.  In fact, the stealth aspect to the game is really non-existant.  You won't have to worry about things like which way the enemy is facing, what cover you place yourself behind, or the amount of lighting on you.  Stealth is merely a stat that determines how close you can get before the enemy automatically notices you.  If stealth games really turn you on, as they do me, just know that this isn't a stealth game, but a perfectly fine arcadey affair.  And, you know, you can just have a stealth-sandwhich and be invisible, so why the stats at all?\n\nI'll admit, I only played the game on normal difficulty.  The game does have easy and hard settings, but as an adult with adequate reflexes, I found Lili to be fairly easy to get through, but challenging to get through well (you are scored for each enemy you face and given a small reward in the form of a mask for doing well).  I'd say that makes it ideal, but then, I'm not sure exactly who this game was made for.  The simple saccharine story and visuals make it seem like a casual game for parents to play with their children, though I think even with an easy setting, reflex challenges might prove inherently difficult for younger kids.  But if it's just meant to appeal to the children of the 90s, now present day indie gamers, the difficulty is on the ball in terms of gameplay.  That audience will probably find the story a bit too easy, however (unless you want to get meta and compare Lili - the character's - struggle living in her father's shadow to Lili - the game's - struggle to emerge from the shadow of monumental games like a terribly clever gamer whose review will be super influential).\n\nSo who is Lili for?  Well, me, I guess.  I mostly enjoyed it and I recommend it if you think the strengths I've just beamed into your head outweigh the bits that are mediocre - and those bits are just mediocre, never really bad.","February 6, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

It has a really cool world with different races of creatures, you help them out in sidequests, etc. But beyond that, there's no action, or even any real enemies. And having 3 skills that just do the thing a little better (Speed = faster walking) does not an RPG make. At least IMO.\n\nAfter I stopped trying to compare this game to what I thought it was going to be, I really enjoyed it. You have to accept that most of this game is running. Go back and watch the trailers and see what happens: running & talking to NPCs. Which is indeed what you do but it's fun because of exactly those things. The world is really amazing; it looks beautiful and unique. The dialog with the NPCs has great humor and various video game (and other media) references and the music is just plain amazing, mostly because it sounded inspired by the music of Zelda games. I found myself reading the text of everything in the game (Treasures, baddies, etc) because they were often very funny and often had great references to video games and things of other media. And Lili is a pretty awesome protagonist.\n\nI feel like this game gets a lot of flack because it's not what people expected, which is true. The way it is marketed is rather misleading so as a result, a lot of people buy it who would not have if they had seen footage of it represented properly, which means they won't enjoy it. No, it's not going to appeal to everyone, but I would argue that there is a large number of people who would find it very enjoyable. It's a very original, simple adventure game with video game references, amazing atmosphere, and great writing. And it's got hats. How can you go wrong with hats?\n\n\n[And I would like to point out that -by the credits- this game was made by 5 people, which makes me respect it all the more. I hope to see more Lili in the future, maybe on a grander scale.]","June 20, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game would have been better having significant puzzle solving in the environments or even just making the combat a part of the interaction with the world instead of an activated sequence.\nI can't recommend this game as anything more than a very pretty moving picture to boot up.

I heard this was pretty short so I held out for a good sale and finally picked it up for about $4. After almost 3 hours I'm maybe halfway through the game. I figure it should give me at least 5-6 hours of gameplay which is decent for that price but at full price you may want to hold off.\n\nAnyway, about the game itself... The characters and the world are totes adorable. You'll find humorous writing, both light and even a little dark, video game references and great art direction. It's a good looking game with it's own style.\n\nIt's not without flaws, though. The biggest one which may even make it difficult for some people to play this is the barfy mouse-look. I can't even call it mouse acceleration. It's way worse than that. The mouse-look lags way behind and then suddenly snaps into position. It's very awkward and even though I never get motion sickness playing games, this had my stomache rolling sometimes.\n\nAlso, this game does not allow you set your game up via launcher or main menu. It dumps you into the game right away and you can fiddle with some minor graphics options once you get into it. The game did an adequate job of detecting my hardware and the game ran fine for me but for some others this may end up being a problem. Every game should allow you to configure your settings before rendering more than a menu just for safety's sake.\n\nAnother minor thing is the lack of voice acting. There are some voice clips, from Lili saying "hi" in 3 or 4 different ways to the other characters having their own little intros/outros to some grunts/barks during combat but aside from that none of the dialog is voiced which is weird since the voice acting that is there isn't bad. It would have been nice for a game this short to be fully voiced, at least the main characters.\n\nOverall, though, it's a fun, cute little game involving smashing vases, stealing people's belongings out of thier homes, picking flowers and completing quests in good ol' RPG fashion.

Prior to this, I honestly believed a game just had to either have good gameplay or a good narrative to hold my interest. Lili: Child of Geos has neither of these things, but what it does have is an amazing sense of place and a beautiful aesthetic.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is mediocre. You largely wander around doing minor fetch quests while chasing ghosts. You can read other reviews for specifics on the gameplay, but what's important is to remember that this was originally an iOS game. Grabbing flowers off the ghosts while avoiding hazards is incredibly difficult and unintuitive with a mouse. It's not "unfun" but it's certainly not optimized for a keyboard-mouse style of input.\n\nNarratively, the game is pretty average. I really enjoyed the characterization of Lili as a grad student, and some of the minor characters had a few amusing lines, but the actual story and characters are paper thin. If you're looking for a game with a story that leaves you wanting more or characters who you'll remember a week after you play it, this isn't the right place for you.\n\nAesthetically though, dear god, does this game have aesthetic power in spades. Just look through the screenshots and trailer to get an idea. The game is gorgeous and, on top of that, it has an art style that you can't really find anywhere else. Usually games that put all their attention into graphics go for a pure fantasy build, or something dark and gritty. This game pumps graphical power into childish whimsy and it pays off like crazy. You will never play another game with an atmosphere of innocence and fun like Lili imparts on its players.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to people who are specifically looking to enter a beautiful world unlike any other in gaming. I'm not sure it's quite worth the standard price, but it's well worth nabbing it on a sale if you can. However, if you're looking for the next big gameplay or narrative adventure, give this one a pass.","August 18, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It won't be long before your arrival will alert the Spirits as your presence starts to influence the lives of the Constructs and make them question their existence as servants, so you will soon be caught up in the affairs of Geos’ locals. As much of a premise for a serious plot there is, the game chooses tell its story in a satirical way, adding jokes and references to other games every now and then, some which fail to deliver, making the entire story feel irrelevant after you realize most quests are there to fill in the space without an actual outcome in the storyline. As a game that focuses on exploration and the landscape it creates with it, it was disappointing to see how limited that exploration really is; it was exciting to find new items, meet new Constructs and see where else their quests will take me, but after a few minutes you will soon realize that there are only around eight additional sidequests, most which take no longer than ten minutes to complete and as for everything you see in the distance, you will never actually get there.\nRating: 6\n\nGameplay\nAs for how the game plays, well it certainly is different from anything you have experienced before, as your main objective is to defeat Spirits by jumping onto their back and picking the flowers that spurt from their heads. This is where the game shows its true nature, as it was originally made for tablets and picking flowers by dragging them with your finger across the screen feels natural and easy, but doing the same thing with a mouse can be a little bit tricky. Using a controller makes the whole thing a little bit easier as you can select the flower you want to pull using the action button, but at the same time it creates another problem, as you can only select from a range of four flowers, mapped to their respective action button, so later on in the game when you'll have to deal with up to eight different flowers, weeds and bombs at the same time, the controller will prove to be more of a burden than a helpful tool. Outside the battle the game works much better, using the keyboard and mouse or the controller to move around, collect flowers, look around for treasures and meet Geos' finest, but then again for an open world experience, there is a really small number of things that you can do outside the main story, which isn't that long either and the first glance at Geos will soon be shattered by exploration limits and the lack of new things to keep you going for longer or distract you from your main objective.\nRating: 5\n\nGraphics\nLooking back at the iOS version of the game, it's clear that the visual upgrade worked out for the best and Lili: Child of Geos looks amazing on PC, but the real beauty when playing the game comes from the art style itself, taking you somewhere between what a gnome village would look like and combining it with a good Pixar movie. The landscapes are simply amazing and as for the characters, even if the Spirits look the same except for their masks, the Constructs each have a unique touch to help you recognize them whenever you see them around Geos. The bad part in all this is that you never get to explore everything that you actually see ahead of you and the five different locations of the island can be completed within minutes as there is nothing else to do besides the main objective and a few chests scattered around.\nRating: 8\n\nAudio\nThe soundtrack complements the visual art style, probably not in the best way possible but its better with it there playing the background as you move on than without it. The worst part on the audio side is the absence of voice acting, which is understandable since most mobile titles lack such things, but as a PC port it's hard not to complain about how great the dialogue could've been voiced by the right actors, and on the same note it could've made some of those lame jokes funny just by using the right voice. The sound effects are okay, but since there is a limited number of items and objects that interact with the environment and your character, it will soon feel like a repetitive and monotone experience.\nRating: 6\n\nExtras\nIt takes around four hours to finish Lili: Child of Geos, which isn't nearly enough to justify a 20€ price tag, and aside from that and a few achievements that you'll miss on your first playthrough there really is nothing else to keep you around, no matter how beautiful the island of Geos is.\nRating: 4.5\n\nVerdict\nJudging by the first look, Lili: Child of Geos is beautiful and unique, but in this case the first look is deceiving, as the game won't last more than a few hours and as for the time in which it actually is entertaining, that's probably less than 30 minutes, but if that time is enough for you and you're just looking for a great view, Lili: Child of Geos delivers flawlessly on that side.\nRating Overall: 5.9\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Lili: Child of Geos at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=289[/h1]","November 5, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game started as an iOS game, to developer BitMonster's credit, the PC release has end of improvements, to the graphics and gameplay. However, you still get the inkling its not that far removed from its iOS origins.\n\nPros\nFunny, beutiful, and unique coming of age story that is generally fun.\nLots of collectibles with plenty of pop-culture nods and winks\n\nCons\nCombat gets tedious quickly, achievements are very grindy.\nBit too easy, a bit too simple.\n\nOverall\nConsidering the time it takes to play through, I'm not sure its worth the price (£15).

Likely.\n\nLili: Child of Geos is decently ported iOS game about playing as a girl picking flowers....what am I doing with my life?!\n\nTL;DR: It is a fantastic looking game that is basically a collectathon without much challenge beyond hopping on the backs of enemies to pluck flowers from enemies trying to shake you off of themselves. It sounds silly, but probably worked well on mobile and worked fine as a PC mini game. Calling this game an RPG is a stretch -it's more like a platformer without platforming - adventuring and collecting really. I adore the world design and want to see more of it, and it's simplistic game style makes sense for being an original iOS game.\n\nLili caught my attention from a recent Groupees Bundle: The character is a unique female protaganist and the game looked like it had a nice Pixar-movie quality. I'm glad to say that at least visually and in terms of world building, it does have that quality. I've taken about 150 screenshots of this game, especially since I was captivated by the foilage, lighting, shading and texture effects. Sure, there are more graphically advanced games, but end result of the developers move to make the game look better on PC instead of being a simple port made the game a pleasure to look at and arguably one of the best looking games of the year.\n\nThe gameplay mostly boils down to exploring the island, collecting money from kicking pots and collecting white flowers, which are sold for money. The meat of the gameplay is near violently plucking flowers off the backs of Spirits in "combat" in order to get their red flowers for reearch at the school Lili is from. I like that the game has a simple story, but it is disappointing that in a game about flower picking, that there are only two types of flowers that matter in the overall world, excluding the green, coin, bomb, and thorns on spirits throught "combat". I use combat in quotes, because basically  Lili needs to steal the flowers off the back of the spirits haunting the living, wooden constructs by jumping onto their backs and plucking flowers that sprout from them while the spirits run around trying to shake her off. Thsi form of combat is really the only form of challenge in this game, which was fine for me since it's simplcity is what I was expecting. There is an RPG mechanic of increasing your grip, speed, and stealth, but considering how easy the game is, coupled with the easily obtainable items to augment these abilities (Not to mention that one guide highly recommended Speed and stealth, but I went with Grip and stealth with no problem), your progression will generally not matter unless you are just bad at the game.\n\nWhile the gameplay is extremely simplistic, yet solid, the best part of the game to me is the overall game world. From the protaganist, to the cast of kinda-stupid but lovable NPCs, and the well design "levels". it made me interested in the world more so than the game. I'd be interested in seeing a sequel or a successor that incorporates the world into new gameplay, like a platformer or a Zack and Wiki style puzzler.\n\nSummary: I finished Lili in slightly over 4hrs and considering what little gameplay there was, I'm perfectly fine with that. More if spent time with the sidequests, though I didn't see a reason too since money or upgrades are only a problem in the earliest first half hour of play. There are plenty of achievements and all seem easy, though it would be a grind to complete them all. I have issues with the constant achievement popups, the lack of ability to change the resolution or remap keys (part of the game was cut off on my Ultra-wide monitor. I played it on a regular monitor, and it was fine. Then I went back to the UW on another play, and I didn't have the cutoff issue anymore), but despite that, I still enjoyed the game. It's shortness makes it an easy recommend for people with large backlogs, though the $20 price point is a bit too high for what is being offered.","September 30, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Also the controls sometimes freaked out if you walked into somthing at a certain angle, and the steam acheviemnts aren't always responsive (mostly the ones for using items). To be fair though I didn't complete all the sides quests, but I also spent a lot of time running around getting flowers to save up for items.

A game I think people of all ages could enjoy depending on what they're looking for. For younger kids you have a virtually non-violent, beautiful and funny place to explore. Older audiences might find entertainment in the occasionally dark humor and the game's weird inhabitants.\n\nGameplay-wise Lili: Child of Geos is a very short game. I'd estimate around three hours of casual play. If you're going for collectibles and a perfect ranking against all enemies you may add two or three extra hours of game time. It's not a very challenging game either if you play on easy or medium. During the game you will attempt to "de-flower" spirits walking about the game world. You do this by playing a sort of minigame where you drag and drop flowers and other items off a spirit's head. You can tell this game mechanic was designed for the use of a touchscreen, which isn't too strange as this is a PC remake of a mobile game, but the developers made it work fairly well with a mouse. Depending on your skill, you'll master this part of the game quickly. It does get progressively harder as the game goes on, but it never reaches a level that will really challenge you and have you retry beating a spirit more than a couple of times. I have yet to play the hardest difficulty setting though. There are three settings, of which I played the middle one.\n\nControls are a bit wonky. Camera control takes a bit getting used to. Mouse sensitivity have only four presets which is the part I found the most annoying about the game. Some weird collisions here and there. Otherwise well made.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but try to find a bit of gameplay to watch before you decide whether or not to purchase Lili: Child of Geos. It's a game best enjoyed if you go at it with a relaxed attitude. If you're up for exploration and fun in short bursts. It would be easier to recommend this game if it had been cheaper. I don't really think the price suits the length or content of the game.

You play part of Lili, quirky graduate who has landed on an island with intelligent humanoid trees and masked "spirit" creatures with the mission of picking up all the rare flowers for her graduation thesis. Problem is, the flowers grow only on spirit's back, so she has to chase them, jump on their back and pluck flowers while they run frantically away. But not to feel bad for the spirits, cause they're all kinda jerks to the tree people who are basically their slaves.\nIt has definitely got my recommendation. Firstly I'll tell what's good about it, then what problems does it have and lastly a conclusion.\nPluses:\n+Graphic. Hands down. They're not exagerating the marketing pitch, the graphic is very nice for such a small, tablet-ported title, nice particle and filter post-proc effects hold on even to AAA modern game standards, and framerate smoothness is commendable. I couldn't manage to lower it under 60FPS anywhere - on rare loading points, on great city panoramas, anywhere! The framerate stayed rock solid stable.\n+Characters. Tree-people are generally original, are interesting, have charm and personality, and are diverse. Just the way it should be in an imaginative adventure game. Lili is really quirky and charming heroine. A bit simplified characterisation and motivation, which again begs the conclusion this was intended for younger players, but one can see she was written with heart.\n+Interesting areas. Areas are full of collectibles, small side quests (which usually give cosmetic colectibles) and secrets. It's fun to explore them. Again though, although one can wander around nicely exploring, the areas aren't huge, and can be completely scanned fairly quickly. The game isn't 10s of hours long, more like 4-8h (at the time of writing I had 1.7h registerd and, as I understand other reviews, I'm somewhere around the half mark. On the other hand, the areas are diverse and look lovely all in all.\n+RPG elements. Although somewhat shallow (4 skill gagues with some 5 stages overall) skill acquiring is a nice touch. Other RPG staple, equippable items is just cosmetic, but is my hat collection is even this early vide and fun to collect. Could have been more deep and flashed out, but better to have it like that than not at all.\n+Gameplay. As said, exploring the world overall is fun, plucking "minigames" arecahotic when played with mouse, but not too hard with few skill adjustments and prizes are satisfactory. Overall it does it's job well enough, although, yet again is somewhat simple.\nNow the minuses:\n-INABILLITY TO CHANGE KEYBINDINGS! I'm a leftie, goshdarnit, and having no possible option to change movement keys to anything other than wasd bothers me alot (if this review were just for me, I'd put here two minuses, 'stead of one). Arrow keys are already used for camera movement (which I already do with the mouse), so they're in the code, I just need an option to change them with wasd, but none exists. Connected to that is\n-GUI. It seems shody ('seems', not 'is'). It gets the job done, but it's obvious this is a tablet port, the buttons are huge on FHD and some standard shortcuts and usability options don't exist here. Nothing game-breaking, but it could have been better.\n-Shortness. The game has potential, could have been something much greater, but in it's heart it's a tablet game with tablet shortness. People are reporting around 6h gameplay time. Shame.\n-+Odd quirks. I... kinda can't describe in detail, but at the moments I'm experiencing strange tonal dissonances in the game. I can't put my finger for whom the game speciffically is. If it's for younger and/or casual audience, then why are there lots of standard gaming touches about modern computer games, and their respectable memes. And rest of the game is depicted like fairytale like fantasy setting. It's not entirely clear how this setting is connected to our world. Lili goes to magical university so 9/10 times I think I'm in fantasysetting, then suddenly the tone shifts to strange and disturbing. Not that I mind, disturbing fairytale has become regular trope in itself (and e.g. I love AM's Alice MR) but it kinda clashes awkwardly. The game doesn't want to commit fully to weirdness, but sprinkles it around in odd bits. It's not a problem, but sticks like a scrapwe on your keyboard you know you'll get used to eventually, but which distracts first 10 times you feel it...\n-Prize. For such a short game 20€ is a bit much. I bought it within a bundle, so it's definitely worth it, but full prize is a bit too much. Just a bit, but still.\n\nConclusion: Interesting short casual experience with awesome graphic, great exploration and fun story. The game's not a masterpiece, but it doesn't try to be one.\nI recommend it without a doubt, IF it's on a discount.","August 8, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as Lili on an exceptionally child friendly island where you beat the baddies by plucking flowers from their heads, which temporarily ... well I'm not really sure, makes them go off in a huff? They are always available for a rematch if you want to. The island itself is beautiful, the gameplay is reasonable although it very much shows its phone/tablet based roots and the story is charming, although firmly aimed at a younger audience.\n\nSo what could possibly be wrong with it?\nWell first up the price. It is a very short game with quite a hefty price tag. I got it as part of a bundle so I'm good, but in general I would not advise paying full price for this unless you really don't need... money.\n\nSecondly it advertises itself as two things, one is an RPG. Whilst you have three stats that you can upgrade this doesn't make it an RPG in the sense that most people would understand. The other is the line that references "Zelda, Broken Age, or Psychonauts" all of which I love, but all of which have pretty much no bearing on this game unless it's something along the lines of "if you ripped practically everything out of one of those games and then shortened it massively... then here's Lili!"\n\nSo yeah... it's a beautiful, short, kid friendly game with lovely visuals, a fun story, funny characters, decent gameplay... but it's overpriced and very misleadingly advertised.\n\nSome of the achievements are also a bit hiccup-y with one refusing to trigger, some not counting/triggering correctly, and unfortunately the grindy ones are tied to a single savegame which is a shame because shifting that to a global variable would have made replaying a great option rather than just running round a completed game picking flowers and kicking vases...","August 24, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played Lili as soon as it came out for iOS and in my review of the game then I gave it high marks. I give them again this time around.\n\nThe best part of Lili for me is that it is full of humor and I actually had a very powerful emotional response to part of the story. It's really that good. But let me pause to point out the one flaw I see in the game.\n\nUnfortunately, punctuation is sloppy and visually stands out against such a flawless graphical backdrop. Admittedly, I'm a stickler for quality writing with careful, consistent use of punctuation and spelling as much as an engaging text. Sadly, this is seemingly the only unpolished bit of Lili. Also, while I appreciate the quirky descriptions and tongue-in-cheek collectibles, there is unexpected semi-questionable content for astute readers.\n\nThat being said, I love the feel of this game so get ready for more gushing. The graphics are stunning with beautiful art direction and an immersive environment. This is even truer in the Steam version. It's funny that it looks as I remember it but then when I checked screenshots from my iPhone playthrough, I realized what time and effort really went into this port. The graphics are redone and gorgeous on the big screen!\n\nLili is a great hero and it's nice to see a nonsexualized female lead. She can be taken seriously and is genuinely likeable. She is also fun to control both on iOS and Steam. I like the control options and found the use of the mouse to give a bit of precision to the main "battle" mechanic of the game. I use quotes because there really are no fights other than plucking plants from the backs of spirits and this unique twist is actually very engaging and serves as both a sort of mini game as well as a well tuned challenge in progression.\n\nFinally, I really like the new listings of characters because at the end of the day, they are what made my first experience with Lili so memorable. I look forward to playing through the rest of this game once more and hope you pick it up as well.","September 8, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a great sense of humor and includes some surprising game references, a little bit of dark humor, and even some social commentary. It is also self aware and of course makes fun of itself. However it does have character development, albeit a little thin but no less profound, as Lili discovers what she truly wants from life. Better yet, it features some amazing hats and customization. Another surprise came after the game was over when I was waiting for the credits and only five names were listed. The small team makes one appreciate the game even more, and it is clear that it contributed to the intimate feel of the game and the coding humor *tips fedora*.

However, I kept playing and got quite into it, the game is actually pretty good on the exploration and "questing" front, even if it doesn't have a massive map. I did find that the game was rather heavy on the "collecting items" front.\n\nMusic is very good, and the sound bites work well to enhance the text which makes up the dialogue as there are are no full-text voices. The dialogue in this game has lots of humour, and the story it tells is good.\n\nThe Graphics are very nice, cartooney not photorealistic. The design of the maps in the world are likewise very well done.\n\nI did encounter a bug that prevented the in-game cursor from loading, but this was easily fixed by switching resolutions in-game. The game is listed as having full controller support, but you shouldn't be playing with a controller. It is simply not suited to this.\n\nOverall, while it isn't the most amazing game out there, it does provide for a fun game that you can probably get through in an afternoon, if you have one free. I will say that if you're after a heavy RPG, don’t go for this. But if you want to buy this for a more easy-going RPG, or one suited to children, then this is a good choice.","December 16, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That certainly is not a bad thing. It's relaxing, easy on the eyes and fun to progress through. The majority of the game consists of walking between four areas, clicking a button next to flowers to harvest them, clicking the same button to kick vases, and occasionally clicking the same button yet again to engage in a minigame where you pull flowers off of spirits. Simple but fun. Where the game really shines though, is in its surprisingly engaging story and characters. This game has some really dark undertones and explores some touchy subjects. Talk to everyone and don't skip the dialogue. I don't really have any major issues with this game. Mostly just insignificant nitpicks, like progression, which requires you to collect red flowers through NPC side quests or through battles with spirits, which isn't a problem in itself, it's just that you don't need a lot to move forward and once you get a couple, you can skip about half the content in the game or do it anyway which essentially accomplishes nothing. It's good that they give a choice of how you can play the game but there's no sense of accomplishment for completing 100% of the game. I don't even think the game keeps track of how many red flowers you get in total. Regardless, I still recommend this game. Twenty dollars does seem a bit pricey but I got a good six hours on my main playthrough and I'll probably return to this game at some point so I'm satisfied.\n\nEdit 8/5/15 : Seems the price dropped to ten dollars.

It's worth picking up on sale, but not for the full price of $20.\n\nPros:\n- Looks great, especially considering it started on mobile. A lot of that probably comes down to the fact that most levels are cleverly designed to avoid needing to draw more than 20 feet in any direction, but the game does run on Unreal.\n- Usually clever writing. Not perfect by any means, but it's generally entertaining.\n- Strong world design. The descriptions comparison to Tim Schafer's work is pretty accurate in the world and character design.\n- The main mini-game is fun. It involves trying to pick flowers off the head of a spirit as it runs around and sprouts bombs and thorns to make you miss. It's reasonably challenging to win the later rounds with a perfect rating, but you're going to breeze through it if just passing is enough for you. Mileage will vary heavily here.\n- Lots of hats. Every spirit (52) and most quests (something like 12?) will give you a hat. There are also at least two pets to find, but the costume changes are limited to palette swaps, unfortunately.\n\nCons:\n- Very limited graphics options. You get a few presets with no descriptions of what any of them actually do. I don't think many people are going to have trouble running the game, but Highest turns on an incredible level of depth of field. I'd have liked to be able to turn that off.\n- Short. I finished it in 3 hours. That was enough to defeat all 52 spirits (most with 3/3 stars), complete nearly all of the quests, and find around 60-70% of the collectibles.\n- Controls are a bit wonky. Particularly the camera.\n\nNotes:\n- Achievement hunters beware! Lili has a ton of achievements and *most* are near enough to completable in a sane person's playthrough. Then there's "Break 1,000 vases." I only got to 120 despite making an effort to break any I came across. You could probably get an extra 100 or so by going out of your way to look for them, but the full 1K is going to take some serious grinding.\n- Trying to play it on a standard touchpad would be a nightmare.\n- The description compares this to Zelda, but the only similarities I can find are some of the humor, Wind Waker's art direction, and the fact that money is completely and utterly useless in both games. Don't buy it hoping for puzzles or Zelda-like combat.","December 31, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I kept playing and got quite into it, the game is actually pretty good on the exploration and "questing" front, even if it doesn't have a massive map. I did find that the game was rather heavy on the "collecting items" front.\n\nMusic is very good, and the sound bites work well to enhance the text which makes up the dialogue as there are are no full-text voices. The dialogue in this game has lots of humour, and the story it tells is good.\n\nThe Graphics are very nice, cartooney not photorealistic. The design of the maps in the world are likewise very well done.\n\nI did encounter a bug that prevented the in-game cursor from loading, but this was easily fixed by switching resolutions in-game. The game is listed as having full controller support, but you shouldn't be playing with a controller. It is simply not suited to this.\n\nOverall, while it isn't the most amazing game out there, it does provide for a fun game that you can probably get through in an afternoon, if you have one free. I will say that if you're after a heavy RPG, don’t go for this. But if you want to buy this for a more easy-going RPG, or one suited to children, then this is a good choice.","December 16, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s not an RPG, adventure game or a walking simulator… It’s more of an exploration game with heavy emphasis on item collecting (hence why people call it a flower picking simulator). With some adventure elements in the mix, including “fights”, which are actually simple minigames.\n\nDon’t let the simple gameplay fool you though. Lili is an engaging game about exploring the world of friendly wood constructs and helping them out with their requests. (This usually involves gathering some items or “fighting” an enemy.) It’s not a community simulator like the Animal Crossing series, but has some similarities, including the same non-violent, relaxing charm.\n\nTechnically it was ported from iOS, but the only thing that may give it away is the very simple control scheme; the developer practically remade the whole game for PC, which includes astonishing, yet not intrusive visuals– all presented by the Unreal 3 engine– and brand new game elements. It is a version made with love (which sadly doesn’t extend to provide support for technical issues), and if you start playing it, you will feel that love too.","March 17, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You go on quests, break pots to get loot, challenge enemies, unlock doors and the character talk in text not voice.  Lili is a less violent version of Zelda because you can't die and the enemies are defeated and not killed.  Instead of swinging a sword you pick flowers off their head.  It sounds like a cheezy game but I had fun playing it and it takes some effort to get through the game.  The graphics are really good and the gameplay is easy.  This game is no match for Zelda but it's a fun adventure none the less.  Great for all ages.  I would like to note that considering this game was originally a mobile app game I'm impressed how well it's made.\n\nPros\nSimple gameplay\nGraphics\nClean language\nNot very long (complete around 5-7 hrs).  If this was a Zelda game that would be bad but for this game it's good.\n\nCons\nAchievements - most are easy to get but there's one you can't get with one playthrough which I find annoying.  To get all 3 training achievements you have to play through a second time.  You can get 2 out of 3 in a single playthrough.  Also, the game wants you to collect 1,000 flowers and breaking pots.  The flowers one takes time but not hard if you constantly collect them.  The breaking pots one seems to take forever because there's fewer of them and never marked on your map.  By the time I finished the game I only broke around 500/1,000...ugh!  If you're serious about achievements that will take up more than 5-7 hrs to complete the game.  The achievement issue doesn't make the game bad, just annoying.","July 18, 2015","true","7.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Great colours, everything is shiny and bright, a joy to look at.\n\nEven though the controls with the controller are neither configurable nor actually explained, it works well. Every key binding for the items are displayed for keyboard only which may lead to some item waste as you try and figure out which controller button does which. But control is tight and during the spirit fights the controller buttons are shown correctly.\n\nThere's no speech in the game, but that - for me - only added to the charm. I felt reminded a lot of the Wind Waker, one of my favourite games as a kid. The inspiration clearly came from that game.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is awfully short. You only need 3-4 hours to collect everything and defeat every spirit. The items are not really necessary here - though I only played on normal. And even though the game is so short, the fights with the spirit get a tad repetative near the end. Defeating all 52 of them brings nothing to the game, and almost every fight is the same. And replay value is nigh zero, the story is linear and everything is collectible in the first run.\n\nI have enjoyed the game so far but I can't really recommend it for full price. Though the game is beautiful, runs well and has a cute main character, it's just too short. Be sure to grab it on a discount, though.","June 21, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A nice simple story set on a beautiful island with some really nice stand out characters and an easy yet enjoyable mechanic made for an enjoyable yet short experience that I would recommend to people looking for something a little different.\n\nAs mentioned above, the graphics in this game are superb, every area is crawling with life and every nook and cranny seems to have been paid a lot of attention. The character models as well are all unique and portray an enjoyable visual style that makes them feel much more alive as characters, even despite not being voiced.\n\nThe dialogue of the game is light hearted and fun, even going so far as to almost break the fourth wall at times when mentioning some of the games obvious limitations.\n\nSadly, the game isn't voice acted which feels like a slight let down. I feel it could of been the icing on the cake here but as mentioned the dialogue is interesting enough to read through.\n\nThe actual second to second gameplay involves a lot of fetch quest like objectives and the whole game is very easy, you can complete it to 100% in about 4-6 hours but the gameplay isn't the draw here and sometimes the IOS roots of the game can be seen.\n\nLili: Child of Geos is an experience more than a challenge, a nice vacation from the stressful and grim games that most of us play a lot and I loved it, here is hoping for a sequel!\n","July 12, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a game that children and adults (channel your inner child adults!) can play and enjoy.\nGraphics: When the graphics are set on 'Fantastic', which is the highest value, the game is gorgeous. The view of the island itself is magnificent and the lighting in-game makes the entire game seem somehow enchanted and magical.\nStoryline: The storyline is pretty simplistic and one should not expect a complex and in-depth storyline from this game. The plot itself is that you are Lili, a botanist and student sent to the supposedly 'uninhabited' island of Geos to collect samples of flowers to bring back home for your research project. However, you find that the island is not empty and that there are creatures (constructs and spirits and many others) of a different variety.\nGameplay: As you read in the upper section that Lili is a botanist, you may assume that you will pick flowers throughout the game. Yes, you are correct! You will be picking countless of flowers, breaking vases, talking to goofy individuals, scaring birds, finding items, and fighting spirits (yes, you will pick the flowers off of their backs!). You should not expect a hack-and-slash style or a difficult puzzle from this game.\nHumor: This game is hilarious. If you actually take your time (like I did) and talk to everyone and read everything, it turns out that our heroine is a gamer! And there are Zelda and Super Mario references (and many more) throughout the game as well as things and topics that would be considered 'inappropriate' are slightly implied so that if your children are playing it, they will not understand. If you are playing it (an adult), you will laugh your butt off!\n\nOverall, I truly enjoyed this game. No, it is not difficult but it is hilarious. It is a relatively short game (I would say approximately 3-5 hours if you don't take time to look at anything, read anything at all, explore, or do side quests), and the only reason I have 9 hours game-time is because I wanted to receive every single achievement (and I also kept going afk while in-game). This game is a good way to unwind after playing a scary game or having a bad day. The hilarity of this game is what kept me coming back!","January 12, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought it (like many people have) based on the dazzling screenshots and videos on the store page, and because it said it was an RPG. It took about a minute since I booted it up to realize that what I had just bought was in no way an RPG and in no way the game I had paid for. If only the Steam refund system had existed back then.\n\nThe sad part is that this game is beautiful. Really beautiful. The soundtrack isn't half bad either. Now if only those things could have been combined with a robust combat system, a world larger than 3 subdivisions in a small town and more than just a smattering of a story line then it might have been a runaway hit instead of such a letdown. Seriously, you can beat this thing in 3 hours or less, and all the side quests are nothing but fetch and find quests.\n\nI want to like this game, but I just can't bring myself to. It would be great if someday someone made a sequel or reimagining of this game, kept the theme, kept the characters and environment, but totally rebuilt and expanded everything else.

You could easily burn through its content in a day but the majority of it sadly gets very repetitive very fast. At $20.00, it's a hard sell I'd argue.\n\nYou're dropped onto the island of Geos as Lili, a college student persuing a Vege-Magical degree, and become embroiled in a conflict between the island's ruling Spirits and their servant Constructs. Lili's pursuit is not entirely selfless (at first). She's here to study the flowers that dot the island, which most conveniently grow from the backs of the Spirits, forcing her to spend a majority of the game delicately plucking them from her enemies.\n\nAs a central mechanic, the spirit combat is great and well realized. The chase to catch a spirit followed by the aforementioned flower picking is great fun, hampered only by the finicky controls thinking you want to stop and either pick flowers or smash jars when you're in hot pursuit. Lili's origins as a tablet game really show up here, as the plucking mechanic has you selecting a flower and dragging it away from a spirit to collect it.  It is fun perhaps the first handful of times, but given that there are over fifty spirits in the game to fight with little variety aside from the number of obstacles that crop up on a spirit, it does make the game's pacing drag if you are going for 100%.\n\nGeos has a lot of bright and colorful details to its world, and it is fun to just wander around the island and see what's in it as the Constructs go about their business. While not a fully realized world like in Deadly Premonition or Majora's Mask, where the characters all follow a set schedule, Geos nonetheless is a delight to get lost in for a few hours and take in the scenery.\n\nIt's also good to see Lili realized as a character; she has no love interest and she has no need of someone to come save her. As a plucky protagonist with ideas for what she wants to do with her life, Lili stands up for herself in a game that, while it has action, is at its core a non-violent experience, barring how you feel about picking flowers off the backs of monsters.\n\nIt's not a perfect game and suffers from having too many spirits to fight through, but for a quick delightful romp Lili's journey to Geos is one worth undertaking.","July 4, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You could easily burn through its content in a day but the majority of it sadly gets very repetitive very fast. At $20.00, it's a hard sell I'd argue.\n\nYou're dropped onto the island of Geos as Lili, a college student persuing a Vege-Magical degree, and become embroiled in a conflict between the island's ruling Spirits and their servant Constructs. Lili's pursuit is not entirely selfless (at first). She's here to study the flowers that dot the island, which most conveniently grow from the backs of the Spirits, forcing her to spend a majority of the game delicately plucking them from her enemies.\n\nAs a central mechanic, the spirit combat is great and well realized. The chase to catch a spirit followed by the aforementioned flower picking is great fun, hampered only by the finicky controls thinking you want to stop and either pick flowers or smash jars when you're in hot pursuit. Lili's origins as a tablet game really show up here, as the plucking mechanic has you selecting a flower and dragging it away from a spirit to collect it.  It is fun perhaps the first handful of times, but given that there are over fifty spirits in the game to fight with little variety aside from the number of obstacles that crop up on a spirit, it does make the game's pacing drag if you are going for 100%.\n\nGeos has a lot of bright and colorful details to its world, and it is fun to just wander around the island and see what's in it as the Constructs go about their business. While not a fully realized world like in Deadly Premonition or Majora's Mask, where the characters all follow a set schedule, Geos nonetheless is a delight to get lost in for a few hours and take in the scenery.\n\nIt's also good to see Lili realized as a character; she has no love interest and she has no need of someone to come save her. As a plucky protagonist with ideas for what she wants to do with her life, Lili stands up for herself in a game that, while it has action, is at its core a non-violent experience, barring how you feel about picking flowers off the backs of monsters.\n\nIt's not a perfect game and suffers from having too many spirits to fight through, but for a quick delightful romp Lili's journey to Geos is one worth undertaking.","July 4, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(bordering on 'some'?). There is some "humor" that is questionable both in taste and apropriateness for younger audiences. *See end of review for details, including trigger warnings and warnings for parents.\n\nAs far as the rest of the game goes, the atmosphere and evironments are absolutely stunning and worthy of screenshots. and the music is varied and well-suited. There is a bit of a Zelda-esque atmosphere which comes as no surprising seeing all the little Zelda references sprinkled throughout the game. It was refreshing to play a game that was not violent, yet still involved "beating the bad guys." So many of the characters you meet are adorable and hilarious, and have succeeded in getting laughs out of both of us. It is worth talking to all of them; they say some of the most ridiculous things. The gameplay centered around a very simple concept: pick flowers, though it was a pleasant surprise to find that it could be still be challenging sometimes. I would easily recommend this game to most of my friends.\n\nPros:\n+ Fun, non-violent gameplay\n+ Gorgeous visuals\n+ World worth exploring (not overwhelming like big sandbox games)\n+ NPCs worth interacting with\n+ Nice soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- The aforementioned tasteless jokes (why it is 8/10 and not 10/10. they were pretty gross.)\n- Unexpected spike in difficulty between areas/levels.\n- Does not clearly state its save mechanism (it's autosave, btw) and does not indicate what triggers a save\n- Bit pricey for the length. I wouldn't pay more than ~$12.\n- No replay value (one achievement needs ~half a 2nd playthrough but that's it.)\n\n*There are a small handful of instances in which sexual harassment is normalized or made into a joke. Fortunately, they are few and far between, and most are easy enough to ignore and move past, but I can see a couple of the jokes being potentially triggering - especially since you would not see it coming from a game like this (we were very surprised ourselves). None of these jokes are a big piece of the game, but it's enough to make it not an 100% all-ages friendly game. To be more specific,\nTRIGGER & PARENT WARNING: Stalking (creepy photos of Lili and her butt in one NPC's place), Sexual harassment (abuse of power/authority), Sexual abuse (1 joke).","January 4, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It's not difficult at all but it an odd way, it was really fun. Definitely something you can just relax and play. It reminds me of a game that would be on Wii-U due to its cute charm. I got it on sale for under $3 and I suggest everyone do the same.\n\nPros:\n\n+ GFX are nice\n+ The characters are really odd and interesting\n+ Has a great charm and there are some cool game references like Zelda and Mega Man\n+ Honestly, fun to play\n+ The surroundings are really fun to look at\n+ I could argue that it is the best casual game I have ever played\n\nCons:\n\n- Too easy, not challenging at all, you can get a key to open all locked doors at the beginning of the game, the items are useless, I didn't even need to use them\n- Moving between areas, the game kind of freezes for two seconds when opening red doors, annoying\n- When using a controller, some times the right stick will drift to the left, it can be fixed just by moving the right stick, but I don't think this game was designed to support controllers at first\n- Full price for this game is too much, I beat it in 6 hours and got 42/46 achievements, $20 is too much\n\nOverall, I'll give it a thumbs up.

The mechanics are simple and easy to understand for gamers of most ages (granted those gamers can read), and the rest of the game is made to be a family friendly adventure. Combat and violence is replaced with a fun little mini-game (which feels awkward on the mouse at first, but you'll get used to it) where you chase enemy spirits across the island, hop onto their backs, and pluck Spirit Flowers off to weaken them while avoiding the thorns and bomb plants that grow there as well. After defeating a spirit you can earn a score and a rating measured in stars, if you earn 3 stars you'll also get a colored version of that spirits mask (there are also fifty unique spirits to encounter, so that means 50 unique masks to unlock). Outside of that minigame, the rest of the game sees you running or walking around the island of Geos, slowly unlocking new zones to explore freely and to find new spirits to defeat inside. The exploration of these zones remind me a little of The Wind Waker, as the island is bright, colorful, and actually very pretty (especially on the highest settings). Unlike Wind Waker though, there are no dungeons to explore (unfortunately) but there are a lot of fun little puzzles to undertake, quests to do for the wood-construct citizens of Geos, and every time you enter a zone, a whole batch of Spirit Flowers (the same kind that grow on the heads of Spirits) spawns in random places for you to collect. Unfortunately a few bugs appear where flowers will grow inside walls or under bridges or just places you can't reach, and there are the occasional clipping issues that block Lili off from small areas she should be able to access, or temporarily stick her into the environment (only happened once for me, but it took me five minutes of running in a circle to get her free), and the zones themselves really aren't too large. However you will find yourself scouring these zones over and over while hunting for spirits, treasure chests, and flowers and the zones are well designed and so different from each other they surprisingly don't get old after a few hours of playing, and with the flowers you find you can sell them for gold coins (used to buy outfits, upgrades, and powerups for taking on spirits), trade them for keys (one key will open any lock on the island, but is destroyed after each use) so you can loot or explore the various houses and shops on the island, or you can use the flowers to gamble with in a minigame I found quite easy (probably just because I have good eyes and reflexes) to try and earn even more gold coins.\nI bought the game on a whim because it was on sale and looked cute, and surprisingly it is now my favorite game of all time, simply because it is so fun, cute, and happy it always makes me feel good when I play, no matter how poopy I feel before loading it up. I've already finished the game (it is rather short unfortunately, but I've heard you can play it for about 40 hours before collecting every single hat, outfit, lore item, mask, pet, and completing every quest) but I want to keep playing it and try getting the game's other ending and explore the bird poop mechanic a little bit more. Yes, there is a bird poop mechanic where if you run too fast while scaring birds, the poor things will fly away and poop all over Lili, leaving rainbow colored droppings all over the girls face and clothes (this always makes me laugh because she always has a calm smile on her face throughout the game).\nSo would I recommend this game? Yes, however the majority of Hardcore gamers probably wouldn't like the game for much more than the billions of references to Dark Souls, Oregon Trail, Mario, Zelda, Minecraft, Prometheus (yes, the movie), and much more. Children would probably love the colors and characters, but a lot of jokes and dialogue would probably be wasted on them. But if you're a total nerd who wants to play a peaceful game that'll just make you laugh and give you at least 3 to 5 hours of sheer happiness (that's the minimum time to beat the storyline), you'll probably love it as much as I do.","June 28, 2014","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I well knew that the game was only a simple game, all it was about was picking up flowers (lol?) and quick time events fights. So I was prepared to a mediocre game with a good artistic style.\n\nWell, it's much more than that. The style is in fact very pleasant, I would say very well designed levels. You get 5 different levels in which you can free roam (you can't jump so no platforming sessions). Every level is quite different from the other and very suggestive. Every level also comes with its own background music.\n\nThe 'fights' consist in getting close enough to the enemy, and triggering the QTE (with the mouse cursor, or with ABXY buttons of the 360 controller). It is a nice QTE, compared to the average QTE in other games. During the fight you also can choose whether to use or not some powers (flash bombs).\n\nThe Character can be upgraded and customized (although the outfits are different almost only in colors). The flower picking is not tedious, comes spontaneous while you walk around enjoying the scenery.\n\nWhen I saw the achievements....picking up 1000 flowers....I thought it was crazy. But no, in fact in only a few hours I did everything in the game and it really was no hassle. I enjoyed every part of it. It is the exact game I was looking for: it is nice, fun enough, and not complicated at all. It is a perfect game for children, or for grownups that want to relax from all the other FPS and action games, and dedicate themselves to this relaxing game. You don't have to reflect, you don't have to plan anything or else, just sit back and enjoy this little game. 80/100","December 22, 2014","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

After 4H of playing im done with the main Story and unlocked every Item, got 3 Stars on every possible Enemy and completed every single Side-Quest.\n\nNow going on with the Good Points: I like the graphics very mutch, not too realistic with a little cartoony,handdrawn look. Some good athmosphere Light effects as well as good Bump-Mapping. The Map is just awesome designed and with love to every detail. Also the Character Models are always unique Characters also with effort and creativity put into everyone (except the Spirits, they always look the same, just the Mask differs), while you gotta say that those squeky voices kinda annoyed after a while. Also the Main Character, Lili, has a well thought-out character and a athmosphere fitting look. The Gameplay Mechanics are also something new and nice to experience aswell as they are easy to learn. I've got to mention the Controller Support the Devs put into the game ( you dont run across that often) is also a good job and easy to work with. Also the text lines are always fitting, sometimes funny, and very entertaining ( some spelling issues in items descriptions :/ ).\n\nFor especially the the Offer Price its totaly worth its money.\n\nBefore you go, always remember that there are TONS of video Game references or direct Links in the whole game. Try to find and understand them all ;)\n\n"It's dangerous to buy games alone!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demontrace/recommended/266490/","demontrace","demontrace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demontrace/","1006 products in account","So somehow my review got lost, whether because of this "upgrade" to the complete edition, or some other reason, either way, here's my thoughts from back when I tried this abomination:\n\nReally boring, and not my type of game.\n\nFirst the options menu: It's horrible. Only a few resolution options, a few buttons for graphical options, which are preset according to setting like High, Highest, and so forth. No actual customising available. Keybindings cannot be changed. Basic mouse options of inverting, and mouse sensitivity buttons, rather than a bar or a number. All in all, the options menu needs a lot of work.\n\nGame starts off talking to everyone, and walking into building to talk to more people. You can also add to your fun by breaking vases or opening chests. The chests contain items that have really unfunny descriptions. That is basically a recurring facet of this game. Unfunny dialogue, stale descriptions, and flat jokes.\nDuring dialogue there is some voice work, but it doesn't match the text. Rather, it's your character saying hello multiple times in a conversation, and the constructs/spirit things making weird sounds.\n\nFinally, the character design is pretty bad. The female doesn't have to be attractive, nor have large assets, but I'm going to have to say the haircut is pretty horrid. A tumblrina if you will. The whole look of her is unbecoming to me, other than the outfit, which is passable. I suppose she matches an explorer, although it feels like the designer wanted her to be Lara Croft, just without being attractive in a tradional sense. I suppose the word is, hipster. This is of course subjective, but will this present times inspired look work in the future, should someone find themselves playing it? Does it work in present times? I don't feel her look emphasizes 'geeky girl'. It's different, and I feel emphasizes tumblr, SJW, feminist, things of that sort. I personally don't fall into that camp, and as such, makes me worry that the game is designed by a development group that IS affected by those camps. Politics don't belong in a game, unless directly marketed as such, and creativity marred by such a thing is troubling. From what I played of the game, I don't necessarily think the game itself is an extension of SJW beliefs, but I believe the creation of the character you play as in a physical sense, IS affected by the creators political beliefs. Take that as you will.\n\nThe world is colorful, and the game is inoffensive, in terms of interactions, but it just seems aimed at a younger audience, or people with easily offended sensibilities. I like a wide range of games, whether shooters, puzzles, rpgs, or some adventure games. I'll even go back to games like legend of zelda, or super mario bros. This game, however, is not my cup of tea, and I cannot recommend it. It lacks depth, and your interactions with the world reflects that. I didn't feel engaged, and more like the game was a chore. Maybe I'll come back in the future, but as things stand, it's too boring to hold my interest.","May 3","false","3.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

There is a bit of a plot here but ultimately the desire to return to the game isn't strong enough and the reply value is almost zero.\n\nThis brings me to the issue of, "Should I recommend this game to others?"\nThat is really a very conditional thing because there is money involved.\n\nHad this been a F2P game then I would wholeheartedly recommend it due to the fact that, in short sessions, the game is really very enjoyable and is a pleasure to look at. The visuals and style of the game just scream quality from the rooftops and there is enough tongue-in-cheek humour here to put a smile on even the most cynical of faces. If you enjoy games you will come across such a large number of references to other titles it is almost wrong to call them Easter Eggs since the game is saturated with them rather than having them hidden away. The developers clearly love Legend of Zelda and other Nintendo games because they not only attempted to create an Nintendo-esque art style but they also added music to the game which is clearly inspired by games such as Wind Waker. They achieved that goal with such success that you could drop Mario or Link into the game world and they'd look perfectly at home.\n\nUnfortunately when it comes to paying money for this and wanting value for money from your purchase, Child of Geos has very little to offer. It reminds me of something that would work well as a casual game for a rainy afternoon but nothing more, as such I wouldn't recommend this game unless it was on sale for maybe £2-3 at most.\n\nWhat the developers have created here is really something which deserves a sequel though, while they missed the mark on gameplay they have set a new benchmark for style and quality for the visuals, music and presentation for an indie game. I sincerely hope that this isn't the last we'll see of Lili.","November 29, 2014","false","4.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

As the game appearently was taller than my screen but still thinner. So I had to click around outside of my screen until I got the correct button.\nFrom there on things just got even more cryptic. For in regards to screen resolution you do NOT have the choice of 1920*1080.

I thought I was getting a full "Zelda"-like game with a female protagonist and a unique combat mechanism, but this was just "Flower-Picking: The Game," with occasional optional fetch quests.\n\nI'm not even sure what demographic this was meant for; the dialogues, humor, and videogame references are older-teenager appropriate, whereas the gameplay is simplified enough for an elementary student to master.  Likewise, The main character looks like she's 15 and acts like she's 12, but is supposed to be a graduate student, and has apparently played every old school videogame on the planet except for Zero Wing... even the other characters in the game couldn't place her age.\n\nWhat I liked about this game:\n- The visuals and character designs were interesting, creative, and well-crafted.  I really enjoyed the overall look and atmosphere of the game, and the attention to detail of the artists.\n- The game's frequent references to other videogames and movies, the dark humor, and the sassy side comments.  It was worth it to keep talking to characters and to read all the Mayor's signs.\n- The balanced learning curve.\n- The ability to pick up wearable items like ridiculous masks, videogame hats, and flying pets.\n\nWhat was okay:\n- The core game mechanic of picking flowers off spirits' backs.  While there was an increase in difficulty as the game went on (the introduction of thorns and bombs, the movement patterns of the spirit, the need to score higher combos of non-thorn flowers), there was not enough variation for it to feel appreciably different after about the 8th enemy.  The only real distinguishing factor from that point on was how long of a combo you needed in order to win 3 stars; early enemies only need 8-12 flowers in a row, whereas the final boss takes a chain of 30-40 flowers.  As you can imagine, by the 52nd spirit this minigame had worn out its welcome.\n- Sometimes you will be able to complete optional side quests instead of fighting, which fall into one of four categories: "find all the hidden things," "visit that place you just visited," "fetch an item from the chest you just opened," or "fight that spirit you just fought"... O.o\n- Four Hand Monty's "if you are short on cash and don't want to break vases" bonus ball-and-cup minigame.\n- The oversimplified inventory system that consists of three tiers of armor for each of your three stats, three one-use items that I rarely ever used, two kinds of currency, two levels of keys, a cheater's map, and a bottle that summons butterflies for no reason.  That's it, unless you count the treasure trophies that only exist for flavour.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- Being constantly interrupted by either Mailbox, or the Mayor, or the fish, with long blocks of dialogue that you can't really skip.  I'm all about witty banter and story progression, but considering you need to play through the game twice to get all the achievements, it would have been nice to be able to bypass the excessive chatter.\n- The big mid-game "choice."  I played through the game a third time, just to see what would happen if I chose the alternate path, and it was totally not worth it.  I was expecting at least a cutscene with the Professor.\n- The rainbow bird poo.  Seriously?  That needed to be a thing?\n- The achievements.  Some of them made sense, like the ones for beating the spirits, but some of them were needlessly tedious such as the "break 1000 vases" or "scare 500 birds." Additionally, these achievements are not cumulative across multiple playthroughs, you must break all 1000 vases using the same save file.\nThere is also one broken achievement for this game: "unlock all doors."  It seems there was a discrepancy between the PC version and other ports, with the PC release only having 22/28 unlockable doors programmed in.  Thus, the achievement cannot be unlocked without manually altering the game code (you can find instructions for this online, but I personally didn't want to risk irreparably damaging my game data just for 100% completion).  [Edit 12/19/14: The broken achievement has been removed from Steam, so you can now get 100% completion!]\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7/10.  I liked the setting and the humor, but the core gameplay and the achievements were tiresome and boring by the end.","December 8, 2014","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artsyle is amazing. The graphics are very good. There are tons of collectibles and sidequest. It had good humour (though a bit too much memes). The gameplay was not incredibly complex. The "Combat" involves picking flowers off of enemies in order to get red flowers. you get red flowers to progress to the next area. Honestly, this game is not meant for gameplay, but that is okay. What is truly most enjoyable about it was running around exploring, taking in the beautiful scenery and finding all of the hidden treasures. You even get to learn lore through finding items and talking with the villagers. Some bits are information you are only able to get from villagers after you find a certain hidden treasure. The story was nice too. Spoilering this part for well.... spoilers.\nWhile the story itself wasn't very complex, it wasn't just about saving the island from the tyrannical mayor and his goons. It was also to show how Lili grew as a person, and how this adventure made her realize that she was just doing what her dad wanted; instead of doing what SHE wanted. It was fun.\nThe Characters where all very likeable, and you may even grow attatched to some of them. My only real complaint was how easy the game was, and how short it was. Though honestly the experience is certainly worth having (if not for the enviroment alone). A very enjoyable experience, leaves a small amount of room for re-playability as well.

Specifically from a design aspect, I find the mechanics to be a fascinating way to have a non-combat oriented game that still proves to be challenging, interesting, and altogether very different.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty simple as far as a concept goes: you are a student botenist, and are collecting rare plants to study for a report, and thus go to an island. However, when you get there, trickster spirits get in your way and steal whatever flowers you have collected. To get them back, you must ride them like an unbroken bronco, plucking them while trying to hang on. All in all, very different, and definitely worth studying, especially if you have any interest in game design. Outside of this main gameplay trope, shall we say, there's a fair amount to explore in this world, with flowers showing up around every corner, plenty of people with well fleshed out personalities to talk with, and an interesting stat system to learn to make future, more difficult spirits more manageable.\n\nThen there are the aesthetics. This game is absolutely gorgeous for the few resources it takes. The textures are well placed and the models are incredible. The animations are so carefully crafted, that it draws you into the magical island you have entered. I haven't found anything that feels out of place, or that jars me from the experience of the game, even with all of the collectable hats you can find for your main character.\n\nNow the story is why I recommend this game with caution. Although it is fairly well written, it definitely is aimed towards a target audience that I am just not a part of. I believe this game to be designed with players younger than me in mind, older children into the preteen age. I feel like most children could get something out of this game, although I'm not completely sure how young too young would be for this particular title. However, being in my early 20s, this story simply doesn't compell me personally.\n\nNow even with the somewhat childish atmosphere and story, I still found myself truly enjoying the game. It's not my favorite game, by a long shot, but for what it is, it does offer some decent entertainment for when I just want to relax and play a game that reminds me of the titles that got me into gaming almost 20 years ago.","December 21, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's colorful and unique art style and character designs interested me enough to put it on my watchlist. Having had the chance to finally give the game a playthrough I can see it both met my expectations and also took them in a different direction. This isn't your typical RPG by a longshot. You won't really be level grinding or anything like that as there really is no battle mechanic. You play as a botanist and your typical task on the island is to pick flowers. The best flowers happen to grow on the backs of creatures known as spirits. Picking them off their backs as they try to shake you off takes the form of a mini-game. I hadn't known going in that the game was a revisioned port of an iOS game, but it by far feels like one. That isn't a bad thing however as this game is beautiful to look at and the 'battles' can get quite challenging when thorny flowers and bombs are thrown into the mix. The game is also quite charming with a very unique art style I greatly enjoyed.\n\nI do have a few issues with the game however, the camera has a bit of a wabble motion to it that is noticeable which can't be turned off in the options. If you easily get motion sick, this may get to you at first as it almost did with me, but as you're moving around it becomes less noticable. The game is also dull in parts and repetitive. Especially at first but once the game gains momentum it becomes far more interesting. The game even has a fairly dark undertone which I enjoyed but doesn't ever drown out it's charming and humerous nature. The writing is a bit odd at times though with occasional typos oddly phrased sentences and punctuation errors that hardly ruin the gameplay. Dialog is easy to read and understand even for children, though item descriptions can use words a bit out of reach for younger players. The game also features an auto-save feature which can get annoying towards the end of the game when you're given two choices. I would have liked to have saved at that point manually to reload later and take the other path instead of having to play through again.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed myself while I was playing and genuinely felt myself drawn into the world this game created. This game isn't for everyone and I wouldn't consider it an RPG as it's closer to a modern day point and click adventure. I'd recommend it to ages 10-15, especially to female audiences or Miyazaki anime fans as it has a similar world feel. It won't be a length sit. I finished the game in 5.5 hours, but it does have a branching path towards the end.","November 29, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise is that Lili has arrived on a mysterious island in order to study plants. She discovers a society run by Spirits who build wooden people called Contructs to do their bidding. Her mission then becomes to help the Constructs find freedom by defeating the Spirits. To defeat the Spirits, she has to pull flowers out of their backs. If you're using a keyboard and mouse, you'll use the mouse pointer to manually pick out flowers whilst avoiding thorns. If using a controller, you'll use corresponding buttons (A, X, B, and Y if you're using an Xbox 360 controller).\nInbetween fights, you'll explore the land of Geos, opening chests and doors and doing various side tasks for the local residents. As you progress, you'll gain points to improve your ability to grip onto Spirits, run, and approach Spirits without them noticing you (these are listed as Grip, Run, and Sneak respectively). This is how they qualify that whole "RPG hybrid" bit.\nThe game will take you a few hours to complete if you do every sidequests (and by "a few" I mean less than 3 or 4 depending on how well you can find flowers and avoid falling off Spirits) so the $20 price tag may not be worth it unless you can find replay value in defeating straggling Spirits, rematching old ones for a higher score, or venturing into a harder difficulty.\nIf I had to recommend this game, it probably wouldn't be to fans of Zelda, Broken Age, or Psychonauts (although there are 3 or 4 Zelda references that might bore you), but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't enjoyable. Still, the short length and the shortage of explorable areas keep the game from being the Zelda-esque adventure it strives to be.\nSo ultimately, can I recommend this game? I want to say, "No," but I had fun with it, so I'll begrudgingly press the "Yes" button alongside a precaution to wait for a sale.","February 4, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You pluck flowers off your target and the difficulty increases by increasing the required number of flowers needed to be picked and the introduction of dangerous objects that mix in with the object.  If my monitor had touch screen capabilities, I would be playing the game with my fingers.  Despite this simplicity the game is fairly enjoyable because it comes in combination with a fairly enjoyable setting and atmosphere.  If I were to compare it, it would have to be with the atmosphere of the first city you wonder through in JRPG games like Final Fantasy IX and Kingdom Hearts.  It has a joyous, adventerous feel that warms your heart.  Maybe not at full price, but I would certainly recommend this game if you want to play around in a happy setting with surprisingly well polished graphics and lighting.  I feel like this game is worthy enough for the developers to turn this into a series starring Lili in more adventures but with more RPG elements, more puzzle elements, and a larger world.","November 30, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once there, you discover that a race of beings called Constructs are working as slaves for vicious little critters called Spirits.  Naturally, you'll battle the Spirits, free the Constructs, do a little soul-searching, and save the day.\n\nThe gameplay is charming, but fairly limited.  You'll walk around, talk to people, do fetch quests, and fight Spirits in what are essentially QTE mini-games.  You jump on their backs and pluck all of their flowers out, avoiding thorns and shedding bombs as you go.  Defeated Spirits merely run off in a huff; everything is very non-violent and kid appropriate.  There's also a gambling mini-game that is fun for a few spins.\n\nSadly, there isn't much story to tie it all together.  It's clear that the evil Mayor will be the Big Bad from the get-go, so not much mystery there.  Lili's only real drama is whether or not to abandon the Constructs to turn in her project on time, and I doubt anyone will be very confounded on which path to choose.  Lili will also exchange letters with her professor that hint at some deeper family trauma at play, but it's only brought up at the very end of the game and nothing much is said of it.  Exploring that a little further might have added some real heart to the game and made it feel a bit more substantial.\n\nOf course, many of the game's shortcomings can be traced to its origins as a smartphone app, with an emphasis on sharp graphics and simplistic gameplay.  Make no mistake, the game is quite beautiful, but the transition from app to Steam product was less than ideal.  The game feels a bit unpolished all over, and the achievements are a total mess - some are bugged, others pop up erroneously, and many are tedious grinds which are completely inessential to clearing the game.  The game was perfectly playable on my end and didn't crash, but the whole thing felt rushed.\n\nAnd yet, with all that said, I'll give the game a mild thumbs up.  It's nice to see a family appropriate game on Steam, especially with a female protagonist.  It looks great, has pleasant tunes, and the writing can be quite funny in places.  You can tell that the adult writers were slipping in a ton of gags to either amuse themselves or any parents nearby.  It all goes down easy and most people will get a few hours of fun out of it.  That said, I got the game for 85% off - I wouldn't pay anything close to the base price of $20 for it.  Something in the $5 range is more appropriate.","January 30, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to collect red soul flowers from the islands evil spirits. I admit it does get a bit repetitive after a while. But thats where the beauty of the game comes in. The environments feel so greatly detailed. You can go into some of the houses of the towns folk and you get a pretty detailed look at how they run their lives, pictures on the walls, toilet paper on a tree-stick holder! With every new area I seek out- the more amazed I am of the beauty.\n\nThis is a short happy game- be prepared to do things over and over with a little bit of rotation. But take your time, explore. Experience the beauty.\n\nIf I'm ever to get the Occulus- I really want this game to be playable with it. I want to be in this dream world!\n\nPros:\nABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL GAME\nNice soundtrack\ninteresting 'people'\nSneaky game refrences\n\nCons:\nNot a really deep story\nEnemies are repetative\nVery little voice acting makes it feel like a wall of text sometimes\n\nI decided to pick up this gem when it was on sale\n","January 5, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The team that made it was incredibly small, yet has more polish than I could have expected from even a AAA developer these days.\nIt's lighthearted, mechanically sound (if not terribly innovative really), artistically magnificent, and just altogether charming. As is the case with many indie games, it has a healthy dose of humour and 4th-wall-breaking, and more gaming references than you can shake a deku stick at. (I'm incredibly sorry for that one, that's my bad.)\n\nLovely, lovely game, and incredibly ambitious work for such a small group.

From start to finish, Lili: Child of Geos is a blast. Memorable characters, quirky design, and a fantastic environment make this casual game worth playing. The shift of focus from "combat" to the chase is quite welcome, and dialogues with the different characters you encounter were surprisingly amusing. The weakest part of the port was disappointingly with its implementation of Steam Achievements, one of which is broken, and of the others that there are simply too many mindless ones (do X, Y times).\n\nMy biggest complaint is with its ridiculous $20 price tag (the mobile version costs $2.99); although the developers have indeed done a great deal to enhance the PC experience, over 600% mark-up is unacceptable. It's on sale frequently enough that my rating reflects a sale price, as it would be lower by several points at full price.\n\n7/10.","January 26, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The majority of the gameplay consists of running around kicking over vases, stealing flowers, breaking into peoples homes and assaulting NPC's from behind.  The anti-slavery storyline (however thin) is to be applauded, but the sub-plot involving a stalker is problematic.  Those with an addictive personality may want to steer clear of the gambling mini-game.\n\nNo technical issues other than an overly narrow FOV and lack of fine grained settings for graphics (the depth of field effect can get annoying).","January 18, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No spoken dialog, only mumbled few-word phrases like "heee-llooo-hooo", but often pages of uninteresting text dialog to read. No intro (at least I didn't get to see one), few simple controls, repetitive tasks all the time.\n\nIn the 2 hours I managed to play, it was all about breaking pots, opening chests and occasionally jumping spirits to pluck flowers off their backs. The map is a pain and full of unclear markings, keys that open all doors of a level can be bought fairly soon after collecting a few flowers, and most of the quests are pretty silly. Not just silly because all you do is run around and by chance figure something out, but also silly because the surrounding stories' scripting is of pretty low quality. A ninja sword for a pirate? C'mooon.\n\nTo think that I could've played 2 more entertaining hours of Titanfall instead... *sigh*","April 26, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
