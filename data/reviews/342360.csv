The train stands as a common ground of a setting where you have windows and other passengers. Each one having their own existence shadowed. In this game, you are caught between decisions and if you like fortunes (Tarot Cards specifically) or have an interest in them; making a psychological aspect of who or what you are. The story resolves around hours and you are drawn to specific cards, these cards you choose also grant you the cards in Steam for players unless you idle and lose the choice of chance then. You have to get through those points. The cards all have an interesting connection of past. The more you go through you find a way to identify the people around you as well as yourself. For instance, these people/shadows leave and move around. DIfferent choices lead to different status and depending on them, the choice shows a significant effect on dialogue. If you are to think of VNs and routes this has a very basic but understandable concept. However the text shows deep insight into the creation or "memory recall" of yourself or another. Basically you got to play it a bit to understand what it gets at. Summarizing it so far it's one of those games that it's a choice that can matter. As stated you can only choose 9 cards but events and discussions show up that will make you go along the story. However as for anymore to spoil, the game shows it's bits of mystery and suspense. For those seeking a good read and play evaluation, try this. However if price is not for you wait. It doesn't have to be rushed this game is a patience on time and sadly there is no Screen shot button as well as an auto play. So you'll be clicking quite a  lot. Enjoy it if you do. The game makes you view death in a certain way as well as questions of life. Throughout the game on each end you get the password. I will not spoil it for you however there are some online guides. Although there is an extras gallery it cannot be unlocked without a code. Alas this game trult did play quite a bunch of high replayable moments. If you take the time to decipher and figure out all the characters and names in the story while playing the routes. You will find a deeper appreciation.\nTips and Hint: Check your stats and decisions. Save before them to understand and save yourself the trouble. Although some choices just change a few things specifically. Your stats make a difference to the ending. Also there are passwords in the main menu continue screen and endings can be replayed there. *I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR THE IN-DEPTH VN route takers you take the time to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-SPOILERS-\nThere are two protaganist routes(Wind and Wing, you start as Wind)! As well as a side story.\nWatch the Opening if you want to figure out the true end "phase". If you are looking for passwords. I will include a guide later. However they will just spoil it for you.","January 14, 2015","true","5.8"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","27","33","3","2"

Albeit the game was short but the story was compelling. It took me roughly 5 hours to complete it in its entirety. You're on a train with several people who have all recently died and you're basically piecing together your past. This game deals with some serious issues, such as suicide, death and a few other mature subjects. Most of which are approached subtly as you progress through the story uncovering your past but also through interacting with the other passengers on the train. The haunting melody of the soundtrack with the muted color scheme adds to the overall atmosphere of the game. Not to mention that the characters you're talking to for the most part are silhouettes of their former self.\n\nThere are many choices that affect the endings you get and you'll need to finish the game a number of times before the "true, good ending" is revealed, and you uncover the complete story. Of course you could cheat and just look up the passwords to unlock them instead of playing the game through a few times but I feel like each ending lends itself to a bit more of the main character's personality and state of mind. You also get to understand how the other characters relate to them. This is a really good game and I fully enjoyed it.","January 26, 2015","true","5.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

You talk to the other passengers, as you try to figure out the mystery of what your life was, before your train reaches its destination.  We could've had some really interesting characters here, but the dev made the story so vague, and all the supporting characters too, that the entire game is just boring because of all the ambiguity.\n\nThe ONLY remotely interesting thing about this game initially is the endings, and it's a total chore to get all 4 of the "initial endings", because you can't skip ANYTHING even though 90% of the game is the exact same no matter what your choices are.\n\nEventually, if you unlock all 4 initial endings, you get access to the REAL game, called Wing's Path.  This is where you actually have a decent shot at piecing together what your character's life was like.  Wing's Path prevents me from recommending this game for two reasons:\n\n1)  You are expected to complete all 4 initial endings before getting access to the real game.  Really... I'm expected to waste 4 playthroughs of my real life time?  That's dopey.  It should unlock after 2 endings.\n\n2)  The fact that the real game is called "Wing's Path" is troubling.  It's actually an appropriate name, but it's related to a lie told in the game that almost all players will accept as a given fact of the story, and this red herring makes piecing together the story by yourself VERY difficult on your first few playthroughs.  If this in-game lie was not told, the player would have a much easier time piecing together the story throughout their playthroughs of the game.\n\nAlso, there are two characters with the name "Wing" in this game - one major character, and one minor character.  This again unnecessarily complicates the player's ability to piece together the past, and I can't think of a reason why the dev chose to make two completely different characters have the same name, other than to confuse you.\n\nUnlocking the true ending of the game (which thankfully gives an entire explanation of your life), is pretty much impossible on your own.  Fortunately, the dev has a guide to assist you in your pursuit of the true ending:\n\nhttp://www.zeiva.net/other/toa/guide_ending.html\n\nIf you choose to buy this game though, I would recommend getting 2 initial endings on your own, using the guide to get the other 2 initial endings, getting 1 Wing's Path ending on your own, and then guiding for the rest.\n\nThe dev mentions in his comment of this review that you can hold down the down arrow key to skip through a lot of text.  It's very useful on ending farming, but I don't think it's mentioned in game.\n\nAll in all, the unnecessarily long "walling off" of the true game, a lie in the game, and name confusion prevent me from recommending it.  The story fragments given, and the lack of any timeline for the fragments, already made the story difficult to put together as is.  There was no reason to make things even harder with an in-game lie, and two distinctly separate characters with the same name. I'm not going to say "don't play it", but I'm not going to say "you should play it" either.  Get it on sale for a few bucks if the positive reviews really pique your interest, I guess.","January 15, 2015","false","3.9"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","36","57","0","4"

I like it, but theres really no need for that.\n\nIn its current state there's just no way I could recommend it. You can actually save the game, but when it ends the game wipes all the saves. Plz add a REAL save feature and then I can recommend this.\n\nThe developer has fixed the save bug and that was the biggest problem with the game. Now you can just mess around and try out different dialogue easier without worrying about having to replay the whole thing if you screw up.\n\nI'd still recommend following a guide to get all good endings, its very tricky.","January 16, 2015","true","1.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","3"

I really like the feel of the game, the story, obviously the art, and the music. It's quite a step above most of the visual novels on steam, and well worth your time. I got this game in a bundle so I didn't pay full price, so I'd recommend waiting for a good sale or for it to be bundled again if you're looking for a deal, otherwise I'd say give it a go at full price, considering it's also not nearly as over-priced as some of the steam visual novels.\n9/10 so far.

To appreciate that Visual Novel, you must like that essential part lingering during the entire game. All is thought for that aspect with the low pace and the musics.\n\nThe story is a little masterpiece, as it plunges the reader little by little in the understanding in the form of a kind of puzzle which unknots itself in the very end. The atmosphere and the story together give form to a very emotionnal grand finale which might make you cry because of its intensity.\n\nThere are quite a lot of choices in the game and they are really important to move forward in the story and through the different endings. Some people will say that the game needs a guide, but I don't agree. Anybody passionnated by the story and the atmosphere will try to find all fine details and a clear logic will eventually reveal itself to make the good choices. However, there is a very difficult riddle at the end of the game, impossible for me to resolve without the clue in the author's site (but really, it worths the effort).\n\nThe Visual Novel talks about sensitive subjects, but I don't think that could be a problem for anyone. Now, the only flaw for me is the repetitiveness. There are 9 endings, and you will start again and again the game to get all of them. Well, if you are passionnated by the atmosphere and the story, it's not a big deal but I can understand some people give up because of that (even if I recommend against doing that because the very end is really excellent).\n\nOnce again I'm impressed by a Zeiva's Visual Novel.

But if there's no actual interaction, I just can't stay engaged. I hate to admit it, but I've passed up some wonderful VNs because they're.. basically a movie. I'm not a movie person; I get antsy, and outright bored. This VN, though.. Has a ton of interaction. Constantly keeping me engaged, thinking about what's going on.\n\nI love it.\n\nTrain of Afterlife starts you off as somebody who has passed away, and no longer has memories of their living moments. You board a train, and meet very real characters throughout the course of it. Real, in the sense, that they're relatable. You feel like you could actually meet these people; they're wonderfully-written.\n\nThis game had some of the most profound, thought-provoking things to say, sometimes seemingly out of nowhere. The entire atmosphere of the train can be wonderfully calming, or uncomfortably eerie, and it all depends on you, the player. Not the choices you make as the character, but how you actually interpret it. Things may seem one way or another, and it's all based on your perspective.\n\nWith nine endings in total to go through, I'm going to say this: It's not going to make sense after your first playthrough. You will be utterly confused, curious. With plenty of forking paths in conversations, you won't see every possible conversation outcome in one game.\n\nIf you're big on the game looking nice art-wise, just take a look through the store's screenshots. You've got nothing to lose. I, personally, am a big fan of it. It matches the game's style of being peaceful or creepy; however you'd like to view it. The music, in general, is very pretty. It fits the scenes well, and more than once I found myself sitting in one area and listening to the track over and over.\n\nTl;dr This game is beautifully written, engaging, and utterly profound in its own sense. The art is appealing, the music is nice, and it's got tons of replay value.

It's also one of those kinds of stories where you can piece together its mysteries before they're revealed — and you kind of have to for its excellent final puzzle — which I quite enjoyed being able to do. The characters and their dialogue all feel as fleshed-out as they could be for the game's length, though it may take multiple playthroughs to realize that since initially they feel somewhat stilted and their full story can only be revealed through taking certain actions at the right times. Perhaps my only criticisms of the plot are that several of the endings feel pointless, and that the relationship between the main characters veers too close to anime garbage territory, but even then I can't say I found it completely unbelievable considering the circumstances.\n\nGameplay is typical; you read messages, move around the train, and every now and then make a decision that impacts what ending you'll end up getting. Unlike most visual novels, there (usually) isn't an option to skip already-read text, but at the very least clicking rapidly does the same job. On the other hand, the fades from scene to scene are a bit slow, which can be irritating when trying to quickly repeat actions to see another ending.\n\nGraphically, there's not too much to say since the game takes enough of a minimalist approach that you can see most of the game's graphics in the screenshots on the store page. For what it's worth, I do think the background art is rendered nicely and the subdued colors perfectly set the mood. There are only a few tracks of music in the game, all of which are from royalty-free websites, but the selection is fitting and soothing.\n\nAfter clearing all 9 endings of the game there's also a brief side-story to read through, which at the end pushed plausibility a bit too much for me to appreciate everything else about it, and an extras gallery, which, in addition to including a CG viewer and a music player, also has character bios and such where the writer also speaks about her inspirations, which I found interesting to read.\n\nOverall, though I wasn't blown away by its conclusion, nor moved to tears by its events, Train of Afterlife executed its premise with enough finesse to captivate me for the few hours its journey lasted.","April 7, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This is more of a "visual novel" than a game, although you do have the option of selecting one of thirteen tarot cards (that reveal more of your past) on each of the game's "days."  It's quiet and thoughtful, and offers some of the developer's thoughts on life and death, but it can be completed in less than half an hour. That said, Train of Afterlife offers several different endings depending on the choices you make while playing, and collecting all the endings will open up something called "Wing's Path" which lets you effectively complete the game's story.  For completists, this will be an attraction, but for casual players, one journey on this train will be enough. Either way, the normal (current) price of $12.99 US is far too much. The visual style, story, and mechanics are minimal at best, but the trip is interesting the first time through (clicking to select destination seats can be tedious over time, but without it, there'd be very little interaction).

I really love these. It's so apt, thoughtful and perfect. (e.g "The only person who can imprison you is no one but yourself."\n- The extra story for one of the characters which gives us further insights and details of her past.\n- Great art\n- The OST are rather nice\n\nCons:\n- It is tedious to go through everything again to unlock all the endings (Use the guide that Zeiva provided on their website if it gets too tedious and hard.)\n\nIt is still worth it to unlock all the endings and the true end!","December 31, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While having to replay the game to collect more pieces and figure out the mystery is not a bad idea, it'll make it a lot harder to look past the somewhat clunky interface, the illusion of interactivity and dreary music while retaining an interest in the story if you go through the same bits up to 9 times. At the beginning I was genuinely intrigued, by the end it was a tedious chore and I wanted it over with.I still enjoyed what I got in the end but it was a hard road getting there.\n\nStill, it's unique and thought-provoking enough to at least give it a shot, though waiting for a sale is recommended; one playthough takes an hour even while exploring all text options.","March 27","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The VN takes place in a train, which is carrying the souls of people recently departed from the world "to heaven, hell, or whatever lies ahead". Each soul/shadow stays on the train for 12 hours, before departing. Some of these souls attempt to figure out their past lives, while others believe in leaving it behind. How the character interacts with these souls decides what happens when the character has lived his/her 12 hours through. The character also has the choice to view flashbacks of his/her past life, using Tarot Cards.\n\nAll in all, Train of Afterlife was a superb visual novel, simplistic and aesthetic at some moments, while downright creepy and disturbing at others. The soundtrack was great and the art style distinctive. I give it a Recommended and 9/10.","December 13, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

To summarize, though the game brings up many questions about the afterlife, it doesn't present a fair point of view, requiring that the player hold a certain point of view to reach the endings they desire.  The true ending worsens the other endings as a whole, and the characters eventually turn into mechanics to reach the ending the player desires, because how grindy the game becomes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtDBIHvcRjw","July 22, 2015","false","6.6"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

It all takes place in one compartment of a train on its way to the afterlife, and there are only a small handful of characters. But the fun of the game is playing it over and over to see all of the endings and find out how it all comes together. It's a sad and memorable story, and at times very creepy.\n\nLike other visual novels, there is a lot of repetition in subsequent playthroughs and I would recommend a walkthrough to figure out how to get the true ending of the game as it's not intuitive.","May 3, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps just wait for it to go on sale.\n\nAnyway, moving on the the review. It's a tad confusing and a bit weird but it does all tie up even if some of the plots are loosely knotted up. Basically you have just died and you figured out stuff from your past and who the mysterious boy or girl (you get to choose) named Wing is. Through the power of Tarot and unlocking different ending which give you a passcode, you can progress and learn more of the story.\n\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and recommend it but it is an acquired taste. At first, I was like, what the hell is this but it really did grow on me. My only real complaint is I wish there was more to it. It felt a little flat and lackluster.

There are only nine endings, so if you save strategically you should be able to clear the entire game in an evening. A fair warning - for artistic reasons, the author does not have any form of a "skip dialog" feature, you have to click through everything each time you replay. The music is nice and atmospheric but gets a little dull over time. Like most visual novels, its story is the best element and the writing is good - no huge monolouges and enough clues peppered throughout that you can form theories around. There's also some nice imagery relating to tarot, and the "true" ending wraps up the game nicely. Definitely worth a few dollars, so buy when it's on sale.","December 24, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did make it to the final hour and got a mysterious, unsatisfying ending.  I decided that once through was enough.  I went to YouTube to see the "true ending."  Thirteen dollars is too much for this visual novel.  The time it would have taken to get the true ending would have been too much.

None of the characters remember what things were like when they were alive or even their own names.
