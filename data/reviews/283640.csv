It's basically a neat little mash-up of Dark Souls & Castlevania (or a "Metroidvania")! I mean, that's how I went in to it and that's what I got. It definitely scratches all the right itches, if that's up your alley.\n\nSo, when folks say it's a Dark Souls-like, there helps explain some mechanics quickly:\n-There's a stamina bar\n-There are "bonfires"\n-You get "Estus flasks". Don't worry about needing to grind for healing stuff if you're in a rough patch\n-Level-ups are governed by "souls" (referred to as "salt" in this)\n-Movesets are very similar. ie, parrying, rolling, choosing to two-hand a weapon, etc\n-Equip load controls and limits your movement and rolling/tumbling/flopping ability\n-It's easy to die. Things hurt. They also don't really like you?? It's very rude\n\nThe Castlevania vibe comes from a few things. Largely because it's 2D, but I think the label also applies itself because this is a 2D world with lots of vertical movement. Y'know, scaling several "screens" and stuff.\n\nIt's a fresh world, though! Story is given through item descriptions (DRINK UP THAT ~~LORE~~, FOLKS), as well as very sparse NPCs. Salt is also a heavy item of reference, as you will quickly find. The primary use? For leveling. Now, there are primary stats in this, but they are tied to/governed by a skill tree/web. Think FFX's sphere-grid and there you go.\n"Choose this to learn how the hell to use a hammer. It also gives you a point of strength."\n"This icon has a horse. It also gives you endurance for some reason"\n\nThe game itself is rather lightweight and looks wonderful in spite of this (~500mb at the time of release). I will say that the character faces look... Bad. I just gave my dude shaggy hair and a gigantic beard to cover it up. The Grizzly Adams look worked well until I found a hat.\n\nOne thing I will mention, though, is that the game doesn't *tell you* much. Like, I get that it's the "Dark Souls Thing," but remember the Estus-equivalent (red potions in this)? For example, from what I'd seen so far, the game never tells/shows you that your little red potions are refilled at sanctuaries. I died at a boss, thought I wasted them, and noticed I had gained them back.\n\nAnyhow, it's a good game so far! I recommend it if the above appeals to you!","May 17","true","3.6"," 183 of 204 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","183","204","12","3"

If you like Dark Souls, I don't see why you wouldn't at least somewhat like Salt & Sanctuary but if you're looking for a pure "Metriodvania" this game will disappoint, because the game is much more Souls than "Vania".\n\nThe combat combo system is awesome. Different button combinations produce different attack animations making combat fun and kinda like a "beat-em-up". S&S has alot of different weapons and armors, all upgradable, and a very cool level progression system sorta like Dark Souls but includes a massive skill tree. S&S also has a message system like DS, where you can create and read messages from other players.\n\nS&S is very easy at first, even the first boss is weak (not the impossible boat boss), it gradually gets harder, then I experienced a huge difficulty jump when I visited "Castle of Storms", which was rather frustrating. I put the game down for awhile because of it.\n\nI would have liked to see multi directional attacks as well, as you can only attack left and right=old castlevania style. I would have also liked weapon and armor drops from enemies like in DS, but its not there, enemies drop loot sometimes, just not weapons and armors.\n\nOverall I do like S&S. Its not near as good as the Souls series and a "Metroidvania" it is not, but it is a wonderful game if you like Souls and 2D side-scrolling action and its unique for that very reason, its 2D Souls! If you don't like the Souls series, you would want to pass on this game as it borrows too heavily from it, not bringing enough originality to the table, nor does it bring game changing mechanics to the 2D action-plat genre.\n\nI'd rather play DS 3 atm, but I do recommend this game, I highly recommend it when it goes on sale and after you have gotten your DS 3 fix.","May 17","true","7.9"," 65 of 69 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","65","69","2","4"

I was gonna write an elaborate review on Salt and Sanctuary, but I thought this might be better:\n\nI play nothing but Souls games. I might take an interest in some other game for a while. BUT I never finish em or I loose interest. That might be boring of me, but whatever.\n\nWhen I played Dark Souls 1 back in 2012 it had me hooked. I also bought Demon's souls and really loved that too. Those two Souls games were all I played. I played them till my ps3 died and then thank the gods, Dark Souls came to PC so I got it on Steam. I played that till Dark Souls 2 came out. Then after all the DLCs and things were done, I also bought a PS4 JUST so I could play Bloodborne. Then I bought the Scholar edition of Dark souls 2 and played the crap out of that till Dark Souls 3.\n\nSalt and Sanctuary is the Best thing I've played since Dark Souls. I love the weapons, the combat, the bosses and the great locations. It's familiar enough to jump right in and start cracking skulls, while being different enough to be fresh.\n\nIf the Souls games are your "thang" then just buy this and Praise the salt.","May 22","true","21.3"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","66","73","4","13"

You won't be button mashing to do flamboyant combos here, forget about it... You either learn to play cautiously, observe your environment, and block strategically or you will DIE like a ♥♥♥♥ING prick!!!\n\nIt's got multiple classes, a decent amount of character customization options, and a massive skill tree that levels up your individual skills while giving you little snipets of lore.\n\nThe music is a mix of sound effects, dark ambient and beautifully haunting guitars which all add to the already decrepit atmosphere.\n\nIt's easily one of the best indie games I've purchased in a very long time, it oozes with passion from the devs. Finally something to scratch my itch for a Symphony of the Night HD remaster.","May 21","true","5.2"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","65","73","18","0"

It's even worse than blind Dark Souls playthroughs.\n- Some bosses/enemies feels unfair, no counter-play, if you try to roll behind them, their attack will reach you even if you're behind (Looking at you, Kraekan Wyrm you ♥♥♥♥ing piece of ♥♥♥♥)\n\nI've already played 40 hours by the time i'm doing this review and the game still pretty fun!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaldy90/recommended/283640/","kaldy90","electric jesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaldy90/","1211 products in account","Is this 2D Dark Souls or something completly different ?\nFirst things first, in my opinion this game should not be compared to Dark Souls.\nAs someone who beat all Dark Souls games multiple times, I see why people compare it to Dark Souls and I have to say, that some facts are pretty identical to Miyazakis masterpiece (lets forget Dark Souls 2 for a moment). But this game feels more like a 2D brawler, like Streets of Rage or to be more precise, because of the higher difficulty level, like the old Shinobi or Ninja Gaiden games.\n\nBut lets talk about the game itself:\n\nThe game has a stunning artwork. Everything looks like a painting. The animations are fluid and the combat system is "inspired" by Dark Souls (damn, looks like this comparison is just too fitting...), means you have a fast depleting stamina bar wich is used for every action taken and a even faster depleting healthbar, if you are not carefull enough. And it  will	 deplete, because the bosses are difficult, have mostly two or more phases and are just freaking awesomely designed. For example an early boss,  The Queen of Smiles	 looks just terrifyingly epic and has some pretty beautiful and deadly attacks.\n\nThe weapons you will use have different move patterns, wich needs to be mastered. But for me, here ends the similarities between Dark Souls and Salt and Sanctuary.\n\nSalt and Santuary plays like a 2D plattformer, stuck into a great RPG-corset. And the battlesystem reminds me somewhat of Devil May Cry, with its fast and light attacks and the heavy but slow attacks and of course the aerial combos. Yes, right - aerial combos. You can knock your enemies up in the air and follow them with some hits and a final blow to the ground, wich is a good way to deal damage while avoiding it.\n\nBy the way, wich needs some explanation too is, that if you want to play a sorcerer or cleric:\nWhen you cast spells, your stamina bar will loose some maximum stamina, wich represents fatigue. So you need some "blue health pots" (they are different for each faction) to restore your maximum value.\n\nAnd lets not forget that this game is a metroidvania, too. You will find items and equipment wich will help you find new ways, even in the starting area, after you have departed for round about 3 hours. So prepare for some backtracking, if you want to reveal all the secrets of the island.\n\nTo make it short:\nPros:\n\nBeautiful artstyle (- but the character models look a bit strange at first)\nChallenging gameplay and bosses\nMetroidvania thoroughly\nThere are some factions to choose from, wich will alter the look of your sanctuary.\nEven compared to Dark Souls, this game differs a whole lot, to be recognize as its own game\nCons:\n\nIf you dont like backtracking - there is backtracking\nSome may do not like the character models\nThat´s all - seriously, I do not find any other cons, at least for me.\n\nVerdict\nTo be honest, this game looks like Dark Souls, feels like Dark Souls, but it plays totally different compared to Dark Souls.\nThe World itself, with its melancholic feel and artwork wants to be explored. The weapons and skills wants to be mastered. The epic bosses want to be defeated. This game breaths and lives the vibe of the Souls-Games, but it has it own ideas and tweaks to be its own game. If you like the Souls-Games and need a new fix, this will greatly sufficient.\n\nEven if I have not yet completed the game, I am sure that I will remind this game as "Salt and Sanctuary" and not as "the 2D Dark Souls game".\n\n\n(Edit: After exactly 15 hours of play time I have beaten the game, and it is pretty awesome. The ending will left you want to play more and thankfully there is NG+.Still I need to say, that the last few bosses were much to easy, at least for my build, wich contained heavy armor and a two-handed mace)\n\n.\n.\n.\n...By the way, I did compare it to Dark Souls, didn´t I ? ...","May 20","true","15.8"," 53 of 70 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","53","70","6","0"

Like rebindable keys (espically good for a souls fan) resoultion options, borderless windowed for those who enjoy that.\n\nOnto the game:\nThis game is basically a Souls-like set in a 2D metriodvania style. The game mechanics have been translated to 2D in a fashion that makes it feel natural. The Controls are responsive and fuction like what you should expect out of a 2D souls-like.\nThe game carries over more or less all the Souls mechanics that would work in a 2d plane (Stamina bar, Invicibilty frames, "bonfires", refreshable healing [estus], currency dropped on death and then gone if you can't retrieve it etc.)\nA mechanic in this game that can be brutal is wouding. Attacks deal different amount of wounding to you, reducing you total max health. This can destory you if you aren't careful. Also you can exhuast you stamina bar lossing max stamina. This is easy too do since rolls use a lot of stamina but are very very good. Can be reset at sanctuaries (bonfire) or with certain spells/items.\n\nSome of most spotable diffrences is leveling up. Instead of simply having stats to level up, you have a talent tree.\nThe talen't tree adds depth and a diffrent apporach I think is beneficial for this game. You flesh out and learn higher classes within weapon which might seem annoying in the first place but it adds to not making you a master of all trades. While higher class gear is better it means you gotta sepnd a lot more levels to get it. Hence it balances out. Everything in skill tree imrpoves your stats, other than those giving you more potions/estus.\n\nAnother mechnic that is different is there is salt and gold. All salt is dropped or rather stealed by the enemy that kills you, the enemy that steals your salt will power up and you receive the salt when it's killed. Bosses drop salt they've stolen at set precents (usually 20-25 ish) and doesn't seem to change in anyway by holding it. Upoun death a npc will pull you back to the last sanctuary (bonfire) and take a set amount of your gold (10% ish). This can't be retrived.\nSalt is mainly used to level up you level and weapons and to transmog weapons with boss drops. Gold is mainly used too buy items from npcs.\n\nIn this game sancutries are your safehaven wher you level up. The big thing here is that sanctuaries are under certain creeds if not empty. If you are the the sanctury's creed youcan summon npc's to that sanctuary, vendors, blacksmiths, creed questline npc's etc. If a sanctuary is oppucied by another creed you can not summon npc's or get creed exlusive's from the npc. The npc in there will offer you to join theri creed which abondeds the old one. You can hower convert or defile another sanctuary to take it over.\nCreeds have exlusive itmes at certain npc which usually ar locked behind leveling up the creed. This can be done trough a leader (creed npc).\n\nThe enemies and bosses in this game is very varied and placemnt of enemies uses the 2D plane to it's fullest. Platforming is a fair chunk in this game while not the most difficult it adds to the game and can be used heavily against some enemies.\nBoss desgin is great, difficulty compared to souls depends on the player more than the game. Personally i find it easier due to it's easier for me to see the bosses attack (2d handrdawn style is the reason behind it) Bosses in this game is highly varied in terms of desgin, attacks etc. So bossfight doesn't feel like copycats.\n\nThis game is full of secret and cryptic secrets. So there is a lot to exprole.\nThe world conects together, making backtracking less a chore and makes the world seem more "naturual"\nSound and visual wise this game is solid giving you a fairly good immersion.\n\nThe game cartinaly isn't without flaws, but no game breaking ones. There is a lot that could be added and things to improve and tweak, but for such a small team this is a Grand 2D piece. This game isn't for everyone, and being a soulsfan doesn¨t nescarrily mean you will like this.\nBut all in all I highly recommend this game.\n\nPS: For those who need helps; Yes there is a wiki","May 18","true","13.4"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","33","38","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prude/recommended/283640/","prude","Puri Puri Prude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prude/","303 products in account","This game is basically everything I wanted from it. Captures the Souls combat formula perfectly in 2D, incorporates aspects of metroidvania games to fill in the rest of the mechanics, and just feels well put together (especially for such a small team) whilst not being overly short or simplistic. I've played all 3 of the main Dark Souls installments and perhaps it's just familiarity causing it, but I found this legitimately more challenging at many points than Dark Souls 3 was. Level design is excellent (and would probably appeal to people who preferred Dark Souls 1's looping paths and interconnectivity and abundance of shortcuts) and the platforming aspect isn't neglected either; there's some neat tricks introduced as you go deeper. The price of entry seems fair, I could see myself spending multiple playthroughs at likely over 10 hours each (2-3x more for the first, NG+ an option) with this. Strikes me as very replayable with as many interesting build options that the game gives you. Magic isn't awful like it has been for the last 1.5 Dark Souls games either, so there's that. Virtually anyone could run this, and I've not heard of many technical issues (more than could be honestly said for some of its inspiration). All in all I had a lot of fun and the similarity to niche games many of us have previously enjoyed helps to both highlight where it does well in emulating the thrill of said games, but also shows off the ways that it feels like an entirely new experience divergent from those games.\n\nReally all I could complain about here is enemy grab attacks. Mostly unfun in the Souls games and mostly unfun here too when they come in to play, but that's just a select few enemy types that often have avoidable mechanics if cautious.","May 22","true","18.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","0"

I was torn apart weth I should get Hyper Light Drifter or Salt and Sanctuary. My little brother was a little more interested in S&S, so I got it.\n\nI got thrown onto an unknown island to find my princess, after I lost her at sea and washed ashore. I found my first sellsword idol and realised, "Wait, there's local co-op?"\n\nAnd so me and my brother played and enjoiyed the game to our fullest. I was the tanky, two-hand great sword dude, and he was the high dps mage. I also threw a little of miracles into my build to use the guardian sword miracle I bought (but ended up finding the revive miracle way more useful).\n\nThe game, by itself, should not be treated as a parody to Dark Souls. Rather, treat it as a stand-alone title, with its own experience and gameplay that rivalss even Dark Souls. Treat the game as an equal, because it gives and experience that is independent in its own way. Of course, it does look a little souls-like, but dut let that make you think the game is a worse parody of Dark Souls. The world map is interconnected in a way that can even rival Dark Souls 1. The bosses are just as amazing and challenging, if not, more. But unlike Dark Souls, the platforming never gets old as you wall jump, change gravity, and even dash mid-air to help you get to where you're going.\n\nIn summary, the game has you running about killing monsters, jumping in puzzles, and slaying enormous bosses. But unlike Dark Souls, the whole concept of plattforming, level and world design make the experience unique and fun. You can even bring a friend to help you celebrate your deathfest.","May 30","true","29.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

Sanctuaries act as hubs for leveling up (which is done by collecting "salt" from enemies), branching your skill tree, and talking with vendors. Tech Tree is locked so choose skills/abilities wisely. Losing salt when you die makes death a consideration when chosing to battle enemies who might be stronger than you. This lends itself to somewhat of a grind for salt/leveling up at the begininng of the game but the grind is just enough to let you get a feel for controls. I used my Xbox One controller in lieu of a mouse/keyboard and it works great - would highly recommend going this route. The different character classes seem to offer lots of great replayibility.","May 17","true","46.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

S&S has all the same Souls-like mechanics: Light, Heavy, Block, Parry, Rolling, stamina draining actions and commitment to your actions.\n\nThe combat is smooth. Heavy and Light attacks, parrying and blocking all come together to give a combat depth I've not seen in a game since Dark Souls. The added jumping attacks give another dimension to the combat.,,\nEach weapon has a class, and these classes have different move-sets (like Dark Souls) which add even more depth. In addition to weapons there are incantations (spells) to add more variety than just your average hack and slash.\n\nThe platforming is precise unlike Vladis Story, Platforming in S&S feels fluid, and it hasn't gotten in the way of combat, yet.\n\nI died on the first boss a few times because it was so intense, but the difficulty isn't unfair like in some games (Vladis Story for example). It feels very fair, I only died to the boss from my mistakes, not because of some unblockable RNG combo. I almost died from a normal enemy because of my mistakes as well.\n\nThere is also local co-op which is very well laid out and was the most fun I had in a long time on a PC game. Salt is the best couch co-op game I've played on PC in a long, long time.\n\nOverall, If you like titles like Dark Souls, Zelda, Ori and the Blind Forest, or even Vladis Story (which I didn't like), then, I think you'll enjoy this game. S&S  is even worth it at full price.","May 17","true","40.2"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","2"

Its more often called "2D Dark Souls" then its called by its real name. Yes, its true that the game takes a lot of things from the Souls Franchise and its easy to see and say where the inspiritation came from. But it mixes it up with its own unique ideas wich make this game very special.\n\nThe 2D perspective and the controlls give this game the possiblity to use jump'n run mechanics and also some metroid or castlevania elements mixed up with pretty well working combat system wich wants to figured out by the player. The combat is challenging as it is in the Souls Series but it has its own flow coming from the faster movement of the players characer. The list of weapons and armor is large, there is a huge skill tree, many possibilites to build yor character.\n\nThe worlds in this game look amazing and beatiful, very detailed you can see that the devs loved what they did. There is a very unique vibe that you can feel while playing the game. Its all dark and sad, but in the same moment this sadness is broken up by the funny design they have choosen for your character and the npcs. The worlds dont equal each other and so do the bosses. There are various enemies, wich are all well designed mostly feel well placed and not just put there just to be there.\n\nThere are not many downsides for this game. In some situations the game is a bit unfair, cause you will die without having the chance to escape or win the fight. It takes some time to figure out the Sanctuary, Creed and weapon enforcement mechanics. Escpecially the Sanctuary/Creed thingy is a bit confusing. But thats all.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell: If you are a Souls-Fan like i am, you will love this game, if you like well planed and lovely designed 2D metroidvania games, you will love this game. If you like challenging hack'n slay with tactical combat, you will also love this game.\n\n8.5/10","May 21","true","18.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

It's the first 2D Souls game that I believe to be an evolution instead of a copy. It runs well, and is highly responsive with controller. The graphics and particularly the animations are well executed, especially after parries.

Well this is one of those real legit uses. It's a Lord of the Fallen level shameless homage, just transplanted into a 2D platforming Metroidvania world. You have sanctuaries that act as bonfires, resting at them replenishes health, stamina and item usage but respawns enemies. You have salt instead of souls (though the level system is a bit more unique, each level gives you a point to put into a skill tree instead of directly increasing stats). You can hit a button to switch between one-hand or two-handing a weapon, dodge, have equipped weight limits, can parry into a big counterhit, build as a rogue or warrior or wizard or cleric or whatever. Yadda yadda. What's impressive is that they took all of these features and transplanted them into 2D in a way that works. There are things like Covenants to join, but abandoning one will mark you as a sinner, there are upgrade paths for weapons that require finding obscure materials, there are shortcuts to unlock and annoying fast enemies and poison status effects and the ability to leave messages for other players, it's all here. Plus local co-op.\n\nYou probably already know if you like Souls-like games by now, and if you do, then get this because it's a good one, and oddly cute in its mimicry but no less brutal or compelling with some messed up monster design and serious challenge. A little brother to the real series and just at the right price. About my only complaint is the sketchy art style sometimes looks a little too rough in an un-stylized way, and there's some heavy overuse of tilesets. Remember how every area in a Souls game looks basically unique? Not so here. Quite a lot of identikit caves and castle halls. But then that's really just window dressing after all.","May 18","true","5.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

Full stop. Almost every single design decision is ripped completely from Dark Souls 1 and 2.\n\nThere are a few tweaks here and there: boss elemental/damage type weaknesses are emphasized so having a diverse weapon set is handy. Weapon balance is almost as out of whack as Demon Souls. And the lore goes a long way toward writing something that feels more properly fantasy, where the mystery is appopriately fantastical, dense, but has an actual answer, than Souls ever did with its goofy pastiche and dull "all is lost, all valor is pointless" world.\n\nA lot of you are already clicking the buy button, and that's fine. The game does not disappoint. The graphic design has some issues; the world got attacked by the Gears of War color stealing aliens so everything is murky and tough to read, but the core interconnected world, loads of bits to collect, stuff to upgrade, different weapon styles, enemies, bosses, exploration it's all Souls. I recommend it on that measure heartily.\n\nThe problem is, we already had this genre in 2D. It was called a metroidvania. The difference here is that the combat borrows more from Souls than anything else in 2D. You seldom really honestly "dodged" anything in a Souls game. You used the dodge ability constantly, of course, but nine times out of ten, you were using the iframes imparted by the dodge to get through the attacks. It's the same way here. Where Metroid or Castlevania will ask you to learn positioning and react to boss attacks, most attacks here are simply handled by dodging through. It dumbs down the combat considerably*, even though the author does his best to throw in "can't dodge must jump" attack patterns every now and again. But, this is the same guy who gave us the quite good Dishwasher games, which are far tougher and more interesting mechanically than any Souls game combat-wise. So to see a simpler product here is a disappointment.\n\nAll that aside, don't let me discourage you. Salt and Sanctuary is solid. Everything you loved about Dark Souls is here and it's certainly an enjoyable playthrough. But that we got a PC port of this before Dishwasher Vampire Smile feels like a crime.\n\nTo add a couple of more compliments and complaints I had no room for elsewhere: the game is absolutely full of secret nooks, paths, and rooms loaded with shortcuts to other zones and junk to find. There are not a lot of weapons, but there are certainly loads of spells, materials, and clothes to locate. Sadly, the inventory system is a mess, a massive pile of unsortable little icons arranged with no rhyme or reason except kinda in the order you picked them up. No hint on shop vendors as to what you have or how much when you go shopping. Fast travel is convenient and checkpoints and shortcuts are common enough to ensure no boss has a tedious boring long walk a la Dark Souls 1.\n\n*That's not to say that iframe dodging has no place in a side scroller. Shank, Dishwasher, Streets of Fury all make it work, but those are games whose primary focus is on combat depth and variety. Combos, swiftness, flow, etc. Castlevania and Souls don't focus on that aspect. Different subgenres\n\nEDIT: By the way this is a better RPG than Witcher 3.","May 17","true","13.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

S+S takes great care in that, with enemy telegraphs feeling more like what you'd see in a Castlevania. it tightens things up for a less fridgeperson-speed game.\n\napart from that, it's 2D Dark Souls, right down to the interface. if you don't like Dark Souls, maybe you'll like it in 2D more. if you do like Dark Souls, you'll enjoy rediscovering it in 2D, and maybe being slightly baffled at -just how far- they go to make their game feel just like it.","May 20","true","38.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

The Souls games have often been compared to 3D Castlevania, and this basically feels like it's looped all the way back to its sources. And it feels good.\nThe vertical nature of exploration in a 2D game adds a fresh spin to fans of the Souls series (and loads of deaths by falling), whereas those coming from traditional Metroidvanias will enjoy the challenge of a more in-depth combat system from what they might be used to.\n\nPros:\n+Good map design, lots to explore and plenty of area variety\n+Loads of area interconnectivity and secrets\n+Plenty of weapon variety including special hybrid weapons like Sword Whips and others; most playstyles are viable (yes, even cleric builds; looking at you, Dark Souls 3)\n+An excellent translation of Souls-like combat into 2D, very satisfying\n+Skill tree allows for flexible builds without pigeonholing you into certain loadouts (e.g. needing Strength for Greatshields in Souls games), weapons do not have stat requirements\n+Local Co-op\n+Asynchronous Multiplayer features suchs as gravestones and corpses of other players, and a robust message system\n+In-game Challenge system increases replay value for skilled players\n+Lots of lore sprinkled about, not in your face but it's there if you know where to look\n+Good price for the amount of game you get\n+You can parry with a gunshot!\n\nCons:\n-The complete lack of a map may be daunting for fans of traditional Metroidvanias\n-Fast travel is available a little too easily and early in my opinion, somewhat devaluing area interconnectivity at times\n-Weapon tiering feels a little arbitrary\n-Some platforming segments can get frustrating due to requiring precise jumps\n-Character art is... stylized. Very stylized. You might want to wear a mask or full helmet.\n-No inventory sorting options, items are sorted in order of pickup, no storage box\n-Local Co-op currently denies certain key items for player 2, not recommended to use a main character for Co-op\n-No direct online multiplayer","May 23","true","66.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I went into this game expecting an homage to dark souls and i got that and so much more. the combat system, the salt used for levelling up and upgrading equipment, the sparse story told through item descriptions and npc interactions...it's jsut so lovely and perfect. the many sanctuaries around the world that can be upgraded with various npcs that provide various services as well as area bonuses. like dark souls, salt and sanctuary has something like covenants (called creeds) that you can level up in and collect bonuses from. the skill tree is massive and reminds me of path of exile's humungous skill tree. regardless of your starting class, salt and sanctuary allows you to create a fully customizable character that can be proficient in anything. i really like the branding system. i've only found 2 'brands' so far, but one allows me to use certain obelisks to reverse gravity in certain areas and walk on the ceiling. the other allows me to jump off walls. i'm sure there are more out there and i'm curious to see how they help me progress through the world. the 2D platforming nature of salt and sanctuary combines with the branding system to allow for more vertical gameplay than dark souls could pull off. i also really like the way you can unlock shortcuts between the sanctuaries and that there are even little hidden checkpoints that act like sanctuaries and restore your health/potions while on the way to certain bosses. the 2D nature also gives a certain advantage to the bosses in that they only have to attack in one of 2 directions. it adds a certain level of challenge to not being able to dodge left or right, but only forward and back. the many different weapons have their own attack patterns that add some depth to the combat and the fact that you can transmute them into other, potentially more powerful weapons is pretty amazing.\nall in all, i can honestly say that i like this game as much as the souls games. if you like dark souls and platformers, don't wait-just get it. the only downside to this game is that there's no multiplayer. but there's local co-op, which is almost as good.","May 21","true","114.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It is a bit of a Metroidvania game but like Dark Souls it has no minimap and the difficulty is hard enough that you will die plenty.\n\nThe game's art style may seem iffy when starting the game; it's a bit sketchy and looks a little like a flash game, but make no mistake - the game itself is absolutely massive. It's easily the size of your typical Castlevania game and the slower paced gameplay makes it seem even larger. Considering the size and scope of the game which rivals Dark Souls series, it's a bargain even at the non-sale price.\n\nThe gameplay has about the same pacing as Dark Souls in its combat, and it also has the ability to block, and roll, amongst other things. However, a minor qualm is that sometimes enemy attacks aren't telegraphed that well in advance, making them hard to dodge in time. Besides that, though, it does one of the best approximations of Souls combat in 2D and features a ton of different types of builds.\n\nThe amount of platforming in the game is more significant than souls, which I suppose makes up for the fact that you can't really fall off ledges in a 2D game unless there is a lot of platforming. I think they went a little overboard with it, falls probably killed me more times than actual enemies, unless you count enemies hitting you off ledges as being "killed" by one.\n\nThe amount of lore in the game is quite nice and the game is more text heavy than your typical action indie game, with each inventory item having a ton of lore and even the level up screen having segments of legendary tomes. But, like Dark Souls, it doesn't interrupt the game unless you wish to read the lore. The lore itself, however, is quite solid.\n\nThis game is basically what that cheap Dark Souls ripoff Slashy Souls SHOULD have been. An amazing version of Souls in 2D that pretty much has everything a fan of dark action games should want.\n\nOverall the game is fun and the people who will get the most kick out of it are those who have played the Souls series and are looking for more similar gameplay. However, anyone looking for an extremely fun Metroidvania should also give it a try.","May 21","true","51.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Beautifully crafted, with massive world, ton of items and very entertaining gameplay. Basically, you get Dark Souls in 2D world, with almost exact same game mechanics, such as stamina-based combat, brutal difficulity and great scenarios. Also, platforming side of game is very nicely made, almost on level of old PSX Castelvania.

I went in not knowing what to expect, and found myself on a patchwork island, where each death, though knee-punchingly frustrating, was completely avoidable. I have two different characters, and what was nearly impossible for one is a cakewalk for the other, and vice-versa. I'm having a fantastic time with Salt & Sanctuary, but I do have two complaints: One, there needs to be a map. I understand that some people may disagree, and that's fine, but if there is an in-game map, you have the option to ignore it. You don't have the option to will one into existance if there isn't one, and options are always good. The second complaint is that the soundtrack is way too minimal. There are about 4 or 5 songs that I can recall, and two of them make up 90% of the game. Also, those songs are about four bars long. Those two things are just small complaints, though, and I really am enjoying this game. Looking forward to what Ska does in the future!

This can lead to finding some interesting weapons, only to find out they don't work very well. Most of the time, however, this isn't really a problem.\nThis game is a fantastic combination of some of my favorite genres.

I figured I'd give it a shot, as the graphics looked appealing to me. Overall I'd say this is a good game, with a rather good character progression system, and a great gear system.\nSome fights can be a bit irritating, as large enemies have a tendency to push you back a lot, and even block you off from certain areas. My main irritation so far has been the boss fights, as the ones I've done so far (6 or 7) have been kind of lackluster. They start out with a set of moves, and progressively as the fight goes on, they just become faster. I'd much rather have phases in the fight, rather than linear difficulty progression, and adding new moves when you reach said phase would make it a lot more interesting.\nThat being said, I can definitely recommend this game if you enjoy combat-heavy metroidvania games, and liking the Souls series doesn't hurt.","May 21","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Game is pretty much a Metroidvania 2D Souls game.  For people unfamiliar with Dark Souls or its brethren this game is challenging but never unfair.  For people expecting JUST a metroidvania game expect combat to be more costly than others.\n\nYou'll see a few people saying the combat feels "clunky" here and that's due to them not really understanding how it works and just want to button mash.  Each swing of your sword/whip/hammer/reaper/axe/spear will go through it's full animation before you can do anything else.  You can't just spam attack as it will leave you open for attacks.  Bosses are frustratingly awesome in that you NEED to learn their attack patterns and exploit them.  All in all it's a great game if you like games like these.

The human characters (yours and NPCs) look weirdly out of place but I guess there is some reason for that somewhere, seen as the rest of the models look okay.\n\nCombat rewards both the fast paced gameplay and the methodical and slow approach, though since the game has only two dimensions, it becomes trickier to move around in case you screw up. Generally you can perform some cool moves both on the ground and in the air, like a beat-em-up game so to speak, but you also have a Stamina meter.\n\nThing is that I felt like my "dodging" options were limited, but it promotes other ideas like parrying and blocking, which you'll need since enemies can go into attacking loops.\n\nSomething to concider would be the leveling system and how you can unlock certain perks on the Tree Skill that they have going on. Instead of a bland "+1 on stat", you get to unlock which weapons you can wield, which armour you can wear, etc etc. I'd argue that leveling up in this game feels more rewarding than Souls games due to your required control over your character's build.\n\nBut overall, it just comes down to whether you would be okay with a 2D Souls-like game or not. Personally, I was not, but I didn't think the game was bad.","May 18","true","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game however, tries so hard to be Dark Souls, that it forgets what makes the Souls games awesome, a FAIR challenge.\n\nIn this game, rolling is busted and hardly works, there's no stat to increase HP, the controls are clunky and fail to give the player the required fast and crisp input to complete the gimmicky bosses and over-used platforming sections. Not to mention that most of the deaths in this game come from either missing a jump, and dying, or getting hit off a ledge and dying that way. Thats not fun at all, there are hardly any fun 1v1 enemy encounters, it's constantly throwing multiple enemies at you that stunlock you, or send you flying, becuase if anything touches you, you GO ♥♥♥♥ING FLYING OFF THE SCREEN. Most enemies can 2 shot you, if there's 2 enemies on the screen, be sure as hell they will combo you around the screen like a ♥♥♥♥ing Super Smash game.\n\nThe main problem with this game is that there are too many arbitrary and artifical ways they make the game harder. "Here, fight this boss on a series of crumbling ledges that also periodically shoot fire at you" this is the definition of a gimmicky boss, sure it takes some skill, but the amount of trial and error required to get passed some of these poorly designed encounters, leaves the player feeling frustrated even after a win. Everytime i beat a boss in a DS game for the 1st time, i was so happy at what i had just accomplished, knowing i just completed a difficult, but fair fight (barring some cheesy ♥♥♥ bosses in DS2 of course). Another issue is that the game also reduces your total amount of HP everytime you are hit, another artifical way to increase the difficulty, even with the ring which helps reduce the amount of HP lost from taking those hits, its still completely unnecesary. It just feels like the devs made the game to make players feel bad, "hope you like fighting on ledges that 1 misstep and your dead while 5 enemies are constantly chasing you and archers are launching arrows at your face! isnt it great how hard our game is!?" Its like the game just laughs at you and doesn't respect the player like a Souls game, which always builds up the players skills, making every new area a fun new challenge that's teaching you the ropes at the same time as kicking your ♥♥♥.\n\nIn the end, i think if there was far less crushingly difficult platforming and less ledges/cliffs/holes in the ground, i would have maybe stuck it out (The controls certainly don't help). But im sick of trying my best in a given section, only to have a trash mob enemy hit me once, and throw me flying off a ledge to my death. The Souls-like mechanics are well done in some places, the way Salt(Souls) work, fat rolling, weapon/armour variation and  the tech tree is OK for what it is, the atmosphere is nice as well, but the game severly lacks the balance from a Souls game. That is to say, the balance of difficulty vs frustration, which is what keeps the player playing, that feeling of "Man, i got my ♥♥♥ kicked, but i totally made some mistakes, and i can do better", not "Hey this boss will 2 shot me no matter what happens unless I play perfectly for the next 5 mins" and "Why am i fighting 5 enemies on a bunch of narrow platforms, this is cheap and makes me feel bad!".\n\nIm a patient man, having just finished casually speedrunning DS3, beating Doom on Nightmare (which was hard as ♥♥♥♥, but so fun!), but this game will test the patience of any gamer i can think of. Be wary of this game, as it will crush your soul so hard, youll boot up a Kane and Lynch game while cutting yourself for reprieve.\n\n-Rebuff","May 22","false","10.0"," 71 of 138 people (51%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","51","71","138","15","18"

The bottom line is that this is a very addicting, 'hard' game that feels like Dark Souls and Castlevania had a metroidvania love child.\n\nHopefully without gushing too much..\nPros:\n-Rewarding gameplay that feels good once you get the hang of it\n-Tight controls, this game is all about timing and strategy, not button mashing.  There are combos, to a point, and when you execute one perfectly and the monster explodes into a blood stain, it's some of the best 2D combat ever.\n-The art direction in this game is perfect.  The island, the characters, the weapons.. everything comes together to deliver a beautifuly modern 2D experience that is cohesive, while still delivering varied locales on the island.\n-The story, it's there, and it's a good one, but it's very much not in your face and you can breeze right by it if you choose..  Don't.  Talk to everyone, seek out new areas and people, exhaust all conversation trees, and talk to the scarecrow. Always.\n-The sphere-grid skill tree and leveling system in this game is deep and when you combine that with New Game+ can produce some pretty interesting hybrid builds.\n-You will get frustrated, and you will get mad, and you will want to keep playing this game regardless.\n-Pumpkin Helm\n\nCons:\n-Not really a con because it's more just part of the genre, but can scare away someone used to having a game hold their hand (If this is you I'm describing, push forward and keep trying even after seeing "Obliterated" splash across your screen dozens of times..it happens.. and maybe switch to a strength build using 2h when you can.  2H hammers in this game are a license to make monsters explode. You can also grind up salt from monsters and level up at a santuary a bunch if a boss is just too much for you)\n-An in-game indication of soft cap breakpoints on skill-tree points/ more in depth weapon scaling info would be helpful, but thankfully there is an extremely good Salt and Sanctuary wiki with a lot of this information.  Same goes for boss weaknesses, although those are sometimes indicated on message bottles in-game.\n-A map of discovered areas would be nice at some point in the game.\n\n10/10 would kill God's with a giant warhammer again","June 5","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Standouts include the Hall of Red Cages, the Dome of the Forgotten, and some more areas I don't wanna spoil.\n* Cons\n-No map- A lack of some kind of map led to a very confusing layout that can often confuse the average player.\n- Some dickish bosses- while every boss was challenging, not all of them felt fair.\n\nOverall: 8/10.\nBuy it.","May 23","true","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The levelling system leaves the weapons and armor lockeg behing specific "tiers" and classes, which was particularly dissapointing as it encourages one to pick a type of weapon and stick to it.

I have only used one class, 4 weapons, no spells and I have not beaten it yet.\n\nShort version: Buy this game.\n\nMedium version: Buy this game if you like Metroidvanias and/or Dark Souls.\n\nFull Version: This game is too awesome. Yes, I mean "too" awesome, as I want to continue playing it even though I need to go to bed. I want to play it when I'm at work and I want to play it when I'm playing other games.\n\nI'm a big fan of Metroidvanias and I think I have a fairly high standard when it comes to them. Any old game with the basic elements won't do. The only games in the genre that really stand out for me are Super Metroid, Axiom Verge and Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. That's not to say I haven't enjoyed any others, but these are the ones that set the bar for me. Salt & Sanctuary is easily in the same league as the mentioned games and I will be recommending it to people for years to come, I am sure.\n\nSo you have probably heard that S&S is basically 2D Dark Souls. It has many of the elements; classes, branching upgrades, geography that gradually unlocks and loops back into itself, no map, stamina, parrying, etc.\nDon't be fooled into thinking it is purely a derivitive work though. Obviously S&S is inspired by Dark Souls, but it has enough elements to give it its own style and flavour.\n\nIf you haven't played Dark Souls then just know that this game is hard and requires patience. The combat feels responsive, but you cannot just go in blindly mashing. Even basic enemies can kill you quite easily if you let them surround you or get a full combo on you. You have to learn each enemies behaviour and then adapt. This makes the combat really satisfying; an enemy that you think is really hard eventually becomes easy (easier?) and there's always a fresh challenge as new enemies appear. There are loads of weapons, spells and items you can use to customise your character and different weapons have different move sets.\n\nI mentioned there is no map and at first I thought I was going to be in for a tough time as my sense of direction is terrible (even in games). So far it hasn't really been a problem for me and early into the game you gain the ability to fast travel if you find yourself lost, although I actually haven't used it yet. The way the world gradually opens up means you will likely be familiar with any given area before it starts to connect to other areas so confusion should be minimal. I have no idea the full size of the world, but the area I have explored so far feels bigger than the whole of Momodora 4 (great game regardless) and I expect there is still a significant chunk I haven't seen based on various impassable doors and things I have seen.\n\nAnyway, I could go on for ages, but there's no point. There are countless videos and essentially if anything I've said appeals to you, you should just buy the game right now. You won't regret it and if you do, there's always the refund option.","May 25","true","55.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

One grain of salt would not make a difference, but if everyone who enjoyed this game would leave a review it would matter a lot to them.\n\nI pirated the game to check it out and was hooked in the matter of minutes, so I bought the game right away.\n\nThe atmosphere comprising the setting, music, story, graphics and animations is brilliantly crafted. It’s tenebrous, gloomy and dark. The world is unwelcoming and unforgiving.\n\nThe equipment and combat system from Souls series suits this game really good. It’s hard to learn and even harder to master. It could be confusing and off-putting for some players who have zero experience with Souls series, but I just don’t see why would anyone be interested in this game not having played a Souls game.\n\nMoreover, the combat and movement is incredibly fluid and feels great, which is an essential point for a game of this kind.\n\nThe spectrum of enemies and bosses, weapons and armor (and their descriptions) is shockingly wide, the amount of recycling of the assets varies from zero to none. It’s a great achievement for a game of this scale and for a small independent team (in your face, Castlevania).\n\nThe boss fights are unique and remarkable.\n\nExploration is really rewarding and revisiting old locations with the new abilities does not feel tedious or boring at all.\n\nThinking back, I cannot actually come up with any critical issues with the game. Yes, the layout of the levels is confusing sometimes, the game does not teach you how to use brands, but those are hardly cons.\n\ntl;dr: Embrace yourselves and prepare to struggle, to git gud, be wary of devious traps and dangerous abominations lurking deep beneath the island.

Yes it's true, it looks like a 2D Dark Souls and is very similar in a lot of aspects.\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful graphics and atmosphere (character face is meh, wear a helmet and its ok.)\n+ Tons of enemies. Some may look similar texture wise, but they will most likely have different abilities.\n+ Tons of weapons. There are weapon tiers (1-5) which determines how bad or good a weapon is. HOWEVER, most weapons are viable. In fact, one of the best weapons is a tier 2.\n+ LOTS of movesets based on weapon type and the weapon itself.\n+ Good timed "checkpoints". If you die you probably won't have to walk for 3 hours back to the same spot, provided you unlock a shortcut (if you explore a bit).\n+ Puzzles, laberynths and parkour.\n+ Game rewards patience and skill, although you can facestomp for a while if you want.\n+ Optional areas and bosses with their unique rewards for the completionists out there.\n+ Good replayability potential. While you will get tier 5 at the end of 1st playthrough, you won't be even near to be at maximum upgrade, unlock all spells, weapons etc.\n+ Best boss soundtrack I've heard in a while.\n+ Decent lore, but the main plot isn't really explained until the very end. You need to explore and talk with NPCs.\n+ You are supposed to die in the tutorial.\n+ 1st blind playthough lenght: 22-25 hours. Worth spending a few more in NG+.\n+ NG+! NOTE: You are forced into it when you beat final boss. There are no "new items" or enemies in NG+, just more salt and difficult enemies.\n+ No performance issues. (Nvidia 710M 60fps 1366x768). Your laptop may be using integrated graphics card by default.\n+ Almost no hard grinding, even base 5% drops can happen with patience. Item drop also increases with a stat.\n+ Achievements are not hard, but some of them require spending some time into them.\n\nCons:\n- No sorting system, not even automatic nor manual. Items are sorted as you find them, not tier or type based. And sometimes they get misplaced.\n- Game misses a lot of information. You don't know what type of damage do some weapons do. Some are clear, but not others. This is "bad" because some enemies can be almost invulnerable to slash damage (swords, reapers?) but take full damage from strike damage (hammers, some axes?). Same thing for magic, although it is pretty clear if you are dying to a fireball or a lightning.\n- You can't respec all perks. You can respec a few ones but that's it, you won't switch from the best swordman to the best mage with any item (soul vessel in DS2). Eventually you will become able to do a bit of everything while having a main class.\n- The creed system is good overall, but has some flaws: Some items are creed limited because they focus on a class type (warrior creed, mage creed, etc) and because you can't "freely" change creeds, its a bit annoying to get certain basic items.\n- Some weird stunlock. While being between 2 enemies can probably get you killed, there is no reason to get knocked over and over again by low tier enemies while you can do nothing.\n- Some items are only obtainable MAYBE ONCE per playthrough and no enemies drop them. Other are also this limited, but some enemies have a 5-10% chance to drop them.\nNOTE: On the plus side, you can transmute weapons: Literally switch from a weapon to other of the same category, keeping almost all the upgrades.\n- While almost all weapons and builds are viable, only a few guarantees that you dont get stomped vs some bosses over and over again unless you get lucky with their attacks.\n- Slow roll is too punishing, you rather have a ♥♥♥♥ weightless weapon with fast roll than the best one with slow roll. Still, heavy armor is best armor unless you are a mage.\n\nTL;DR: Yes, its a 2D Souls game. It's a new game, has its flaws, but will most likely get fixed or even improved. Incoming mod support has been heard. Definitely worth buying if on sale.","May 23","true","45.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/recommended/283640/","girlkillscomputer","Girl Kills Computer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/","158 products in account","Salt and Sanctuary is an action-rpg platformer that owes a great deal to Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Dust, the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, Phantasy Star Online 2, and Final Fantasy 10.  S&S, like certain characters in its story, is envious.  It grasps, it clutches, it steals whatever it can get its hands on, trying desperately to become the one thing it can never be.  But I found as the initial impressions ("Jesus Christ this is exactly Dark Souls wow they're not even trying to hide it") wore off, I was surprised at just how much the game actually stands on its own.\n\nThe surface mechanics of S&S are stolen from a few key sources.  From Dark Souls, it takes covenants, the style of item usage, much of its UI, stamina-dependent combat with parrying, heavy hits and stunlocking, as well as many of its general area concepts.  It even goes so far as to crib smaller details, such as letting the player wear 4 rings and giving many enemies tracking attacks, ala Dark Souls 2, right alongside the larger ones, such as needing to retrieve your souls, er, salt, from where you died.  From Bloodborne, we have certain mechanics revolving around offhand weapons, boss enrages below certain health thresholds, enemies themselves taking your salt rather than it simply dropping somewhere (unless you die from a fall), and quite a few enemy designs.  From Dust and SoTN, it takes much of its platforming and some later area designs.  From FF10, it takes the sphere grid.  From PSO2, it takes its style of equipping and utilizing spells and incantations.  And if all you saw were screenshots, or if you only heard about the game without playing it through, you might be forgiven for thinking it's a total rip-off in every way.\n\nWhat I found as I played through it to completion, however, was that S&S is more than the sum of its black market body parts.  To start at the surface: It does several things differently on a mechanical level from Dark Souls.  Magic in particular, I found very interesting.  Though you start with a ring equipped (if you start as a mage) that nullifies this effect, you have to be mindful of elemental imbalance that accrues and eventually hurts you if you cast too many of the same element's spells in a row.  I also like how your secondary resource, Focus, caps your maximum stamina as you burn through it, forcing you to choose carefully when to use magic, and presenting some interesting challenges for hybrid builds.  Magic feels satisfying and fun to use, growing more and more powerful as you progress until you can rely on it for every encounter with the right "pure mage" build, without feeling so crazy overpowered that it removes all challenge, like sorcery can be in Dark Souls 1.\n\nI also appreciated the balance the game strikes between Dark Souls' surfeit of similar weapons, and Bloodborne's dearth of wildly different ones.  Most of the weapons I ended up using, I got not from the world or from NPC vendors, but via alchemy, a system similar to boss soul weapon smithing from Dark Souls, but with components that can come from a variety of non-boss enemies as well.  As it turns out, there are a ton of different weapons you can only get this way, and a lot of them are cool as hell.\n\nWhere S&S felt a bit less balanced, to me, was in its armor selection, which felt skewed more towards "fashion souls" in the light armor category, leaving a heavy armor character with often-unusably-heavy armors that didn't differ very much from each other, visually, except in color.  This is partly due to sprite design and character proportions not giving you a good view of what you're wearing, but where are all the fashionable heavy helms, for instance?  And you need an insane amount of Endurance to wear anything with half-decent damage mitigation.\n\nDark Souls is known for telling its story obliquely, through item descriptions and such.  Salt and Sanctuary, however, I found to have a pretty straightforward story, told mostly through NPC dialogue.  There's a ton of flavor text in item descriptions and on the sphere grid, sorry, Tree of Skill.  But I found most of it to be just kinda... there.  It doesn't seem to point to any kind of coherent central narrative, but rather serves to flesh out the multitude of nations and stories that seem to exist (or that we're meant to think exist... somehow, I doubt much has been written beyond these short blurbs) in the "S&S universe".  But to be honest, maybe I'm over-exposed to this sort of thing by now, but nothing really stood out to me in the writing of this stuff.  I found it all pretty bland and easily skipped over.  That said, the main story that S&S tells is actually a pretty interesting one, if a bit simple in the end.  It has a compelling hook, some interesting windings (I can't really call them twists per se), and a satisfying conclusion with a choice of endings.  In any case, the main draw here is the gameplay, which is excellent.\n\nI appreciate the separation of gold and salt into two different currencies, while keeping salt the primary resource for character improvement via blacksmithing, alchemy, and leveling up.  This means gold becomes more of your "noob support" currency, letting the player spend it freely on usable items and some early-game special armors and weapons, letting you get a bit of a leg up at first and recover more easily from large salt losses.  Gold, though, doesn't seem to have too many uses in the late game.  Mostly, it just goes down the toilet when you die, thousands at a time.  I started just buying 99 bags of salt at a time near the end, and sitting there mashing RB for a relatively quick 9900 salt, just to get the gold spent somehow.  But that's tedious as hell, so I stopped doing it and just let it waste away to pay the cleric who revives you.  My theory is that Patches is from this universe, and this is why he hates clerics so much.\n\nI really like how your levelups are separated from your skill tree, how the skill tree is laid out, and how the presence of a limited-use item to respec a single skill point gives you some choices to make when building your character.  What's not immediately apparent is that you can put more than one point into the stat-boosting spheres on the tree.  Though, this isn't terribly useful on NG, I found.  It's better to rush to the sphere corresponding to the tiers of equipment you want to use.  And since I finished the game at level 81 my first time through, using a tier 4 greatsword and some tier 4 heavy armor pieces, I didn't really have enough skill points to start stacking stat-ups.\n\nWhile the visual design takes a lot of its cues from other games as far as general concepts go, I found the atmosphere of S&S to be well within bounds of being its own thing.  World feel and atmosphere are done very well in this game.  It especially starts ramping up towards the second half, once you're into and beyond the Castle of Storms.  There's some really cool stuff there!\n\nMovement and combat feels good.  I especially enjoyed some of the brands you get that change your movement around in unexpected ways for a game that feels like this.  Those little dashes of SoTN were a great and welcome addition.  The first brand you get, though, is particularly cool.  I'm not even going to say what it is, just cause I don't wanna be the one to spoil it for you if somehow you don't know.  And it influences level design in later areas in some really clever ways.\n\nAll in all, Salt and Sanctuary is very much worth your time.  It's an extremely enjoyable and high quality game.  My first playthrough took me about 18 hours, and I know I missed a ton of stuff, especially in the last third when I was just kinda blowing through it not exploring too much due to the difficulty of a lot of the enemies.  I'm very much looking forward to finishing my mage playthrough, and I already have a Bloodborne beast hunter and a thief waiting in the wings.

I'm a huge fan of Ska Studios and i have to say that this is one of their best games yet. If you enjoy the Souls series or enjoy the Metroidvania genre the i would highly suggest you check this game out. The combat for the game is very fluid yet, it has the "slower" combat of souls games. All the weapons i have  used have very enjoyable move sets and the weapons feel like they have weight behind them. All and all i would say this game is a soild metroidvania with quite a bit of challege.","May 20","true","31.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Online summoning and invasions are not available, but Salt and Sanctuary is diverse enough that it doesn't need these elements to still be just as enjoyable as any Souls game.

It's got some Castlevania in there too, but the Souls influence is far stronger on the game. For the most part Salt and Sanctuary gets the Souls style into 2D really well.\n\nPros:\n1. The 2D style combat works surprisingly pretty well with the stamina system, and you can do knock up attacks and air combos, so long as you mind your stamina.\n2. Most of the areas are well designed and there's plenty of optional levels and bosses.\n3. Each boss has a unique look that fits with the level it's found in.\n4. Good character customization.\n5. The music is very well done.\n6. There are plenty of character classes to get you started with your preferred style of play.\n7. There's shortcuts aplenty.\n\nCons:\n1. Platforming can be incredibly unpleasant, and there's a ton of platforming in the game and it seems to work only the game feels like it. Sometimes your character simply won't grab a damn ledge or you can't see far enough to know if you can make a jump or not. A lot of deaths were due to poorly done platforming sections.\n2. The game is ridiculously dark. While that sets a good atmosphere, it can make it difficult to tell where ledges are and interferes with predicting boss attacks.\n3. Dodging can be unreliable at times.\n4. Some bosses are seething with artificial difficulty. One example is a boss fight where you have to destroy an axe being wielded by two ghosts, who can't be damaged and one of them will shoot lasers at you while the other uses the axe. After I got destroyed three or four times the game glitched and one of the ghosts went away, making the fight trivial. When the game can't make a fight good, it just inflates the difficulty by giving a boss unblockable moves or adding more ♥♥♥♥ into the fight to make up for the game's shortcomings.\n5. Bosses don't have unique music for their fights, save for maybe one or two.\n6. The wounding mechanic. Every time you take damage you lose points from your maximum health bar. It's annoying as ♥♥♥♥ and only serves to further add artificial difficutly to the game. It's only there because Demon's Soul and Dark Souls II did something similar. This mechanic also applies to your stamina bar, and since magic uses stamina, that bar drops like a sack of bricks if you use magic.\n\n\nOverall, Salt and Sanctuary is a really good game, albeit a flawed one. If you're into the Souls franchise, definitely pick it up. If not, stay far away. This is not a beat-em up adventure and you will not have fun","May 26","true","37.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At first I thought it was just a Dark Souls 2D, but I did not realize that 2D and 3D are two completely differet things.\n\nIt's already been explained by several reviews - Salt and Sanctuary is a good mix of Dark Souls and Metrovania games.\n\nRegarding Atmosphere and Art Style, Salt and Sanctuary is much more gloomy than Dark Souls. But it seems to lack the sense of slowly approaching dread, perhaps due to its art style; but I don't really mind.\n\nThe gameplay is very fluid and polished. It's very obvious that much work was put into this work. I've only gone so far as the Sodden Knight and some more, but I am yet to meet any unfair challenges.\n\nThe levelling system is quite needlessly complex, however. It's not too difficult to understand, but I believe that it could just have been replaced with a simple level-up system.

Regardless, Salt & Sanctuary is a beautifully visual and ambitious game that does indeed take a lot of its inspirations from the Dark Souls games.\n\nHaving recently gotten into the Souls games myself, the controls do take a bit of getting used to. But once that's squared away, it's easy to see just how well the Souls influence affects S&S in just the right way. A prime example is dying and losing your salt, thinking "Alright, I'm just going to rush there, get my salt back, and get back to my sanctuary", and then getting skwered by spawning bandits and attack dogs (I'm not bitter at my stupidity, I swear).\nThe visual asthetic is a little muddy when things get close and I sometimes miss bottles and salt on the ground, and I wish there was an easier eye-catching jump between picking up an item and seeing what it is off to the side, but that's a personal gripe and as with the controls one gets used to it over time and it becomes easier to see. The addition of a skill tree helps easily visualize what build one wishes to go for.\nThe sound and ambiance is quiet and foreboding. A trademark of Ska Studios alongside the visceral juiciness of blood and blades, the music and tone is well-played throughout the game (so far, in my case) and the boss music is appropriately tense and reactive to the situation in comparison. Executing an enemy has a satisfying SQUELCH and even opening bottles sounds weirdly gratifying.\nStorywise, there isn't much. There's text in the beginning to give some opening composition, but it's brief and gets the subtly gets the point across that the story may not matter all that much.\n\n\nThe game is deep, beautiful, and lavished with evidence that this was made by Dark Souls fans, for Dark Souls fans. With Ska Studios's signature elements and talent, this is the best of both worlds and highly recommended. Even if I am a biased fan.","May 19","true","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Calling it Dark Souls in 2D is a fairly simple summation, so I'll also add that it plays very much like a really hard Castlevania game.  If you haven't played Dark Souls, do yourself a favor and check it out, but definitely get this game anyway.  The game also doesn't suffer from some of what people get frustrated with in Dark Souls, such as hit detection, random enemy behavior, accidentally striking walls, and poor jumping.\n\nFurthermore, with the salt and gold system, you don't feel like you're losing terribly much progress when you die as there are a fair amount of things you can buy with gold instead of salt.  Also interesting is the idea of making offerings to get different shopkeepers, blacksmiths, and so on to come to individual sanctuaries as well as making different sanctuaries stronger.

Controls are very smooth.  Combat-  every move feels important.   Your abilities will slowly degrade between sanctuaries.  That sound terrible, but it keeps you from living out of your backpack for the whole story.   For example,  your health bar's max capacity can be reduced by a grevious wound and your magic bar use degrades your stamina cap.   The main purpose is to break the campaign into smaller excursions.   The net effect is that you spend time thinking and caring about the area you are in.

Most of them end up undershooting and everything is extremely easy and boring, or they overshoot and the game becames impossible and frustrating.\n\nSalt & Sanctuary, however is the perfect execution of the difficulty formula. A truly difficult game shouldn't keep you downtrodden and hopeless. Salt & Sanctuary doesn't do that. It is merciless, beyond belief but even as it repeatedly kills you it makes a solemn promise to you: Observe your enemies, practice and play defensively and you will master me. It's not an easy road, but for me it's one worth taking.\n\nEverything else about the game is equally superb. From the eerily quiet and ambient soundtrack to the masterful artwork that went into this game. Controls are executing flawlessly and game play is addictive, extremely difficult but also extremely rewarding when you start realizing how the game was actually meant to be played.\n\nBeing entirely honest, this game may just possibly be my favorite Metroidvania game, and this includes Symphony of the Night which I've beat at least 10 times.","May 24","true","19.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yeah, the art is, uh, creatively stylized, and there's not much music, but It's Castlevania Souls. Seriously it's Castlevania Souls, with all the good that could possibly imply. Do you like SOTN? Do you like Dark Souls? Do you like Terraria?\n\nWait, what? Don't worry, there's no building or procedural generation in this game, but it's the first game to really out-do Terraria in terms of providing a solid 2D action experience with a customizable playstyle and appearance. It's also the first metroidvania game to offer those things. And it's seriously atmospheric and overall just a lot of fun.\n\nThe game obviously draws a ton of inspiration from Dark Souls, but if you're a casual gamer or just bad at games, don't let that scare you away; while Salt & Sanctuary is challenging, it's much more forgiving than those titles.\n\nUseful information: it has same-screen co-op and PvP!

Regardless, Salt & Sanctuary is a beautifully visual and ambitious game that does indeed take a lot of its inspirations from the Dark Souls games.\n\nHaving recently gotten into the Souls games myself, the controls do take a bit of getting used to. But once that's squared away, it's easy to see just how well the Souls influence affects S&S in just the right way. A prime example is dying and losing your salt, thinking "Alright, I'm just going to rush there, get my salt back, and get back to my sanctuary", and then getting skwered by spawning bandits and attack dogs (I'm not bitter at my stupidity, I swear).\nThe visual asthetic is a little muddy when things get close and I sometimes miss bottles and salt on the ground, and I wish there was an easier eye-catching jump between picking up an item and seeing what it is off to the side, but that's a personal gripe and as with the controls one gets used to it over time and it becomes easier to see. The addition of a skill tree helps easily visualize what build one wishes to go for.\nThe sound and ambiance is quiet and foreboding. A trademark of Ska Studios alongside the visceral juiciness of blood and blades, the music and tone is well-played throughout the game (so far, in my case) and the boss music is appropriately tense and reactive to the situation in comparison. Executing an enemy has a satisfying SQUELCH and even opening bottles sounds weirdly gratifying.\nStorywise, there isn't much. There's text in the beginning to give some opening composition, but it's brief and gets the subtly gets the point across that the story may not matter all that much.\n\n\nThe game is deep, beautiful, and lavished with evidence that this was made by Dark Souls fans, for Dark Souls fans. With Ska Studios's signature elements and talent, this is the best of both worlds and highly recommended. Even if I am a biased fan.","May 19","true","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Calling it Dark Souls in 2D is a fairly simple summation, so I'll also add that it plays very much like a really hard Castlevania game.  If you haven't played Dark Souls, do yourself a favor and check it out, but definitely get this game anyway.  The game also doesn't suffer from some of what people get frustrated with in Dark Souls, such as hit detection, random enemy behavior, accidentally striking walls, and poor jumping.\n\nFurthermore, with the salt and gold system, you don't feel like you're losing terribly much progress when you die as there are a fair amount of things you can buy with gold instead of salt.  Also interesting is the idea of making offerings to get different shopkeepers, blacksmiths, and so on to come to individual sanctuaries as well as making different sanctuaries stronger.

It's got some Castlevania in there too, but the Souls influence is far stronger on the game. For the most part Salt and Sanctuary gets the Souls style into 2D really well.\n\nPros:\n1. The 2D style combat works surprisingly pretty well with the stamina system, and you can do knock up attacks and air combos, so long as you mind your stamina.\n2. Most of the areas are well designed and there's plenty of optional levels and bosses.\n3. Each boss has a unique look that fits with the level it's found in.\n4. Good character customization.\n5. The music is very well done.\n6. There are plenty of character classes to get you started with your preferred style of play.\n7. There's shortcuts aplenty.\n\nCons:\n1. Platforming can be incredibly unpleasant, and there's a ton of platforming in the game and it seems to work only the game feels like it. Sometimes your character simply won't grab a damn ledge or you can't see far enough to know if you can make a jump or not. A lot of deaths were due to poorly done platforming sections.\n2. The game is ridiculously dark. While that sets a good atmosphere, it can make it difficult to tell where ledges are and interferes with predicting boss attacks.\n3. Dodging can be unreliable at times.\n4. Some bosses are seething with artificial difficulty. One example is a boss fight where you have to destroy an axe being wielded by two ghosts, who can't be damaged and one of them will shoot lasers at you while the other uses the axe. After I got destroyed three or four times the game glitched and one of the ghosts went away, making the fight trivial. When the game can't make a fight good, it just inflates the difficulty by giving a boss unblockable moves or adding more ♥♥♥♥ into the fight to make up for the game's shortcomings.\n5. Bosses don't have unique music for their fights, save for maybe one or two.\n6. The wounding mechanic. Every time you take damage you lose points from your maximum health bar. It's annoying as ♥♥♥♥ and only serves to further add artificial difficutly to the game. It's only there because Demon's Soul and Dark Souls II did something similar. This mechanic also applies to your stamina bar, and since magic uses stamina, that bar drops like a sack of bricks if you use magic.\n\n\nOverall, Salt and Sanctuary is a really good game, albeit a flawed one. If you're into the Souls franchise, definitely pick it up. If not, stay far away. This is not a beat-em up adventure and you will not have fun","May 26","true","37.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I never played Dark Souls, so I can't say how much the mimic each other, but it's a great game nonetheless.\n\nThe only downside is that I had to play the first hour with my keyboard since my xbox controller ran out of batteries, and the controls are BAD. Seriously, if you don't own a xbox controller or something like that, you are going to have a headache trying to figure some stuff up.\n\nThe art is kind of a downside too, but it growns on you after a while.\n\nGreat game overall, just wish they had put a little more effort into the keyboard controls.","May 24","true","23.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's got some Castlevania in there too, but the Souls influence is far stronger on the game. For the most part Salt and Sanctuary gets the Souls style into 2D really well.\n\nPros:\n1. The 2D style combat works surprisingly pretty well with the stamina system, and you can do knock up attacks and air combos, so long as you mind your stamina.\n2. Most of the areas are well designed and there's plenty of optional levels and bosses.\n3. Each boss has a unique look that fits with the level it's found in.\n4. Good character customization.\n5. The music is very well done.\n6. There are plenty of character classes to get you started with your preferred style of play.\n7. There's shortcuts aplenty.\n\nCons:\n1. Platforming can be incredibly unpleasant, and there's a ton of platforming in the game and it seems to work only the game feels like it. Sometimes your character simply won't grab a damn ledge or you can't see far enough to know if you can make a jump or not. A lot of deaths were due to poorly done platforming sections.\n2. The game is ridiculously dark. While that sets a good atmosphere, it can make it difficult to tell where ledges are and interferes with predicting boss attacks.\n3. Dodging can be unreliable at times.\n4. Some bosses are seething with artificial difficulty. One example is a boss fight where you have to destroy an axe being wielded by two ghosts, who can't be damaged and one of them will shoot lasers at you while the other uses the axe. After I got destroyed three or four times the game glitched and one of the ghosts went away, making the fight trivial. When the game can't make a fight good, it just inflates the difficulty by giving a boss unblockable moves or adding more ♥♥♥♥ into the fight to make up for the game's shortcomings.\n5. Bosses don't have unique music for their fights, save for maybe one or two.\n6. The wounding mechanic. Every time you take damage you lose points from your maximum health bar. It's annoying as ♥♥♥♥ and only serves to further add artificial difficutly to the game. It's only there because Demon's Soul and Dark Souls II did something similar. This mechanic also applies to your stamina bar, and since magic uses stamina, that bar drops like a sack of bricks if you use magic.\n\n\nOverall, Salt and Sanctuary is a really good game, albeit a flawed one. If you're into the Souls franchise, definitely pick it up. If not, stay far away. This is not a beat-em up adventure and you will not have fun","May 26","true","37.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For some, this might be a reason to call the game's design bland and pretentious, but isn't it better to play something you wanted to and be happy in all aspects than having a completely innovative experience with faults, bugs and design flaws all over a product?\nThe gameplay is extremely smooth, so far (after 8 hours of playtime on release day) the levels offer alot of variety, the difficulty is unforgiving and the item amount and skill tree as complex as it could be.\n\nI love the game and have no doubt that players who are looking for exactly these type of games will too.\n\n1 point minus for the lack of online multiplayer and 1 minus for the slightly intransparent inventory system, but still this sums to a very good 8/10.\n\nI will keep this review updated as I advance more into the game.","May 18","true","16.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Set aside.\nPrepare the pans: Rub the bottoms and sides of the cake pans with a little butter, shortening, or baking spray. Make sure to get into the corners and all the way up the sides. Flour the sides and bottoms of the pan by scooping a bit of flour into the pan, then shaking and tapping to coat the bottom and sides of the pan with flour; dump out the excess. Alternatively, cut out a parchment round and use this to line the bottom.\nBeat the butter and sugar until fluffy and light. Cream together for about 3 to 5 minutes on medium spread (see above notes for more information).\nAdd the eggs one at a time. Beat until the batter is very smooth and creamy-looking. Adding the eggs one at a time gives them a better chance at incorporating into a smooth batter. Be sure they are room temperature so the batter does not appear curdled.\nBeat in half the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the sifted dry ingredients with the mixer running at low speed. Continue to mix until incorporated.\nBeat in the milk and vanilla. Alternate adding in the liquids with the dry ingredients so the milk has a chance to be absorbed without needing to overmix the batter. Stream in the milk with the mixer on low until combined.\nBeat in the remaining flour mixture until just combined and no more visible flour remains. Stir a few times with a spatula to make sure no more flour remains on the bottom of the bowl.\nDivide the batter between cake pans. Use a scale or mechanical ice cream scoop to evenly divide the batter. Smooth the tops with an offset spatula. Drop the pans against the counter to shake out air bubbles.\nBake for 25 to 30 minutes: When done, the cake should be puffed like a pillow, golden, and pull away from the sides of the pan. When done, a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes should come out clean.\nCool for 15 minutes in the pan. Run an offset spatula around the cake to make sure it's completely loosened from the sides of the pan.\nFlip the rounds out of the pan, remove the parchment lining, and flip right-side up to cool completely.\nOnce cool, frost and assemble the cake with the buttercream.","May 25","true","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

With only 2 people, they have crafted a game with far greater depth than many AAA teams have ever hoped to achieve. The game is not perfect, and at launch of the PS4 ver. there were many bugs that found their way into release day - but, here's the thing: this guys give a s***.\n\nThere have been 2 huge patches on PS4, which fixed a ridiculous amount of bugs, and even added brand new features. Anyhow, I'll try to keep this a spoiler free review.\n\nWhat the game has:\n1. Replay Value - Multiple endings, NG+, tons of potential playstyles.\n2. Combat - Amazing 2D sidescroller combat, think Dark Souls meets Castlevania.\n3. Exploration - While not as interconnected as Dark Souls 1 due to the nature of 2D sidescrolling, the game still feels connected, many areas have multiple ways in and out (if you look) for them, items are waiting for you all over the place. In fact, what this game has up on Dark Souls, is it's verticality and platforming. It feels so great in a game like this.\n4. Lore - It is just as vague as it's inspiration, but not an ounce (or ML for the rest of the world) short of mystery and intrigue. As with souls games, read as much as you can.\n5. Story-based skills - There are skills you obtain, called Brands, as you progress the story. I won't spoil what they do, but they add significantly new ways to play the game.\n6. "Craftable" weapons - If you've played Dark Souls, you know what I mean.\n7. Unique NPC system - There are NPCs found in the world, including 'quests' with a few in particular. Others are simply your typical merchants. However, there are others that you are able to bring to your 'bonfire' as you see fit to provide you services. You must use a consumable to do so, but it is a great feature. These NPCs also include one in particular called, "Leader" which allows you to level up your 'covenant.' O ye there is covenants.\n8. Covenents - See #7\n\nWhat the game does not have\n1. Online Multiplayer - It's unfortunate, but there is no way to play online with other users (at the time of this writing). There is a message system and local coop only.\n2. No Online MP is literally my only complaint.\n\nThe Steam ver. runs as expected. I have no performance issues with the game or anything like that.","May 18","true","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Then you'll like Salt and Sanctuary.\n\nThe game is basically Dark Souls in 2D. I know a lot of games are compared to Dark Souls without reasons nowadays but this one takes a lot (by that I mean A LOT!) of ideas from DS (which isn't a bad thing since souls games are very good games).\n\nPros:\n- Gorgeous atmosphere and artstyle\n- Nice music\n- Rewards exploration\n- Huge skill tree like in Path of Exile\n- You can build your character as you like. Starting with a mage doesn't mean you'll never wear heavy armors nor shoot any crossbow.\n- Works really well with kb/m\n- The game is challenging and forces you to take care of your suroundings (lots of traps, which you can use at your advantage!, damn slimes that hides into the trees to fall on you,...)\n- Quite open with some variations in the level (like the forest where you have to carefully jump from tree to tree to avoid falling to your death)\n\nThe gameplay is very satisfying too. You have one normal attack, one heavy attack + a falling attack when you use heavy attack while jumping. You can switch between two loadouts (I'm a mage so I have my weapon + my magic wand on one, and a shield instead of the wand on the other), you can roll, block and jump.\n\nCons (I didn't find real issues for the moment so all of these are nitpicky):\n- The mouse cursor isn't locked to the game window (I use DualMonitorTools to fix that)\n- By default, aiming is super weird (I think it is a bug?) when you play with kb and mouse. It's fine once you enable the mouse cursor in the game options (then you aim with the mouse)\n- Some popups here and there on mouse over would be great (on the icons at the bottom left of the screen, on items you chose when you create your character and when you complete a "work" for a leader,...)\n- Some bosses come where/when you don't expect a boss, it's great for the element of suprise but it makes you lose all your salt (basically xp)\n\nAll in all, I really like it so far.

I get that same cautious, adventurous feeling while advancing through a level in this game as I did in a first playthrough of a souls game. The combat mechanics are familiar and satisfying, and there's plenty of diversity in weapons/playstyle. The skill tree is pretty large, and although it's not that special, it will allow you to continue gaining useful stats even through new game plus.\n\nSalt and Sanctuary is more than a comparison to Dark Souls. It expands on some mechanics and brings a few of its own to the table. For example, there are two types of currency, salt and gold. Salt is mainly used for leveling, but gold can be used to buy things from merchants. A percentage of your gold is also consumed upon death in order to revive you, and as for your salt, it will behave in one of two ways. If you die to any sort of npc (as far as i know) they will take your salt and you will have to kill them to retrieve it. On the other hand, if you do not die to an npc, but to some other means such as a plummet to your death, a unique creature will materialize from your salt and you will have to kill it instead.\n\nThe level design is excellent. Shortcuts and sanctuaries (checkpoints) are well placed and designed in a way that doesn't feel redundant. In some games I'll find myself never once using a shortcut or completely disregarding it (looking at you Dark Souls 2 and your stupid tree bridge in Huntsman's Copse), but in this game I've had a use for every shortcut thusfar. The art and atmosphere are beautifully done as well. I've found myself disgusted by many of the creatures and bosses (The Queen of Smiles is extra creepy), but also awed by some of the scenery. There was a particularly cool area that I nearly missed. After decending a long ladder in the dark I heard the quiet drip of water and the singing of crickets at night, then I stumbled across a woman standing in front of a large, reaching tree. There was mist everywhere and she was telling me about how I'm a dying fragment of eternity, and I just didn't expect that surreal moment in the midst of all the fighting.\n\nOverall I think this game is great and whether you're a fan of the souls series or not you should try Salt and Sanctuary out. 8.5/10","May 18","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The chef class is a literal meme in its entirety.\n\nWeapons.. Now weapons my boy... I succeeded quite well with a tier 0 spear for quite awhile just solely on the factor that its strongattack shred through literal everything. The skill tree and the weapons have a great vareity and are really fun to use.\n\nSpell casting is meh, it felt like dark souls all over again\n\nOverall, I give it a 8/10 check it out!","May 18","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Looking forward to play more. Great game. Challenging beat 'em up platformer RPG.\n\n\nAn excellent 2D game inspired by the Souls and Castlevania series as many mentioned already.\n\nMelee is fun and viceral, magic melts faces and is satisfying once you get used to the aiming system, and I didn't try archery yet so I can't say anything about it.\n\nAs the game progresses, some abilities are unlocked that are used to access areas which weren't accessible beforehand.\n\nDodging isn't as bad as some people say, it is just different than what we're used to from Souls game, especially about timing and "pushing then dodge" mechanic.\n\nMusic has a lot of electric guitar in it, so this can be a plus if you like that.\nAtmosphere is gloomy which fits game's theme well.\n\nDifficulty is overall well balanced in my opinion, as challenge seemed to steadily increase with gameplay experience, making areas and bosses feel evenly difficult (actual difficulty vs perception of it).\n\nWeapon ranges can be visually tricky at times since they hit farther than the tip of the weapon. Range is actually determined by the "slash" visual effect rather than weapon's length itself. Just need to gauge distance accordingly.\n\nNo voice acting. That would have been a nice additional touch, but considering Ska Studios' size, it is understandable.  In the other hand, might as well have none at all than having laughable voice acting some triple-A developpers dare to feed us with.\nPrice tag is very reasonable for the game's high quality.\n\nOverall, a nice game that is worth buying.

You might say: "They should be ashamed for trying to cash in on the success of Dark Souls." I wholehearthedly disagree with that. While the concepts ARE simmiliar, there is also a lot of inovative things, some of which I've missed in the Dark Souls series.\n\nLet's start off by explaining the battle system. You have a fast and strong attack, a block and a roll. This means you can either rely on heavy armor and blocking or light clothes and dodging. Your weight affects your speed and the usefulness of the dodge move, so most of this works the same as Dark Souls. However, the two dimensions provide a much thougher challenge, it's harder to get breathing room and you can get caught and slaughtered much faster. I must also say that the adition of two weapon sets was a great idea. You can change between them even during battle and this can be very useful and prevents you from being restricted by a certain fighting type.\n\nThis brings us to the variation of the enemies. The vary in both how they look and how they attack and some are stronger than others. While you won't have much trouble slaughtering the first couple of zombies, you will soon encounter much thougher and meaner enemies, some of which can kill you in a couple of hits. There are also bosses, a decent number of them actualy. You will need to kill them in order to advance the story and this might provide quite a bit of a challenge. They are still (usualy) not unfair in the terms of mechanics, but they do get stronger the more damaged they are.\n\nThe skill system is great. The number of skills and choises to make is simply astounding. It imediately reminded me of Path of Exile, however it IS quite a bit more simple. This does not mean it lacks depth or different builds, however I do recommend looking up a guide if you're starting out, because otherwise you can quickly screw yourself over later on. You can unlock the option to equip better weapons and armor, while other options include mostly attribute upgrades.\n\nThe last thing I wanna talk about is graphics. The game has a quite unique and beautiful aesthetic which is dark and depressing. The characters looked like giant frog-people, at least for me. As for the soundtrack, to be honest, after not playing for a couple of days, I've already forgotten it. It was simply not remembable for me, however this relies mostly due to personal preferences.\n\nI have to mention one thing that's been bothering me a lot. There is no map. This is actualy quite a big of a deal, because you will quickly get lost in the huge world, which has many different locations and corridors. The fact that you will have to backtrack quite often makes orienting even more confusing.\n\nConclusion: If you ever wanted to play Dark Souls in 2D, now is your chance. Even if you haven't played Dark Souls, you will most likely still love Salt and Sanctuary.

Making the translation over to a 2D side-scroller isn't all that easy of a thing to do when you're talking about a style of game that is replete with depth and complexity but from what I've played so far, Salt & Sanctuary covers all of those bases while still being challenging and fresh in its own right.\n\nI implore anyone on the fence about it to make the dive and step in - I played this to death co-op with a friend on his PS4 and I've been dying with anticipation for the PC version to come out and I wasn't even aware that it was going to be today!","May 17","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's bosses (so far, maybe further ones are not) seem challenging at first but fairly easy when you learn the bosses tells and learn how to dodge the upcoming attack, not to disimilar to a game of the same unnamed genre. As for the platforming I have personally had no issue with it only "unfair" deaths I have had where checking to see if there was a secret or not, but then again MetriodVanias where my go to games when I was a kid and knew there was platforming coming into the game, if you come into the game expecting purely a 2D Dark Souls then I could see not liking the platforming since Dark Souls was for the most part fairly light on platforming execpt a few zones.\n\nAll in all if you read all the negitive reviews on the game you will notice only a couple of complaints "Dark Souls rip off" or "Platforming unfair", which like I said I could see coming from someone who was expecting purely a 2D Dark Souls, but if you expect platforming its not really unfair unless you don't like platformers. Or "Bosses unfair", which again its all about learning boss tells, some attacks you want to dodge roll away from, some attacks you want to dodge roll towards, some attacks you want to jump, I have not run into an attack you can not avoid (unless you poorly manage your stamina) but some may seem unavoidable if you don't think about rolling towards the boss to get under the attack.\n\nWho would I recomend this game to? Anyone who enjoys the Souls mechanics while at the same time enjoys platforming not to disimalar to Castlevania games of old.\n\nIs it a perfect game? No, but most the complaints are highly subjective or just not taking the time to try different ways to avoid attacks. I know I have beat the Queen of Smiles a few times, know that you can do the fight without taking damage but I just suck at the fight so just put her weakness on my weapon and kill her more quickly becuase I keep screwing up dodging toward her on attacks or the timing of it. Then again I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the "unfair this or that" complaints where from people who are younger then when games where designed to be quarter eaters back when unfair was the staple of all games. But I have seen no reason to believe that this game crosses the line between "challenging" and "unfair", but certain parts may be in that grey area where its hard to tell which it is.","May 25","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They will reward you for observation and exploration, just like in Dark Souls - thus they'll punish you if you don't pay attention to your surroundings...\nThe lore of Salt and Sanctuary isn't openly presented and has to be discovered by reading item descriptions (again, like in the Souls series) and the soundtrack underlines the atmosphere well enough, especially during boss fights...\n\nThere are some cheap fights and areas in which you're likely going to die uón your first try, but overall they are scarce - thus the positive parts outweight them.\n\nOverall I recommend Salt and Sanctuary if you're looking for a challenging "Soulslike" game - If you tend to rage you shouldn't approach it , if you're willing to learn from your mistakes then it's gonna be a great experience!","May 27","true","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's no reason a 2D game should be running worse than an open world 3D one like DS III.\n\nPlatforming: This is easily the weakest part of the game in my opinion. The platforming just is not fun in any way. Most of it is simply jumping from one platform to another and hoping your character does not decide to not grab the edge and fall to his death. I've probably died as much from falling to my death as I have from actually fighting enemies.\n\nControls: This might have something to do with the performance drops, but the controls feel really sluggish in some fights. One of the most annoying things that happens is your character attacking in the wrong direction and hitting absolutely nothing. It seems like the attack button command takes priority over the move button command and instead of your character turning and then attacking if you press a direction and then press attack he will just attack and not turn at all.\n\nRolling in boss fights also has a bit of a curve to it. Bosses are treated as solid objects in all the cases I have seen and you have to roll in order to get past them and dodge their attacks. Unfortunately, the roll range seems really odd and more often than not I end up rolling into a boss and going absolutely nowhere because I get stopped dead in front of the boss.\n\nIf you can look past the control issues and grin through the platforming, then the game is pretty good. But, with all the Dark Souls clones that are either coming out or have already come out I think there are more polished games on the market that will give you more bang for your buck. This game has potential however and I'm looking forward to seeing if it gets more updates to polish out these problems or if they improve on the game in another installment.","May 28","false","21.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

This is the basic concept of Salt and Sanctuary. Now when you think of a 2D game, you likely have horrible flashbacks of utterly cliche of "indie" and "retro" art styles with. Thankfully, this is not one of those trash titles. This has an art style of it's own that is beautiful in its own way. No pixelated garbage, solid platforming, all in all a very very solid MetroidVania type of game that will have you yelling at your monitor when you mess up just like Dark Souls. This is coming from someone who is pretty much against any kind of side scroller as I feel they are just overdone to hell by "indie" devs.  Gameplay is extremely fluid and feels refined, no matter if you're a heavy armor great axe wielder or a dodging dagger/bow user. If your laptop can't handle Dark Souls 1, but you want that self harm experience, go ahead and get it. Even if you can handle Dark Souls III, I'd recommend it. For those looking for a game that's like the original Castlevania games, jump on this.","May 26","true","20.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Received Death Wish Simulator 2016. 10/10 would purchase wrong game again.\n\nSeriously though, I really like this game. The framework is certainly based off of Dark Souls and you will see many similarities but I didn't buy this game because of how much I liked Dark Souls. I bought it because I loved Dishwasher 2, which first introduced me to Ska Studios.\n\nThat art style and hyper violence are still here but things aren't as chaotic and over the top because of the Dark Souls influence. Ska Studios' dark art style is perfect for a series like this. I also like the dark guitar and ambient sounds that comprise the soundtrack.\n\nThe combat is difficult but rewarding. You will die....a lot but for all the times that you see the word Obliterated, the few times that you see the Victory makes it all worth it. Again this game is difficult without being punishing. None of that going hollow nonsense and needing an item to restore yourself. Simply visit any Sanctuary and you're back to full health. When you die it's often in new areas or with a new boss; trying to figure things out. Once you do, you know that victory is coming in time.\n\nIt's been years since a game has been addictive enough to keep me up until the wee hours of the morning but Ska Studios has managed to do so with this gem, so kudos to them.\n\nI hope this game gets a lot of support, so that Ska Studios will release more titles on PC. I would buy Dishwasher 2 on Steam in a heartbeat.","May 28","true","34.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It has a lot of the same basic systems that the Souls series has. The game follows a lot of the same design decisions that the Souls games, but missed some opportunities to improve in areas. The game doesn't really tell you how anything works. You also basically have to commit to a build instead of really being able to experiment at all, since you have to spend your levels into a talent grid, similar to what you would find in Final Fantasy 10 or Path or Exile, and they tend to put different playstyles about as far away as they can from each other. You can refund some points, but you have to find items to do so, and there are only about 20 of them per playthrough so far as I am aware.\n\nCombat feels kind of slow and clunky.\n\nRolling exists, but the hitboxes can be kind of weird. Also, there are different tiers of rolling, similar to the Souls series, where the closer you are to the encumbrance cap, the less effective rolling is. This makes wearing heavy armor and trying to roll expensive in terms of stat points, since you are going to have to heavily invest in your carrying capacity.\n\nTaking damage reduces your maximum health, so getting more potions isn't really effective, since by the time that you could use all of them your health will be at a point to where you will be killed in one hit anyway.\n\nMagic seems useful, but is somewhat inconvenient to use. There is no lock-on system, so casting it in any direction other than straight ahead is kind of fiddly. Casting spells also reduces your maximum stamina. You can recover this "fatigue" through the use of potions that you have to spec into.\nMelee has a limited combo system similar to what you would find in old beat-em-ups, you will do some different combos depending on what order you hain you heavy and light attacks in. There only seems to be about 5 different combos per weapon types however. There are currently 16 different weapon types, including staves and wands for casting spells, so there is a variety of weapons that you can use. Each weapon talent path also contains a couple of different types of weapons, such as spears, scythes, and poleaxes, so you have some room to switch between a couple of one type doesn't suit you.\nParrying exists, but doesn't seem to serve much of a point. Most of the enemies that you would want to parry, including bosses, aren't parry-able. Most of the normal enemies I can kill in one hit, so no point in trying to parry them. At least the parry animations look cool.\n\nBosses are fairly interesting. They aren't just larger versions of the normal enemies that you fight. Each one generally has a couple of attacks that it will use at the start of the fight. Once you get it to around half health however, it will pick up a new attack or two and start chaining its earlier attacks together. One of the larger problems with them though, is once they do hit the point where they start using new attacks, is that they start spamming them pretty much nonstop, not really leaving you with any room to get in any hits. Also, since most of the bosses are quite large, the character has some trouble trying to roll though attacks/models, and tends to roll in place and take a hit or two instead. Which you generally tend to die afterward, since the potions heal over time, and most of the boss attacks tend to be long, sweeping attacks and hit almost the entire arena.\n\nOverall it seems like they had a pretty good game, and then they added a lot of "features” in order to make it "challenging", while instead all it does it make the game tedious to play. It doesn't feel difficult, it feels cheap. I don't really feel victorious after beating a boss, I feel like I managed to avoid getting cheesed.\n\nI really wanted to like the game, and maybe I will get to a point where I will start enjoying it more, but as it stands I would just rather be playing one of the Souls games.\n","May 18","false","9.2"," 83 of 179 people (46%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","46","83","179","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rynoII/recommended/283640/","rynoII","Mr Smeeb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rynoII/","413 products in account","At the time of writing this, I have had a total of 6-7 hours in this game. 3-4 on PS4 and 3 on Steam. I honestly tried to like this game. As someone who has beaten Demon's Souls 6 times, Dark Souls 12 times, Dark Souls 2 4 times, and Dark Souls 3 4 times, I cannot find a reason to keep playing this homage to the genre. I have learned a great deal of patience playing the Souls series, in fact I consider myself a better person because of it, but I can not play this game for more than 30 minutes at a time without getting mad.\n\nLet's start with the positives, because there are some despite my initial paragraph. The game's platforming works well. The game has a fair bit of customization with its extensive sphere grid like skill tree. The weapons, for the most part, feel unique to each other and have weight and heft to them. The names of the zones are dark and brooding and I love em. While the humans look awkward, I do like the art style of the game. The music is dark and brooding, which is what you need for a game like this.\n\nNow....for the bad stuff. The stuff I just cannot tolerate or forgive. The first is the god awful hit boxes. So many times I will get hit by things that I really shouldn't have. There are also times when rolling into an enemy to get behind them doesn't work, resulting in you getting hit anyway. An example is when I was rolling into an enemy to get past them, and got swiped into the air (because the hit box on the weapon seemed to be the entire screen despite being behind the hilt of the weapon at the time) and launched me into the air, falling down a pit just to get juggled by another enemy who knocked me down another pit to my death. Totally unable to prevent it, something Dark Souls is known for giving you a chance to prevent. There are also the enemies. Each enemy has unavoidable attacks which is a no no for a game like this. It may be fair, and some people may tell me to get good, but it doesn't FEEL fair. In fact almost 100% of this game doesn't FEEL fair. Dark Souls at least feels fair, if I die I know why and how to prevent it next time. I feel like each enemy I fight is just more bull stacked on top of more bull. "Ok let's make an enemy who is invisible, can grab you in the air and on the ground, his grabs are unavoidable, and he can jump at you from off screen. Oh and make it take 90% of the player's life too." "Ok let's make a slime that attacks before you get a chance to react, and make it gravitate towards the player so they cannot dodge it, it instantly poisons him, and let's make the boss of this area throw them out during the fight. Oh! Let's also make it so there are no iframes after being grabbed so it can happen again immediately. AND, make it so each consecutive grab worsens the poison until the player dies in 1 second. Seems fair."\n\nLet's get down to the elephant in the room though. Even if the enemies are not being impossible, and I am making good progress without dying, the game is just simply not fun. It is not an engaging game. Maybe I have just played too much Dark Souls, but I do not think that is it. So at the time of writing this, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. I wish I could, I wanted to like this game. I bought it twice. I gave it a solid 6 hours at least. I just cannot do it. I will continue to play the game, maybe something will spark my interest  and if that day comes I will update this, but I think I am going to go back to Dark Souls for now.","May 29","false","3.4"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

This homage (not a homage) to Dark Souls will test your skills as a gamer...well, only your paitence at jumping puzzles and un-ballanced enemies, weak level and character design.\n\nLest break this down.\nGraphics: Bland desaturated souls wanna be; both in level look and HUD style. We all love the Souls series and thats why we wanted to play Salt & Sanctuary. Its just a shame that this game really has no style or direction much of its own. The characters are a pain to look at and the bosses apear to have been grabbed from someones lack luster doodles from 6th grade. Its a muddy confusing mess to look at.\n\nGameplay: Excesive jumping in platformers are a lazy gameplay/time extending excuse. Theres nothing old school about the jumping in S&S. The platform traversing isnt there to get you around from point A to B etc. Its there to get in your way, or for the enemies to hit you off of. It would have been nice to need them to get around a labrynth like world. The bland layout will make you not give two salts about where you're going or what you're doing.\n\nI like the weapons and how they look while attacking. They feel right and the gore adds to that; something i wish the Souls series had. I wont review the items and secondary trinkets as i generally dont care for that kind of item/gameplay mechanic anyway. Fighting is neat to look at but you tend to get sick of it when you have to go get your salt due to some BS enemies you cant see or lame lazy boss fight that you cant dodge roll around.\n\nWhen you DO lose your salt you are kindly informed that you lost it FOREVER. That of course is on par with the Souls series, but this time its the above mentioned tripe thats takes your sou...er salt...away from you. When the game feels like its cheating you then punishing you for what its done; things get a little frustrating. Not only do you get the 'bad touch' from the game, you get charged for it too. You pay in gold to respawn back at the bondfi...er. sactuary. When you feel its not your fault you died, you feel like you got robbed. Pretending to be like those other difficult games without understanding why they're difficult but fun; doesnt make for a 'love of Souls games' game.\n\nWhat the game does add that is nice: The extra abilities like wall jumping or upside down gameplay etc. When the game tries to be different (character design aside) it shines.\n\nThe whole time playing this game i just wanted to go play Souls instead. I admire the small team that made the game, and i like how far they've come. As a fantasy doodler myself, i like that the game is hand drawn. It's just sad that this game doesnt have much of its own design and style to be fresh. Trying to be a homage to that which we love, the game fails because its trying too hard.","May 25","false","15.6"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","8","25","0","4"

Till it is tightened up it cannot be recommended despite the fact that I love the concept, and that its basically 2D dark souls.","May 19","false","10.4"," 16 of 46 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","16","46","2","3"

Meh 6/10.\nThe looks and aesthetics are perfectly fine, it gives off the proper atmosphere and the background blends (though some areas flowing into others looks a tad odd).\nThe animations and combat feel clunky though you can easily compensate and that alone doesn't take from the experience.\nRolling in the game works fine, I had little difficulty rolling through blows even with fat rolling.\nThe Salt is a direct rip off of Souls from Dark Souls, but its a proven mechanic and functions fine here alongside Gold.\nThe sanctuary and levelling up system is interesting, I wish I could have explored it more though it seems to cripple adjusting builds.\nOnly fought the Sodden Knight (first Boss) and he was a cake-walk so nothing to say there on Bosses besides block, stab, roll, jump repeat until half hp then block, roll, block, attack, jump repeat.\nOverall I like the game, so why downvote and request a refund?\nCombat in general.\nThe enemies have very random patterns of attack which alone is not a big deal, but the game is prone to throwing a half-dozen of them at you at once making it difficult to approach the situation.\nThey also benefit from infinite stamina and no way to properly deflect or hinder their attacks or movement rendering Shields virtually useless when they swing endlessly.\nRolling is easy though futile if you are still in the enemies reach as they will turn on a Dime and continue thier frenzy without hesitation regardless of what combo they may have been in.\nCouldn't try magic but found no way of properly aiming with a Bow which I found rather disappointing.\nLastly enemies with thier random attack patterns and endless frenzied swings will most assuredly stunlock and kill you if you are surrounded by any more than 2 at any time making groups a nightmare to handle.\n\nAll in all it was a nice game and these are my first impressions with the mere 2 hours of playtime I was permitted.\nThe game does not suffer from poor controlls, aesthetics, or level design.  In fact I found them stellar and well implemented.\nThis game suffers from poor enemy design which cripples the entire experience.","May 24","false","1.9"," 9 of 33 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","9","33","2","3"

Was super excited about it, having watched a quick look of it and dug the overall feel of it. But, having got my hands on it I can't really recommend it.\nThe controls are super clunky and unresponsive at best, to the point where it seems like a design choice in order to make the game more difficult. I was playing on a wireless 360 controller but even when I switched to mouse n keyboard it was still a major factor.\nThere are big sections where a well timed jump is necessary and it often seems touch and go as to whether the game registers it or not. This goes for other controls like the roll as well.\nWith it being a 2D environment, both of these are essential in defeating enemies but neither can be relied upon in a pinch. Thats not even factoring in the difficulty in actually memorising the (seemingly random) attack patterns of bosses and their ability to spin on a dime mid combo.\nI'm also finding the colour scheme difficult to look at for long periods of time. Even if I know a trap is somewhere I can still have difficulty locating it and feel like I'm constantly straining my eyes.\nNot really liking the general enemy design, especially the blob enemies. Their attacks seem cheap and too easy for the AI to land.\nI'm gonna persist with the game, and would probably give the game a "maybe" rating if I could. If you can, try a demo..

Not the most important thing, but it's annoying.\nThe inventory isn't very clear on how weapons and shields work. You have two slots for either a weapon or a shield on either side of the inventory, but equiping a weapon on either side will only let you use one of those weapons if you're two handing.\nNo obvious equip load indicator, so no way to know what's too heavy on sight, something Souls does right.\nNo obvious armor or weapon stats, so no way to know what's good or bad on sight, something that, again, Souls does right.\nNo normal enemy life bars, which is just a QOL thing, but still.\nThe UI is just clunky and doesn't flow well.\nIt's a more rough Souls, basically.

Specially because mobs don't have a pattern and they can just do batshit crazy combos out of nowhere. As it seems some of them don't even have stamina so they can spam their attacks and block as much as they want. I think in games like these, mobs have to be similar to the player in general like they must have similar pros or cons.

An unlikely combination, but one that works surprisingly well and still keeps all aspects of it fairly satisfying.\nOnly downsides are that there is no online co-op (it's local play only) and the unusual art style which might turn some people off.\nI heartily recommend this game to all Soulsborne and Castlevania fans alike.","May 22","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very much like a Souls game, but it's also got a great metrodvania feel. Pros and cons are as follows:\n\nPros:\nTypically tight controls\nGreat art style that emphasizes colors and shading when it needs to(Except for those faces)\nA lot to explore\nA large amount of customization for such a small game\nRewarding when taking down bosses or getting through tough areas\n\nMeh:\nNot as difficult as it could have been. It's typically balanced, but it's not going to challenge you to be pushed to your limits. It definitely rewards patience, but bosses and enemies become predictable very quickly, lowering the difficulty of the game. Some parts will still feel difficult, but it's not overbearing, in my opinion.\n\nCons:\nStun lock. Enemies will knock you down and start chaining attacks, giving no time for recovery and feeling cheap\nStarts to drag a little towards the end. The world felt a little worn, but it's still great to explore. Just a little more variety would have been appreciated.\n\nIt's a good game. Great even. It's really enjoyable, and it's probably going to end up being one of those indie game gems. It's a solid 9/10.","May 22","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals have a great feel ripped right out of Lovecraft, with smooth controls and well laid out levels. Interestingly, I didn't find the difficulty all that bad, and I've only felt like I got cheesed a couple of times. This may also be the first game I've ever played where playing as a caster is easier from the get-go. Souls veterans may have an easier time, but I don't think this one is quite as challenging.\n\nThere is one thing (maybe a drawback for some) I do have to mention though. The lore of this game gets a little confusing at times. You need to read absolutly EVERYTHING here to get into the story. That includes all character dialogue, item descriptions, and skills. Again, this is very much in the spirit of a Souls game, but newcomers to that style of story-telling should be aware of it. These games do not present an easy to find narrative.\n\nOverall, I very much recommend this to people who enjoy Metroid and Souls style games. You absolutly do not have to be a Dark Souls verteran to play and enjoy this.

You gain health by leveling, roughly two levels is 5 health. You gain stats by putting points into the Skill Tree, not just allocating points into whatever you want. The melee weapons do have a little combo in them, according to your equipment load as well. Magic is really well done in this game, you lose your maximum stamina everytime you use magic, but you gain a little bit of it back after you use a potion. The game can be unfair, but hey, that's what happens when you play a "Souls"-like game, nothing will be fair. Some bosses are challenging, some are fairly easy. There are even some moments where you can execute a monster by stomping their head in or stabbing them in the face while they're stunned. The visuals are nice, sound effects are wonderful, and music is pretty nice\n\nTL;DR : If you like any of the Souls games, platformers and blood flying  you should try this game.

It has satisfying combat, solid controls, and a good sense of risk/reward styled fighting. I however do not like the fact that some things just feel unfair or "broken" for lack of a better term. In one of the later game areas there are creatures called spindlebeasts which are much like unicorns, these enemies are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the second they touch you they will impale and insta-kill you. As far as I know there is no way to get away from them besides running away from or around them. I haven't tried blocking their one-shot attack with a shield, but I highly doubt it works. Beware of these if you want to keep the 20k+ salt you earned from a boss fight. There is also a late game boss  (Witch of the Lake)  that tends to fly off screen and then absolutely annihilate me with one of its attacks, granted this is probably becasue I'm pushing it into to the corner with attacks or maybe because I'm just bad at fighting this boss, but it still feels broken. The game was released not too long ago and is most likely going to get some balancing or fix patches to help with some problems. Long story short it's a fantastic game with a lot of promise. I highly recommend it for those who are looking for a fair priced hack and slash, story rich platformer.\n\nTL;DR good game buy it.

Being a fan of the Souls games and Symphony of the Night, I was intrigued to discover this game, even more so when I discovered it was by the people who made Charlie Murder, which admittedly I didn't play much of. Not a fault of the game mind you, I'm just not that good at beat 'em ups. This however, I did, my time on record with this game should be evidence enough of that. All the important things from Dark Souls and SoTN are there. The platforming works well enough, a few explorative aid power ups to be found but nothing major. Points off for all that Dark Souls fall damage though, especially since a la SoTN a heavy attack will send you flying gayly across the screen usually to your death, especially in areas with a lot of dropoffs (i.e. Red Hall of Cages, Hager's Cavern, Crypt of Dead Gods, etc). The combat works great, it took the most important and best aspects of the Souls series in terms of the combat which translates surprisingly well to the two dimensional plane. The dodging, the parrying, the stamina and equip load management, it's all there and works just fine. The bonfire stand-ins, called sanctuaries, though fewer than the bonfires were still work just fine, smaller more temporary respite in the form of shrines offer no opportunity to level up but do heal and usually signal a boss is nearby. Covenants, or in this case creeds are present and do a few things to benefit the player, unfortunately unlike Dark Souls changing from one to another is not painless. The level up system is different from the Souls games or SoTN but still works well, a comparison was made to FFX's skill sphere system and the comparison is apt. Your ability to wear certain weapons and armor, which are divided into tiers, is determined by picking the appropriate enabling skill in the skill tree, which does limit what you can use and makes you pick and choose very carefully where to put your upgrade points. Two currencies abound here, salt (souls), and gold. Salt is for leveling up and upgrading gear, gold is for purchases at NPC vendors. Upon death, which in this type of game is bound to happen, you lose all your salt, which if you kill the offending enemy or spawned bat (no bloodstains here) you reclaim them, if you don't die on the way there that is. You lose about 10% of your held gold as well, which is not recoverable. Technically it holds up, I only encountered one minor issue that resolved itself in seconds. I think I covered just about everything, overall this is one of my favorite games of the year so far. There's a lot to recommend here, and for roughly eighteen dollars there's a lot of fun to be had, a solid 8/10.","May 25","true","44.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though the game is 2D you can get lost quickly and end up in an unwanted boss fight (I lost 9000 salt because of that).  The stagger in this game is brutal which makes it fun.  From what I've taken in from the game light armor seems to be the best because you can roll fast obviously but heavier armor slows you down and you still take the same amount of damage.  The sheilds are so forgetable during fighting so your best bet is to two hand a weapon if you are scared of getting hit just roll.  The one thing that irks me is the money system,  There is gold and salt.  Salt is used for leveling up weps and yourself.  Gold is for purchesing ♥♥♥♥ but the part that irks me is that you farm all this money but when you die a large portion of it is taken away to pay a mysterious cleric to revive you so if you have 6000 gold then when you die they take out 700 gold.  Thats freaking crazy!  They should have stuck to the salt as a leveling currency and a trading currency.  But nonetheless this game is fun and the updates to come will make the game better.

The visuals have a great feel ripped right out of Lovecraft, with smooth controls and well laid out levels. Interestingly, I didn't find the difficulty all that bad, and I've only felt like I got cheesed a couple of times. This may also be the first game I've ever played where playing as a caster is easier from the get-go. Souls veterans may have an easier time, but I don't think this one is quite as challenging.\n\nThere is one thing (maybe a drawback for some) I do have to mention though. The lore of this game gets a little confusing at times. You need to read absolutly EVERYTHING here to get into the story. That includes all character dialogue, item descriptions, and skills. Again, this is very much in the spirit of a Souls game, but newcomers to that style of story-telling should be aware of it. These games do not present an easy to find narrative.\n\nOverall, I very much recommend this to people who enjoy Metroid and Souls style games. You absolutly do not have to be a Dark Souls verteran to play and enjoy this.

It's very much like a Souls game, but it's also got a great metrodvania feel. Pros and cons are as follows:\n\nPros:\nTypically tight controls\nGreat art style that emphasizes colors and shading when it needs to(Except for those faces)\nA lot to explore\nA large amount of customization for such a small game\nRewarding when taking down bosses or getting through tough areas\n\nMeh:\nNot as difficult as it could have been. It's typically balanced, but it's not going to challenge you to be pushed to your limits. It definitely rewards patience, but bosses and enemies become predictable very quickly, lowering the difficulty of the game. Some parts will still feel difficult, but it's not overbearing, in my opinion.\n\nCons:\nStun lock. Enemies will knock you down and start chaining attacks, giving no time for recovery and feeling cheap\nStarts to drag a little towards the end. The world felt a little worn, but it's still great to explore. Just a little more variety would have been appreciated.\n\nIt's a good game. Great even. It's really enjoyable, and it's probably going to end up being one of those indie game gems. It's a solid 9/10.","May 22","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As such, comparisons to Dark Souls are...kind of a given.  It's a different beast, in both good ways and bad, from Dark Souls, so let's break this game down.  It's not perfect, but has enough charm to keep you engaged for a decent amount of time.\n\nVisually, the game's characters are a bit odd, as they have an almost leathery, sackboy like skinset, but other than that, the visuals are striking.  A bit watered down at times, but with lots of detail and grim, haunting environemnts that are just as creepy as they are cool, like a village of dead people with smiles carved into their faces, corpses in a pumpkin patch which try to eat you, and an entire dungeon of creepiness.  The combat feels tough and meaty and there's a lot of blood, the best part of it being the weight each blow seems to have.  It feels like you're really slamming a hammer or a whip into an enemy when it makes contact.  You can reclaim your exp, called Salt here, if you die by killing your killer, which is cool, or by killing a bird if you didn't die to an enemy.  There are clever traps and wicked monsters, all well designed and creepy looking.\n\nNow, unfortunately, this game isn't perfect.  The music is...pretty lackluster.  It's not going a lot of the time, but occasionally breaks into a guitar riff and...doesn't feel ambient or appropriate.  It's also gonna get old quick because you are gonna hear it a lot.  The story is pretty nonexistant apart from a setup.  There are some interesting side stories and you meet some cool NPCs, but apart from a feeling of something sinister guiding you through the island, there isn't much story and the world building feels poor compared to Dark Souls.  We don't get much of a feel for other countries or nations outside the island we're on in the same way as we did for Dark Souls.  This game focuses a lot more on platforming as well, which is both good and bad.  Good in that it provides something different and interesting for getting around.  Bad in that you will die to gravity a hundred times more than you will to enemies.  This also brings up another point...any enemy your size or great can punt you off the edge of a cliff with ease and there are A LOT of cliffs in this game.  You are going to die a lot in unfair ways as guys swing at you and just throw you into an abyss.  Finally, some enemies are just unfair.  I know this sounds like a cop out, but there are two major problems with enemy design.  The first is stun.  It's easy as all hell to stunlock in this game.  For both you and enemies.  Get sandwiched and you are toast as your health drops to zero almost immediately, with you unable to swing your sword or raise your shield.  Conversely, it's easy to just totally prevent an enemy from hitting you if you are fast enough.  It's a trade off.  Worse though is that some enemies will screw you with unfair abilities.  That stunlock got me killed when an AOE did 1000 points of minor damage over like 10 seconds, but since I was stunned, I couldn't escape.  I also found a troupe of skeletons in a cave.  THey are able to teleport and hide from you.  This means they can teleport away from your swings and gang up on you with you unable to counter attack.  There are a fair number of problems with enemy designs.\n\nSalt and Sanctuary feels a bit less...polished than Dark Souls.  It's a good game and it has a lot of fun moments.  The design of the world is striking and the combat feels satisfying when the enemies don't BS you.  It's worth a try because the combat is addictive.  However, bear in mind there will be frustrations.","May 22","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm really glad I did because this game is great! It's a little too short to explore everything (in terms of builds and weapons) in just one playthrough, which is nice because you are able to repeat the game via the learned paths but using different methods of combat each playthrough (very very similar to Dark Souls).\n\nPersonally I went with 2h Swords and 2h Hammers and found the game challenging but not overly so - the difficulty is about where it should be IMHO. The art is fantastic (with the odd and notable exception of your character's head, it looks like Sockboy f**ked a beanbag chair) and suits the game well. I experienced no frame rate drops or any crashes, seems to be well optimized.\n\nThe local coop is awesome, feels like playing a 2d diablo on the PSX back in the day and it's really unique in that it allows both players to develop their characters side by side. Any items you find in the host(Player 1)'s game are automatically given to the guests (Player 2), and if Player 2 loads their game they will have everything gained (minus the story items) in their world.\n\n10/10 if you have someone local coop to play with\n7/10 if you're playing alone (like me) you loser you.","May 24","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By regressing from Dark Souls' 3D back to 2D, we've arguably come full circle, back to classic Metroidvania. One wonders why we ever embarked on this silly quest for 3D to begin with.\n\nYes, I said it, it's Dark Souls in 2D, I'm not sure what kind of insightful commentary you expected. There's lots of weapons to collect, all with slightly different mechanics and movesets, there's lots of enemies and creative ways to die, interesting and mindboggling boss monsters, all that. True to it's progenitors form, there's very little story but lots of atmosphere, the world is doomed and you don't even know what the main quest is. Also there's no ingame map which is utterly inexcusible.\n\nAt the time of writing I've played about twenty hours and finished two thirds of the game. Will head into NG+ soon. It's great, it's Dark Souls, I'll take whatever I can get.\n\nVerdict: Great game, buy it if you're into the Souls series or Metroidvania.","May 24","true","31.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because even though that they called it a "2D Dark Souls", this game does an amazing job at being unique. The atmophere, the weapon designs, the monsters, the bosses, everything is done with so much orinality and detail.\nIf you are going to play this game, pay to attention to everything. There are so many details and fragments of the lore everywhere, you'll need a ton of patience to read it all. And it will be worth it.\nMy sincere opnion is that this game is not getting the attention that it deserves, and yes, I am fan girling but I really don't care.\nAnyway, I can't really list many cons but one thing that really got me down is that there are only 6 daggers on the game. For a game with "600 weapons, armor pieces, spells, and items"(quote drom their website), I don't really think that it would hurt to make 5 more designs. I really like using daggers on rpgs, but man I had to make a lot of effort to use them on this one. And on the end I gave up to the sword whips.\nStill, I love this game so much and if you enjoyed playing demon souls, dark souls and all of those, you'll love this one too.","May 22","true","51.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has satisfying combat, solid controls, and a good sense of risk/reward styled fighting. I however do not like the fact that some things just feel unfair or "broken" for lack of a better term. In one of the later game areas there are creatures called spindlebeasts which are much like unicorns, these enemies are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the second they touch you they will impale and insta-kill you. As far as I know there is no way to get away from them besides running away from or around them. I haven't tried blocking their one-shot attack with a shield, but I highly doubt it works. Beware of these if you want to keep the 20k+ salt you earned from a boss fight. There is also a late game boss  (Witch of the Lake)  that tends to fly off screen and then absolutely annihilate me with one of its attacks, granted this is probably becasue I'm pushing it into to the corner with attacks or maybe because I'm just bad at fighting this boss, but it still feels broken. The game was released not too long ago and is most likely going to get some balancing or fix patches to help with some problems. Long story short it's a fantastic game with a lot of promise. I highly recommend it for those who are looking for a fair priced hack and slash, story rich platformer.\n\nTL;DR good game buy it.

Being a fan of the Souls games and Symphony of the Night, I was intrigued to discover this game, even more so when I discovered it was by the people who made Charlie Murder, which admittedly I didn't play much of. Not a fault of the game mind you, I'm just not that good at beat 'em ups. This however, I did, my time on record with this game should be evidence enough of that. All the important things from Dark Souls and SoTN are there. The platforming works well enough, a few explorative aid power ups to be found but nothing major. Points off for all that Dark Souls fall damage though, especially since a la SoTN a heavy attack will send you flying gayly across the screen usually to your death, especially in areas with a lot of dropoffs (i.e. Red Hall of Cages, Hager's Cavern, Crypt of Dead Gods, etc). The combat works great, it took the most important and best aspects of the Souls series in terms of the combat which translates surprisingly well to the two dimensional plane. The dodging, the parrying, the stamina and equip load management, it's all there and works just fine. The bonfire stand-ins, called sanctuaries, though fewer than the bonfires were still work just fine, smaller more temporary respite in the form of shrines offer no opportunity to level up but do heal and usually signal a boss is nearby. Covenants, or in this case creeds are present and do a few things to benefit the player, unfortunately unlike Dark Souls changing from one to another is not painless. The level up system is different from the Souls games or SoTN but still works well, a comparison was made to FFX's skill sphere system and the comparison is apt. Your ability to wear certain weapons and armor, which are divided into tiers, is determined by picking the appropriate enabling skill in the skill tree, which does limit what you can use and makes you pick and choose very carefully where to put your upgrade points. Two currencies abound here, salt (souls), and gold. Salt is for leveling up and upgrading gear, gold is for purchases at NPC vendors. Upon death, which in this type of game is bound to happen, you lose all your salt, which if you kill the offending enemy or spawned bat (no bloodstains here) you reclaim them, if you don't die on the way there that is. You lose about 10% of your held gold as well, which is not recoverable. Technically it holds up, I only encountered one minor issue that resolved itself in seconds. I think I covered just about everything, overall this is one of my favorite games of the year so far. There's a lot to recommend here, and for roughly eighteen dollars there's a lot of fun to be had, a solid 8/10.","May 25","true","44.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes elements from Dark Souls and mixes them with elements from the old 2D Castlevania and Metroid games. The gameplay is centered around three main areas: combat, exploration, and platforming. And it does all those things really really well.\n\nIt basically uses the souls (sorry salt) system from Dark Souls for leveling up as well as the huge varriety of starting classes, weapons, spells, and other equipment and consumables that Dark Souls has and puts all that in a 2D world that kinda resembles the amazing level design of the old Metroid games with everything being connected and secrets everywhere.\n\nIt's more than "just" Dark Souls in 2D. It's a full fledged Metroidvania game with labyrinthian levels that open up more and more when the player gains additional abilities to reach prior inaccessible locations. The game requires the clever use and combination of abilities to solve door puzzles or reach certain places.\n\nThere is no map and the areas are HUGE and all connected to each other. Salt and Sanctuary is not a game for people that need GPS to find the way from their TV to their fridge at home^^\n\nIt's also not a game for people that want something casual to play. It's a very challenging game. Yet thankfully not in an unfair way. The controls are responsive and precise and the player has all the tools needed to get the job done. It's hard but fair. And overcoming challenges or finding new places feels very rewarding.\n\n9/10","May 27","true","49.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As such, comparisons to Dark Souls are...kind of a given.  It's a different beast, in both good ways and bad, from Dark Souls, so let's break this game down.  It's not perfect, but has enough charm to keep you engaged for a decent amount of time.\n\nVisually, the game's characters are a bit odd, as they have an almost leathery, sackboy like skinset, but other than that, the visuals are striking.  A bit watered down at times, but with lots of detail and grim, haunting environemnts that are just as creepy as they are cool, like a village of dead people with smiles carved into their faces, corpses in a pumpkin patch which try to eat you, and an entire dungeon of creepiness.  The combat feels tough and meaty and there's a lot of blood, the best part of it being the weight each blow seems to have.  It feels like you're really slamming a hammer or a whip into an enemy when it makes contact.  You can reclaim your exp, called Salt here, if you die by killing your killer, which is cool, or by killing a bird if you didn't die to an enemy.  There are clever traps and wicked monsters, all well designed and creepy looking.\n\nNow, unfortunately, this game isn't perfect.  The music is...pretty lackluster.  It's not going a lot of the time, but occasionally breaks into a guitar riff and...doesn't feel ambient or appropriate.  It's also gonna get old quick because you are gonna hear it a lot.  The story is pretty nonexistant apart from a setup.  There are some interesting side stories and you meet some cool NPCs, but apart from a feeling of something sinister guiding you through the island, there isn't much story and the world building feels poor compared to Dark Souls.  We don't get much of a feel for other countries or nations outside the island we're on in the same way as we did for Dark Souls.  This game focuses a lot more on platforming as well, which is both good and bad.  Good in that it provides something different and interesting for getting around.  Bad in that you will die to gravity a hundred times more than you will to enemies.  This also brings up another point...any enemy your size or great can punt you off the edge of a cliff with ease and there are A LOT of cliffs in this game.  You are going to die a lot in unfair ways as guys swing at you and just throw you into an abyss.  Finally, some enemies are just unfair.  I know this sounds like a cop out, but there are two major problems with enemy design.  The first is stun.  It's easy as all hell to stunlock in this game.  For both you and enemies.  Get sandwiched and you are toast as your health drops to zero almost immediately, with you unable to swing your sword or raise your shield.  Conversely, it's easy to just totally prevent an enemy from hitting you if you are fast enough.  It's a trade off.  Worse though is that some enemies will screw you with unfair abilities.  That stunlock got me killed when an AOE did 1000 points of minor damage over like 10 seconds, but since I was stunned, I couldn't escape.  I also found a troupe of skeletons in a cave.  THey are able to teleport and hide from you.  This means they can teleport away from your swings and gang up on you with you unable to counter attack.  There are a fair number of problems with enemy designs.\n\nSalt and Sanctuary feels a bit less...polished than Dark Souls.  It's a good game and it has a lot of fun moments.  The design of the world is striking and the combat feels satisfying when the enemies don't BS you.  It's worth a try because the combat is addictive.  However, bear in mind there will be frustrations.","May 22","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By regressing from Dark Souls' 3D back to 2D, we've arguably come full circle, back to classic Metroidvania. One wonders why we ever embarked on this silly quest for 3D to begin with.\n\nYes, I said it, it's Dark Souls in 2D, I'm not sure what kind of insightful commentary you expected. There's lots of weapons to collect, all with slightly different mechanics and movesets, there's lots of enemies and creative ways to die, interesting and mindboggling boss monsters, all that. True to it's progenitors form, there's very little story but lots of atmosphere, the world is doomed and you don't even know what the main quest is. Also there's no ingame map which is utterly inexcusible.\n\nAt the time of writing I've played about twenty hours and finished two thirds of the game. Will head into NG+ soon.

Great combination of Dark Souls and Castlevania. Excellent job for Ska Studios! Many thanks!\nBut I still want  to say something. Now it is 9/10 in my mind, and I hope it will be 10/10 in the near future.\n1. Basically, the system for weapons and classes is rich, but the balance is...not that good I think? When I started using Greatsword in the first round of the game, it dropped  into easy mode. Most of the small battles during the game can be settled in two, or even one hit by the Greatsword. However, when I tried to start with Hunter or Mage, it became quite tough. Maybe it's because I didn't find a reasonable way to play with such classes, but still, the difflculty curves of different playing methods varies a lot. Anyway, weakening  strong weapons is not my purpose. But I really don't expect such issue to harm the gameplay.\n2. The style of the map design is quite similar to Dark Souls, from macro view. Different regions interconnect with each other. But many shortcuts seems non-sense when we can open them in the late game. Meanwhile,  Sanctuary and Shrine, which share similar task with the Bonfire in DS, are a little too covert to locate. I know it is a good 2D cross-boundary game (is this description right?), but with strong monsters without small map...hmm..well, more than half of the deaths in may first round game were falling. Rookies may fell depressed when they die because of this, if they are not familiar with DS series. So my point of this passage is, maybe a little swift is needed to make the game softer.\n3. Chinese! Chinese! Chinese! I heared someone is working on Chinesization privately in China, and I think it will come soon. Many DS players in China do not want to try this game only because it doesn't have Chinese! What's more, it will be of much help for us to undersdand its world view and script, and recommend to our friends.\n\nP.S. 头一次写英文的游戏评测，蹩脚的英语大家见笑了- -！不过能两个人做出这样的游戏真的令我很震惊。我希望能够尽绵薄之力使这个游戏变得更好，并且把它分享给更多的中国朋友，尤其是魂系列的爱好者。感谢Ska Studios，希望将来能够玩到你们更多的优秀的作品。","May 17","true","47.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess I prefer more action -packed 2d games, like metroid on the snes, or games like Dust, where you don't have to manage a stamina bar, and the combat is much faster and more fluid.  Salt and Sanctuary just started to feel like a chore...\n\nNow, this game is a great achievment for such a small studio.  I loved the indie style graphics, and the lighting effects are really atmospheric.  It also has a brilliant inter-connected world design which has you unloking shortcuts all the time and bringing you back to new areas with new skills to unlock secrets.  It also expands on the Dark Souls legacy in novel and interesting ways, such as having your convenant effect the sanctuaries (bonefires) and being able to offer statues found in the game at your sanctuary in order to summon merchants and such.  It also has a really cool skill tree that reminded me of the one in Final Fantasy X.  So there's lots of great stuff about this game, just not my cup of tea.\n\nand I see from the Steam reviews that a lot of ppl like it, but for me it just became more and more infuriating and less and les of a joy to play and this is someone whose sunk around 300 ish hours into the dark souls games.  Maybe I shouls have persevered, but for now i'm gonna let this one rest.\n\nNow, before all the  fan boys and girls get their knickers in a twist, I'm not saying this is a bad game, but i can't recommend it as I got bored of it really quickly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/283640/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","TL:DR\nHoly crap. Rarely do I come across a game this amazing (especially now that Steam is one step up from Google Play), and I've played thousands of games in my 35 years. Its a 2d Metroidvania RPG. If you dont know what that means, go back to gamer school cuz I don't have time to explain it here. This game is awesome, period. Ive been playing for 4 hours at this time, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what this game offers.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nIts amazing, probably one of if not the best Metroidvanias I've ever played. Chars are very customizable, theres plenty of weapons, armor, and magic to choose from. And each item has an awesome description in the inventory. I'm a sucker for world-building touched like that.  You even get to choose a god, which affects certain things. You can change your god too, but your first god wont llike that unless you get forgiven. The graphics beautifully are done in a really unique hand drawn style, not quite standard cell shaded and they are f'n perfect for the tone and setting. The game's tone is pretty dark. Lots of blood splatting out, undead and gross monsters shambling about, gore, dead bodies and so on.\n\nChar development is done skill tree style (more like skill web), Its pretty fluid - you can make many different pure builds, hybrid builds, or jack of all trades build work. You can cosmetically customise your char when you start out too, which is awesome as most Metroidvanias have a set protagonist. Theres many different classes to pick from when you start, but that only sets your start - like I said the skill tree is really fluid. Want a thief that uses magic? Go for it. A Paladin that doesnt use heavy armor but relies on speed? Yep. Anything is possible. Of course, some builds are easier to play than others - theres plenty of guides out there to assist with builds if youre overwhelmed. But the game is balanced enough that as long as you understand the base mechanics, you should be able to make any build work\n\nI was really surprised that its a PS4 port, because it actually works - no bugs, lags, glitches or anything so far that you typically find in ports. The controls are well done, and both K+M & controller are fully customizable (THANK YOU DEVS! I dont have to rant about people with physical disabilities and non mappable controllers in this review!). Theres a slight annoyance lining up your char to pick something up or go down a ladder on rare occasions, but its so very minor that it really isnt a big deal. Other the controls are pretty well done, although theres no way to interrupt an attack/roll/etc once you start, so youre committed and there appears to be a slight (intentional)  lag when using a healing potion which can really suck with a monster in your face. But you'll get the timing down pretty fast. You'll need it.\n\nDying is handled decently, as some areas and battles can be difficult. Theres "sanctuaries" (save points/rooms) and when you die, the enemy takes your salt (xp) and you lose some gold. Go get your salt back by killing the enemy, and youre good as new, minus a little gold.\n\nIf you say you like Metroidvanias, theres no way your library can be complete without this game.","June 6","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bloodbourne.\nI couldn't play DS3, not only because my system couldn't play it anymore without dying on me, but it also was a step back after DS2, and just not as fun for me as it was before.\nI needed a fix, and fast.\nAnd i found it in Salt & Sanctuary.\nLet me get it straight: i love Ska Studios, always loved.\nI adore their recognizable art design - dark, gruesome, and somewhat cartoony.\nAnd this game has it too, but it also has every good aspect that Souls had.\nBut it's not a ripoff, oh now.\nThis game has enough of it's own content to NOT be considerent a ripoff.\nFirst of all, this game has covenants too, yes, but now they're called Creeds and they're one of the basis of gameplay.\nYou see, every Creed has it's own special things and specializes in different things.\nEvery covenant even has their own replenishable healing items which act differently, and i'm not even talking about abillity to get into your posession through covenant leader such things as Stamina recoverers, throwable items and buff items, which all replenish when visiting the Sanctuary (but only of your own creed, every other creed's sanctuary will have the items that you may got while working for them).\nOr, what about combat?\nIt's much more awesome than in Souls.\nNot only you can do secret COMBOS with almost any weapons, it also has two different ways of parrying (traditional and bloodborne method that actually now works with crossbows too) AND you can attack in air.\nLeveling Up became much more complicated. Much. More.\nWith every level you now get a Pearl that you can use to get nods in you Skill tree. Each nod has something different, like raising your one stat by one point, up to 3 on one node, or leveling up your specialty in, for example, whips, which also raises your agility by some points. Yes, now you don't need stats to wield someithng, but you need to be more leveled in that category, which even includes armor. I don't really like that much, but it's interesting, at least it's different from souls.\nEverything in the skill tree, even the ammount of healing items you can carry (you can also raise them at Creed's leader, though, but only for a creed).\nAlso, i could say that this game is really a metroidvania, it even has abillities which needed for progression, like wall jump. Which is cool, i like that.\nBut the most important part in this game for me was it's lore, world, plot, all that.\nI won't say much but i'm really, really interested in this world. I want to know more. About the island, about the world, about salt, about everything.\nThis game is my favourite "Souls" game right now, and probalby will be forever.\nI'm deeply in love with it, and i can not recommend it enough.\nGood work, Ska Studios.\np.s.

Any of them. I might get into it after this, though.\n\nThat said, it's nearly impossible to not see the similarities just from what I've heard and seen of the Souls series prior. You get to create your hero, select class & looks, and then you're thrown in head first into a fight you cannot win and die horribly.\nWith that out of the way, the game begins for real. In a nutshell this is a 2D platforming action game where you navigate dank labyrinths while slashing/crushing/burningg/stabbing the enemies in your path. Along the way there are plenty of treasure and secret areas, spread out in a metroidvania-like pattern where some are accessible right away, and others locked behind an ability barrier.\nThe island which the game plays out on is seperated into differently themed areas, all of which have 1-2 bosses guarding the exits to the next. Each area usually have more than one exit, and several shortcuts to the others, unlocking the paths to earlier areas as you explore, so the way you progress through the game can vary. If you find a particular boss too hard, there's nothing stopping you from turning back and trying another one in a different area instead.\n\nAll the while you're exploring the island you'll accumulate Salt, the games "experience currency". Salt is used for levelling up (via the Tree of Skill, a system a bit similar to the sphere grid of Final Fantasy 10), as well as weapon and armor upgrades. Gold will be dropped by enemies as well, and is used for buying new items, as well as being deducted as a penalty for dying.\n\nSpeaking of dying, you'll be doing a lot of it. The platforming the later stages of the game can be a bit messy, and the bosses throughout the game are very deadly indeed. Dying means that all your salt will be lost and a percentage of your cash as well. However, the salt is absorbed by the enemy that killed you and by returning there you have a chance to reclaim it by killing him in turn. Should you die again before that, however, the salt is gone for good. Bosses have a containment threshold in their HP bars which you need to wear them down past for them to release the salt they've stolen, which means that even if you lose a huge chunk to a hard boss you don't have to actually kill him to get it back, hurting him to about 1/3:rd HP is enough, and you can quickly warp back to safety with the goods.\n\nWhat will keep you playing this one is the allure of levelling up and growing more powerful, locating secret treasure, as well as finding new and more imposing bosses to conquer. The atmosphere of the game is a bit too oppressive sometimes, I feel, with the dark caves giving way to even more dark caves in the next area after that, even if some variety does exist (Dome of the Forgotten was great).\n\nLike in the Dark Souls series you will find player-made messages strewn about the island in the form of bottled letters. Most are helpful, some atmospheric, and others just try to mess with you. You can write your own using a set of pre-written words to try and warm your fellow players of impending damge, clues to help them, or directions to secrets.\nOr you can just trick them into jumping of a cliff.\nYeah, I fell for that. Pun not intended -.-\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game with visceral combat, RPG-elements and metroidvania-like exploration. You can use keyboard+mouse or a controller, whatever you prefer. Both are prefectly viable. I completed it with Kb+M without any control issues. The levels are well designed and the bosses hard, but all have weaknesses you can exploit (both elemental  and clearly telegraphed moves). With the exception of one of them, they're all imposing but fair (Curse you,  Disemboweled Husk! *raises fist*)\n\nIf you're into platformers and Action-RPGs, you definitely should check this one out.\n","June 6","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found the amount of bosses and their drastically different move sets forced me to change up how I played making the momment I beat them that much better. As I fought my way through the world several times I would find new paths and bosses leading to areas I hadn't even caught a glimpse of in my other playthroughs. Even the first boss which seems unbeatable could be beaten with enough skill, and I love how the game rewards you for beating all of its trials.
