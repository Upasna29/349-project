They are phenomenally strong.\n\nThere is no obvious or easy way to earn the real currency. Until this is changed, it doesn't matter how fun the game may be, I can't recommend it. I will change this review to reflect gameplay if these extremely unfair mechanics are changed.","December 11, 2015","false","21.0"," 287 of 317 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","287","317","11","13"

I'd love to see vehicle combat games make a comeback but this isn't the way to do it.  Consumables bought with gold, the premium currency, are literally twice as effective as anything a free player can get.  There is even premium ammo you can buy that gives you 50% more damage.","December 11, 2015","false","3.0"," 179 of 209 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","179","209","5","1"

Combat is decent, and the variety between the 4 classes of vehicles is okay.  Steering/driving is reasonably responsive while still having a good feeling of weight.  Weapons don't have quite the same feeling of impact or weight, unfortunately, and are fairly simple, but they work. Unfortunately with premium purchasable vehicles with higher stats and gold premium ammo that does higher damage, I simply cannot recommend the game.  The game itself is decent, and free, and worth taking a look at if you have a decent internet connection for the download, but the potential pay2win monetization means I cannot, will not, invest the time to explore deeper or recommend it.","December 11, 2015","false","1.0"," 118 of 148 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","118","148","3","2"

No it isn't, its some P2W russian World of Tanks parody. The models are loosely based on Russian Armoured Personnel Carriers, Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Rocket Artillery etc.\n\nIn general the game is terrible, UI sucks, crazy P2W,unbalanced matches, but apart of that what poked my eyes most were the name suggestions. When you type in a taken name it shows a set of suggestions and they're ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious, I'll toss in a few examples: when i typed ♥♥♥♥♥ they suggested me Holy_Hard_♥♥♥♥♥, when typed Gay they come up with Gay_Hunter, instead of Obama they recommended me Knicks_Murder_Obama, when i typed in Sex, they recommended me to choose Loud_Great_Sex, well sure why not? What was strangest of what I found is that suggested names sometimes get outright political undertone and often the kind which is not very popular in Russia, for example typing in Assad, they suggested me "Maniac_Assad_Murder". Could this be the beginning of the rise of AI?\n\nI've took a few snippets of these ridiculous naming suggestions for curious people:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FXax8bo.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1XbhPOA.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OTOMxJf.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bMNTdkJ.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ru6tKIy.png","December 14, 2015","false","1.5"," 58 of 75 people (77%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","77","58","75","30","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Indigir-/recommended/412470/","-Indigir-","Indigir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-Indigir-/","4 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n1. There is no fight balance. And it makes profit for developers - if you meet powerful enemies, you can always take gold items to win. It always works, so you get used to buy it, developers have you money, you have your victories - profit for everybody. So they not interested in working on balance.\n2. Players online is very low. People left this game, and situation become worse every day. In this pitiful situation players from clan GUARDS may be very noticeable. They always have everything gold that can be bought in the game. So you can ask - where they take it. Its simple. They are paid for their work for game. Helpers (green writing in chat) can earn for 20 000 to 60 000 gold coins, moderators (orange letters in chat) up to 100 000. And also all of them earn gold-shots for riding Couriers account - 10 000 gold shots per one battle. Do you donate enough to win the battle against them? Because without gold you cant win. May be you would meet them very rear if there is more people playing MWO.\n\nSometimes, ex-moderators try to sell their salary gold to players and get real money instead. They dont know where to spent it, so why not)))\n3. Early access is endless in MWO. And its also very profitable. Today we buy paints, vip accounts, gold items to level up one car, tomorrow developers can change characteristics of you car and it will become uncomfortable and weak in battle and you have to level up another car, that become stronger - so you will pay. But no one will return you money or your time - its early access, isnt it?) I felt like they stole from me. What changes are waiting players and wil it be for good or worse - no one can tell.\n5. We were promised that after Retribution it will be possible to play on any car because they will be balanced against each other. Its a lie. Take for example intelligence vehicles (its really bad synonym they choose, even I with my poor English can understand it) - you can comfortably play and win only on 2 or 3 cars, others you dont even need to level up and they gather dust in the garage. Because their specification were modified to be weak. And this concern to engineers and other. Cars havent been balanced, you should use only very small number of them to win.\n5. The only thing that really well-considered is system of punishments and rules , I have strong feeling that on punishments all the creative resources were spend. However, you can break almost all of them, because top of the administration does not play their game (why do they need this ♥♥♥♥ ), admins are detached from the players , and those moderators who play cover most of disorders , if they ban honestly, a month later there will be no one to play with.\nSo you can break rules until you own comrades kindly inform admins about it. Moreover, one can fool the system and earn many thousands of gold coins using referral accounts and then start working as moderator, ye they have one of that sort.\nI was banned first time for giving my account to my friend (yes rules are very strict about lending account to friends, so read them carefully), but you can always have it back if you give information about your friends who also break rules and then they will be banned, you will have you account back - fair and square. My second ban was for this published opinion about MWO. It all reminds me Stalin, dont know why)))\n6. Developers dont play their own game any more. Some years early they played and it was another game and online was much higher. And at least they knew what should be fixed and what should be postponed.\n\n7. Today I think that the game in this statement and with all problems including gold flows from Guards, does not worth to donate in. Being short-sighted I donate a lot and now can advise not to repeat my mistakes.","March 12","false","3.8"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","43","54","3","0"

Sorry but this game reminds me of APB Reloaded without the cheats, meaning unless you have premium for faster money+xp, you will be grinding forever until you're old and dead lol.\n\nBottom line: Bascially without premium game is pointless to play.

Simple this game should have never been Greenlighted for the simple fact If you are givin a ban half the time you dont know what its for as its in damn Russian. Dont expect any help figuring out items ingame as the websites in fricking Russian. Dont thing your going to get any help in chat as the mods are too busy dealing with 10 year old brats to be able to give you the time of day. I have been asking for 4 days where these Dual Pod Artillery guns are coming from, they arent in the store but while you get 1 shot from your gun these things rain down like 8 shells on you. the start panel that gives news hasnt been updated in months and I could go on for and hour about other things.

Even with premium you level at a snails pace. Were talking hours to reach level 3. This is with VIP so without it is way way worse.\n\nArtillary gameplay is awful overall compared to WOT and feels like your barely participating etc.. Engineering amounts to get rushed down by any vehicle in the game and hope your teammates kill them. The tech tree is non existant. Basically it's click improve on some parts and swap guns if yours has any. Also improvements go to 40+ for basically any component in the entire game.\n\nNow for the next big issue is matchmaking. So, a newer game released with MM that sticks completely wrong tiers vs each other. Also matches take ages so you get to feel entire stomps for long periods. We had a match where I was a T1 engineer with 3+ T1 scouts and T1 tanks vs things up to tier 3 and no T1's on the entire enemy team.\n\nBasically skip this.

Not only won, but came in first out my team mates. Upon further inspection I realize my success was due to OP paint job.. yea.. a paint job. Apparently paint jobs or more than just for looks.  Looking at the store as well shows the game is super heavy pay to win. Such a beautiful young game, but that just muddied its waters and im not gonna fish in it. The strongest heavy tank you can freely obtain in the game has an armor base of 7500, but if you purchase their premium heavy tank it has 15,000 armor points! That's absurd. As fun as my one match was, I would not touch this again. Pay to win is a bad game market to delve into.

Also, need a mechanism to balance a battle where a team member just simply never plays tyhat round...  You had 4 members against 4... but one of them never started on your team... so you are down one... AND their empty vehicle keeps respawning to become a victim... Either a way to replace that person... OR.... at the very least stop them from respawaning...

Here, they try and mix it up... that CAN be good with a proper balance ( and hopefully, likewise balance play styles)  Example:\n\nTeam one\nstormtank  Level 50\nengineer    Level 15\nArtillary     Level 20\nScout         Level  5\n\nTeam Two\nstormtank  Level 50\nengineer    Level 15\nArtillary     Level 20\nScout         Level  5\n\n\nHowever, this is not what I see mostly.. Worst example: I was brought into a battle the other day against a 5 member Clan with mostly level 50's agains a mismatch of players with much lower Levels....\n\nMight as well have been unarmed civilians against the Mechanized Warbots\n--------------\nPlayable teams/Battles??"? YES... on occasion...\n\nRecommend more DEV work on balancing or gaining more players to balance with...    AND.... some more maps.\n\nWith that work... BALANCING at min, I would bump it up to 7.5....  more maps and such I could riase it a little more..\n\nNot sure it could ever be a 10.. but it could be a sweet 8.5 casual PVP game.\n","February 14","false","158.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

I have to say I like it, it plays like a cheaper World of Tanks but it looks scifi. For the layperson the game works by having you queue up into matchmaking as one of a large variety of vehicles in out of 4 classes, scouts (light vehicles) "stromtanks" (tanks), engineers, and artillery vehicles. after selecting your vehicle and gear (smoke screen, scanner, nitrous, etc.) you are dropped into a game. There are a few different game modes, you have modes where you capture points and turrets, capture the flag, and team deathmatch type modes. Concerning the maps, there are a good deal of them, just under 20 at last count. The higher level you get, the more maps you unlock to play, at least from what I can tell.\n\n\nReally I would recommend Metal War Online: Retribution to anyone looking for a fun free to play vehicle based shooter, or to anyone looking for something to substitute there World of Tanks cravings without actually playing World of Tanks.\n","December 13, 2015","true","5.0"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","1"

The developers can take a while to make the changes needed, but overall they do well. Still highly reccomend for those out there that enjoy a slower paced, skill based tank based shooter game.\n\nI am Russ_B0llocks, and I approve of this game. MWO: R is the real deal. Don't get tricked into the liquid MWO, which is a scam made by some canadians who don't even know how to make an animated garage, and charge 80 dollars for its content packs.\n\nMWO: R is one of those games that you can literally just breeze into. A mere handful of minutes is more than enough to attain the skill needed to get 2x double kills and getting away with murder.","December 16, 2015","true","1.0"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","37","7","19","3","1"

You have to stick with your team which is nice and you cant just drive out on your own or you could easily get destroyed.\n\nThe four car classes each take a useful role, like the scouts for well, scouting, the engineers for healing and freezing enemies in place, the stromtanks or whatever theyre called for taking a lot of damage and soaking it in for the rest of your team nearby... but it has very high damage and health. and the artillery which i dont know what to say about yet, but it can pretty much hit you from anywhere if you're spotted with a huge splash that does quite a bit of damage.\n\nSo far i like it, but it could be better.\n\n\n\n","December 12, 2015","true","6.9"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","1"
