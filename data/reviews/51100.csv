This does seem like a good way to make a comeback but Tactical Intervention suffers some major drawbacks.\n\nThe game itself seems just like a standard multiplayer FPS. You get a gun wich you then run around and shoot people in the head with and eventually get shot in the head yourself. Seems fairly simple right? But the game got these nice little small details wich varies from using a fire extinguisher to put up a smoke wall to being able to roll away from explosions and thereby prevent taking damage. This is according to myself the only positive point of the entire game.\n\nThe gameplay is also one of the worst of modern day FPS games. It's not that it's bad but it's just nothing special.\nAnd don't get me started on the animations. Everyone looks like crabs when they walk around!\nAnd with just around 500 ppl in game at the time this is written? The game has been out for less than a year and the community is alredy dying out.\n\nAs a F2P title the game functions as a good example of a Pay 2 Win game (P2W). This means that the people who pay for stuff in the game (be it a more powerful weapon or even dogs) can totally dominate the people who don't. So someone who is far more skilled may get totally rolled over by someone far less skilled just because the far lessed skilled guy has put more money on the table.\n\nPROS\n+ Good ideas that later FPS games may improve\n+ Better than COD\n+ So bad it's funny if you're in the right mood\n\nCONS\n- P2W\n- Laughable animations\n- The community is barely alive\n\nOVERALL SCORE 32/100","April 21, 2014","false","20.7"," 764 of 953 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","764","953","2","25"

It's not good... but it ain't bad either. It DOES have some potential to be a good game, but... it's not going that way... much.\n\nAnd it's not tactical at all, it's a free-to-play "Counter-Strike" ... "styled" ... game... ? It's not a slow game, it's the opposite actually - it's a bit fast, but not CoD fast or Quake fast.\n\nRight off the bat I'll say that the shooting is really weird, it's jerky and awkward to get used to. The network part of the game is horrendously bad, and there's some optimisation issues (it's Source engine for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, how can you mess up that?)\n\nBut it's still VERY ♥♥♥♥ING FUN\nThe best mode in the entire game must be the VIP Car Escort, which is a car chase on a few maps (so far 3 exist), which are pretty big, and you just have to drive forward.\nDriving isn't as simple as it sounds, the handling is unlike any other game with cars. It's a bit hard to learn but it comes fast.\nSo while you drive, you occassionally stumble upon green boxes, which can heal you, your passengers, repair your ride a bit (dunno about that one actually) and have a surprise weapon like a grenade launcher or RPG which is a round changer most of the time.\n\nIt's unfriendly to new people, because there's a bunch of menu options and sections where you just get confused how everything works, and most of the mechanics are explained through VERY simple tips during the loading screen. The best way to learn is in practice.\n\n\nGet a friend or two or a pack of them, grab some alcohol (optional), go with your friends on one team and play the game. It can be enjoyable.\n\ntl;dr:\n+- weird shooting, can ♥♥♥♥ you off\n+- weird driving, makes you laugh sometimes\n+ car chase best mode\n- borderline if not crossing the pay2win line\n- unbalanced weaponry\n--- heavy armor ffs nerf that ♥♥♥♥\n++ awkwardly fun with friends\n+++ gore\n- network stuff","November 22, 2014","true","47.9"," 388 of 474 people (82%) found this review helpful 96 people found this review funny","82","388","474","96","17"

Just got me downtrodden.\n\nI didnt quite enjoy the game. I would prefer counter strike more than this. Sure the running, the rappeling, the riding on vehicles are fun, but hell was it buggy. (Did I mention that the driving physics will wish you never took a seat in the game because you know teams will kick you out for it?). Plus the aiming was preposterous.\n\nThe game was like an upgrade of the oldest CS, but lazily done and gave up on..\nThe maps were good and the controls were nice. But the gameplay just makes it seem bad. Guns are ridiculously expensive and having them expire is even more so. I wouldn't even dare buy one gun which I can permantly have for how much it is.\n\nNot a suggested game for players with bad internet.","February 19, 2015","false","1.7"," 196 of 239 people (82%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","82","196","239","37","0"

It has this Counter-Strike feel to it, which i love, such as: No ADS (Aim Down Sights), Recoil and more. I like it because im a huge fan of the Counter-Strike series and just VALVe games in general, theyre genius.\n\nI like the ideas they have put into this game like the gamemode where you can drive a car. The game doesnt have amazing graphics, but i dont expect more from a F2P FPS (Free to Play - First Person Shooter) game really.\n\nThe first time i played it, it was quite confusing, but it didnt take long before i had a ton of fun in it.\nA thing i also like about this game is thats its not Pay2Win, even though you can use real money to get kind of better weapons, it doesnt ruin the game at all. I, myself, use the P90, and ive bought it for lifetime for in-game money, and it works perfectly fine against AK's and M4's even, its pretty well balanced.\n\nAll in all i think id rate it a 8/10. <- Open beta rating.\n*I will now change this to a 9/10 because of full release.*\n\nEnd thoughts:\nThe gamemode with the cars could use some polishing, it can be quite glitchy driving into each other and stuff, but im not sure if it can get fixed, its still fun though.\n\n*This has been more polished now and works better.*\n\nThe recoil when you spray could be a lot better, because it seems like you deal 0% damage if you spray, even when it says i hit the enemy when i spray, i dont get assist if somebody else kills him. Even though you dont spray in a game like this, it still needs to get improved. If you think the recoil is bad and the game is hard, its just because you need to train, its like Counter-Strike, you need to double-tap instead of spraying.\n\n*The spraying and dealing no damage thing seems to have been improved, but its still there in som cases, be aware of this.*\n\nBut well, awesome game in my opinion, give it a try and if you dont like it after the first 5 minutes, play some more, it will get better. But if it doesnt, i guess its not the game for you. Its F2P (Free to Play) and you dont have to use actual money to play it. Its also made in the Source Engine, which is my favourite engine, love it.\nNice game, highly recommended.","September 2, 2013","true","10.2"," 324 of 422 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","324","422","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/faith198/recommended/51100/","faith198","Faith4Dead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/faith198/","56 products in account","The game is okay in some sense, the only trouble i have with it is that it is not super obvious which servers have high level OP players and others that have low level players.\n\nIt can ruin your experiance if you join a game and the enemy team has like possibly 3 players in lvl 30 and they do all the killing whilst the low levels on that team just dmg you and then the OP ones finish you off or they kill you solo, as they are wearing bulletproof helmets and body armor that well protects them too well, the starter weapons are alright but the best thing to do first is buy one guy permanantly and possibly a new pistol, i went with the MP5 the pistol though i forgot the name, game is slightly easy to learn but hard it CAN be tactical if you well work with a friend and crouch walk silencing your footsteps and leaning around corners before entering an area, the only major downside is if the map is close quarters expect A LOT of shotgunners, as they will and always will 1 shot you no matter what so if you hear footsteps (if you are deaf or not) then be sure to fire first as if someone sprints or opens fire they will appear as a red dot on your circle like radar, very handy though as it will well...be your "wallhack" you could say so whenever someone sprints towards your direction you can snap at the location of the dot and be instantly ready since everyone in this game sprints like a mad man on drugs.\n\nThe thing i dislike the most about this game is that the starter weapons are not that useful against someone who has all the gear already by buying items, like the m1 is terrible and it's best to stick with the skorpion the shotgun is alright but sometimes it's bad in all ways, i majorly dislike the default starter sniper as well it's too shakey i assume the sniper everyone uses the ASO or whatever has no breathing on it and it's 100% steady all the time as the sniper will 1 shot you like the AWP in Counter Strike, it's very hard to get used to the recoil sometimes so when playing TDM and you join quickly in the warm up, try out the recoil BEFORE you get into a fight so you know how many shots you can fire before going sky high with recoil.\n\nThe propane tanks and such in this game are slightly useful as the fire extinguisher will be a free and easy smoke screen and flashbang somewhat, so if you assume enemy is around corner you can make your own smoke screen cover then if he runs through it you can "flashbang" him with the smoke, it's also useful if you shoot it near an enemy whom has not used their fire extinguisher to i assume kill them or blind them, the propane tanks though i dislike slightly as all they do is spin around and damage you slightly and knock you back, i assumed they would blow up after a certain time limit but that's up to those gas cans which i assume you cannot move at all and can only kick.\n\nThe hostages in this game are a pain though as when playing the hostage capture mode on round 1, you have to capture all hostages or save them to win or just kill the enemy team which everyone does, losing EXP for killing a civi is however dumb though as in the car chase modes it will happen often due to it being hard to drive somewhat, i also dislike how it's hard to keep track of hostages since they can wander away and the T's are on a limited playing field while CT's however can roam around freely, if this was CS everyone can move around freely and not be restricted, i would like however if you could see the sharpshooters that will kill you if you try to leave the area, then if you kill them you can roam around freely.\n\nI however dislike the killstreak items as it will be impossible to get the m249 or rpg even the grenade launcher, all a rushing player could get is a flashbang and tear gas before he/she dies, yet tactical players will be able to get almost everything in the special rewards area, the kill streaks however would be useful on a FFA not a TDM, TDM is very very annoying since you could join servers where is up to rank 9 or lower and a rank 3 or 6 could have good gear since they bought it and it will be slightly unfair, i would like though that if a player has body armour they could have some what of a unique model or something.\n\nThe problem this game has is that you possibly "gain" accuracy if you stay with allies yet everyone rushes and stays away from each other like this is CS, yet it is not and is a much harder or easier version of CS so they only survive for about a second or two, though the accuracy gain is not super visible i assume that the 3 little bars on your crosshair mean your accuracy gain, so it must mean that it gets majorly worse as you stick with allies or something since it feels like that, i must say though if it is a gain then it should be gained by 5% so if you and a friend stay close you gain 5% accuracy boost, the larger the squad the better which will greatly help let's say a sniper or a player with an LMG.\n\nThe rolling in this game is sort of useful if you are crouching when facing an enemy and roll away or back, i assume they think you are dead and stop firing for a second or they miss all their shots due to bad connection or something, it can be useful if you use it right, never attempt to sprint away when getting shot as it means wasting stamina and insta death, it is much faster and easier to roll, though you will not see it happen very often in this game since everyone sprints, dies, see's nade sprints away instead of rolling since it reduces damage taken.\n\nBlind fire however is not useful at all since if the weapon viewmodel is aiming at let's say the table that you are hiding behind you wont shoot over it and will hit the table instead, this feature however gets unused A LOT.\n\nThe voice commands in this game are not very...useful the reason is because they are all icons, for taking fire it's a man on fire which does not make sense at all, if this was CS:GO or CSS you would have much more voice commands and more options to command the team, in this game you can only say, medic, follow, roger, you lead, under fire, cover me and that's it. not very useful if you dislike typing to command a team, i also must say i dislike how the characters don't have unique voices like CT's should have a serious swat voiced person whilst T's have a somewhat i assume inexperienced terrorist voice or trained terrorist, something along those lines as the voice lines are always the same guy on either team.\n\nThe auto voice command whenever a player is low on hp is very stupid and bad, i assume only allies can hear it but it would be better if it was more of a cry for help rather than a low quiet voice of "patch me up" "I need a medic" would make the game more realistic in some way if EVERYONE could hear it though, so if an enemy player is low on HP next to an ally he would attempt to whisper for a medic next to him but under fire he would scream at the top of his lungs for a medic, so they could hear him over the gun fire and same with the players attacking the enemy.\n\nThe grenades and weapons in this game do need to be improved, i would like if i could DROP my weapon for the enemy weapon on all modes of gameplay which could allow a player to try out let's say a M4 shotgun or something, the grenades though need a fix on them though as flashbangs will blind you no matter what, i threw a flashbang down a hallway and looked away yet to still only be blinded by it, also the tear gas is very useful and unuseful, sometimes the smoke for it will bug out and not show how big the AOF is so you will wander into it without knowing, the fire nade however is too OP if you use it right, as if someone wanders into the fire for a second to back away quickly they will die too fast, it would be better if it did slow damage on the player if they were out of the fire yet crazy damage whilst in the fire, also the character models in this game are okay but it would be better if you could pick between 3 models when you start off.","April 12, 2015","true","11.7"," 96 of 134 people (72%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","72","96","134","22","0"

While not being tactical in any way, it does live up to its name; being an intervention. While many people are on a high from Counter Strike, and CS:GO, T.I. seems like a very possible alternative to dive into. However, even with its decent map design and solid mission modes; T.I. fails in many regards. Keep in mind, this is a free game.\n\nGame Play synopsis -\n\n- pay to win does not always win. I found that after a couple hours playing, years back, i could stand my own with an M4 and buying light armor with the in-game points. *Save your GP*\n\n- Shotguns = the noob cannon. I find the best way to deal with these players, is to just stay away. There is always some off chance that a stray bullet with decide to fly across the map and nail you with a headshot. However, the gore and carnage that is left in their path is quite enjoyable to watch.\n\n- invest in a decent pair of boots. Speed is key, and with no universal speed, the ones who can run are the ones who can survive.\n\n- camping is possible but hard to pull off. The feature to spot where your attacker killed you from is a great advantage. *it takes certain skill to defend a corner*\n\n- Spawn time is 10 seconds. Longer than most games, such as C.S. and the instant respawn in a deathmatch.\n\n- The damage stats are garbage. You’ll see damage carry over from previous kills. Upwards of 200, 300, etc. In many cases, 150 damage could be beaten by 140. The number of shots again follows this logic…..oh wait, there is no logic because it makes NO SENSE!\n\n- This game is all about how well you can tolerate those annoying players who live in the middle of nowhere with a ping of +600 and can kill you instantly because they are clipping harder than the Microsoft Word Helper in a paperclip factory.\n\n- You’ll be bombarded by rage quitters, “you’re a 10 yr old boy!” comments, loud music being blasted over the voice chat, and also, the always appreciated, “?how do to change class” stupid questions.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral Review:\n- Good game\n- Its FREE\n- Minimal disk space required\n- Minimal hardware specs to run at a decent frame rate.\n- Not for those who easily rage\n- Slightly cartoonish graphics\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRage Scale-O-Meter:\n6/10\n\nQuality:\n6.5/10\n\nSupport:\n5/10\n\nOverall:\n6.6/10\n\n**Remember, it’s a FREE game!!**\n","March 20, 2015","true","449.0"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","49","60","10","3"

The aim is to either beat the other team in a race-off or shoot them in their cars if you like winning dirty. There is alot of weapon choices and each have their advantages and disadvantages. For example, you can't shoot an assault rifle or shotgun while driving, but you can shoot an SMG while driving. The three tracks are called Monaco, Highway and Innercity. Monaco is a nightly city, Highway is a highway and Innercity is the heart of a city. This action-packed racing game also has powerups, so you can collect special weapons like rocket launchers and grenade launchers on your way to the finish line. This game is great to play with friends, but also is fun with strangers to play. And it's free, you couldn't ask for more, other than more tracks.\n8/10","September 5, 2013","true","37.4"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","38","49","0","1"

Sure its got glitches here and there, but in the end who really cares? Where else can you drive around blasting each other on your way to hand off or intercept a package?\n\nSo the graphics aren't as slick as COD, but you know what? The game play is a million times better. If you only play games for the most up to date cpu intensive graphics, then go away.\n\nMany decry "pay to win". The game works by accepting cash, or in game points to get better equipment or weapons. You start the game with 50K game points, enough to rent out some serious kit, or permanently buy a decent weapon and some extra equipment. You get more GP by doing well in the game. You can get all the equipment you need by playing for a while and saving up points. The only folks who complain are those who want instant gratification. I got everyhting I ever needed not spending a penny, but have supported the developers by buying some DLC items now and then. Believe me, there are folks who spend a bundle on the best weapons, and they aren't winning.\n\nMaybe there are beter games out there for deathmatch, but thats not what makes this game shine. It's the mission mode folks, where you and your team must complete missions, or thwart others from completing their misions. Team play is encouraged, by requiring members to heal each other rather thrn thmselves. And sticking in a group is a force multiplier by increasing the teams accuracy.\n\nDon't listen to the whiners, read a guide and get in the game. Don't be a tool, help your team and behave likea human. If you get pwned a bunch early on, so what? You gonna rage quit because someone shot you in a FPS game?

The gameplay and controls are so damn clunky and the weapon models are like basic gamebanana skin models. The weapons recoil are absolutely ridiculous. When shooting at an enemy it's pretty much trial and error on whether you get to get the kill or get killed so accuracy is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. I wouldn't call this a tactical game as it still seems like the whole run and gun ♥♥♥♥. The worst thing that does make the game terribad are the connectivity issues. Earlier when I first played this I had no issues until later on this evening when I've been losing connection to host every 4, 5, 6, 7 times in a row. I'm not sure whether it has to do witht he host rage quitting or just terrible TI servers. If it really is lobby hosts rage quitting causing the connection to be lose then thats some terrible lobby development there. While the game has a lot of negatives in it, the game does feel a bit entertaining sometimes. There are a few fun and silly game modes that you can really enjoy. Once you get use to the gameplay you'll get better and better at it, but the game can be too boring if you're that good.\n\nI sorta half-♥♥♥♥♥ this one, but if you want a real tactical arcade challenge then play Counter-Strike. If you want a real Tactical Shooter then play Rainbow Six 3, Ghost Recon, Insurgency, or SWAT 4. Give this a go if you like, but I wouldn't recommend this game.

And you can hate it.\nI hate it. Don't ask "Why, why?!" Because I'm explaining everything. The game mechanics and the actual gameplay isn't that bad, there is blind firing, human shields, rolling, and upgrades and in game money. And levels.\n\nThe game characters are ugly, it looks like they took max payne from 2000 and just retextured it. Seriously, this is 2013 and the Game Developers aren't even trying. And it was made by the co creator of CSS! Oh well. The weapon and level system isn't that bad, except the guns they give you at the starting suck incredibly, and when you buy a better weapon, you can only most of the time only afford to keep it for a week (Ahem, 7 days). The gamemodes are terrible, well, most of them anyway. Two of them are from CS, CSS, and CS:GO, Hostage Rescue, and Plant and Defuse, which is elimination mode most of the time, then there is objective mode which is the hardest and probably the funest, there is three maps, one is hostage rescue, another has a car driving map, and another where you just break in buildings and walk on walls.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe game is not bad, and I would say you give it a try.\nUnless you hate terrible graphics, say goodbye.","January 26, 2014","false","2.9"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","28","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlowahMellie/recommended/51100/","FlowahMellie","MeLos❤M","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlowahMellie/","63 products in account","After saying this about the game :\nIts a great game. with good character models and the maps are very nice to play and have a good looking texture.for this game u need a better PC than you need for CS:GO because this game ask more of the PC and videocard than CS:GO does. but in this game u get more stuff than in CS:GO u can make her ur own inventory and choose the character that u want. this isnt possible in CS:GO. but CS:GO dont have lagg for me, but this game does cuz of the 25-30 FPS i get. (because i have a crap PC with a normal PC you dont have lagg) The Character models and weapons are very good looking. especially the Character models compared to CS:GO are way better. also the stock weapons look better than in CS:GO\n\n+ points : Good Character Models, Nice Maps, Nice Weapons. Good Skins.\n- points : asks a lot of the PC, My PC get fast hot. (but i have crap pc). and a bit lagg for me cuz of my pc\n\nis my mind changed after the last update (27 July) and am i retired of this game..\n\nTo start with why i have quitted :\n\nA.  This game has tons of lagg at least tons of people that lagg. because the : Russian, Asian, Arabian and also European people are joining the USA Servers,  for some European people is the ping or lagg okay in USA (100-140 ping) but with ping above that. stop playing in USA ♥♥♥♥tards.  go back to the server of your own world piece like (Africa, Asian, Ocean, some European and RUSSIAN)\n\nB.  before the update on 25th April was this game perfect. the HItmarks were great. the lagg was less. and a lot better Frames Per Second. so to go on after the update on 25th April my game was ♥♥♥♥ed up. learnt the game again and the hitmarks were good to do again... but the update on 27th July (last update) actually destroyed this game for real.  The HItmarks are sucking, the FPS is a lot less and the lagg gets more and more. I prefer and some other guys to get the game back before the big update in April.\n\nC. The Players.  BEFORE the big update in April had this game sometimes over 400+ players. but atleast 300+ .  then after the update somewhere in the middle this game became having : 200-250 maximum.  now after the update in July this game just have 140-180 maximum.  means the devs ruin this game with the updates that makes this game less good (like : giving less FPS. getting more lagg, and ruin the hitmarks) or the game is just this boring...\n\nD.  since this game just have 140-180 people maximum playing at the same time are there less clans active. the only (big) clans that are a bit active to keep this game active are : aQ, MVP, some Gamer Junkies, Machete and some of the Expanse.  all other clans retired of lost to many players to call it a clan like : ||R.E.D||, RPZX, DaC, DOD, GODz, RSF, PATI, DIY, myP. T.S.F and myP. Lan-b,  Hellas, EsP, QB,  Kriptex (felt apart, some members retired but some merched with Shini, KWA and are now Machete) sorry if i forgot any clan that also retired.  then also players like : linimicus, Tornado and Luda retired. means this game gets less and less players. we have to get the players back with restoring the lagg, repair the FPS and the big deal : fix this hitmarks again.\n\nIT WAS A GOOD GAME BEFORE THE UPDATE ON 25th APRIL. SO FIX THIS GAME BACK TO THEN. AND SOME PLAYERS PROBABLY WILL BE BACK ON.. IF THIS DON'T GET CHANGED THEN I WILL SAY : THANKS DEVS FOR RUINING THIS GAME.\n\nFOR NOW I HAD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. BUT WHEN THEY CHANGE THE GAME BACK TO BEFORE APRIL I HAD RECOMMEND THIS GAME.","July 8, 2014","true","886.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","18"

The playerbase basically consists of little prebubescent kids screaming "LOL IM RANDOM ARENT I FUNNY FOR THAT LOL" "KOOLAID I LIKE LEMONADE" "WOW LOL GG HASHTAGS" [literal quotes im not even joking]. The modeling for the maps and playermodels are blocky and have an extremely outdated feel to it [like op said]. Graphics, obviously, are not the aspect that truly make a game a well made one [for example: n64/sega genesis games like Goldeneye 007, Ocarina Of Time, Toejam And Earl (which I think im the only one here that remembers it), Sonic, etc]. I was gonna list some PS2 games, but a majority of titles for that console have had in the past, and even today, decent graphics. To bring Tactical Intervention onto that topic: Even if you were to upgrade the game in every single visually appealing way, the gamemodes would still suck major ♥♥♥♥. The most time I spent on a gamemode was Team Deathmatch, the total amount of time being about 20 minutes, until I got way too bored. Tactical Intervention gives me a feeling that it was put on Steam for free as a desperate attempt to revive itself, much like WolfTeam did with Aeria Games. To explain: WolfTeam was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing to me and most people back then. Me and my friends would go on it and glitch through the maps and get kills to get other guys to rage, and even just playing the game vanilla style was pretty damn fun. Well, a few years later, and now it's a sellout with practically abandoned servers and a ton of moneygrabbing tactics to feed the develepors inflating money-grabbing corrupted egos. Looking back on it, the whole WolfTeam getup was good for when it was released, but hell no would it achieve greatness ever again. It's the same concept with this online game: Tactical Intervention was probably, like, the best thing ever when it was in its earlier days. Now all it has left is Steam to back it up to hopefully bring some of the glory back the cheapest way possible. Anyways, to finish off, Tactical Intervention is a game that is ♥♥♥♥ed up in all corners, bringing a ♥♥♥♥ton of errors along with it.\n\n*bows* That is all.","November 28, 2013","false","0.7"," 97 of 172 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","97","172","0","15"

The game requires a lot of participation and time (or money) to become good enough to compete with regular players. One of the best parts of this game is the community. It requires effort and patience to become a meaningful part of that community, but once you know how to play the game and know your teammates, it's just plain FUN!\n\nOriginal review: "I wish I could recommend this game, but unfortunately the Devs have neglected the most important part of it: Anti-cheat.\nIn a pay to win game like this, you can't allow hacking or cheating of any type. Omega has consistently failed to address this issue. For years. I love this game, but I wouldn't recommend it to any new players."\n\nAddendum:\nI wrote this review late at night when I was crabby after running into a couple speed "hacks" (ping discrepency?) and I failed to mention any of the things that I love about this game. Thank you for Bilbur and Plat for checking me on that.\nI'm leaving the original review, partly to explain and partly to encourage me not to write a review like this again.\n\nI don't have evidence for my complaint about cheating, just my game-play experience. It's unfair of me to call out Omega for this one issue when he has been working to improve the game and release content since I first started playing. There are a few issues (such as the water lag in Office and the positioning of hit boxes) that have persisted through several updates. It seems to me that Omega and Fix Games have prioritized new content over these other issues. I would say that the new content improves the game and adds strategic depth, but these issues still need to be addressed.\n\nI DO love this game and play a lot, and I do not plan to stop playing it or to stop supporting the game financially.\nI want VAC because I think the community suffers without it. Because I'm an established player with gear and the experience to use it, I can usually hold my own against any opponent, even one using injectors or other exploits. It's hard enough to play against experienced players as a newb without adding the frustration of dealing with cheaters and trolls/griefers.\n\nIf you do put the time and effort in, this game is very rewarding. I love the community and the game is just FUN once you learn it. If you are not willing to learn to play and meet the other players, don't bother.","July 11, 2014","true","430.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HOTSHEEPattrition/recommended/51100/","HOTSHEEPattrition","[HOTSHEEP]attrition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HOTSHEEPattrition/","75 products in account","Being closely involved with CS since it's inception,  when I heard that Gooseman had created a new game I was very interested.  This game has a feel of the original CS.  Unfortunately, this game becomes very lopsided in a hurry as equipment and perks are acquired by higher skill level players making them impossible to beat by players on entry levels.  The micro payment system is also difficult to endure, as well as the long delay between maps.  As well, there are too many items that must be purchased with real money and cannot be earned by game points.  I am referring to tactic altering weapons and accessories including supressors, red dot sights, custom skins, and armor - all of which are available if you're willing to spend $7 to $12  per item and for only a limited 30 days use (for all cool items except for skin cheats which only need be purchased once).\n\nWhat disappointed me quite a bit is the artistic license the devs decided to take with weapons whose character and standard configurations are sacred in the gaming community.  Everyone knows, for example, that the Steyr Aug's receiver casting includes an integrated 1.5x telescopic sight housing fitted for lenses made by Swarovski Optik.  We pretty much all know that the Aug sight contains a simple black ring reticle with a basic rangefinder.  Curiously, the developers of TI decided to remove the integrated 1.5x sight on the only Steyr Aug that you can acquire in-game on a permanent basis.  The REAL Aug equipped with the standard fixed optical sight can only be acquired when  on a temporary basis when playing TI, and this can only be achieved via a micro transaction of real cash - and you will have to buy said Aug as an item in a  weapons crate  containing a bunch of accessories you don't really need or want - tough ♥♥♥♥ - but don't worry about acquiring too much clutter in your arsenal cause all items you get in your crate somehow vanish after 30 days.  That's 30 calendar days, not 30 playing days.\n\nMakes me wonder why the developers didn't also program the cars to  transform into pumpkins  at precisely midnight, may as well have the VIP turn into Cindarella holding a mop bucket too.  Which midnight? Good question.  It's midnight once an hour somewhere on the planet.  Insideously,  armor cannot be permanently purchased ever.    What makes me start violently gnashing my teeth is when I am reminded once again --> the items which can only be permanently acquired via micro transaction of real cash are essentially game changing legal cheats.\n\nYes, I said it, cheats, which I loosely define as advantages that are not available to all players - unless they have cash they are willing or able to hand over via the micro payment system.  Thes advantages these items purchase give players an immediate decided boost, tilting the playing field dramatically.  I can hear many of you now, tsk tsk tsking me, come on now Attrition, do you REALLY want to call these guys out and accuse them of haxoring - they are after all, performing within the framework set up by the developers after all....come on now, I can't imagine it, please, Attrition, describe these cheats of which you speak.\n\nOkay.  I'll touch on one (or two) -  Here's a no brainer: the alternate terrorist skins available for purchase only cause a terrorist appear almost identical to a CT.  Can you look me in the eye and tell me it's cool by you if you're playing as a CT and another CT appears on your screen, when you ignore them since they look like your own team mates and derp derp!! Dead.  You just got PWND. You must be a noob cause you got killed by the guy you mistook for a CT, in a skin that cannot be obtained by game points, only with cash - and once purchased remains in inventory forever.\n\nHow about a weapon cheat - you may not call it one but essentially it is when using the Super V SMG.  IRL, Kriss Corporation currently has only built the Vector Super V chambered in .45 ACP with a 5.5" long barrel as the only length availabe in the automatic version.  Kriss says the effective range of this weapon is 45 yards, and even at that distance you're looking at a 37" bullet drop.  In Ti, this SMG is more powerful at distances greater than you can accurately damage using the M4 or AK chambered at 5.56mm and 7.65 x 30 respectively.  The Super V feels as if it's about twice as powerful than the MP7 - and at close range that's understandable, provided the target is NOT wearing body armor.  However, in TI the MP7 doesn't penetrate body armor like the Super V does which makes absolutely no sense.  Basically there's no reason to buy any other gun than the Super V - and most likely one of the TI assbeef devs has a personal copy of the civilian model of the Kriss at home (available for only $599 in usa) where he keeps it in his closet, but at night he comes out of the closet with the proof of his virility and manhood, and  enjoys holding his own SUPER V in front of the full length mirror in his parents basement (where he lives) threateningly posed while admiring himself in the mirror while wearing only underpants and mirrored sunglasses.  Gotta be the reason it's so over powered. Gotta be.\n\nThe Deathmatch I don't like at all, it's good for the mentally challenged who cannot put together two brain cells long enough to consider such a thing as team work...but at least the spawn points were well thought out.  In deathmatch the server "admin" gets to limit weapons selection - so you may be forced to play with only pistols for instance.\n\n--->WHO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO NOT ALLOW THIS FEATURE IN MISSION MODE?!?!?!  I OUGHTA SLAP YOU WITH A TROUT!!!! <---\n\nIf  Mihn Le had been actually involved developing this game he'd have certainly pushed for a single one time purchase and let players earn perks that don't give them such huge advantages over other players, and he would have understood that the chat window should be easier to read must  stay open longer.  Mihn would have realized immediately how important community involvement is for the success and longevity of any multiplayer game, and this game would more interesting and attract more people for a longer time.  As it is there is zero community involvement because the Server binaries are not released to the public which means you're never going to run your own TI server where you'll be able to kick and ban the punks - an absolute requirement in multi-player online gaming enjoyment.  This also means that the degree of aimbotters and wallhackers has increased dramatically.  And why wouldn't it?  There's no VAC guard, as weak as that is, and no admins to kick punks from servers where they rack up scores of 44 and 0 AS A LEVEL 1 experience player.  WTF?  Really?\n\nLast, the most egregious crap  in this game is the way teams become stacked all the timeand it's silly.  On just about every single room you'll notice one team has three players who have experience over level 25 with a few level 9 or 10 sergeants mixed in....and they're be playing against a team of all level 1 and 2 players who are just getting the hang of the game.  These poor new players get their asses handed to them round after round.  Don't you think you'd get sick of it?  Of course you would - and that, in a nutshell, is the reason TI is never going to be a popular game, never going to have a following greater than it currently does, and will never earn it's dev's a dime after all is said and done.  New blood feels the game is rigged against them - which is too close to REAL LIFE, ain't nobody got time for that.  It's an indication of how completely out of touch these devs are with the core market who support the MP/FPS franchise.  They aren't interested in dialog or communication with the communities of modders, map makers, server admins, and clans who make up the backbone of true blockbusters such as Counter Strike and Team Fortress.\n\nThat said, I gotta say, I enjoy the hell out of this game.","January 19, 2014","true","390.0"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","1"

It's really fun if you want it to be. Can be a casual shooter game or a competitive one depending on how you wanna play it and who you play it with. Some may say it's not fun because it gets too hard for them, or just that they play with guys who are new to it or with those who just wants to fool around. Don't just assume it is not a fun game just after a few hours of playing it. It can take time for you to get used to.\n\nAnd even though T.I. is made by the same guys who made C.S., don't compare the two games. Just take it as a whole different game, or at least that's what I suggest.\n\nI like this game a lot. It allows you to get guns permanently, there are achievements that may take you a long time to get, a number of maps and modes to play (after the latest update), driving maps which quite a number of FPSs do not have, and also several skins you can purchase to have a different and a more badass look for your own character. To be honest, I got hooked on this game for months and I still like this game a lot more than other FPSs I have played before. T.I. is also not so much of a 'pay to win' game compared to some of those I have played. Yes it is true you can purchase stronger guns when you are only a level 1 with real cash, but even so, everything can be bought with in game money other than skins. So I personally wouldn't call that pay to win, since you are just buying things to have it faster. It's not like you bought a gun that's only purchaseable with real cash. But well, I respect the opinions of others if they do disagree with me.\n\nBut of course, there is also the downside of this game.\n\n1. Little laggy.\n\nThere are quite a number of players in this game that face lag. Even though there are players from all over the world, it is still kinda bad. But even so, if you are able to deal with a little lag, it shouldn't affect you that bad. And for those of who you gets really bad lag, like maybe around 20 FPS or lower, if you are using a laptop, try keeping it charged. That's what I do and the lag is gone. May only be for me. I don't know..\nOhh. And if you are playing with lag, I suggest you to not play at driving maps that often. Can be chaotic..\n\n2. T.I. community\n\nWell, just like in most games, there will be people you will meet who are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. There will be ragers, whiners,  trolls, etc. Just ignore them if you can't take this kinda crap. And if they annoy you over the microphone, just mute them in-game. Good thing they have that option.. If you are able to deal with them, good for you. If you can't, well....try harder..\n\n3. Hitmarks\n\nAfter the latest update in July 2014, the hit registers have been screwed up. It's harder to land hits on target now that the hitmarks aren't as accurate compared to before. Not sure if this applies to all guns, but I notice this problem mainly for the assault rifles. Would appreciate it if this issue gets fixed quick, like say..to how it was before the update on April 2014? Then, the hitmarks were dead on.\n\n4. Game development\n\nSadly, there are only 4-5 developers working on this game at the moment. So, updates can take awhile. But when updates do come, it may not necessarily make the game a 100% better. Like from the latest update in July, it's good they brought in new maps and new game modes. But the hit registers also got messed with. It can take awhile for problems to be fixed and all, but it would be nice if there were more people helping out on the game development. More people to get things done, and more people to get to understand what people actually want to see in T.I and implement them. If things go well with the development of the game, and when more people start playing and supporting this game, the developers would get more income which would keep them motivated. Would be nice for both sides don'tcha think?\n\n\nWell, to sum it up, I recommend Tactical Intervention to gamers out there from all over the world. Yeah, there are problems here and there, but it's still pretty fun. And hey, it's FREE! Would call it a poor man's C.S, but it is better than it sounds, in my opinion at least. It would be nice to have some of you guys to volunteer to help out developing this game too. Also, from what I mentioned about the issues after some updates, don't be too disappointed from what you get as of now. It will be fixed and it will get better....hopefully..","August 9, 2014","true","364.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","6"

The starting weapons are decent, make no mistake, but all other weapons which can only be obtained through the in-game store are notoriously overpowered, and other cosmetic gear items provide similarly unbalanced boosts for a variety of stats (truth be told, they don't really seem to do anything either, which is even worse). You're expected to grind matches to obtain points in order to purchase items on a temporary ownership basis, as permanent gear can cost so many points that you'll likely be tempted to pay up with real money (which is probably the intention here).\n\nStill, Tactical Intervention is a game worth trying out, and it does have some value worth offering if you can stick with it. It also has attack dogs, and that makes it worth at least the hard-drive space, in my book.","April 17, 2014","true","22.0"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

When you start, you have a stock set of weapons and no equipment. (Personally, I can use these stock weapons and WIN vs good players, just gotta aim!) You start with 50k in GP, enough for a good primary and secondary gun, with money left over. You will need to play or pay to earn GP and buy guns and equipment. Items like combat boots give a slight speed and stamina bonus. Gloves give more melee damage and item use speed. Googles protect from flashbangs... Plenty of other items to earn along the way.\n\n\nWhat I like about this game...\n-Simple controls, easy to customize button layout and HUD display\n-Small/medium sized maps with simple layouts for quick paced action, easy to learn\n-Several game modes (bombing, deathmatch, VIP escort, hostage rescue, driving, and more)\n-Teamwork is emphasized: Bonus points for healing team, aim bonus for staying near teammates\n-Small community of players, very friendly and fun\n\nWhat I dislike about the game\n-Small community of players!

Now you're probably wondering what kind of game this TI really is, huh? Well let me try to explain it briefly: TI is the way the community always wanted it to be, a better and quicker way of playing where experience points is not required to unlock weapons only in-game credits which is given after every match played and that gives every new player a fighting chance. Below you'll find all sorts of information regarding the game, take a look you might find something helpful.\n\n[▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲]\n\n-=> Tips & Trix <=-\nLooking for a guide on how to play TI? Then you've come to the right place, just scroll down to the bottom of this page to find the guide. Hope that you find this review helpful and don't forget to press the: |LIKE| button above & spread it to your friends so more people get a chance to experience TI.\n\n[ Information! ]\nA super fast paced first person shooter that offers an intense adrenaline rush when playing "Vip-Escort" or "Team Deathmatch" whether it's in a car-chase, a strategic mission map or blood a splattering deathmatch, either way you choose to play you'll find TI insanely entertaining, every map offers it's own unique gameplay & strategic design and can be used to your advantage if playing tactically. This game is purely based on teamwork and staying close to your teammates will give you accuracy bonus and the possibility to get healed.\n\n[ Modes! ]\nRating: (9/10)\nBomb Plant, Hostage Rescue VIP-Escort including cars & Of course the classic Team Deathmatch. Feels great to have so many modes to choose from in the same game, it makes for a sweet rotation.\n\n[ Content! ]\nRating: (9/10)\nTI offers a nice variety of weapons and equipment for customizing your character in many different ways, alot of new content is added frequently which improves it even further. The recoil system provided in TI is one of the most well balanced in any FPS game ever and it just runs & feels really smooth and it reacts properly. The characters are really well made and the weapon models binds it all together nicely, surely animations can be a bit slack but will be fixed in the future. The damage factor is properly divided depending on body part hit so shooting someone in their legs and feet will require many more bullets than shooting him in the stomach etc.\n\n[ Maps! ]\nRating: (10/10)\nThe maps surely are top-class and the environments are wonderfully crafted and we can barely wait to see the new maps to come in the near future that will be even better and offer even greater strategic gameplay. They feel really light and natural which adds a great atmosphere to the game and a depth not really found in other Source engine based games such as trees, rocks and rays of light. The textures are also very well made and unique in every map which is nice since it doesn't get so repetative.\n\n[ Personal Opinion! ]\nRating: (10/10)\nHighest possible rating because of the potential & depth that TI offers and not what it currently lacks. It feels more alive and unique in it's own way than most games out there today and the future looks bright for TI. All the small details really binds this game together and it makes it feel personal. I used to play Counter-Strike since 1999 to recent times and pretty much all the famous FPS games ever released in between too, sure they we're great in their own way. Yet somehow this game just raised the bar to another level that is unmatched by most games today because it feels much more personal and not like mainstream crap made to suit everyone. TI offers hardcore gaming at it's best!\n\n>Absolutely recommended to be enjoyed with friends!\n\n[▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲]\n\n{ STARTER GUIDE! }\n\nTo begin with you'll start with 10.000 credits and that will cover all the cost of the items to start with if used properly. It is wise that you don't use all of it right away or you'll regret having to use the lesser powerful starting guns when the ones you got expire. And it will only force you to stop playing due to rage. So I'm going to explain to you how to start your TI career properly. Read slowly and try to absorb as much as you can. I suggest you open this guide while in-game for a much quicker & easier access! A few more years and this will become a world famous game not a single doubt about that at all.\n\nBelow you can see text marked like |This|, that means it's a button.

IT IS PLAYABLE. But needs support from better servers which lag less, which is hard for the developers as this is a free to play. They really need to fix their ingame buying menu & need to make it more compatible with steam.\n\nThe game does need a better GPU card if you are thinking about jumping into it straight from Cs1.6 or CsOnline.\n\nApart from that the levels are drawn on the inspiration from Project IGI 2 and are really well designed.

Yes the animation and graphics can be better, but it's not always about the graphics, its about the community and the gameplay. The game is not pay to win, despite what some people might belive. By the time you hit around level 30, you should have a main assault rifle, a smg, helmets, goggles, gloves, boots, and armor (optional). Even if lets say god forbid somebody buys a gun permanently, then so what? It's a fps game, it still takes skills to aim a gun. The guns are fairly balanced, even more so now that there is a recoil system now, you can't just spray and pray most of the time.\n\nI would say give this game a try first, it's free, and you start off with 50k gp which gets u a nice permanent assault riffle right off the bat. If you don't like it then fine, uninstall and move on. If I had read the reviews before I started playing, and if I had listened to them I would have missed out on an awesome game. The developers actually listen to us, they are currently planning a tournament soon it's starting on july 12.

Drive, bomb, rappel and shoot your way through eleven high octane levels.\n\nCommand attack dogs, deploy breaching charges, perform drive-bys and control hostage situations!\n\nFrom the brilliant mind of Minh “Gooseman” Le, the co-creator of the seminal team-based FPS Counter-Strike, comes its spiritual successor, Tactical Intervention. Take your role as either terrorist or counter-terrorist and confront opponents in fierce and frantic combat over a variety of high energy maps wielding authentic real world weapons, from the classic P90 to the terrorist favourite, the AK47.\n\nFeaturing unique games modes and mechanics not seen in other shooters, Tactical Intervention allows you to experience first person combat from an entirely new perspective. Hijack a car to take part in an intense highway chase; unload your high-powered Gabard shotgun at the VIP while leaning out the window, as your opponents scramble to protect him. Take out the covering helicopter with a well-placed shot from an RPG while you handbrake turn to broadside your target.\n\nExperience the thrill of rappelling down a building, kicking in the plexiglass, hurling a flash bang, grabbing a hostage as a human shield, and dealing some rapid fire death with your Uzi. Use riot shields to defend yourself against enemy forces and then command your vicious German Shepard attack dog to savage terrorists out of line of sight. Dive to cover and lay down suppressing fire with your Aug assault rifle so your teammates can liberate the terrified hostages.\n\nCombining the strategic elements of modern team-based shooters with the pure thrill of the original Counter Strike series, Tactical Intervention brings a whole new level of gaming to the battlefield and lets players feel the true intensity of battle. With a huge variety of weapons, special equips, authentic combat uniforms and paths to victory, Tactical Intervention truly is the next evolution in team-based combat. So grab your P90, slap on a red-dot, twist in a silencer and dive into TI!\n\nA New Era in Tactical Combat.","October 15, 2013","true",""," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

I have way too much $$ in it buying stuff that I could of even bought with gp to support the game.  I have 400,000 gp in the game yet I buy things to support the Devs servers etc.  Yet they do not stay on top of fixing ♥♥♥♥.  Their player base is going to hell because of it. It has become ♥♥♥♥. Updates never come out.  The game has been ruined by poor choices and poor coding and no updates to fix it. They added gun jumping screen shaking muzzle flashes so it is harder to hit ....not too big of deal but then add beatdown gloves to the shop so you can one hit melee someone from a good distance away. Which is ♥♥♥♥ people just run around charge you not firing to bash you. They had the Super V screwed up for forever, and did not take care of it forever and said the gun was fine when it was broken. THis went on for months and moths and moths. Tired of ♥♥♥♥♥ with a game called Tactical Intervention removing any kind of tactical from the game. It is sad. I had not played an FPS worth a ♥♥♥♥ for some time this game was worth a ♥♥♥♥. Yeah I am ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to have to review the game as such. I have played it since early steam beta.\n\nNow I am uninstalling it. Screw supporting something that has become ♥♥♥♥! I hope to hear sometime that there is something done worth reinstalling it. This upcoming update I know won't be enough soon enough. ♥♥♥♥♥ need to learn to add things as they can especially fixes instead of trying to do a whole lot all at once and nothing inbetween.

That's about it.\n\nHoooo boy, the negatives.\n\n-95% of the community is ♥♥♥♥.\n-PAY TO WIN.\n-If you want to buy weapons with GP, you will need to grind for two whole days, approximately.\n-Hardly any updates or nerfs to anything.\n-That "breaching" ♥♥♥♥ it tells you in the description? None here.\n-About as tactical as Call of Duty most of the time.\n-*Car chases are tedious as ♥♥♥♥ - you WILL need a good team or else you are screwed.\n-*Only thing that will grab you is the fact it has car chases involved.\n\nOverall: This game is wasted potential and just fell on it's ♥♥♥. If it wanted to be tactical, it needed to feel tactical and not just be another lack-luster P2W game by slapping a pretentious title on itself. Should you need any ounce of tactical gameplay that's free to play and that requires more thought, just play Ghost Recon: Phantoms or something.\n\nBetter yet, just ♥♥♥♥ing buy Counter Strike - any one of them will do (except Nexon).","April 11, 2015","false","63.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Created by a co-creator of CS, I was quite pleased to see the changes they had made to it. With some smarts, and patience, one COULD get really good at it, I thought. To an extent, that may have been true. But I can't help but think the devs were a little too greedy with this game, and a bit unfair in other aspects, as well....\nFirst off, the game is a nice take of CS, with great features like rappelling, player VIP escort, drivable cars, breaching charges too! It all seems great, at first. You'll soon find out that rappelling is worse than useless, noob VIPs get themselves killed, thus ending the round, the cars mechanics are absolutely HORRIBLE, and the breaching charges are overpriced. Oh, did I mention that? EVERY perk, attachment, accessory, pretty much anything besides the actual weapons need actual $$$ to use, and most for only a month, as there is no perma unlock for them. I know, crazy, right? But hear me out.\nThe guns themselves are decent, save for one. They can be permanently unlocked, but it is a pain in the @$$ to do when you only have the default guns. What's wrong with the default guns, you ask? They are significantly lower dmg, accuracy, and mag size. Useless. Good thing is, you can rent guns to get ingame money to payoff your rent and even profit, with the right application of use.\nThis needs a seperate paragraph of its own. The Super V. Basically the Vector, it outclasses the M4, AK, G36, every other SMG and assault rifle, destroys shotguns and pistols, and snipers aren't even a challange, unless they have 50 meters on you. Even then, its anyone's guess. Accuracy, damage, RPM, this gun has it all. You can use it in a car, on land, in hell, anywhere. It will ruin the poor fool in front. Devs need to fix this, FAST, or this game could quickly degnerate into people relying on other people's sense of goodwill and benevolence.\nHonestly though, my take of this game is that it is very good. It has a small community really, so once you meet the right people, (the decent ones with hearts), you will be able to actually play with them, use some strategy, maybe. Strategy in this game, with a closely knit, communicative, strong team will beat almost any opposition out there. Maybe a rehaul in graphics, but that's a minor thing, definitely a change in the whole $$$ grabbing thing, though. Change the way you get the accessories, attachments, aesthetical changes, etc, and maybe TI will get a larger following. That, and a basic autobalance so that it isn't all lvl 40-50s on one team, and like 5 lvl 1-4's on the other. I still reccommend this game, because hey, if you don't give up on it, and you persist, it will quickly grow on you after a while. Then fall off. But let that happen later.","April 15, 2014","true","119.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are deffinitely bugs in this game, mainly the Highway missions. It's deffinitely leaned to the tactical side, and staying next to teammates raises accuracy which can lead to a bit of teamwork, though not often. There are graphic issues that can occur when set to higher settings, may have just been me.\n\nI'd give the game about 7.5/10, so I do recommend trying the game.","April 8, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Apparently kids with no arms play with game.\n\nBut really, this game has alot of potential and can be VERY fun if you play with a team that you can properly work with. It actually gets rather boring if you play against/with pubs because you just end up stomping if you have played an FPS before. I would say 85% of players cause the following gamebreaking issues as this game is all about teamwork, while the 15% are the heros in the match that do everything.\n\nPUBS DO NOT\n- Heal you\n- Stick together\n- Communicate\n- Follow the objective\n- Kill enemies you would assume would be an easy kill for them\n\nPUBS DO\n- Complain the game sucks because they didn't get a non default gun\n- Leave matches midway\n- Stand Still and watch enemies\n- Crash cars when driving\n\n. This game works best if you organize a match with people you know. It gets really fun when you actually start having to use cover properly and work with teamates when fighting intelligent enemies.\n\n*Recommend for groups of players, playing alone will only frustrate you*","September 5, 2013","true","66.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are not amazing by any means but You can still tell what your looking at, the AS50 is a very overpowered rifle and shouldn't even be in the game,This is made worse by bad TDM spawns, Highway is the best mode in my opinion It was kinda fun driving around Trying to avoid terrorists.

If I have to describe/compare with a single sentence both of the game I would say “If CS is like a professional boxing with strict rules and limitations, then TI is like MMA (Mixed Martial Arts).” CS is stripped from any kind of “tunings” except the bullet vest/helmet and the defuse kit, which is good for competitive/sport matches (you know what to expect). But in the other hand TI is more arcade, you can tune/create your own “class and style” of game play similar to Team Fortress 2, but without the limitations of predefined classes. You still need some skills to shoot precisely (deal with recoil), use tactics (communicate), use grenades, which I love how they behaves, not like in CS (in CS there are just two useful grenades, flash bang and smoke all the rest are joke), when you throw frag grenade, tear gas, smoke, flash bang you know what to expect and the other side have to get the hell out from there, if they want to survive and even so they still can be blinded for a while after or knocked down from the blast or have a blurred vision, smoke is passive grenade and the incendiary is more or less like the smoke to create a barrier, but not to kill. You can rush/run for your life or to attack, you can peak, you can roll, there is bullet penetration (although not always predictable and sticking guns from the glass walls make greater damage than no sticking, but hey no one is perfect ;)). There is a map and if you make noise (shooting, running or even moving will give your position away) good for ambushing campers. And if you get tired from all that bomb, rescue, escort game play, then you have cars :). There are plenty of weapons, gears and perks to choose from and you start the game with 50000GP enough to buy a decent assault rifle permanent or rent all bunch of stuff. Compared to all that CS is much more limited, plain and simple, which as I said, has its good sides.  TI compared to Call of Duty is still “realistic”, so no any air strikes, missiles etc, maybe just the dogs are that little “too much”, but there is match limitation for them, so it is so so bearable.\n\nAlthough TI is free to play, it is not (at least by my opinion) pay to win game, you can buy absolutely everything in the game with earned game points (GP) just by playing it, the only thing which cannot be bought with GP are the custom skins, which do not have any direct influence on your player specs.\n\nIf you want to have a look at the rest of that letter and the current issues with tha game here is the link:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/51100/discussions/0/46476145348892070/\n\n******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nThere are so many good and so many bad things, which can be said about this game and this review, can be really long, but no one will read it, so it is waste of time for me to write it in details. All I will say is:\n\n1.	I have bought CS:GO a week before I have installed TI and so far, I have accumulated 125 hours on TI, I am level 23 and I have bought quite few items (already have spend about 260,000GP) and I have accumulated just 6 hours on CS:GO and those are actually, because I have started to play CS:GO now/recently.\n\n2.	I am a real world, skill/tactics based, FPS fan and TI had it all and more than any other FPS, I have ever played, but all the romance disappeared after I started to notice some serious unbalance in the game and after a while it is not anymore that much about skills, than just, what gadgets/items you have equipped. From that point on, it will start to become more and more a rat race to gain more GP and buy better armor, shoes, gloves etc, because it will highly influence your success rate, mind you I am not talking about the weapons…. and it begins to feel more like a RPG game than a skill game.  When you win or lose, you know and the rest of the players know (even, if some of them do not admit it), that most of the time you win or lose, because of the better gadgets/items you or they have equipped and the skill factor and the satisfaction of winning are pathetic, if you have to be honest to yourself.\n\n3.	I do understand, that the game is F2P and the developers need to make money, but if I buy some DLC, I will become even more overpowered and it will be more like shooting fish in a barrel, than a fair challenge and satisfaction for all the players. I guess that is a common point for most F2P games and the main reason of their decease, which will be really pity for such a great game :(.","February 8, 2014","true","866.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Im just impressed by how its free to play. Its a game you will want. The only problems are maybe 1 or 2 things including crashing every now and then or maybe lag from a bomb. But otherwise the game offers you everything. Guns are realistic meaning its harder to kill someone. You can use a microphone to talk. You can drive cars and poke your head out of the windows.

However, I think the free-to-model kills it. Though the developers do give the player enough in-game currrency to buy at least one permanent weapon - choose wisely. Mission game modes are where you want to spend most of your time, if you're into tactical shooters similar to counter-strike. I didn't feel like its TDM mode was the highlight of the show. Actually it kind of feels unnecessary and thrown in for a particular crowd, maybe. Yet everyone seems to play TDM, and that is likely where all new players will start their experience. It is because of that that I don't recommend this game. However, I do recommend one tries the game playing Mission mode exclusively. I will have to play further to determine for myself if all the missions are worth the time, but I am turned off by the free-to-play model - which can be easily exploited for pay-to-win.","April 25, 2014","false","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Recently got into this game out of curiousity. I was bored and saw the game just sitting there as "free to play." So I said ♥♥♥♥ it, why not? I wanted to shoot something, and if it meant a Counter Strike kind of game, why not? I expected the bugs and glitches the game has, and visually a bit rough, because it's a source engine game made by a small group of developers. How ever I wasn't expecting the amount of joy I'd get out of playing this game. Just little things like rappelling down the side of a building to rescue hostages, or using a hostage as a human shield, or having my character followed by a trained attack dog. Though I think the games high light personally is the Car Chase maps. I think if the developers really wanted to change the game around and rake in cash, it would be by focusing on the Car Chase map designs. Barreling down a high way full of traffic, as terrorists and counter-terrorists alike shoot out windows at each other, trying to blow out a tire, or sending a RPG shrieking across the street to nail the VIP car, is by far the most fun I've had in a FPS in a long while. This is not just a positive reviews, but me begging developers to make more vehicular chase maps, by far the best part of the game. For both the action and hillarity.","May 1, 2014","true","32.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

This feature has gone too far to the game itself, I don't want to waste my money over a gun that can kill almost anything but not a guy who have a LOT of stuff. It should just use the traditional $ to buy weapons via Buy Menu like in the Counter-Strike series...\n\nOP Shotguns: Am i playing CoD right now? AM I!? okay, here is the point, Ive seen a dude almost get a K/D ratio of 67/39 using a shotty itself, which is ridiculous. And for the fact that the pumping animation is SLOWER than any FPSes I've ever played, it took me about a second to fully pump a shotgun before returning fire.\n\nLaughable Animations: Heh, the player animations in this game are so laughable, they run like crabs with guns, the reloading animations are okay though, just the running and crouching animations are just meh, but this is just my least problem about the game.\n\nCharacters look ugly as hell: ???, why is everyone look outdated and just retextured? Can't they just make a single character without looking like.... ripped off from a old game? Again my least problem from these reasons.\n\nGameplay itself: Worse than idiots running around with shotguns in the game itself.\n\nSpawns: Oh hell no, TDM got the spawns similar to CoD's spawns... take this as an example: 2 Guys spawned, then a enemy spawns right behind them and he mowed them down using its OP Shotty or a powerful weapon...\n\nWeapons that obscure 50% of your screen: "Oh look, my gun is so big, I can't see ♥♥♥♥ on my screen, I'M DEAD!" Seriously, they just make the guns hideously giant to obscure your screen just to admire what your gun looks like, they should just make it smaller and less obscuring\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd the only thing I like about this game was the:\n\nGore: Hey, despite I don't like this game, they made the gore look satisfying. Instead the character's head stays there when it gets headshotted by a powerful weapon, it bursts into tiny pieces with blood all over.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros:  Captain Obvious much? Better than CoD\nGood Maps\nGore Simulator with CTs and Ts\n\nCons: Again, Captain Obvious. P2W\nBad TDM Spawns\nUgly looking characters\nAnimations that are the most laughable than any game.\n\nOverall Score: 15/100","September 6, 2014","false","2.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The community is pretty small so far so there are a bunch of really good people to play with but quite a few new players every week or so. For a free game I find it very balanced. The Pay-to-Play features with most free games is practically non-existent. The in game currency is so easy to obtain that anybody can buy anything in the game and be just as good as everyone else. You could spend real money to buy a gun or you can also play 10 games or so and buy it yourself. All real money is good for are buying cool skins, but even then the skins don't add or change the game play. All in all I would give this game a large thumbs up and recommend this game to anybody who wants a free, fun and fair FPS shooter.","November 23, 2014","true","101.0"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","19","36","2","0"

TI requires precision aiming and burst firing that are different for every gun that makes them distinct. I personally like the feel of how the gunplay is handled and it feels very right with the other aspects of the game.\n\nnext up the Movement.\n\nthis is the part i love the most. In TI they have Dodgerolls to put out fire & making it harder to get hit. Stamina Cooldown. Leaning Left & Right for Peaking & a over head peaking. basically you have many aspects of being able to do things to evade & shoot that makes this very Tactical and helps the flow of the game.\n\non the whole its a game where ull need to sit a few hours to get a real feel for it but its a great game if you take it as it is.\n\nbe warned that you might get stomped as it has a skillcurve but thats just how it is. but if you put in 5 or 10 hours ull likely get the flow of it and it just keeps getting better from there.\n\nthe items are fairly price and u start with a decent amount of ingame currency to buy a gun straightup if you want but its best to test them out nowadays to see if you like them.\n\nTLDR:\n\nGreat game why arnt u trying it out already its F2P.\n\nif you got any questions just ask me.\n\nTeufel outtt","August 31, 2013","true","71.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnakekillerX/recommended/51100/","SnakekillerX","SnakekillerX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnakekillerX/","252 products in account","This game gets a lot of hate.  Sure the game isn't completely polished and it does suffer from a bug here or there, but really there aren't as many bugs as people make this game out to have.  I play BF4 as well and I find it has just as many bugs as this game, and the reviews for BF4 aren't as 1 sided as Tactical Intervention, when they really should be, not to mention BF4's god aweful client side / server side prediction hit test system.\n\nTactical Intervention is a server side hit detection game, with multiple game modes.  There are TDM style matches where you respawn after a few seconds, OR there are other game modes where you do NOT respawn, and have to wait for the rest of your team to either die too, or complete the objective in time... the ladder is by far the more fun of the two types as it promotes team play.\n\nThere objective modes like, plant the bomb, rescue the hostages and protect the VIP.\nProtect the VIP is one of the most fun game modes in my opinion, especially the maps where you start in vehicles and have to stop or protect the VIP depending on which team you are playing on.  You and your team pile in a couple of cars and and have a shoot out while driving, the chaos is so much fun.\n\nThis game has the worst metacritic score out all the free to play games on steam which made it stand out for me, I downloaded it because I wanted to play it and see how bad it was and laugh, but there weren't any laughs to be had.. except those of enjoyment as this game is honestly a lot more fun than a lot of alternative shooters, free or otherwise.\n\nSome people call it pay to win, but I disagree as you can buy mostly everything with GP (an in game currency rewarded each round for actions you perform, the better you do.. the more GP you get)   You can either rent or perminately buy weapons and equipment... oh and you can get an attack dog, which is pretty neat.  One thing you cannot buy with GP are new player skins, those you have to pay real money for, but other than a visual change they do nothing.  AND you can still get new helmets, gloves, boots and belts using GP anyway, which also give a visual and stat benefit to your character.\n\nYou start of with 50,000 GP and all but 2 or 3 guns can be permantly bought for that price.  (ranges from about 18,000 to 70,000ish GP on the weapons)  it does take some time to gain GP so you may be best renting a weapon for a day for the fraction of the cost first to see if you like it, before you perminately buy it.  Buy the time you are done fully testing the weapon you will probably have made back the GP you spent on renting it anyway.\n\nYou can also interact with a lot of objects like fire extingishers, gas canisters, you can rappel down a building..  and drive cars, trucks and an airport luggage taxi.\n\n\nI can't stress enough though how much you should just try the game for yourself.  The game was to be the next counter strike and made by counter strike's co creator, but I think thats where the reviews went bad.  I believe counter strike players (there are a lot of them) expected this game to be better and possibly a replacement but it didn't turn out to be their cup of tea perhaps.  I recommend this game, it gets a lot more hate than it deserves.","May 3, 2014","true","560.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But in all honesty, that doesn't do the game any justice. It has the same features as Counter Strike but how you play and what you do will greatly affect your experience. First of all, Graphically, it uses the Source engine so the graphics are decent but defineatly not great. On my machine at max settings, textures have the same resolution as a Minecraft block. Furthermore, the animations are stiff and unrealistic. However, just like in Counter Strike shooting is good. You have 3 default weapons which are all good and balanced well and even the shotgun doesn't seem overpowered. The maps are fairly large with open space and little nooks and crannies. Most maps are designed for 6v6 gameplay although some maps are big enough to hold 24 players. There are the standard TDM but there is an interesting gamemode called Highway. As the name suggests you drive a car and shoot people in other cars and retrive the intel. Nothing in this game is unique but it is not supposed to. It is simply a F2P Counter Strike. However with all the problems the game has I would rather buy a $20 game like Counter Stike because it would provide a  better experience.

Of course it still needs to have some bugs fixed and a better way to control cheaters but anyway I find this game pretty fun. It has a wide variety of weapons that you can get with hard time spent to get game money or just buy them with real money...\n\nA very good game imo.. =)","June 21, 2014","true","305.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game gets me so deep into it I litterally forget that I have to get off of my computer so I can go to bed. This is a more realistic game, so 3-4 shots with any of the rifles will most likely kill you. This is more of a fast paced game but do not get out of cover unless its clear. There are 2 gamemodes that I love to play. Kill the VIP and Team DeathMatch. In TeamDeathMatch you have unlimited lives and you keep killing until the time runs out. Once it runs out, the team with the higher points wins the round. Kill the VIP gives you only one life. If you are a terroist you have to kill the VIP take his package and give it to the chopper. The police have to protect the VIP and the package to your helicopter. You do this all with really fast cars and you can shoot while in the car. Overall I would rate this game a 8 1/2 out of 10. I do recommend this game A LOT\n\nGraphics: 7-10\nGameplay: 8-10\nGamemodes: 9-10\nWeapons: 8 1/2-10\n(Again) Overall 8 1/2-10\n\n","April 26, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But in all honesty, that doesn't do the game any justice. It has the same features as Counter Strike but how you play and what you do will greatly affect your experience. First of all, Graphically, it uses the Source engine so the graphics are decent but defineatly not great. On my machine at max settings, textures have the same resolution as a Minecraft block. Furthermore, the animations are stiff and unrealistic. However, just like in Counter Strike shooting is good. You have 3 default weapons which are all good and balanced well and even the shotgun doesn't seem overpowered. The maps are fairly large with open space and little nooks and crannies. Most maps are designed for 6v6 gameplay although some maps are big enough to hold 24 players. There are the standard TDM but there is an interesting gamemode called Highway. As the name suggests you drive a car and shoot people in other cars and retrive the intel. Nothing in this game is unique but it is not supposed to. It is simply a F2P Counter Strike. However with all the problems the game has I would rather buy a $20 game like Counter Stike because it would provide a  better experience. Oh, did I mention the screen shake?\n\nBut to be fair, you get enjoyement when you play this game, which is why my final veredict for this game is a 7/10","November 29, 2013","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The problem is with this game is the lack of game modes but as patches for a new UI and modes with new maps (without DLC) this makes for a great free to play experince. Yet I'm a little mad at the devopers that they made better guns but having to pay with real money but it's okay because the guns are banlced. Other problems are that ingame money is hard to get but this also makes the guns less op yet it's still fustrating because the guns are just so good. But after all the problems with this game it's amazing and free so download it and be happy you did. (P.S. Careful Mac users your game will crash during loading maps due to the new update.)","April 17, 2014","true","77.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I've won 196 matches, and have lost only 154 in comparison. The game in itself is strenuously challenging, but not impossible. I'm tempted to say that it's difficult to cope with at times, and is not for everyone. You need to be able to react fast, and build a common strategy as to how you'll get your next kill in. Spawn points are ridiculous, but it often favors random parties. Same goes to individuals, too. There's people who like to complain a lot by the way, about choice weapons, such as shotguns or the often spotted P90. It's mostly fun, though, to watch them ramble on and on about that last headshot you got in on them. All in all, noobs will be owned, but you can still easily work your way up with experience, and of course, the GP you earn with every match helps tremendously. Just be sure not to stray away from the shop. One can easily earn the necessary armor and weapons for more comfortable gameplay, or just flat out buy it with cold, hard cash, for not everything can be purchased with GP. At the same time, it doesn't take forever to save up GP either. As far as developing one's inventory goes, to each their own. One shouldn’t complain about another’s fix.","March 1, 2015","true","463.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The games dead dont even bother downloading this. Only EU servers left and the admins dont give a fk anymore. After they changed (Now to FixGames, who apperently dont fix a ♥♥♥♥..) it just got worse and worse. I got atleast 10 pictures of different ingame bugs and glitches. Ignore what is down below this. Its just dead.\nThis game is.. a mixture of emotions. It is a pretty good game, i enjoy it when i game with friends and buddies. The mechanics are almost alright. The guns handle pretty... unique, though difficult for newbies and ameteurs alike (and im sure even some pro's will agree the handling is pretty difficult when compared to other games.) There is a shop that lets you buy things with In Game Points (GP), but most of the greatly customized things (permanent attachment guns are pretty rare and limited edition) and skins and playermodels are all bought with $$$. An offer that allows you to buy said customization would be great, also the option to buy attachments permanently rather than a 2 week rent would be great as well!\nThe major complaints are the community. Its just as bad as CoD most of the time. High lvls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥'s most of the time, especially since most of THESE people cheat to achieve such levels. The game lacks VAC, which makes hackers stick to this game like flies on honey. Not only do these "High" levels disorient new players to automatically delete this game (i could point out this could be considered cyberbullying believe it or not), but they also ruin the fun for other gamers who try play this game fairly. The voting system... well it sucks. It is completely broken and makes even kicking an obvious hacker a hassle since most of the time the voting screen wont pop up. All these, in addition to slow action from admins and well.. the lack of them (never seen an admin in my game time to be honest). The game quickly went from having over 600 players! 600 was plenty, always rooms to join, and places to come to and play. Poeple would join pretty quick (600 might seem insignificant, but in this game, where ya need a minimum of 4 players to start a match and max was 20, it was plenty. and im talking of the USA1 server alone). Now... barely 150 when the game is at its peak, and 100 barely most of the time, play this game usually. and the other servers are empty, so im talking literally 100 players playing all servers (USA1 is the only server used). Out of these 100 players, a vast mayority are hackers (im including aimboters to the term just for this review.)\nI have heard a lil rumor VAC will finally be enabled in a week or two.. but is it too late for this nifty F2P FPS game? or will it attract gamers back to this once wonderful game? Only the Developers will be able to save this game.\nEdit:I have seen cheats and have reported atleast 6 or 7 people. Not to mention the massive aimbot community.  The community is horrible a lot. (have images to prove that one actually) and well, there is some hope. VAC is coming to TI very soon (bout a week maybe i heard), but is it too late? The community ranges about an average of 110 players online at any time (pretty low considering the 600-700 players when i began at earlier stages). The guides are ok, but still not very helpful considering the weapons depend on your playing style (everyone has their own style). Also the "pride" high lvls have.. well kinda aholes if ya ask me. i seen unfairly balanced matches, all lv 1-5 in one team, and another team with lv 30-40 (several high lvls) just putting down new players making them hate this game to the guts. (an option to chose which lvls can join would be great).Always voting down when a vote for balance teams shows up (i also need mention, the game voting system is cmpletely broke. i have yet to see one day where it works).The need for 4 players min is horrible too. if i want to play with a friend, i cant since i need 4 players. making private 1-1 battles impossible. Also there is the vehicles and the lag these cause (barely anyone can drive those things without crashing. the vehicle engine (ragdoll effects and how it interacts and stuff) is pretty bad as well. my Car can drive over cars like a tank. the streest are really narrow, the stages feel cramped (try Office with 20 people for a size) and monaco is barely playable.\n\nits not all that bad, now attachments are rentable (next step, permanents), and the skins are more diverse (paytowin spoiler too), though impossible for normal players to get due to the $$$ cost rather than GP. Weapons (except snipers and shotguns) are a tad more balanced. (snipers are either OP or very crappy (like the initial sniper everyone gets.. i can get quicker kills with the initial pistol than with that sniper. and the AS50, the most OP gun in the world, especially for people with really low PING and FPS. *cough* or aimbots. Shotguns are all broken, the bullets dont spray much (especially on the autoshotgun) making it deadly and just ridiculously op to the point of making half a team quit and the other half quit due to being outnumbered (seen it). As mentioned earlier, bots would be a great addition, allowing players to practice alone at the cost of 0 GP (or maybe a GP reduction depending on the ammount of players on like.. maybe player kills count and bots dont or something) or to fill up stages (many cases of making a match when all are full and nobody joining). some more mechanics like this would be great. The recoil is still as high as ever, but i guess that is what makes the game somewhat (since there aint ironsights or anything).\n\nThe game is "alright" but until there are more players and the VAC is set up, i would NOT reccomend this game myself. Kudos and hope someday TI will carry forward, right? Anyways.. thats more my line of thinking. The dev's aint to blame either, i think they done a great job with each update (really seen lots of improvement). Just hope the community gets looked over.\n\nUPDATE: JIM ITS DEAD.. The games dead dont even bother downloading this. Only EU servers left and the admins dont give a fk anymore. After they changed (Now to FixGames, who apperently dont fix a ♥♥♥♥..) it just got worse and worse. I got atleast 10 pictures of different ingame bugs and glitches.

Thsi is probably becausae it has been amde by I believe either the same company or developers that helped develop Counter Strike. I own counter strike and plodding through it I have to say I was not impressed. The one kill and you are dead during TDM (Team Death Match) was not fun as I constantly felt like a noob on it.\n\nThis game is better than Counter Strike. You can drive cars in VIP Escort (CT Mission) Assasinate VIP (Terrorists), you have the basic hostage rescue mission like CS and bomb mission again like CS.\n\nYou start with 3 choices of weapon, a Scorpion sub machine gun, a boklov shotgun and I believe an M1 rifle. All these weapons feel fairly light when going against enemys with xp paid/ premium paid weapons. Dont be fooled I have won matches where I was only team member against 2 other enemys with nothing but boklov shotgun. Give it a chance.\n\nMaps dont look overly pretty but they feel so much fun to blow apart as if you play Office map on TDM or FFA you can blow CPU and filing trays apart to give better view or hide behind. The game feels like you have more startegy. In an escort mission as CT do you zoom ahead and meet the VIP at the drop off point where you are ready to defend or smash terrorist off the road and just generally slow them down, or stick with the VIP car no matter what. Tires can be shot out and if your car gets trashed GTA mother**&&^^ andjust chuck a civilian out GTA style. Dont run them over though that cost you 80 xp points. Kills usually get you 20 unless its  a head shot 1 kill where you get 40 xp.\n\nThe VIP looks liek an indavidual charchter he looks like a French Gendarme.\n\nMaps are varied and you have about 15 ounds 7 as CT and 8 as Terrorists. When you shoot a man at point blank range in the chest with a shitgun...he knows about it as bits of red meat fly over the map. So much fun.\n\nIn short this feels an interesting look and very indavidual version of a fairly old format cops and robbers. If like me you see Battlefield Hardline but remember Origin wouldnt allow you to play your Battlefield 3 game because it asked for you to sownload plugin endlessly and nothing happened, just take my advice stick with tthis game. You can even buy a dog for 1000 xp if I remember correctly.May be a little more.\n\nAll in all hillarious, and for the first 9 level you can play with players of the same level if you are like me and want to play European servers but its a day when not many playing go to USA 1 server up to 250 people playing on a good day and I find connection is ok.","March 6, 2015","true","465.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imasonyt/recommended/51100/","imasonyt","NotInUse01010381","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imasonyt/","16 products in account","In my opinion, Tactical Intervention is a very good and detailed game. It offers you to challenge the terrorists while being the police and the same about being a terrorist. From a variety of gamemodes and missions, you can choose to protect areas, people and things to trying to get as many kills as possible in a TDM Match. All of this is offered for free with no sort of in game payments. Ofcourse, you can skip a few hours of trying to unlock a weapon by simply paying £2.\n\nThe overall system of the game is very good. Obviously, because this is an older game, the graphics aren't great. The game "hawken" surely can't be beaten in graphics by any game. Even a game as good as this.\n\nThe buttons are fairly easy to get used to with the default keys to move as "W,A,S,D" and the mouse to "aim" and "fire." In my opinion, after a year of playing Minecraft, i changed the shift key to the crouch button because its my natrual idea for crouching and my natural movement od my hand when attempting to crouch. To roll out of an enemys line of site press "x." The roll key is very useful when trying to get out of any line of site but also is annoying when you jump of a 1ft tall wall and you automatically roll into an enemys sniper bullet.\n\nBeing a huge Call Of Duty fan, i am used to "annoying" snipers and trickshotters, slowly swarming over the Call Of Duty franchise. The only game that wasn't as bad was "World Of War." In this game, snipers can take up to 4 bullets to kill. Exactly like "BattleField 2-3." I like this aspect because its real war and it matters how good you are; not how lucky you are.\n\nOverall, this game is very good. I give it an 8/10. If the graphics were improved in a newer version, im sure this could be a competition for some well-know franchises.\n\n- Mason Firman | CEO Of Many Websites.","May 16, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For a game thats supposed to be a sortof "sequel" to CounterStrike I think this has missed the mark by far. Besides that the game has cool ideas that just haven't been executed very well.\n\nI tried to like this game and the ridiculousness and chaos make it fun for a bit, but Tactical Intervention did not provide me any motivation to keep playing. The game has some cool ideas with high speed car chases and having the ability to rappel down heights.\nThe car chases are probably the most fun you're going to have in the game but the physics for cars don't work very well and it feels very glitchy. When other people drive cars it looks and feels unnatural and very unpredictable. A missed opportunity.\nThe option to rappel is given rarely and I've only used it on one map with limited succes.\n\nBesides the game mode with car chases, you also have Team Deathmatch and hostage missions. The hostage missions work different to the one youre used to from CounterStrike. The Terrorists get a group of NPC hostages that they have to manage and prevent the Counter Terrorists from saving.\n\nGuns are a bit of a mixed bag. Personally I think the recoil is a bit too exaggerated and your gun just quickly jumps around as you fire it in full auto. Some guns do hit the things that youre aiming at and some are just terrible and are overshadowed by the guns that are considered the most efficient.\n\nBesides walking and sprinting the game provides the option for players to do combat rolls forwards, backwards and sideways. This can lead to cool, funny or awkward situations. It depends on how they're used, as with a lot of things.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Tactical Intervention brings a lot of cool ideas to the table, but doesn't execute any of them very well.","July 14, 2014","false","18.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It offers you to challenge the terrorists while being the police and the same about being a terrorist. From a variety of gamemodes and missions, you can choose to protect areas, people and things to trying to get as many kills as possible in a TDM Match. All of this is offered for free with no sort of in game payments. Ofcourse, you can skip a few hours of trying to unlock a weapon by simply paying £2.\n\nThe overall system of the game is very good. Obviously, because this is an older game, the graphics aren't great. The game "hawken" surely can't be beaten in graphics by any game. Even a game as good as this.\n\nThe buttons are fairly easy to get used to with the default keys to move as "W,A,S,D" and the mouse to "aim" and "fire." In my opinion, after a year of playing Minecraft, i changed the shift key to the crouch button because its my natrual idea for crouching and my natural movement od my hand when attempting to crouch. To roll out of an enemys line of site press "x." The roll key is very useful when trying to get out of any line of site but also is annoying when you jump of a 1ft tall wall and you automatically roll into an enemys sniper bullet.\n\nBeing a huge Call Of Duty fan, i am used to "annoying" snipers and trickshotters, slowly swarming over the Call Of Duty franchise. The only game that wasn't as bad was "World Of War." In this game, snipers can take up to 4 bullets to kill. Exactly like "BattleField 2-3." I like this aspect because its real war and it matters how good you are; not how lucky you are.\n\nOverall, this game is very good. I give it an 8/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supersizeyeti/recommended/51100/","supersizeyeti","Zee Skipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supersizeyeti/","141 products in account","A game that has a lot of potential but doesn't execute anything very well. For a game thats supposed to be a sortof "sequel" to CounterStrike I think this has missed the mark by far. Besides that the game has cool ideas that just haven't been executed very well.\n\nI tried to like this game and the ridiculousness and chaos make it fun for a bit, but Tactical Intervention did not provide me any motivation to keep playing. The game has some cool ideas with high speed car chases and having the ability to rappel down heights.\nThe car chases are probably the most fun you're going to have in the game but the physics for cars don't work very well and it feels very glitchy. When other people drive cars it looks and feels unnatural and very unpredictable. A missed opportunity.\nThe option to rappel is given rarely and I've only used it on one map with limited succes.\n\nBesides the game mode with car chases, you also have Team Deathmatch and hostage missions. The hostage missions work different to the one youre used to from CounterStrike. The Terrorists get a group of NPC hostages that they have to manage and prevent the Counter Terrorists from saving.\n\nGuns are a bit of a mixed bag. Personally I think the recoil is a bit too exaggerated and your gun just quickly jumps around as you fire it in full auto. Some guns do hit the things that youre aiming at and some are just terrible and are overshadowed by the guns that are considered the most efficient.\n\nBesides walking and sprinting the game provides the option for players to do combat rolls forwards, backwards and sideways. This can lead to cool, funny or awkward situations. It depends on how they're used, as with a lot of things.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Tactical Intervention brings a lot of cool ideas to the table, but doesn't execute any of them very well.","July 14, 2014","false","18.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My favorite gamemode is "VIP Car Escort" which is present on 3 maps (Play Monaco, Innercity or Highway on Mission), but is sometimes boring when you get in a car with a sucky driver. It's a fun game that requires some thinking.","December 1, 2014","true","32.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A friend recommended it to me and I was skeptical at first, but after playing a while I found I really enjoyed it. I also found out that a lot of what people say about it is wrong.\n\nFirst, it is not pay to win, and the grinds for guns are hardly long at all, compared to other online games.\n\nSecondly, I realize that it is fairly cheaply made, but for free? You can hardly beat that. The only things that cost money only are skins, which do nothing. I have not spent a cent on this game, and yet I am just about to purchase the most expensive weapon.\n\nThirdly, the gamemodes are fun, especially the vip escort missions, which usually end up looking wacky and hilarious. Their is a moderate team element to this game as well, so that is always nice to know.\n\nLastly, I was looking for a simple mmofps that wasn't pay to win and consistently fun, this was it.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it is filled with children who spam the mic and complain, but you can always mute them, and airheads who think they are immortals among men. However, these problems typically pollute every online game. Overall, it is a fun, free experience, and I intend on playing it for a long time, try it before you judge!","June 3, 2015","true","531.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I lag like hell currently in the game.\n2) In the beta, after 15-20 minutes my laptop HEATS UP SEVERLY and shuts down on its own which could end up ruining computers.\n3)You guys REALLY need to decrease and improve the recoil of ALL the guns. Every time I shoot a gun I feel like I am some kind of a terminator who has gone full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and on steroids. I can't shoot at a thing properly withou shooting something else. So PLEASE decrease the recoil.

Most people like to point out the terrible aspects of the game, hackers, glitchs, etc. I've read as many comments as I could before I took a handfull of sleeping pills can decided to write this. Most people expect this to be a free CS:GO or COD. The fact of the matter is... its not and never will be. This game was made for FUN, not to be perfect, thats why its FREE... not $59.99. Anyway, it really bothers me when incompetent people write reviews like "don't play it" with no initial caps, not reasoning, and no reason for saying it. Most of the people who write these reviews have 0.3 hours on the game... I... but.................................................. I can't. I only have 3.9 hours (at the time of this review) as I broke my laptop, though I had a good view of what the game is like and how its played. It has easy to remember controls, great mechanics, and a multitude of game modes to try. This game had a little bit of something for everyone, so if you going to write a negative review remember:\nUse initial caps\nUse correct English (or the language said review is written in)\nDon't be completely incompetent\nHave atleast two hours of gameplay\nDon't be close minded\nAnd PLEASE spell things right... its sad it really is\n\nIf you got this far you can read... congrats","April 17","true","15.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is so bright that one can read a newspaper. This light is caused by tiny sea algae, the Dino-flagellata. Sometimes the lightened surface has a diameter of more than 1.5 km.\nAlgae are used in many wastewater treatment facilities, reducing the need for harmful chemicals, and are used in some power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.\nRed algae are important members of coral reefs. Red algae are unusual among the algae because they can include in their cell walls calcium carbonate which makes the plants hard and resistant to wear.\nBrown algae are found mainly in the tidal zones of temperate to polar seas, but some exist in the deep ocean. Among the brown algae are the largest and most complex of the algae; well-known forms include the giant kelp and the free-floating sargassum weed.\nAlgae have chlorophyll and can manufacture their own food through the process of photosynthesis.\nKelps are the largest algaes. They can be more than 200 feet.\nIt is the major food for fishes.\nThe oceans cover about 71% of the Earth’s surface, yet algae produce more than 71% of the Earth’s oxygen; in fact, some scientists believe that algae produce 87% of the world’s oxygen.\nThey also help remove huge amounts of Carbon Dioxide.\nOxygen was poisonous to the organisms that populated the early Earth. By producing oxygen, the first algae may have created the greatest toxic waste crisis in history.\nFossilized Algae are used to make dynamite.\nAlgae may be able to help save the planet.","April 11","true","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

The fact that I have to pay tons of games to earn game points, only to realize that I can only have that gun for a week just sucks. Everything costs so much, and requires dedication to play this kind of game, All mannerisms of customization is cool, but when those customations actually alter gameplay aside from the guns bothers me. A guy who's really good at the game gets rewarded, whereas other players who aren't the best get punished by low gamepoints, leading in no helmets, guns, kevlar vests, or even a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dog.

Well, you'd be wrong.\nThe game in its current state, with the old F2P cliche of being handed the worst guns in the game and a not-at-all outstanding gameplay despite the creative and often-tactical features (such as rappelling or using an attack dog), is absolute garbage. I'd recommend staying away from the game unless you're thinking of forking out some money to skip the rage-inducing starters. Money that'd be better spent on something else.","September 2, 2013","false","1.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"
