If you played this after playing later entries like Double Agent or Chaos Theory, or (god help you) Conviction or Blacklist, you might encounter some difficulty getting used to this game's quirks and its overall non-streamlined nature compared to later entries. Give this game a little patience, however, and it will reward you with a rich story and a satisfying stealth experience. However, if you want a more refined and near-perfect stealth experience, you might want to pass this game up in favor of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.","January 9, 2014","true","8.7"," 84 of 89 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","84","89","0","0"

Does the game still hold up as one of the pioneer hardcore stealth games to this day? ...Yes, yes it does.\n\nYou play as Sam Fisher, a Splinter Cell in the secretive OPs agency known as 3rd Echelon. You are shadow, invisible, a ghost...and an excellent infiltrator. Should you be captured, you would cease to exist to the general public. With the credo realized, you must play this game as if the light will burn you alive. You will slowly creep through various locales finding ways to circumvent guards or silently take them out. You are provided a generous amount of tools and gadgets to help you in this cause. Be it sticky cameras, wall mines, to snake cameras...you will always find a use for the tinkets possessed by Sam.\n\nThe game is pretty unforgiving in terms of stealth. There are 5 ratings of exposure to light you can be in at once and depending on your current position will determine how fast a guard realizes it is a bionic commando versus a mosquito buzzing around. There is also an invisible noise detection level which varies depending on the surface you creep upon. You can flatten yourself against a wall to be even more hidden and use distractions such as light switches to pull unexpecting guards to their sleepy fate.\n\nOne aspect that still amazes me is that you can sneak through most levels without ever touching a guard or being detected. Granted, since this game needs to have a little bit of variation from the normal stealth routine...you'll find yourself in a couple of mandatory shootouts. These occurances are few and far between and help break the typical slow creep and crawl you'll be doing through most of the game. Music and sound play a big part with music dynamically ramping up in intensity when guards are becoming alerted to your prescence to heavy rock when a battle is unavoidable. Ambience of halogen lights and crickets chirping as well as cars passing by will be your typical tune when you are a ghost.\n\nTechincally speaking, the game looks great if you do a few simple tweaks in the game's .ini files. I personally could not see the CG cutscenes without sacrificing my graphical tweaks but just watch them on YouTube and you'll still get the full effect. A small price to pay for 1080p and anti-alising. The game runs stable at 60fps and looks fairly decent for its time. Volumetric lighting and partial physics exist here.\n\nI can fully recommend Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell for anyone looking for an actual stealth game where slow and steady certainly and almost always wins the race.","September 1, 2014","true","12.6"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","47","49","0","0"

The graphics are pretty good for a 2002 release, and the gameplay is solid enough to be fun. Back in the day it was kind of a big deal, but nowadays many elements feel dated: the levels are very linear, the story is forgettable, the music is unremarkable and there's no content besides the main campaign.  I recommend it for fans of the series or the stealth genre for historical reasons, but for everyone else, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the one to play. It's a good deal when you buy it with the Elite Echelon Pack which comes with SC, SC:CT, SC:DA and Conviction.\n\nAlso a quick note: The PC port was made with old Nvidia cards in mind, so on most modern hardware you'll be missing many of the special effects the original Xbox version had, as it falls back to a generic setting. The lack of this generic setting on the sequel (Pandora Tomorrow) is the reason why it's not on sale on Steam.","July 2, 2015","true","15.9"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","6"

There are many ways to approach problems and I very much enjoyed playing cat and mouse with my victims while being completely undetected. The setups are mostly well-thought out and the variety of mechanics keep it interesting. I dislike being forced into story-driven firefights so often, but at least the gun mechanics are up to it. The music is somewhat generic and the story seems to be sort of lackluster in that it's hard to care about the characters or what's happening to them.","August 4, 2013","true","21.2"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/recommended/13560/","Tribeman","Tribeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tribeman/","452 products in account","Splinter Cell, a Stealth Action game very much like Metal Gear Solid, except not nearly as over-the-top ridiculous awesome (although this game is pretty awesome). You play as Sam Fisher, America's resident badass to prevent major world conflict (particularly war) and save the lives of many many people. Sam is a no-nonsense guy who is VERY good at his job.\n\nStory: 9/10\nThe story is pretty good, a little cheesy at times but good nonetheless. You are basically traveling across the world infiltrating places (EVEN THE CIA) in order to find out more information about your enemies. Sam is an NSA agent, part of Third Echelon, which is supposed to be super top-secret, the kind that if you are caught, it will cause an international crisis because you are probably breaking a few treaties.\n\nSound: 10/10\nSound is a MAJOR element of the game. The effects are pretty good and whatnot, and "Name of the Game" by Crystal Method is a kickass song. I'm giving this a 10 because the game relies on you being STEALTHY, which means sneaking and timing and making minimal errors, prepare to save often!\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nConsidering the game was released in 2003, the graphics are way ahead of its time! You use the element of surprise and hide in the shadows in order to achieve your objectives. This combined with the sound factor from above basically make you a modern day ninja with night vision and death at your fingertips.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nA little complicated at times, things aren't always so obvious, and that is a really good thing. The game is really easy if you know what to expect, so on your first playthrough be prepared to have a lot of "WTF" moments. With everything flowing together so well, you really find yourself immersed and FEELING like Sam Fisher. When you have to run, your heart will race. When you have to be quiet, you will find yourself holding your breath. This game is truly magnificent for its time.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nNaturally, I would give this a 10/10, but I have one major gripe. The xbox version came with FREE DLC, which were 3 additional levels after the end of the game. We don't get those on PC. Apparently there is a way to grab them, I think it was supposed to come with a 1.3 patch if you also have Chaos Theory (Splinter Cell 3) installed, I didn't try though. The game isn't any less good because of it, just a little depressing.\n\nI should also like to note, if you are looking at the sequels, Steam doesn't have Splinter Cell 2, Pandora Tomorrow. There is apparently a PC version you can go buy or something, so I'm not sure why it isn't on Steam, it is depressing, so until we get it, enjoy playing Chaos Theory and so on.","December 19, 2013","true","9.5"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","2"

Or making a distraction and hiding in shadows as the investigate, then moving along or knocking them out. I feel awesome. I feel like frikin' James bond, but cooler and better with less sex. The story isn't normal Tom Clancy standards, but not as bad as Call of duty (which is just TERRORISTS TERRORISTS SHOOT SHOOT BLAH!). I highly recommend this game to anyone.

Probably around 6 years old. Most of the time I didn't know what to do, or how to really play the game, but I understood the general concept. Playing the game has made me relive old memories and it's still a good game to this day.\n\nSplinter Cell, the first out of 6 games in the series is a good gem. Released in 2003, this game was quite worth the time. I'm quite surprised by the A.I. in this game due to it being an older game. The A.I. is generally smart and gives quite a challenge even on the easiest difficulty being normal. There are about 10 missions or so, but each mission is realtivley long and you will most likley die alot in the beginning as you need to get a good feeling for the game before you actually get into it. Most likley you'll have to watch a couple videos for throughout certain points in the game. Generally every mission has its challenge, but it's still very fun.\n\nThe sneaking aspect in this game is something that I have really never seen in a stealth game. Splinter Cell only offers this type of stealth in there games, where you have to be quiet at all times, move carefully every second and plan your tactics strategically and quickly as possible. Conviction and Blacklist didn't quite follow this same design for a stealth shooter but still made it very fun with a different design altogether. Meaning, the first splinter cell, pandora tommorw and chaos theory are quite unique to their design and make it worth playing.\n\nLets get into the game itself. The year is 2003. You play as Sam Fisher, a former agent of the CIA is now recruited into americas newest division agency, third echoleon. Along his side is Lambert, a former friend of Sam who helped on previous missions in other agencies like the CIA, and Anna Grmistodder. (I maybe wrong about the CIA part but I have good feeling he's related to that field.) She's a computer hacker that serves the agency and aids Sam in information about various things.\n\nThe story itself is quite interesting. It isn't anything too fancy, I haven't beaten the game yet but it is quite interesting as it dives into the political world of countries and the struggles that occour when new leaders or dictators rule over a country. Essentially this isn't any different as the basic story is stopping a dictator gone mad after realising the crimes he has committed. The game breaks this up over ten missions and generally the plot gets a bit more interesting each mission. The gameplay ties into this generally well, but it's more fun as the stealth feature gives it a unique feeling as this game masters the genre of stealth very well. You'll even find yourself going back to some missions to see what you could of done differently, or maybe even see if you're up to a harder challenge. This game makes it so it isn't too hard, but nothing like a cake walk. Generally there are times where you may get frustrated, but once you realise your abilities and how you can tie them in any situation, the game becomes generally easier and just fun to play overall. It may seem that this game wants you to think logically. Essentially, yes, it does want you to use your head and think outside the box a bit from time to time, but it makes it fun to the point where you don't have to worry to much on whether you'll be able to reach your objective.\n\nOverall, this game is reccomended for people who like a challenge, as well as stealth games in general. This game is quite unique and in my opnion, games like these should be made more often rather then the shooters or stealth games we get nowa days.\n\n9/10","February 16, 2015","true","20.0"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","21","28","4","0"

There's a very good reason Tom Clancy's name is on it, and that 10 years after it was released, it's still worth money...because it's awesome :)  Different missions require different playing strategies which challenges the gamer to a variety of styles.  It's also filled with secrets that don't always become obvious to the user at first glance, and it requires you to think about your next move.  Plus your character gets to do interesting things like rappell down walls, use night or thermal vision, remain undetected, interrogate or manipulate npc's, shimmy underneath moving trains etc.  Mandatory training in the game, prior to the first mission ensures you are confortable with the controls, before everything counts.

Sam FIsher(the character you play as),former Navy SEAL officer and Persian Gulf War,is recruited by the NSA to work with it's new division,Third Echelon. He is dispatched to Tbilisi to investigate the disappearence of 2 CIA officers. He finds out that a man named Vyacheslav Grinko(another antagonist)removed their subdermal tracking devices and tracks him down to the defense ministry,finding out that Nikoladze is doing an illegal operation in Azerbaijan. Sam goes to an oil rig and finds that NATO forces are sending fighter jets to bomb the rig,he finds Piotr Lejava and gets his suitcase,which has a laptop containing an encryption key to"The Ark". The information is revealed to have come from a mole in the CIA,so Sam goes to the CIA HQ to investigate,and interrogates Mitchell Dougherty,finding that his OCD caused him to backup data on an insecure laptop,which was exploited by a network owned by Kalinatek. He goes to Kalinatek and finds Ivan,and gets his encryption key. He goes to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar and finds that the Chinese general Feirong is working with Nikoladze,and that American soldiers are going to be executed on live TV. He rescues the soldiers,and kills Grinko in a firefight. He goes back to the Chinese Embassy and forces Feirong to shre information stored on his computer,which reveals that Nikoladze fled back to Georgia. Sam goes back to Georgia and finds Nikoladze in the Presidential Palace,where he narrowly escapes being killed,with Lambert's arranged blackout saving him.

You can technically do all the things you can do in the newest one. It is fairly easy, challenging at times but not so hard, it has nice realistic take on missions, you infiltrate get the orders and choose your path in whether stealthy killing, assault or no killing. All in all it was good experience, the story wasn't bad as well. However the aiming in this game is ridiculously horrible, even after you wait for the reticle to close you might spend a whole magazine trying to shoot a light, I dunno who saw him fit for the field and if you try to snipe, oh man you need to battle with the thing to get a shot, but It's cool there are alternate ways to shooting.

Though the use of stealth is a bit odd, it dosent take away, that goining in guns blazing isnt the best option. While the games leads you to use stealth, the game suffers from a few bugs and glitches that not ruin but mess up the stealth element to the game (these are minor and aren't game breaking).\n\nBug/Glitches/Mechanics:\n1. In some levels while shadow are your form of disguise and to hidde bodies and yourself there are some areas that, are pitch black yet when standing in it, the Ai will detect you and investigate or spot you all at once.\n\n2. The Ai's field of View is, wide; sneaking up to someone from their side, in a dark or lit room will alert them atomaticly, going from behind is your best bet. this also comes to attcking or passing by them from above.\n\n3. The Ai have anodd jerky movment to them that, if you were to attacking from behind, the Ai might spin quickly and spot you, this also comes to their patrol pateren as they might stutter in movment.\n\n4.Your detection meter is useful to know when enemies can see you or not, but also suffers a glitch or bug, no matter how dark you hidding spot is if your tick mark passes the first bracket from the dark end then eneimes will be courious or spot you. Meaning you'll have to stay in total darkenes to avoid beeing seen.\n\n5. Your gun, the five seven silenced pistol, is very inacuarate, you have to wait a total of 5 sec before your shot matches the cross hair, or else you'll shoot every where excepte your target.\n\n6. To grab enemeis attention, you have to walk extremly close to you target and get their attention, or throw or shoot something close to their body in order for them to move, but sometimes they might converge to investigate where your hidding.\n\nSummary:\nOverall the game is very fun, the game lacks flexability to play an absolte stealth run (where as you dont kill or knock out anyone). The game instead would rather want you to kill enemies if possible and/ or knock them out if possible. This game is an old title while my review sounds as if I dislike the game I dont, try the game its fun, just dont expect to pass the entier game without alerting any gaurds or having to kill or knockout any non objective based Ai.","August 4, 2015","true","22.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

A nice meter in the down right corner tells you if you are a ninja or a Christmas tree.\nThe enemies can interact with the environment in numbers of ways. Like they search for you if they had seen you and might call others for help.\nStealth is the key in this game and you do not have enough firepower to shoot through the game (although possible but not recommend).\n\nIt took me about 6 hours to get to the end on normal difficulty with a few retries because failing some levels which never frustrated me.\n\nSound\nSound is important in this game and has descent ones. You recognise most of them instinctively to know what is going on in the world.\nSometimes you hear a nice background music to set the mood.\nIn combat you do get the same tune everytime which is slightly annoying.\nThe guns Sam carries are most silent and therefore there is nothing interesting for the sounds to note here. You do get some nice fireworks though.\n\nThe Goodies\nStill got the looks.\nStill plays as a unique game.\nStory is easy and fast, most of the time told by news reports (cut scenes).\nNice unique variety of levels. Makes most use of the game mechanics. Especially the end game.\nSam Fisher.\nIrving Lambert.\nSam Fisher finds the news funny.\n\nThe badguys\nAI sometimes sees you, even when you're in the dark.\nA badly done death.\nIs it bad this list ends here.\n\nClosure\nTom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a great game and the first of many. I played this game on the PS2 back in the day and still is one of my favorite games of all time and it surprised me the game plays very well for today's standards.\nAs always I prefer gameplay over graphics even though I mentioned the latter first.\nFor anyone who is a fan of this gerne, this game really fits in your collection.\nEven though the AI can be wonky, it is still fun to play with.\nThat is all I will and can write from the top of my head from my not so first impressions and to the end of the game.\nTo bad Pandora Tomorrow, the sequel got removed from Steam, but from the early days I can tell it is nice game and if you can get it to work (there are some hints in the Community section here somewhere) you will not be disappointed.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading. Hope it helped anyone to decide if the game is worth getting. (got the whole package on a summer sale) and stay off the streets, I mean be stealthy and infinite goggles on.

There are different types of stealth and the kind that I hunger for is actually rare these days.  Most games have stealth as an option but I never see it as the only way to progress.  Options are nice but I love it when the game punishes you for being spotted.  Forget about shooting your way through.  Guns are literally only used to take out lights.  Anything else is a travesty.  Hardcore stealth like this is very few and fare between.  Which is why Splinter Cell is one of my favorite game series.  So much nostalgia sneaking past guards in very dark places.  Using your wits and the shadows to sneak by.  Hell some missions flat out failed you if your spotted and why the ♥♥♥♥ not when the entire premise is that you weren't supposed to be there.  Taking out a single guard requires timing and strategy as just taking him out isn't enough.  Finding a good place to hide his body is critical.  Hell some missions were so strict that taking out anyone was mission failure.  I cannot stress enough how much I love it!  The earlier SC games were a treasure that I will always love.  Sad that Pandora Tomorrow isn't on steam because without that we have to skip to Chaos Theory and after that things will never be the same for this series.

The game that launched so many ships, and has attained the status of classic for the stealth game genre...\n\nThe very first entry of the serie, sadly, aged pretty poorly. Having only played it relatively recently, I don't have the nostalgia googles most people have(mostly because it was on a console I didn't own when it came out, and one I didn't bother to get). So I need to adress the fact this game has a lot of issues. Controls are horribly wonky to the point of being irresponsive at times. A lot of game mechanics are actually pretty broken like the segment where you must avoid being sniped in a minefield, and you will get hit even in complete darkness if the game feels like it wants to do so. The control scheme itself shows it was thought with console in mind, and isn't instinctive nor convenient. As for graphisms, well... You know. But graphisms are probably the the last of your worries.\n\nIt's not a bad game, mind you, but for today standards, it's certainly not a good one. At best, it's mediocre, and it's there either for nostagics, or for people who want to get it due to its classic status to know what they have missed a few years back.\n\nI suggest you get it in a pack, to understand the origins of the franchise, and how it evolved from there, and for a very low price, which shouldn't be too hard. Understand what you're buying though, because no matter what, you will be disapointed(unless you wear the aforementioned nostalgia googles).\n\nI only recommend the game out of the proverbial classic status, because it's a game one should at least play once, just for educational purposes. See how it began, why it, and other stealth games, evolved the way they did, and measure how far down the road they went.\n\nRemember kids, this is how the light bulbs genocide started.","May 27","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That doesn't mean it's bad, it just means it's the starting point of an excellent series.

By today's standards, the gameplay is absolutely atrocious. It amounts to little more than hiding in shadows (that don't even conceal you 25% of the time) and either sneaking past, or attempting to knock out enemies. The latter usually results in the enemy somehow psychically knowing you're there and blowing a hole in your face.\n\nIf you're looking for the best game in the series to play, definitely go with Chaos Theory, as it's better in literally every possible way.\n\ntl;dr: Clunky as hell, psychic AI, buy it for the story and characters and nothing else","October 25, 2015","true","0.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I remember wanting to play this back when it came out on PS2, but I never got around to it. I gotta say that the game has aged rather well. It looks great and runs flawlessly with no visual bugs. I did find myself using quick-saves and quick-loads a lot. Sometimes the grab option doesnt show up when I sneak behind enemies, so they end up turning around and alerting everyone. There are some neat gadgets you can use to strategically take out enemies in different ways. You can shoot a distraction camera which attracts enemies by making noise and then takes them out with gas when they get close.\nMy only major complaint is that the tutorial never tells you that you can steady your sniper-scope aim by holding down the right mouse button. I didnt realize this until the final level of the game.\nAnyway, I got a good 12 hours of play out of this, and its usually dirt cheap when its on sale.","November 1, 2012","true","13.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Along with lots of costumization in the files.\n\nGraphics Quality\nFor a 2002 game looks pretty solid, as expected from Unreal Engine! The cutscenes don't work properly on Windows 10 thought, forcing us to either use third-party mods (that can break the game further) or play in Window Mode (like I did).\n\nPerformance\nPerformance is solid, a toaster can run this game.\n\nEngine Rating: 4/5\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\nNotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs).

At least if you're on Windows 10.  The worst issue is that video cutscenes flicker, flash and stutter unwatchably.  There is a fix for this, a DirectX8-DirectX9 converter from ENB, which fixes the video issue, but for me it made the game itself not work at all.  It may be playable on older versions of Windows, especially if you don't have a wide-screen monitor ... but these days, really, who doesn't have a wide-screen monitor?  Control assignments are a bit weird, too, and often things break if you try to reassign them to something more rational.\n\nI actually tried this out because I was given Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow for PS2, hated it due to control issues, and wanted to find out whether it was any more playable on PC.  So far, the answer is no.\n\n(About Pandora Tomorrow, by the way ... the breaking point for me was when I got through the first major mission successfully, started the second in which you are issued a FN F2000 rifle instead of your trusty FN Five-Seven pistol by any other name, and promptly discovered that the game makes it impossible to hold the rifle's sights on a five-foot target at fifteen yards.  Which, frankly, is completely freaking ridiculous, the absolute worst example of game-imposed artificial klutziness I've ever encountered.)","April 17","false","9.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

The story i found very boring and uninteresting i was just skipping through the cutscenes after the oil rig mission i couldn't care less the spinter cell games never really had strong stories.\nI just focused on the gameplay and after beating it now a second time after a few years since i first played it my opinion of the game hasn't changed. I do think that there are much better stealth games out there and i do think this game is dated. The game is not easy and can be very frustrating at times and it required a lot of trail and error and alot of quick saving and quick loading which the sequels have also fixed because you didn't do those things very often. The game is also very crpytic as to telling you where you need to go and does a poor job of directing the player in the right direction and the level design is very average there isn't really any memorable levels or sequences. The game is not bad i just didn't have a lot of fun with it and i wished i was playing the sequels pandora tomorrow and chaos theory instead which i feel are much better games. I recommend it if you want to see how the franchise started and how it evolved but if you are just  looking to play a good stealth game there are far better options.

This is the first of 6 splinter cell games and is probably the most memorable one in my opinion though i've only played through the first 3 but i've seen gameplay of all. If you have only played Conviction or Blacklist which are the two latest ones, then you are going to be in for a shock of how difficult and hardcore the earlier games are, you have to actually sneak around the place and stick to the shadows, it is a game where you will constantly have to autosave and re-attempt sections multiple times before you get it right but that's what makes it so great, you can't go all in guns blazing because you will die in 10 seconds completely unlike conviction and blacklist. Yes the graphics are pretty terrible especially the cutscenes given the game was made in 2002 but the shadow system is better in this one than pandora tommorow and it has got a pretty good storyline with memorable level layouts, more so than even chaos theory which many would agree is the best one out of them all.","December 31, 2013","true","27.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

One of my biggest issues was the tutorial, it was long and repeditive and done a terrible job. It makes it seem as though you can't make a sound around enemies without them noticing you, but, in reality they are very lax. The tutorial dosn't use your night-vision goggles at all causing me to forget about them all together and just think the game's brightness was terrible creating a horrid experiance.  Many times there is no way to get around enemies/civillians without being noticed or killing them, unless you knew about the other take downs or rolls that the tutorial neglected to even mention their existance (I never did figure out how to use any of these things since most tutorials online are for console versions).\nEven if I pretend the tutorial didn't screw the game for me, it's still not a good game, it has a terrible sense of direction, where you have to go is hidden in behind bushes in areas you wouldn't even go near, the map they give you in the pause menu only has numbers, no lables and they expect you to know which number you are at and which one you are going to go to even after only telling you the place's names and there are commonly multipe directions you can go (not all go to the same spot) and often the wrong way will have doors with keypads or gaurds making you think it's the right direction.\nI could spend the rest of my life griping about the first level alone, so I'll finish with saying: Even going past all this, I didn't like it. The game was just walk 10 feet shoot out a light knock out the gaurd hide and hide the body (move it away from other gaurds trails) then rinse and repeate. But if you were lucky, sometimes you wouldn't have to kill the gaurd, just follow his trail and hide when he turns around then move on. No strategy No fun just follow a confusing and knock out the guards you see along the way.","February 9","false","13.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

It is possible to get around the spotlight by killing the guards, but its just a real hassle to line up the shots properly to do so.\n\nAs for the rest of the game I think it starts out ok but the Guard AI gets progressively more psychic and psychotic.

That's not just me, that's pretty much all the other negative reviews for this game. Amazing. I really hope its not a bunch of fanboys meticulously sifting through reviews and downvoting all of them, because all the negative reviews essentially have no helpful percentages despite having pretty good points, so it must seem that way. So if you're about to thumb this down because your idea of a good time is "splinter cell and chill", don't. Seriously. "Is this helpful" does not mean "do you hate their informed opinions".\n\nReview:\n\nI wonder how people can review this game calling it "classic" or "unforgettable". They're not wrong, but I think its an unforgettable, classic blunder of a game. I'll start with the pros, at least.\n\nPros:\n- The gadgets at your disposal are nice, although I never used the cameras and rarely use the fiber optic.\n- Animations are fairly top-notch for the time it was made in\n- The thermal-camera being used to see fingerprints was a fantastic idea\n- Interesting "movement intervals" mechanic to adjust speed.\n- The levels aren't always detailed but they are varied enough to not be uninteresting.\n\nAnd now the Cons:\n\n- Terrible stealth detection. There were more than a few times when being in complete darkness did nothing to hide me from enemies. There were a few unavoidable patrols that kept somehow spotting me in complete shadow.\n- The lighting has no rhyme nor reason on your light bar. Sometimes a dim light nearby would barely register, but sitting in shadow would shoot it up by 2 or 3 light bars. Sneaking through some areas is basically trial-and-error.\n- Terrible shooting mechanics. I know this game isn't a shooter, but it tries too hard at times to be one. There are some unavoidable "horde mode" attacks throughout the game. The "aim decay" is so ridiculously high that firing accurately at enemies is impossible. I've been sniped by enemies with AK's across long corridors that I can barely hit with one semi-auto shot. There are also times where peeking out to shoot an enemy is impossible since they shoot you dead before you even see their hitbox.\n- The climbing system is broken. Getting off of a ladder/pipe/verticle climbable is impossible. If I'm missing something, tell me, because it's infuriating. The walljumping is nice at times but incredibly finnicky. The split jump is hardly useful. The last level is the worst when it comes to this. The beginning area requires absolutely perfect jumps to get up the cliff, and I had to reload more than 20 times to get it done.\n- Player speed is either too slow or too fast. If an enemy is patrolling, you can't move fast enough to catch up and knock them out without alerting them.\n- The alarm system sometimes screwed me over. Even after taking down every single guard and hiding bodies in places it would be impossible to find them, I'd still get "body alerts" every so often. How?!? There's nobody to find the bodies!\n- The story is completely forgettable. Oh look, another angry guy who is close-enough-to-the-middle-east-or-russia-to-be-evil-but-not-so-much-that-its-another-cliche-middle-eastern-or-russian-guy. Oh look, characters that have no arc, people dying I don't care about... The main character is only barely passable as one. Each level was just trip after trip to different places hunting down cheap russian/chinese bullet fodder and pressing buttons.\n- I had to use walkthroughs far too much. The few times you do get a map, it's just a useless picture of rectangles connected to each other. No minimap. No directional pointer. Yes, I know, this is supposed to be a hardcore game, but I got lost way too many times.\n- On the flip side, the game is also ridiculously linear. The only reason one could feasibly do a replay is to do something like a "ghost" playthrough or a "no alerts" playthrough (although good luck with that...). There are no multiple paths. No several points of entry. Nothing. It's literally just glorified corridors and rooms with one door in and one door out that you have to go through.\n\nBasically, if I wanted to play a stealth game, I would play the Thief franchise, or Dishonored. Hell, the new Thief 4 game is better than this. At least Thief 4 didn't make me want to break my keyboard. Thief: Gold and Thief 2 are older than this game yet hold up far better in pretty much every sense (minus graphics, although Thief graphics patches can actually give this game a run for its money, funnily enough). Dishonored might be too action-oriented for your tastes, but its far better and far easier to play a nice, challenging "ghost" playthrough rather than a ghost playthrough involving antidepressants and a bottle of hard liquor to soothe the pain Losing a ghost run in the previously mentioned games were because you messed up. In this game, its sometimes the opposite.\n\nSo no, I can't reccomend this game. It's broken in too many ways, and can't hold up through the ages. "But mister review writer!" you might say. "This game is old! You can't be so rough on it!"\n\nNow look here, you nostalgia-sniffing guttersnipe. Thief: Deadly Shadows came out essentially around the same time, and it is less broken, less linear, and less rage-inducing. The controls are clunky, sure, but at least they don't cause me to die in stupid ways. If you wanted to play a stealthy modern game though, there's always Rainbow 6. The old ones are more hardcore than eating a brick, but at least if you fail them, it's your own fault rather than the game's. The newer Vegas games are a little action-y but could be up your alley.\n\ntl;dr Please don't. Some old games just don't hold up through the ages. If you do still like it okay. It's your cup of tea and you can handle it. I on the other hand, couldn't. And I don't think some others might either. There's other 10 dollar stealth games out there. Better ones.","August 23, 2015","false","15.4"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","3","13","2","0"

With that being said, I HATE this game on PC. It's not the hardcore stealth aspects (I love that and did just fine), but the controls are EXTREMELY unintuitive and clunky. I changed them around a bit, but I can't do anything about some things. For example, you basically have to get close enough to smell a guard's ♥♥♥ just to get the option to grab him. By the time the notice pops up, the guard turns around and you're caught. Jumping is a pain in the ♥♥♥, too.\nI ran into a few glitches as well that required me to restart the entire mission like the oil refinery level. A door that was previously locked until near the end when the guy you're after goes through and leaves it open for you was still shut when I got there. I got to maybe halfway through the CIA level on my way to get my gun and I could not get past a maintenance worker in an inventory room. I was in complete darkness and he'd see me everytime from several feet away, but there was no other way through. I said Eff it and deleted the game.\n\nThat being said, I like a lot of things they did with the game. The stealth aspects are quite detail-oriented for its age. Guards react to the sound of your footsteps based on how fast you move, they will turn the lights back on in a room if you turned them off, and they do a decent job investigating any disturbances.\n\nI played Blacklist before this one and I loved it. The controls were far more intuitive (except for when you're trying to get away from a grenade) and you can play it however you want. But I don't have time to play a 12 year old game with controls this bad.","July 21, 2015","false","98.7"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Since then I’ve often revisited it on my old Playstation 2 and even on that machine it has aged remarkably well.\n\nWhen I saw it was available during the recent sale as part of the Elite Echelon Edition package I could not pass up the chance to revisit an old favourite and all-time classic, on a different format. For a game that’s a decade old the graphics still look superb, even more so on PC, which, compared with the Playstation 2 edition, feel much more realistic and nuanced. Granted the PC edition actually has one less mission than the PS2 (the Russian nuclear power plant) but in terms of the narrative it is hardly missed.\n\nAlthough an ardent fan I can only give the original Splinter Cell a 9/10, simply because Chaos Theory was by and far the best entry in the original stealth trilogy. While a game this old may not entice new fans it will certainly delight old fans and stealth/action games enthusiasts in general. During the sales it can be snapped up for less than 2.00 but still, for a game this playable and gripping 4.99 is a steal.","December 5, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can abuse the meter, and make the ai look atrocious, however, jumping, running, or walking in front of them will get they're attention, and unlike other games, ahem (Metal Gear Solid) They stay on the alert once they see you Even though it's pretty funny if you shoot a light out, they say it must be a shadow, which is what they say if they see you, but don't identify you as a person.","July 23, 2012","true","62.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Beware, you will need to use important tactics like sticking to a wall as an enemy passes by you or hiding bodies in the shadows so that other guards will not find them and alert the other troops. You must make sure that as you are moving nearby enemies that you have scrolled your mouse wheel all the way down so that you are really sneaking so slow they will not hear you. Sometimes though, even the slowest speed will alert them, so this is also a game of patience. It may feel at times however that you will not know where to go (these were the days before flashing arrows to point you in the right direction all the time).\n\nGraphics may not hold up to today's standards but this game is around a decade old, so I wouldn't hold that against it. The challenge comes in when you have to maneuver your way through different areas of a level in a manner so that the enemy does not see you. Of course, you could take the other route and kill everyone you come across in order to move to the next stage, but you're going to want to kill them one by one and make sure that you hide the bodies in very dark corners so that guards will not come across them and raise the alarm.\n\nThe plot is good old Tom Clancy: terrorist activities are threatening the safety of American people and war looms on the horizon. It is up to Sam Fischer, a special ops commando trained in the ways of stealth and military combat, and Third Echelon to infiltrate enemy bases and find inteligence, save hostages, eliminate targets, etc.\n\nOverall, 8/10. Great stealth game, but the AI can be pretty annoying to deal with as you may find yourself scratching your head and saying "how the heck did he see me from there?"\n\n","January 20, 2014","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy stealth, then this is the right game for you! Starring Sam Fisher voiced by the famous Micheal Ironside.  Warning ahead of time; the controls and movement is a little clunky. In tight situations, the controls will fail to help you at most times...time your movements correctly.\n\nThe story is amazing, characters are easily enjoyable, even though some of the script is a little cheesy, but still hilarious at most times.  The equipment that you recieve is easy to use. The further that you go through the missions, the more gadgets you get, which is a plus.\n\nThe missions get harder, as you progress. Changing the from lethal to non-lethal, alarms to no alarms.  The security expands and the cameras are harder to avoid.  The game really tests your patience and strategy.\n\nThere are some glitches that can help you in a few missions, when its really not going your way...which reminds me, save frequently.  You're going to run into difficult situations, and saving is your backup.\n\nA good idea if you don't want to get spotted is to shoot out lights, hide bodies in dark areas, and throw objects for distractions.  Stick to the shadows (obviously), thick darkness is your best bet.  Save your ammunition, don't rely too much on your gadgets.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing.

If you enjoy stealth, then this is the right game for you! Starring Sam Fisher voiced by the famous Micheal Ironside.  Warning ahead of time; the controls and movement is a little clunky. In tight situations, the controls will fail to help you at most times...time your movements correctly.\n\nThe story is amazing, characters are easily enjoyable, even though some of the script is a little cheesy, but still hilarious at most times.  The equipment that you recieve is easy to use. The further that you go through the missions, the more gadgets you get, which is a plus.\n\nThe missions get harder, as you progress. Changing the from lethal to non-lethal, alarms to no alarms.  The security expands and the cameras are harder to avoid.  The game really tests your patience and strategy.\n\nThere are some glitches that can help you in a few missions, when its really not going your way...which reminds me, save frequently.  You're going to run into difficult situations, and saving is your backup.\n\nA good idea if you don't want to get spotted is to shoot out lights, hide bodies in dark areas, and throw objects for distractions.  Stick to the shadows (obviously), thick darkness is your best bet.  Save your ammunition, don't rely too much on your gadgets.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing.  Patience is the key...if you don't have then go watch CenterStrain's videos on youtube for a wonderful stealth-through","March 1, 2014","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some maps require you to be Ultra Stealth because you cannot be seen AT ALL which makes it really fun, where as there are some maps that let you to choose, go all out and blast through it, or take your time and stealth the whole thing.\n\nThe weapons are good, using sticky cameras and shock bullets to paralyze your enemys.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mobiuscenturion/recommended/13560/","mobiuscenturion","mobiuscenturion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mobiuscenturion/","84 products in account","My very first Splinter Cell game. No, I didn't play this when I was a kid, I just started the series and plan to play them in order. Talk about being late! Back then I heard this game was aimed to be a Metal Gear Solid 2 killer. Ha! Not even close. Splinter Cell is a great game, just not on par with MGS.\n\nAs you may already know, you are Sam Fisher, a secret agent of Third Echelon, a section of the NSA. A coup has occurred in Georgia, and a man named Kombayn Nikoladze has come into power. The CIA sends in two agents to see if this guy is up to no good. Suddenly they lose contact. That's where you come in. The story is decent and so is the voice acting. Music also sets the mood too.\n\nObviously, stealth is a must in this game. Why? Because #1: you have limited ammo. #2: Sam can get killed easily, even on the easier difficulty and #3: setting off too many alarms will cause the mission to end. This game does not hold your hand, you have to figure how to proceed by yourself. What I like about this game is the use of light and darkness to proceed. There are cases where you can be nose-to-nose with an enemy yet because you're in pitch darkness, he wouldn't notice you. Note, that's an exaggeration, he'll notice if you get too close, so don't actually do it :D\n\nOf course, there are faults. One is the melee attack. There's JUST one: an elbow strike. You can knock out enemies from behind with it, but the real problem is using it face-to-face. When you're sneaking from behind and they turn around and spot you (which will happen very often), it takes two strikes to dispatch them and by the time you do that, they pumped 2-3 bullets (more if it's an assault rifle), bringing down a good chunk of health.\n\nAnother thing is the aiming. For some reason, this highly-trained NSA agent cannot aim his pistol right. As in, even if you're crouched and still, you can still miss. Not a big deal since you're not supposed to kill too much anyway, but it's a problem when you trying to shoot lights out. What I do is that I quicksave before I shoot. The SC-20K is MUCH better. Not only is it more accurate, but you can do a lot of stuff with it, like sniping, shooting non-lethal darts and sleeping gas. And the last thing is once you beat the game, that's it. Fortunately, it's worth a second playthrough. Try it on Hard.\n\nThis game has done a good job of introducing me to the SC series. It's worth the low price now. I want to play Pandora Tommorrow now but it's not on Steam. Please Ubisoft, fix whatever problems it has and re-release it.","September 1, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I know the game is old but I don't think that excuses it from being held to some basic standards.  For example, there are plenty of times when there are no lights in the room but the game's "light detection system" shows the area as being well lit.  Without night vision, it's pitch black, but the light indicator shows full visibility and enemies easily see you.  It's either shoddy design or a nasty bug, but it happens way too often to be excusable in a game that relies on stealth through darkness.  I've died too many times while shuffling through a dark alleyway to find out that every enemy sees me clear as day, and it becomes a game of watching the light indicator to ensure that there are no bugged out lights in your path.\n\nThere's also sound issues.  You can be 20 feet from an enemy and he'll turn when you make a slight mistake.  Normally you are able to move comfortably at a much closer distance, but sometimes enemies have superhuman hearing that ruins your plans.  Another big issue is that when you move diagonally, you have to press 2 keys (W+A/D) and the game registers that as 2 movements, meaning anytime you move diagonally, you move twice as fast and make twice as much noise.  You can work around this by only using W and moving the mouse to turn, but sometimes you need to keep an eye on other enemies and it isn't practical to make the compromise.  Also, it might just be the design of the game, but your stealth walking speed is slower than an enemies normal walking speed, so if your behind an enemy who's walking away, you will not reach him to eliminate him.  You'd think an NSA Splinter Cell would know how to move quickly and quietly but he's slow as a snail.\n\nI would love to enjoy this game and I did for the most part.  I just can't bother myself to finish it when the core mechanic of the game (stealth) is so flawed by bugs.  The quicksave and quickload features got me through 9 hours of this game but I hate that I have to use those features because of the game's problems and not my own mistakes.  If they ever remake this game with a new engine, I'd buy it in a heartbeat but I can't play it as it is.  Stealth games should have working stealth mechanics and this game is just bad enough that I don't want to play anymore.","October 17, 2015","false","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mobiuscenturion/recommended/13560/","mobiuscenturion","mobiuscenturion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mobiuscenturion/","84 products in account","My very first Splinter Cell game. No, I didn't play this when I was a kid, I just started the series and plan to play them in order. Talk about being late! Back then I heard this game was aimed to be a Metal Gear Solid 2 killer. Ha! Not even close. Splinter Cell is a great game, just not on par with MGS.\n\nAs you may already know, you are Sam Fisher, a secret agent of Third Echelon, a section of the NSA. A coup has occurred in Georgia, and a man named Kombayn Nikoladze has come into power. The CIA sends in two agents to see if this guy is up to no good. Suddenly they lose contact. That's where you come in. The story is decent and so is the voice acting. Music also sets the mood too.\n\nObviously, stealth is a must in this game. Why? Because #1: you have limited ammo. #2: Sam can get killed easily, even on the easier difficulty and #3: setting off too many alarms will cause the mission to end. This game does not hold your hand, you have to figure how to proceed by yourself. What I like about this game is the use of light and darkness to proceed. There are cases where you can be nose-to-nose with an enemy yet because you're in pitch darkness, he wouldn't notice you. Note, that's an exaggeration, he'll notice if you get too close, so don't actually do it :D\n\nOf course, there are faults. One is the melee attack. There's JUST one: an elbow strike. You can knock out enemies from behind with it, but the real problem is using it face-to-face. When you're sneaking from behind and they turn around and spot you (which will happen very often), it takes two strikes to dispatch them and by the time you do that, they pumped 2-3 bullets (more if it's an assault rifle), bringing down a good chunk of health.\n\nAnother thing is the aiming. For some reason, this highly-trained NSA agent cannot aim his pistol right. As in, even if you're crouched and still, you can still miss. Not a big deal since you're not supposed to kill too much anyway, but it's a problem when you trying to shoot lights out. What I do is that I quicksave before I shoot. The SC-20K is MUCH better. Not only is it more accurate, but you can do a lot of stuff with it, like sniping, shooting non-lethal darts and sleeping gas. And the last thing is once you beat the game, that's it. Fortunately, it's worth a second playthrough. Try it on Hard.\n\nThis game has done a good job of introducing me to the SC series. It's worth the low price now. I want to play Pandora Tommorrow now but it's not on Steam. Please Ubisoft, fix whatever problems it has and re-release it.","September 1, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Still has its atmosphere (largely thanks to the awesome soundtrack by Michael Richard Plowman) and I personally think SC1 has the best atmosphere of all Splinter Cells. Yes, Chaos Theory has better gameplay, but SC1 made me really think like "If my cover gets blown, I have no chance of surviving" - and you really don't have much chances of surviving. Like Lambert said in the beginning: "Invisibility is your best weapon". The story of SC1 is quite good, nothing really impressive, but my personal SC favourite.\n\nThe artifical intelligence didn't age really well - the AI will sometimes act weird, but nothing really gamebreaking. The only problem with AI I encountered and was annoying was in Kola Cell (which is a level that isn't shipped with Steam version, use one of guides here to find out how to get these three aditional levels), where I could be seen behind the wall.\n\nAnd what about graphics? Well, this is what made me think "The graphics will never get better" back in 2003. Well, they did, but I am amazed to this day what this game is capable of doing with the lights. The shadow shader is still really neat. In my recent replay of this game, I was stunned by the shadows coming from the windows with blinds. Sad thing is, there is still a lot of new games that can't do this.\n\nThe controls are comfortable to use, although it's not natively supporting gamepads (tried X360 and XONE). The default keyboard + mouse configuration is easy to use. At the time, a lot of reviews praised the use of a mouse wheel as a speed regulator. When I first heard about it, I thought I will never get used to it, since mouse wheel is commonly used as a weapon switcher, but I was wrong, I got used to it in about 10 minutes.\n\nWhat else can I say? Buy it, it' still worth it.\n\nBTW don't get mistaken by my playtime (currently 25 hours), I've replayed this game for about 10 times.","February 16","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problem I have is the game is too short. Out of 10 stars I give this game a 9.","February 2","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still has its atmosphere (largely thanks to the awesome soundtrack by Michael Richard Plowman) and I personally think SC1 has the best atmosphere of all Splinter Cells. Yes, Chaos Theory has better gameplay, but SC1 made me really think like "If my cover gets blown, I have no chance of surviving" - and you really don't have much chances of surviving. Like Lambert said in the beginning: "Invisibility is your best weapon". The story of SC1 is quite good, nothing really impressive, but my personal SC favourite.\n\nThe artifical intelligence didn't age really well - the AI will sometimes act weird, but nothing really gamebreaking. The only problem with AI I encountered and was annoying was in Kola Cell (which is a level that isn't shipped with Steam version, use one of guides here to find out how to get these three aditional levels), where I could be seen behind the wall.\n\nAnd what about graphics? Well, this is what made me think "The graphics will never get better" back in 2003. Well, they did, but I am amazed to this day what this game is capable of doing with the lights. The shadow shader is still really neat. In my recent replay of this game, I was stunned by the shadows coming from the windows with blinds. Sad thing is, there is still a lot of new games that can't do this.\n\nThe controls are comfortable to use, although it's not natively supporting gamepads (tried X360 and XONE). The default keyboard + mouse configuration is easy to use. At the time, a lot of reviews praised the use of a mouse wheel as a speed regulator. When I first heard about it, I thought I will never get used to it, since mouse wheel is commonly used as a weapon switcher, but I was wrong, I got used to it in about 10 minutes.\n\nWhat else can I say? Buy it, it' still worth it.\n\nBTW don't get mistaken by my playtime (currently 25 hours), I've replayed this game for about 10 times.","February 16","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But after having played it, I can safely say that I definitely didn't waste money on it.\n\nFirst thing I wanna mention is the surprising amount of detail in this 12-year old game. Everything from Sam's chest moving with his breathing to all the small details in the background. The graphics in this game are really impressive for the time, if a bit dated.\nThe best stealth games I had played before this are the MGS-series, and, while I wouldn't necessarily say that it's better than those, it's definitely in the same league and probably has the best and most detailed stealth system I've seen in a long time. The system works like this: The darker the place you're in, the less likely you are to get spotted, and if the place you're in is too brightly lit, you will be spotted and killed almost instantly. You can lean up against walls, grab enemies from behind and drag them to a dark space to take them out, the amount of things you can do is stunning!\nIn this game, much like in MGS, GUNS are ♥♥♥♥ing GUNS. They will kill you in seconds if you're not careful. Your enemies are almost just as dangerous to you as you are to them. and that's one of the things I love about stealth games; avoiding enemies can be just as exciting, if not more exciting than engaging them.\n\nTo sum-up: If you like stealth games you're definitely gonna have to pick this game up, and if you haven't tried them before, Splinter Cell will make you realize what you've been missing out on.\nI feel obligated to mention though, that the cutscenes ran like absolute crap. It wasn't because the framerate or resolution was low or anything like that. My screen just kept flashing all the time and it never stopped; it felt like I was having a seizure. Now, that may just be because of my PC running Windows 10, but to tell you the truth I have no idea what was causing it. This was only during cutscenes though, the gameplay, as far as I could tell, didn't have any problems like that.","November 17, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
