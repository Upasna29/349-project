It would be helpful if after a victor is declared, the map would be reshown. I try to check the status of the the other three gangs before I advance the game. Many times the game tells me that some other gang won, but for the life of me I don't see how they could have done it.","July 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As for what i got well to be quite frank, its not a good game. Firstly i would like to point out that i only logged 27mins in game, but for good reason the game is simple boring no strategy. The reason for such little game play is cause i beat the game 4 times in a row in 27mins, never challanged. Secondly there is no game here you just build you city up and be the first to level 5 for all your buildings, it is so simple if you just save your money for city upgrades and skip the shares,politics, and police raids=Game Over you win.\nIn summary sorry i bought this game, but if i can stop any others from making this poor choice then i guess it will be worth it, unless your the type of person who likes boring no challange level rusheing types of games then this is your game. If you like fun and emersive games then NO!!! pls do not purchase.","July 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Easy to learn. Be the first to crank everything up and win the prize.\n\nNo fault or problems.

Was confusing to begin with, I didn't know what I was doing and by the time I did it was too late and the other towns were ahead by quite a bit. I didn't really come away feeling like I had a fun time. The music is fine but everytime you click to end your turn there is a gunshot noise that gets a little annoying after the 20th time. They did a good job in making it but I don't think I will be playing this again.","June 1","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its mechanics are simple but intuitive and eventually one finds out that he just wants to play another round just to improve and make a better play style than the previous one.\n\nIt's a great casual and funny game.","June 28, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
