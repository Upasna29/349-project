So, unless you have an old Pentium4 still up and running it's almost impossible to play this game for it will utilize only 1 core of your dual/quad/octacore processor. Theirfore it will take up to 5 minutes to process a turn. And remember...there are 1500 turns in this game. That's a lot of waiting!!!\n\nGreat design and idea, but terrible programming.","August 28, 2014","false","8.7"," 82 of 109 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","82","109","2","1"

They are not quick to learn as the interface isn't exactly friendly. The UI has its own logic. Once you realize what it is, it becomes easier to use. Yet, still not friendly at first.\n\nMy main issue with the game is the considerable time between turns, becoming longer and longer quickly as the game progress, despite being above the recommanded specs. So, quickly, turns by the AI take ages.\nThis problem is made worse by the limited number of actions you are going to make on each turn. Granted, it depends on nation played and what scenario, what are your objectives etc.\nStill, there will be turns where you have little to do. Or maybe even nothing because you have to build reserve before building, assembling armies before war, whatever before doing actions.\nSo you can have two, three turns with limited or maybe no action but the time to process each turn still take longer and longer as the game progress.\nI'm used to Paradox games becoming over the campaign slower and slower with saving. Pride of Nations is, unfortunately, even worse and quickly worse when processing turns.\n\nI wanted to love the game, I believe there are goods ideas but the game engine is in the way. But spending much more time waiting for turns to be processed than actually playing... no... I regret but I can't recommend the game because of that.","December 21, 2015","false","29.9"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

However, also not unlike other AGEOD games, the user interface of the game is not up to the task of the mechanics.  Lists of nations that you have to click to scroll down one at a time, clunky and variable scrolling speeds for a map (and you'll spend a lot of time scrolling across the map), a painfully limited messaging system (you have a new turn, here's 157 new messages....!  There's no filter, no way of focussing things).  It's playable, but it's the kind of game that you would literally need to have a notepad and paper next to you to play properly, because the game doesn't convey enough of the required information itself (or have a built-in system of reminders/overlays that is effective).  The diplomatic UI is particularly obtuse, for a game where (unlike many other AGEOD games) diplomacy is very important.\n\nThe in-game tutorials are also very limited, and nowhere near up to scratch for a game of this type.  They repeatedly refer players back to the manual, but for a game that as far as I know was only released digitally, relying on a manual is a bit silly.  At the very least, make the manual text available in-game, and far more preferably available contextually in-game.\n\nIf you can look past the UI to the game mechanics, it really does like like there's a potential gem here.  I haven't played enough of it to be able to rate the AI, but AGEOD games tend to be fairly strong on this front.  The mechanics look great, the attention to detail in set-up situations and a decent number (4-5) of extra scenarios as well as the grand campaign mean there's a substantial amount of game here, but the tools given to play the game are not up to scratch, and you'll have to persevere through them to get to the gameplay underneath.","April 18, 2015","false","2.6"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

I still really like it. Yes, it is complicated, has a steep learning curve and takes some time to learn, unless you are familiar with AGEODs other fantastic strategy/simulation games. If you enjoy historical simulations/strategy games then you will enjoy playing this game, as long as you are prepared to learn how to play the game. The tutorials will teach you the basics, and there are some videos on Youtube that could also help you out.\n\nI find the game challenging and rewarding. I've clocked up over 140 hours and am happy to add another 140 to that. Other reviewers mention the game runs slowly and crashes often - I haven't encountered this problem to be honest, but yes, it does take a couple of minutes when you click 'end turn' but when you think of how much the computer needs to calculate and execute I find it understandable and don't mind the wait. The game did used to crash occasionally, however, since I have started playing again it has not crashed once in the 11.3 hours in the last couple of days. (Patch 1.04 has just been released recently and I believe this has addressed most of the instability problems).\n\nI'm glad I decided to re-install this gem and am enjoying playing it. I had been playing AGEODs Civil War 2 before getting back to this. CW2 is also great :)","January 28, 2015","true","184.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

If you can master your impatience, this game is as deep as the ocean (in PC game terms), very historical, very cerebral and very satisfying - if you are patient. The turns are slow, but you have to keep reminding yourself that this game in having to process an IMMENSE GLOBAL amount of information: remembering this will makew you more sympathetic and PATIENT! It's a tremendous game for history buffs like me who want to re-write history. The map and detail are rich, the management needs concentration.

Would not have bought it at the original price. I was pleasantly surprised when the game started.\nIn some reviews people complained about being able to load the game. I had no problems and I am using Win 8.1 SL. The key is to leave enough time for the program to startup. It does take a while to load, but if you are patient enough, you will see there is no problem with the startup. Not on my system anyways ...\n\nLike the music, fits with the genre.\nHas a tutorial. Must work through it. Don't try to figure out everything for yourself, unless you like that kind of approach.\n\nDefinitely worth buying on special or for a $10 price tag. More is maybe expecting a bit too much.\n","December 1, 2014","true","0.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"
