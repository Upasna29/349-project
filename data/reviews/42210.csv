It always keeps them coming back for more." - Carolyn Keene\n\nI remember reading Nancy Drew books starting with age 10, alongside classical juvenile mystery series like The Hardy Boys which will later encourage me to read The Knickerbocker Gang by Thomas Brezina, and eventually actual mystery classics like Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Gaston Leroux, Maurice Leblanc and countless others. But Nancy Drew will always hold a special place for me as the one cheesy, meticulous, smart alec; the lady sleuth who introduced me to the world of detective fictions as a childhood memory that I'm very fond of.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Nancy Drew is a girl sleuth of age 18 who likes to poke her nose in mysteries all around. Here in this particular adventure, she is called in to solve a murder that occurred in a high school. A local detective contacted her to offer an undercover position as a student to gather information within the high school and solve the murder if possible. Already experienced in mysteries of the world, Nancy accepts. She is to snoop around the local high school, interrogate other students and collect clues to shed some light into the brutal affair.\n\nSecrets Can Kill is the first instalment of Nancy Drew game series developed by Her Interactive in 1998, which is remastered in 2010. Here, we have the remastered version of the original with its ups and downs. The graphics are definitely better - with a heavy uplift on character animation especially - and countless references to other games scattered around. Voice acting in these series has never been great, but considering this is actually the first in the series one should expect the cheesiest possible. My main complaint is that an already short yet enjoyable game has been cut shorter with some dialogues omitted and puzzles skipped as a tradition of "remastering" old games here too. Still, this wasn't enough to crumble the game down. In its essence, as any and all Nancy Drew games, this one is fun.\n\nThis is an old school adventuring game which sincerely doesn't hold hands with the player even with the easier mode. There are clues and references scattered all around, and if you plan to actually solve this thing yourself, - without a walkthrough - you'd better keep a pen and some paper around to do old school detective work yourself. You'll need your notes to solve puzzles and get a meaning out of scattered riddles. None of the puzzles or clues are actually hard, but it takes attention and some memory. On that manner, this game is an enjoyable brain scratcher.\n\nSadly, 2nd to 6th in the game series have never been remastered, and are quite old to be digitalized, thus they cannot be found in the Steam Store. If you are curious about these earlier games, your best chance of acquiring them seems like being lucky enough to stumble on a retail copy. I'll go fetch myself a decent youtube playthrough to watch them as a worst case scenario, 'cause this underappreciated, charming adventure series do deserve your time. Nothing magnificent or majestic - even a bit lame on the Scooby Doo caliber - but Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill is an enjoyable pass time for an evening for the mystery lovers who'd appreciate some basic old school challenge.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 7","true","6.1"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/42210/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","This is an old school Myst style sort of game, the kind where you click to the right to turn right.  This game is for veteran mystery gamers as some of the puzzles while not daunting can be a bit tricky up to the last puzzle which has 19 steps.  This game is best played with a pen and paper just like a real detective.  The game itself is short but solving the puzzles doing them yourself will take ALOT of time.  There are many fun details in the world, from a jukebox that plays songs to a video game in the diner called Barnacle Blaster that is like Breakout only with barnacles.  This game can be short if online walkthroughs are used, or long if you want to gumshoe it yourself which is alot of fun.\n\nTips:  You get a cellphone that you can use to take pictures of anything in the game, see a clue but unsure if its useful, just take a picture so you can take the clue with you!\nIf you get stuck open up your cell phone and call Ned Nickerson for help.\n\nRating:  8/10  Value:  $4.99","July 17, 2014","true","33.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

I remember needing to switch between to CDs because only half of the locations fit on one disc. It was such a pain, but it was the very first Nancy Drew, and it was fantastic. Without the lag time of needing to switch discs every two seconds, the game is easier and faster to complete. It certainly helps that the graphics got a much needed face-lift. The game is the same as it was, just better looking.\n\nYes, it's a pretty short game. Yes, it's pretty easy. Yes, it's the first of the series. Yes, they get more difficult further along the line. Yes, they're kind of cheesy and a little dorky. But, that's what makes these games so much fun. Here's a helpful tip I learned along the way: take notes and/or screen shots. They're immensely helpful with some of the puzzles.","June 7, 2014","true","7.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I bought this game for the nostalgia really, and I wasn't disappointed. A lot has changed since the 2-D characters meet 3-D background style of the original Secrets Can Kill, but this game is riddled with tons of coded messages, easter eggs, and the like. I've grown out of the series, but it was nice for the little 'throwback."\n\nPROS:\n-Great (and very well executed) story.\n-Beautiful graphics, at least for the bakcgrounds.\n\nCONS:\n-VERY short, I finished it in a go of about 4 or 5 hours I believe.\n-Sometimes it felt too simple\n- Not a whole lot of replay value.\n\nAll in all, I'd probably recommend this game only to young girls and those who grew up with or enjoyed the franchise.","May 31, 2014","true","5.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The puzzles in Secrets Can Kill are not as refined as those in the other games in the series I've played, but it isn't to say I didn't enjoy the game.\n\nI strongly recommend the series.","June 22, 2014","true","3.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

While I can't rec this for other people to play, they still kept true to the spirit of Nancy Drew games.\n\n♥ The dialogue was on point.\n\nI always enjoy the little jokes and quirks that come with the dialogue in Nancy Drew games. I appreciate the fact that I can play the games with my parents and pets in the same room, without seeing my mom flinch, or my dad wince at a curse word or innuendo.\n\n♥ The ending surprised me.\n\nIt was a change from how the Nancy Drew games usually end, though of course it comes with a positive, keep Nancy safe ending. It actually kept me guessing until the end of who killed Jake...!\n\n✘ The puzzles.\n\nThere weren't many in this game and the one that runs throughout the course of the game failed to impress. It wasn't very hard and was so boring having to keep track of letters...they could have taken it a lot further. The most exciting the puzzles became was the one featured when Nancy has a timed, survival event. Bleh.\n\n✘ It didn't take long to play.\n\nCompared to other Nancy Drew games, especially the newer titles, this game took hardly any time at all to play. I disliked how they didn't make the world as full as they usually do...you can go to the diner, school, and aunt's house. There isn't a sense of time passing, no sleeping, no changing of day/night even. It feels very boring.\n\n✘ The graphics made me laugh.\n\nThey're just so bad, even compared to other older Nancy Drew games. The stereotypes - the asian wanting to be a doctor, the jock popping pills, etc. The music that was never in sync and would blare suspense music while simply talking to someone, etc, etc, etc.\n\nOverall I would only suggest buying this if you, like me, want to play every Nancy Drew game.

The game itself I kinda liked (meh, definately a weaker game). Hardly any puzzles, not much to snoop in.....However I can not empahsize how SHORT it is. Usually these games take me 7-10 hours WITHOUT hints or a walkthrough so I can play here and there through a week or so. This game took me barely over 3 hours!!! The entire game was centralized around one main idea that kept giving you "direction"... I could not believe how fast it went even on Senior level. When it got to the end I was thinking, "you are kidding me right?? It cannot be over this fast!? I haven't even done much of anything!?" Really glad I got it for a discounted price for the amount of game play I got from it. Overall I give the game idea/itself a 6/10. The length of it definately a 3/10.\n\nOf course though if you are one of those people (like me) who just has to play ALL of them, then do what you have to.

The size and scope of the game maintain an old-school Nancy Drew feel -- transporting me back to the days when I could beat one of the games in a weekend easily. However, unlike the older games (such as Ghost Dogs and Royal Tower) Secrets Can Kill has all the advancements in gameplay design that make the newer games so much more enjoyable to navigate. Namely, the side-screen scroll feature.\n\nThe game is small, but packed with fun references to other games and the books, and well worth spending a couple of hours on. The only thing I didn't like much was the fact that it focuses on one long, invovled puzzle througout the game, rather than the multitude of smaller puzzles common in newer Nancy Drews. Still, that did help with the old-school feel of things.","August 17, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is close to the original with a lot of identical or formilar dialog, but there are new twists and a different feel to the game compared t the original (cell phone, different item locations/types, SMALL differences in the map set up, ect). Also there are some cute easter eggs for players who attempt to cut ahead in the game before Nancy has been given the chance to truly know the answers to certain puzzles. I would suggest buying this game on sale since compared to other Nancy Drew games the play time is rather short and the remastered version is not quite like owning an original copy from your childhood. It is entertaining and cool how the remastered it so even old 90s kid fans can enjoy the sence of mystery instead of playing an identical game merely patched up. For any die heart Nancy Drew fans Id say go for it, BUT you will get the highest value waiting for the winter or summer sales so you dont need to fork up a whole $7 on a shorter game.

I think the team did a great job at bringing this story into the present level of difficulty and intrigue as the series' newest releases. One of the hit and miss aspects of the original Secrets Can Kill game is the culprit, and I think the remastered edition did this justice by turning it on its head and making it relevant, exciting and, most importantly, logical. It makes sense, which is something the ending in the original game lacked.\n\nMy only qualm with this game is that it was very short, shorter than most games in the ND series. It didn't stop me from enjoying it, not at all, but I finished it in one sitting, which is unusual for these types of games. Usually I stumble upon a puzzle I can't solve, get stuck and, like a champ, rage-quit for a while. (But I always come back).\n\nIf you want an easier to play, updated version of the Secrets Can Kill game, snatch this bad boy up. If you're new to these games and want to experience Nancy Drew at it's finest, I'd rate this one at about mid-level, just because of its length.\n\n(As an aside, my ultimate ND recommendation is Treasure in the Royal Tower.

It is important to note that this version (the version available on Steam) is a remade and revised version of the original game that was released in December 1998. The game was updated with refined graphics, puzzles, and user interface changes and was released in 2010 to match many of the more modern Nancy Drew adventures available at that time. Within this game you assume the role of amaranthine sleuth Nancy Drew and investigate the recent murder of high school student Jake Rogers at Paseo Del Mar High School. Eloise, who is a faculty member of the high school and is Nancy Drew’s aunt, is beside herself and called upon Nancy Drew to stay at her house while the local authorities have Nancy investigate the troubling events transpiring at Paseo Del Mar. It’s up to Nancy to go undercover as a new student while questioning others to find out why someone would want to murder Jake Rogers.\n\nNancy Drew adventure games are not your typical triple “A” open world RPG or FPS. As the genre mentions it is a “point and click adventure game” where one searches for clues, solves puzzles, questions suspects, and unravels a larger mystery through deductive reasoning. The game is not designed to be an engrossing universe or narrative. Rather, for me, is designed as a light-hearted story for anyone of all ages. It serves as a nice break from larger games and is easy to simply kick back to, relax, and enjoy. The plot-line of these games typically takes about 7-12 hours to unravel depending on your sleuthing skills.\n\nThis game in particular has a more realistic atmosphere that is a bit more intense compared to other Nancy Drew titles. You need to quickly comb the entire high school finding hidden messages and snooping into others’ lives before a murderer catches on to your cover and ends your investigative career for good. The dialogue, story, and game mechanics are well done and have enabled this original classic of the Nancy Drew series to age well. For those wondering if they should buy the original 1998 game versus this 2010 remake: I personally enjoyed the “antique” feel of the original classic made in 1998 and did not like all of the story changes that they made in this 2010 revision. However, if you don’t feel like constantly swapping out 2 discs (the joys of older games!) the 2010 version is still an enjoyable and an above average Nancy Drew title. If this is your first time looking at the Nancy Drew game series, I tend to recommend some of the more classic titles, which are in my opinion, of higher quality and contain some of the best narratives in the series (keep in mind though that the graphics and game engines of these games may be a bit more dated, being from the earlier 2000s). To understand if you might like these games I recommend checking out some of the more iconic titles: The Curse of Blackmoor Manor, Danger on Deception Island, Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake, or Treasure in the Royal Tower (the latter of which is not available on Steam). During the summer or holiday sales many of the Nancy Drew games are easily $2-$5 on Steam so just wait until then and you can check out these games as a nice cheap break from the usual FPS or RPG. Happy sleuthing!\n","May 21, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was...surprisingly...short. It was interesting, It's not my favorite game in the series, but for someone just starting out with ND games, it's a nice introduction to the series. It only took me 3 1/2 hours to beat this one, so as I said, short. Aside from that though, there's nothing particularly wrong with the game. Just expect others in the series to be longer and a little more complicated.","July 29, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The answer to every puzzle falls into your lap, and there were so few puzzles anyway that it made me feel like I was just going through the motions. Plus Ned gives you the exact solution whenever you just ask for a hint, and that really bugs me because I love little hints, but I hate having my hand held. I finished the game without even having to confront most of the clues I found throughout it, and it felt weird that these "clues" are actually disconnected from the case your trying to solve. I beat this game in like two hours, the other two hours you see here are from leaving the game on to watch a movie.\n\nSo eh. I wouldn't bother with it. If you bought it with the collector's pack like I did, that's fine, give it a shot. But don't expect very much.","December 29, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the most unhappy I've ever been with a Nancy Drew game.\nThe entire game pretty much rests on you spending hours being a code cracker and figuring out an absurd amount of codes left around a school. I can enjoy a good code in a ND game but code breaking is the entire game, save for 3 for 4 miminal item puzzles.\nNot only does the game revolve around decoding messages, the areas are small and unpopulated, the characters are bland, and it is the shortest Nancy Drew game I've ever come across. I was honestly shocked when the game just ended.\nThe most disappointing Nancy Drew game I've ever played.","April 17","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
