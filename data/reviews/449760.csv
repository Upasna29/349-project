Also, since there is no penalty for mistakes or reward for accuracy (e.g. new puzzles are only unlocked when previous stages are cleared perfectly), there is no reason to not resort to trial and error when the logic needed to solve a puzzle becomes more complicated.\n\nPuzzle Quality:  Several puzzles had (and some may still have) multiple solutions, which was not the developer's intention.  I'm sure that designing good logic puzzles with only one solution is no easy matter, but it's not very difficult to find these alternative solutions, so I'd say that this game needed a bit more attention before release.  Additionally, with the exception of the occasional larger puzzle, the game doesn't seem to become much harder as the player progresses.  With neither difficulty scaling nor new gameplay elements, Tenrow simply isn't engaging.\n\nThe developer is already talking about a sequel with another 40-50 levels and an algorithm for autogeneration.  Such an algorithm might justify its own game, but the 40-50 handcrafted levels would be better added to this one instead.\n\nIf every $3 puzzle game like this were of similar quality and length, I might have had a different opinion because my expectations would have been different.  But I just can't recommend this game when Squarecells and the Hexcells trilogy do a much better job in every respect for the same price.","April 11","false","2.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It has nice aesthetics, music, and does a fair job at challenging the player however it is really not very innovative, rewarding, or fun. So overall, if you love puzzle games and want to claim victory over another you should try out this game, but expect a very basic experience.","April 13","false","4.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Its graphics and gameplay are simplistic yet work in their design. Having only one button tells you right from the start, that you will spend most of your time thinking rather than acting.\n\nAnd with that come the problems i have with this game.\nIt´s too complex. It´s impossible to think through the mechanics in your head so it comes down to placing some blocks to make the numbers update, see your solution didn´t work and then start over, which for me has nothing to do with a puzzle game.\n\nThat said tho, once you had to go through the chore of such a level, there will be multiple ones where the numbers are well placed, let you eliminate some options and think through every solution before being ready to put it into the gametiles. This alternating between very well designed level and elimination games made me unsure on weather i liked the game or not.\n\nAll in all, it´s great for a little pause (as it´ll be over after that) and the well designed level were in far greater number than the rest. If you want a casual puzzler for a few minutes then go ahead and get it...","April 10","true","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtrafestive/recommended/449760/","xtrafestive","Xtra_Festive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtrafestive/","407 products in account","Tenrow is a simple logic puzzle game where the objective is to highlight squares in a grid until the numbers in each square go down to zero corresponding with the number of highlighted squares in rows and columns. It is a very simple task but can become harder as more and larger numbers are introduced.\n\nIt took me just over an hour to beat the game and only one of the puzzles really got me stumped. If you are into puzzle games and tend to understand the puzzles and mechanics quickly, you may have an easy time with this.\n\nWith that being said, the length of the game is relatively short. For the price-point of $3, this seems fine. Of course, replayability would be nice with the inclusion of randomly generated levels. The developer has stated in a thread that this could be placed in a potential sequel, so it may be off the table for this. Don't expect to get much replayability out of this one. There are 50 puzzles in total that seem well thought-out. As you begin to learn the "formula" to solve them it may become easier towards the later levels.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick puzzle game to pass time for an hour or two. Just be aware of the length and lack of replayability.","April 11","true","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like the concept, but I don't think the puzzles are always logically solvable toward the end, it feels too much like having to take a stab at it, and that does bother me. There's also points where there are multiple solutions, and that does undermine the idea that it can all be logically deduced.\nThe other issue is just the amount of gameplay I got from it, and in under an hour, I had the whole thing beat. For a dollar, it'd be worth it, but I feel like the gameplay would need to be a bit more robust, and have a longer duration for it to really be worth the current asking price.\n\nIt is also a minor point, but the game doesn't actually tell you how to interact with it; it's simple left clicks, but I think that part should be included. It would also be nice to right click to mark out squares you know can't be part of the solution.","April 19","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals say it all, and convey it all, in a manner that is easy to comprehend instinctively before you purchase. But let me expand on that.\n\nThe design also conveys information INSIDE the game, not just the trailer. That's important. This type of minimalistic puzzler shouldn't sell you on simplicity and then be hard to understand. Tenrow does what it promises so clean and so clear that you'll be surprised. It's graceful.\n\nThis game works. It is fun.\n\nIf you've watched the trailer and read even a brief description you'll already know whether or not you like this type of experience.
