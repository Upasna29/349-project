You are not controlling it directly though - you simply set a destination point on the map and hope to get there in one piece (yes, there are random encounters). When you reach it, there are several randomized 'quests' available. Quests usually feature a short gamebook-like fragments, where you decide how to act in certain situations and award you with something - be it meat and gasoline (which are consumed every time you go to another location or send a scout truck on quests), power cells (required to improve your mobile fortress and use special abilities during combat) or new kind of abilities.\n\nIn many cases quests also feature combat. Fighting system in BEDLAM is turn-based, but there is no order of movement among units - you can perform only two actions during your turn, but it's entirely up to you which characters you move or engage in combat. There are four classes of units and each of them has unique features and range of attack. Shotgunners (called trenchers here) have quite a lot of health points and can only attack nearby enemies, but their blast sends the victim one square behind its previous position. Snipers, on the other hand, are very powerful, but their health is low and they can only attack units that are far away. You need to experiment a lot and find the best tactics for each class. Winning an impossible battle with just one unit is not only possible, but extremely satisfying.\n\nFrom time to time you get to fight bosses - very powerful creatures often accompanied by several of their servants. If you succeed in such battle, the boss will join you and you will be able to use him in combat like a normal unit - only it's far stronger and resistant! Perfect for end game challenges.\n\nYou can also use special abilities on the battlefield. If you are lucky and explore a lot, your vehicle will even be able to drop nuclear missiles on whole groups of enemies, or teleport your units wherever you want them. You can also use healing, become invisible for a while or confuse your enemies and make them attack each other. Using those skills requires a lot of power cells so you should collect them whenever it is possible.\n\nEvery time your unit kills enough bad guys, it gets promoted and becomes a veteran - it gets stronger and deals more damage, so it is a good idea to have them fight as often as possible. It's very risky though. Healing wounded units takes a lot of time and if they are killed - they are lost forever. You don't have many opportunities to get new party members, so you have to be extremely careful.\n\nYou are not able to load game if your fight doesn't go well - you have to accept the consequences of your choices. And if you lose all units that you have on board or run out of food/fuel - it's permadeath. Game has great replayability values. It takes around 1-1,5h to complete a scenario on normal. That doesn’t sound like much, but be aware that you WILL die a lot and will have to start from scratch, just like in roguelike titles, so you will spend many more hours before you see the good ending for the first time. BEDLAM gets REALLY hard in later stages and can kick your *** even at the beginning if you're unlucky.\n\nIf you like challenging, turn-based games with RPG elements - grabbing BEDLAM is one of the best decisions you can make.\n\nPROS:\n+ Combat - simple mechanics, lots of possibilities\n+ Challenging like a rouge-like\n+ Great replayability\n+ Huge map\n+ Unlockable races that alter the gameplay\n\nCONS:\n- No proper tutorial, only a couple of short videos\n- Depleting reserves of gasoline/meat prevent you from exploring too much\n\nTL;DR: If you like challenging, turn-based games with RPG elements - grabbing BEDLAM is one of the best decisions you can make.","September 16, 2015","true","4.4"," 540 of 623 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","540","623","4","2"

Will play the game again as soon as I have some quality time and update my review. So please be advised that the text below is probably not a fair review of the current state of the game. It's a review for BEDLAM 1.0.\n\n------------------\nIf you like tactical squad games where you get to play with your whole squad, be wary of this game. It has a weird mechanic where you get 2 action points per combat turn that can be used for any member of your squad for moving or shooting. This generally means that you will use one of your units for every shot (the strongest) and the rest of your squad will be relegated to being meat shields and dying or wasting actions for movement to stay out of harms way.\n\nSadly this makes the combat which is the most important aspect of the game very un-fun to me and since combat is the most important aspect of the game where you spend the most of your time, the whole game is just not worth it to play.","October 6, 2015","false","6.7"," 374 of 491 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","374","491","5","19"

Will you manage? It's all up to you. IT might sound easy, but it is nowhere near as easy as you might think.\n\nSSB is a mixture of the Banner Saga, FTL, Fallout and XCOM with a number of questionable design decisions. I want to make that clear right off the bat. It does a great job of making a post-apocalyptic FTL and and it does a poor job immitating XCOM.\n\nSo, now that we have this out of the way, let's see what the game does well and what poorly. Since my review is a tad outdated, I can tell you this: Version 2.0 made a good amount of changes and fixed a ton of bugs. This tilts my review slightly further towards recomending the game.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n1. Great AI. IMO, this is the point that outweighs all others. The AI will do its best to make your life a living hell, and that is something that needs to happen more and more in current games. I really enjoy when the AI actually exploits my mistakes and doesnt simply do a dumb move just to tickle my ego and make me feel like I'm so freaking smart, MLG PRO gamer. NO. The AI will punish you for your mistakes. This is really important to me, and I hope it is for you.\n2. The artwork is very thematic and beautiful.\n3. The music fits the post-apocalyptic theme perfectly.\n4. Making hard decisions is both rewarding and satisfying.\n5. Exploration is very rewarding and makes you feel good for picking all those exclamation marks.\n6. Lots of locations to explore and lots of enemies to fight and allies to gain.\n7. A really good battle system that resembles XCOM. I am pretty sure the devs will fix the stupid flanking (that presently doesnt even work) and will allow the player more flexibility, as it looks the only choice at this juncture.\n8. A beautiful mixture of four of my favorite games, the Banner Saga, FTL, Fallout New Vegas and XCOM.\n9. Winning a battle has never been more satisfying - especially against THIS TYPE OF AI.\n10. Progression is rewarding - it makes you feel good and it makes you realize what you're fighting for.\n11. Lots of unlockable weapons, variations and vehicles. Some are play-though based and some are not.\n12. Great replayability. I know for a fact that I will be giving this game a lot of play-time, because I want to beat it and I am not discouraged by failures.\n13. Great value for the money - the pre-release build was a few euros cheaper, but since I judge my games like 1 euro for 2 hours of play time, I am sure that in order to learn the game, get used to its quirks, learn how the AI works, and beat it will take me absolutely over 40 hours, so it falls into the good category of games in my book.\n14. Lots of unit races, most of which you even get to play (as in units or heroes).\n15. Punishing gameplay is not exactly a bad thing. Ironman games are not as bad as they seem. Life, in itself, is an Ironman game. There is no looking back, there is no save LIFE point, that you can go back to. You can't save LIFE at school and replay school if it turned badly. Or Save LIfe at college and replay it if you didn't do well...\n16. The more you play the game, the better you get at it. Take the time to reel it in and learn from your mistakes. This type of gameplay always grabs me.\n17. You need to think long an hard before making a move. Just like in chess, you need to consider every piece of the board and what kind of damage may it do to you.\n\nAnd now, let's take a look at the bad. Don't be surprised if I repeat some of my "good" points in this section. One man's boon is another man's curse...\n\n1. Wicked learning curve. You will be spending hours and hours on end as you are getting used to how the units work - both yours and the enemy ones. It took me 2 hours to get past that barrier in order to let the game teach me what bosses do and how units react. And don't get me started on unit range, appearance, race, etc. If you don't have the patience, the game is not for you.\n2. Great AI. Yep, that's also a bad thing. The AI will 90% of the time go for your weakest unit, or the most damaged one. People like breaking their screens because the AI actually outsmarted them big time. If you have a short fuse, or you are not just moderately patient, the game is not for you. Why? Because unless you think your brains out before making a move, you will get outsmarted a lot. And don't get me started how easy it is to overlook a hidden sniper/trencher move that might kill a low-health unit...\n3. The AI punishes you left and right - yep, that's terrible and there is no going past that point. THere is nothing more infuriating to see a single measly unit dodging its way through your mighty 4-tile big heroes in a suicide run just to get a clear shot at your weakest unit on the battlefield...\n4. Two actions per round - you get only 2 freaking actions across ALL your units. So, if the game permits, you can kill 2 units, which is the best case scenario. Or you can be in a situation where the enemy has a clear pass at 2+ of your units, in which ase you are mightily screwed unless you get creative and use your power cells to your advantage.\n5. As a consequence from 4, AND TO ME THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST GRIPE - you can lose a mission, and the game, through NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN. You can get a terrible spawn, bad flanking shots (even though flanking is a non issue in this game IMO), and lose, and get a GG. Now that, I admit, is infuriating.\n6. Flanking is a non-issue in this game. I hoped that the devs would fix it. And they did. How? By adding damage reduction. So you could be looking at a fully flanked enemy and they get 50% damage reduction. I sort of helps you but... dont get me started...\n7. You never know the enemy composition unless you read very carefully - this is another big gripe. You can be faced with a group that would chew your party for fun. Or you can be in a fight that is so easy to win, it is laughable. You never know until you see the battlefield. While that is justified, I find it way too punishing.\n8. You have only a limited number of soldiers. YEAH. THATS BAD. While you can replenish your lost units with way better or worse soldiers while questing, it may either make or break your gameplay, and once again, though no fault of your own. This is a poor design decision IMO.\n9. Luck plays a HUGE part of the game. No, I don't mean while shooting, like in xcom. Shooting an ucovered target has 100% chance to hit and most likely kill. To me luck represents the random encounters, the battlefiend positioning and enemy composition and the way the enemy works to whoop your backside.\n10. So easy to lose, so difficult to win. I believe this is self-explanatory.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game *still* gets a cautious recommendation from me. Patch 2.0 did a lot, and made me I like it even more, but I can easily see how tons of gamers will be frustrated by it, especially if they're not used to playing IRONMAN games or they have a short fuse and get easily aggravated when things dont go their way.\n\nStill, I had great fun with it. I guess I am that masochistic and patient...","October 9, 2015","true","38.3"," 131 of 171 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","131","171","5","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmitz/recommended/367600/","cosmitz","Cosmo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmitz/","209 products in account","Updated as of  31 march 2016 upon the Redux variant:\n\nI'll adress the concerns i had below in my old review before anything else. To note, most of these talk about the Campaign Mode, i'll discuss the Arcade after all this.\n\n- Pacing : While the dozer efficiency upgrades are important, they become less so, so you can afford to use some dozer abilities more often and also cores are easier to find. This makes combat slightly more varied but not like you'll be able to fall back on these at least once a combat event. Due to having most of the points of interest shown on the map it helps to plan some things out now, and having to gather 4 relics does make it more interesting than just 'cross the area as fast as you can'. Same ofr the King Viscera end event which became slightly more varied. Either way, while it 'works' now, it feels like it was brute-force fix instead of a careful redesign.\n\n- Events/lore/flavor text: Events/side missions are still things you mostly skip through. There is no gradient apart from do you want to risk it or not and the result is always random, and the actual content of the event matters little. I'll plug FTL again since it's relevant, but aside from having/getting some very rare random quest items, you can meet events you have nothing to do at with no options. .\n\n- Combat: This is the big one. It's been mostly redone and rebalanced but it still very much feels like you're trading in people for enemies. It's better, since you're always tossing four people in instead of juggling resources/combat with fighting outnumbered, and each unit can move once/twice or once and shoot. The factional bonuses per number of rounds which now also affects you, and mostly works well within the context. The new UI interface which allows you to see enemy movement and attack is much appreciated, though it doesn't show if someone COULD attack you after moving if you're already in the square. Either way, the fact that each unit can now take a hit or two and the enemies are more 'boss-like' instead of fighting an atrition army of ants works for it.\nSadly... as i mentioned at start, after the first round it still very much feels like a cluster♥♥♥♥ and you're just trading damage for damage. Not as ridiculous as the previous installment but it's clear having all the people move, on the way the map was designed, you would end up with the mentioned cluster♥♥♥♥. You also end up in a classic Xcom scenario with the 4 people that if one dies, you can mostly end the run there. If two of your very high veterans die, you're done.  Raising up other people is risky as well, as due to the new 'bosslike' quality of the enemies you really need the extra damage each veteran level up adds.\nPS: Defence now decreases damage as far as i saw, so that's something, versus the miss system.\n\n- The difficulty: Is more tuned now, and you can play with a bit of free form enjoyment here and there instead of having it in your face every time.\n\n- Arcade Mode: In the end, this is what you get when you boil the game down, and how the game i think should be played. A 5 minute by 5 minute jog, just punching through objectives and having some combat here and there. While working a lot better than the campaign and offering a more streamlined experience, it's far from the cool roguelike concept it started as.\n\n\nIn the end, i wish i could recommend it, but i still can't. The game is 'fixed' as much as you could without remaking core systems, but by not having the large problems it became even worse than broken, it became forgettable. Without the issues to distract, you get to see clearer how shallow it is.\n\nBacked and wanted for it to succeed but minus some coffee-break 5 minute fun once in a while, it's not a sit-down game in the least, a game you could invest in for a good hour or two and get something out.\n\n-----------------------\nUpdated a week or so after the initial fixes.\n\nPlayed a few more hours, and all the below still stand. The 'double-back' fighting through King Viscera is ridiculously hard and showcases brilliantly all the horrible aspects of combat. No unit should be able to move and attack in the same turn or double-move, especially a boss character, and it's ridiculous to have two characters duking it out with equalizers for six consecutive rounds as the rest of the battlefield sits still.\n\nAgain i'd recommend against buying or overstaying your welcome in Bedlam thinking it'll get better with a few more hours under your belt.\n\n-----------------------\nOriginal review:\n\nCons:\n\n- Poor pacing . There is no real brick-upon-brick feel with most encounters feeling haphazard at best and the random events feel either like giving you charity or blowing your head off. I'm sure a lot of people will say otherwise but i found also the fuel/meat dozer upgrades are a must have before anything else or you just run out of resources in the wasteland, that's even IF you win all your battles.\n\n- Almost no actual choice. Combat aside, the game plays itself mostly, with almost no variance in event outcomes since aside from 'leave' you only have 'investigate the thing'. Stuff you pick up in your dozer or your crew composition rarely affecting the outcome, that's if you're lucky to pick them up in the right order of events. You can find the locked bunker now, and next turn you find the key, but you can't return to use the key on the bunker, even though you CAN go back.\n\n- Combat feels unavoidably unforgiving and unbalanced. Following X-com style, your base recruits are horrible but unlike X-com, the number of people you have is very limited (16) for the entire campaign. Considering you often end up losing at least one, two people per battle at start, it takes its toll really fast. It also takes three kills for units to Veteran up, the first and only major unit upgrade, which sees their usefulness increased about 100% AND fully heal them in the middle of combat instead of waiting 20something days which at start can be a lot of downtime considering campaigns don't last too much into the 100 days to get to Aztec City, the goal. Thing is, it only takes a ♥♥♥♥ placement RNG at the start of the battle and you know you are just going to outright lose people no matter what you do. It wouldn't be bad if i also didn't have a huge issue with how the weapon ranges are used, and how the computer has a large advantage calculating all the odds, toeing the line of fire, making you waste a turn, versus a player that will have a hard time finding perfect positioning since there isn't even an option for a very visible, permanent-on grid to properly plan your moves. Banner Saga and Gorky 17 did this a lot better, Gorky 17 in particular. A final note, a large aspect is placed on Dozer weapons and Equalizers, but i found these too be way too expensive to use on a semi-regular basis, especially the Dozer weapon, which if you're lucky you'll shoot once, maybe twice a game.\n\n- Event clicking and flavor text. Might seem like a small gripe, but what's the use in clicking through three or four screens of text, where you don't even have any interactivity apart from multiple chances of clicking 'leave'. Making me click more for an event five times to investigate doesn't make me read more, just skim faster and i even LIKE reading flavor text. Also at no point if i decided to go for it initially anyway will i just 'leave', and leave is such a cop-up design.\n\nPros:\n- Great animation and world art\n- Good concept and universe\n- Decent music\n\nWould i recommend it? No, go play FTL. Still the best roguelike survival system.\n\nFor the record: Played 1 easy which i won and four normals out of which i almost won one and one hard/bedlam which i noped out of so hard. The games are very short, which given the tablet-friendly interface i think was intended, but it does feel like by the time you reach the finish line you've barely finished putting on your racing shoes.\n\n---","September 16, 2015","false","5.1"," 269 of 389 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","269","389","6","18"

Which is a pity because it had huge potential.\n\nThe graphics are great and the animations are fluid.  The random encounters are exactly what I expected from a Rogue-lite style game.  Sometimes they're fair, sometimes they're not but that's just that way the dice rolls.\n\nMy complaint is with the tactical combat mechanics.  They're honestly stupid.  Each side gets two turns.  It doesn't matter if you've brought one unit or six.  You can move the one unit twice or two of the six units once.\n\nThink about this for a moment.\n\nMost of the units will be unable to move in any given round.  There is no numbers advantage; a small team tends to be superior as their members don't stand around like numbskulls whilst getting shot-up.  No team composition will give you an advantage until you start getting high health and high damage veteran and elite members.  That's not tactical play.\n\nThere are four classes of combatant scaling from high health and low damage melee fighters to low health high damage snipers.  A melee fighter can attack someone adjacent to them only - which makes sense.  However their low damage means that attacking with a melee fighter is a waste of a precious turn.  They're meat shields in the purest sense.\n\nRanged units can attack only at a very specific distance.  A sniper unit can attack someone seven paces away.  If the enemy is six or eight paces away they cannot be shot at all.  How does this make any sense?  Why doesn't damage or to-hit probabilty scale with distance?  A lot of the gameplay reduces to hoping an enemy will run into the narrow band of a ranged unit or trying to coax them into one with a sacrifice.\n\nNothing in the description, video or screenshots indicates that this is the tactical style.  That no real gameplay is shown is very telling and should have been a huge warning for me.\n\nStill complaining about the tactical game.  Units are not placed at the start of battle they're dropped in randomly, a melee unit could start well behind a sniper unit who is too close to shoot the enemy.  Why - when I am instigating the attack - would I possibly want my units deployed like that.\n\nBedlam could have been a great FTL / XCom mix but as it stands it's a game of chess where your opponet randomly kicks over your pieces.  It's not fun at all.","September 18, 2015","false","1.8"," 171 of 245 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","171","245","2","12"

The main part is naturally the tactical one, where you can send up to four of your soldiers against the different enemies. This fits to the four basic classes "Deadeyes aka Sharpshooters", "Frontliners aka Meeles", "Trenchers aka Shotgunners" and finally "Gunslingers using Machine Guns".\nThey mainly are differentiated via their shooting range/damage/health points and mobility.\nThey can also gain experience for kills, which makes them more useful in general. As there is perma-death for your units, you can quite quickly lose an experienced swat though.\n\nThe normal battle takes place on a hexfield with some cover, where you and the enemy can act two times per turn - for your entire squad. This takes some getting used to, but makes it also quite a unique experience in my opinion. On your travels, you can also get some special squad members through choices or battles.\nThere are quite a bit of choices as you visit different locations, which can for example greatly impact your ressources, which are necessary for getting alive through the wastelands. If you run out of fuel for example, the chances are good that your journey ends in peril.\n\nThe story (including profiles for each soldier for example) and soundtrack are atmospheric, while the graphic is fitting, if not quite impressive.\n\nIn the long run the motivation for playing is getting higher results as well as unlocking new kind of "Dozers", which are the rolling fortresses in which you move. As with the 2.0 update there are Dozers for each of the factions unlockable, with each having faction-like crews with different abilities. They are also improveable, regarding extra functions and weapons, as well the useage of the ressources.\n\nConclusio: While Bedlam can have quite unfair moments (especially some of those random events) it offers enough variation and battle possibilities to enjoy quite some playthroughs. Some may have their quarrels with the battle system (which is questionable, even after the last update), but if you get used to it, it can be quite entertaining too, as well as with the balancing.\nSo...

The initial rollout of BEDLAM was to lukewarm reviews and to muted user response, largely because of a very polarising core mechanic which encouraged some very specific and exploitative play (the long and the short was that it encouraged some very specific team configurations and relied too heavily on you getting an elite that you could power through the game with).\n\nThat version of BEDLAM remains, for those that enjoy that style of game, however, there's a new mode, called "Campaign", and with that comes a completely new BEDLAM, one based very much on the XCOM:EU 2 AP per character approach. This completely flips the game on its' head, encouraging a balanced team of rotated characters where each individual link in the chain needs to be as strong as the next, lest you start leaking team members due to people getting smooshed by elites in the late game.\n\nThis all sounds well and good, but what IS Bedlam to begin with?\nSkyshines' BEDLAM is a blend of a few different games - FTL and The Banner Saga probably being the most prominent titles that would make the most sense to suggest, having a flat overworld map made up of nodes that you can explore, a lot of which have choice based text adventures, along with a smattering of isometric tile based combat encounters where you move your combat pawns around and fight against your opponents. In this game losses are permanent, so there's a touch of the rougelite about it as well, along with persistent meta-progression as you complete runs and unlock more dozers and more options to start your loadout with.\n\nThe theme and lore of the world is absolutely excellent, seriously, it is. A bone dry wasteland that is filled with some memorable characters, a lot of backstory to each one, and a pulpy, comic book feel to the whole thing. The world building has been very well thought out, and is consistent enough that it could easily be built upon in other games, the lore is strong enough to serve as a platform for books and stories, if the game is able to keep going. The art style equally has this pulpy comic style that serves extremely well, and helps set the tone for the game in general, you really do get immersed in this somewhat askew look at the apocalypse. It's more Borderlands than Mad Max, and that's entirely to its' benefit.\n\nGetting around in yer Dozer\nMechanically, the game plays out somewhat similar regardless of Arcade or Campaign mode. You'll be moving from node to node on the overworld map, and then exploring minor nodes with your outrunner car as you see fit, sometimes this will result in a fight, sometimes this will result in an adventure encounter. Either way, there's a LOT of content to digest, it's easily on a part with FTL post it's advanced edition patch, if not moreso. You'll be working your way through the badlands of Bedlam fighting the various factions, each have their own little quirk which adds flavour to the combat, as well as figuring out the best build for your playstyle (since each of the classes have their own way of fighting, and mixing them gives you a very different approach depending on what setup you run with).\n\nWith the advent of the Campaign mode, there's now two very viable choices for players. Arcade mode satisfies those who enjoyed BEDLAM at the point of release, complete with the BLITZ-o-meter and the original 2AP per side regardless of how those AP were spent over the turn. The Campaign mode satisfies the tactical thinkers who prefer the XCOM:EU style of approach with AP on a per character basis, and means that encounters are far more about teamwork and thinking ahead in a group sense, rather than an individual sense. These two very seperate modes actually work to the benefit of the game, opening it up to a much wider audience, and giving the game life where previously it would have been restricted only to very specific fans of the lore or the style of game.\n\nYou mentioned an elephant?\nI did. This game suffers from Kickstarter-itis. Almost as badly as Armello did. I therefore have to slap the warning that any retail purchaser of this game will be purchasing a game that no matter what will never be entirely content complete. Some elements of the game are going to be kickstarter walled off, there's a thunderdome style encounter that is not yet implemented that is going to be KS only, along with a Unique Faction Dozer (this is believed to be the Banner Saga Crossover one, or that might be another one on top) that is intended to be KS only.\n\nWhilst this may make up only a small-ish percentage in "absolute" terms, it nonetheless renders the product content incomplete and therefore I will openly state that the game is such. If at some point in the future the developers open the option for people to buy (note, buy, I'm not asking they GIVE us this, but the option to pay for it) then I will change my review accordingly.\n\nClosing thoughts\nIt's been a long road. But Bedlam is now a game I can, with the above caveat concerning content, now fully recommend. It's good, it's actually solidly good, and therefore worth getting, though with the content issue I would still advise holding out for a sale of some sort because on principle you shouldn't pay full price if you're not getting access or the ability to get access to the full game. That's my personal stance, and you may choose to go for it regardless.\n\nFinal Verdict : Highly Recommended, caveat - CONTENT INCOMPLETE DUE TO KICKSTARTER LUNACY","March 18","true","5.7"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","34","38","0","2"

But after making it to aztec city and then being told you have to head back and do it all over again, the game very quickly became boring and uninteresting due to how hard it becomes to win, Like the difficulty becomes a vertical cliff face when you face King viscera.\n\nThe combat system is good in theory but executed terribly, a feel that you get from the whole game really, it could have been so much more, but it wasn't. I waited with baited breath to play this after the E3 trailers and reviews, and to be honest I feel let down. Yeah its not to bad considering its a budget $20 game but still...\n\nThere just isnt enough unlockable characters and machines and storyline to keep you wanting to trudge through the difficulty and keep playing. I thought this game was fantastic initially, but once you get to the whole king viscera part of the story you just want to ragequit, because it facerapes you hard. Expect to reroll your game hundreds of times. And no, I'm no stranger to roguelikes. Most roguelikes let you build up to something good and let you make the mistake that kills your character through hubris. This game starts off easy, then quickly transitions to impossible and you lose interest. There is FAR too much focus on power cells and dozer weaponry to win.\n\nIts like the developers thought "Oh, its a roguelike so lets make it stupid hard, call it a day and wait for the money to roll in." So, to summarize, I dont recommend this game, only because I hate seeing games with potential go to waste. Also for making the game stupid hard to cover up the fact there's no real content. I'd be happy to put the hours in and unlock everything if it was just made more interesting and less fustrating.","September 26, 2015","false","20.1"," 68 of 94 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","68","94","0","2"

Great atmosphere, music, style and very enjoyable. Many negative reviews are the early version of the game, which was unfairly hard. At the current state, it is NOT very challenging on normal difficulty, once you understand the mechanics, which are pretty simple. Here are few simple tips to get you going:\n1.	Upgrade your dozer asap\n2.	Don’t spend energy on equalizers, at least until/if you get some really good ones. In most cases it is better to use the default dozer weapon. Only use the weapon if there is no other option and you risk losing your lvled crew member (obviously, don't ever risk loosing your lvled chars)\n3.	Sniper is the strongest char by far. By mid game my main sniper delivers 20-25dmg, which is enough to end even a boss fight.\n4.	It is essential to level up your crew: give kills to the same crew member. Your main crew must be able to 1-shot your enemy to avoid taking damage: you will need 10dmg to kill any regular enemy. This is easiest with snipers, as they dish out 10dmg at lvl4.\n5.	Once your main team is leveled up to 10+dmg, start leveling up some backups. To allow injured crew time to heal\n6.	Position your team right on the edge your enemy’s firing range + their move range. This way the enemy can’t move and shoot at you in the same turn. Eventually they will decide to move into your firing range and you will reposition and 1-shot them\n7.	If enemy BLITZ is inevitable – use the dozer weapon to get them drunk. This is a great opportunity to level up your crew and/or get pickups.\n8.	Melee chars are also great, especially once you level them up to 10dmg. Since they have good health and range – you can easily get pickups and don’t worry too much about being hit. Also they are the best to avoid BLITZ (if you can’t use your dozer weapon) – because you can simply charge in and not die\n9.	If you still have trouble with difficulty – check out game wiki and youtube\n\nGLHF!","November 2, 2015","true","109.1"," 53 of 72 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","53","72","0","0"

It is not easy, and it is made that way. It is punishing, brutal and difficult. It will chew you up and spit you out a thousand times over, and I like it for that. If you have read the reviews you will see a lot of complaints about the combat and that is what I would like to address for the most part in this review, becuase beyond that the game is entirely amazing.\n\nCOMBAT: Essentially BEDLAM is a game that takes a lot of inspirations from games like FTL, Banner Saga and XCOM. First and foremost, those who are comparing this combat to XCOM obviously haven't played Banner Saga, or they would see the clear translation to this game. Don't treat the combat in this like XCOM. If you do, you will die. The combat in BEDLAM needs to be treated more like a game of Chess. You need to find synergy between your units, and utilize them according to their strengths. For example, synergizing your trenchers and their knock back ability is essential for maintaining control of the map and positioning enemies where you want. Enemy just out of the range of your deadeye? Push him into range with a trencher and synergize your units. Play to your opponents weaknesses. Does your enemy have 3 deadeyes? Close the gap and play close. Get in their face and play smart so they can't make a play without getting punished. The combat is difficult and brutal, you WILL lose units, it is made this way for a reason. My only major complaint that I can't justify is the Blitz-o-meter. In my opinion the blitz function is what makes the combat over the top difficult. It basically takes the game from an 8/10 on the difficulty scale to a 9.5/10. If the enemy is going to get a blitz, I should too, or no one should get one at all. Also, unit placement. There is no unit placement prior to engagements and that is a major no-no considering how vital positioning is in this game. The positioning of your units its CRUCIAL, especially given the fact that if your unit is "in the open" and not utilizing cover, it is a 100% hit. I think if Skyshine implemented a pre-combat positioning system, this would solve A TON of peoples complaints about this games combat.\nEVERYTHING ELSE: The other meaty chunk of this game is the overworld map and dozer management. All of which I find awesome. It is very FTLesque and definetly feels like I am struggling over those same risk/reward issues that FTL would slam in your face, and it is great. The music it atmospheric and sets the scene, the voice acting is gritty and fitting, the artstyle is attractive and the animations are nice and provide some gruesome deaths. The Dozer upgrades are cool and can provide some help in combat, although you will often time not have the resources necessary to use them because you are either...\n\n1) using the in-combat heal function too much because of the unforgiving combat\n2) trying to upgrade your crude effeciency, because good God crude is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and a half.\n\nWhat is boils down to. Skyshine. Listen and implement a pre-positioning system for combat. I think this will drastically improve the combat as is because it is beyond frustrating to be hot dropped into a combat scenario against a group of enemies and your 3 deadeyes are right up front, meaning you have to take a very very very very valuable turn to move them back, knowing 1 of those 3 are probably going to die because of the 2 action limitation.\n\nI recommend this game for those who are seeking a challenge and who ARE NOT looking for XCOM combat.\n\nWARNING: THIS GAMES COMBAT IS NOT LIKE XCOM AT ALL, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR XCOMS COMBAT YOU WILL BE VERY VERY UPSET.","September 17, 2015","true","6.0"," 59 of 84 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","59","84","0","0"

Make no mistake, this game is challenging - it will not hold your hand and you'll need to do a bit of trial and error with troop placement, and using all your troops.

(And stressful!) Rather than the standard "queue up all your players to barely avoid being attacked next turn" that we've done a million times before, Bedlam's encounters force you to think differently about who moves where, and when, and attacks what. It also forces you to not coddle your characters; they will die, and sacrificing them becomes part of your strategy. That's not the way I usually play these kinds of games, and it's cool to play something that keeps me on my toes.\n\nThere's also a lot of strategic choices and risk-taking to be made as you travel the wasteland. Should I risk some potentially rewarding or deadly side missions, or stick to the road? Do I help this group of nomads, or attack them and take their stuff? Should I risk taking on this boss battle? (Because if you win, the boss joins your crew!) Should I spend some power cells to upgrade my dozer, or save them for encounters? (Where you can use them for dozer-specific AOE attacks that kick all sorts of ♥♥♥ during battle.) Each run through Bedlam always feels different.\n\nTop that all off with a cool post-apocalyptic world full of grotesque, yet charming, characters and I can easily recommend this game.

Like a road trip with your friends! Through a desert! Oh such antics you and your friends get up to along the way. Like watching Bill get eaten by an acid-spewing mutant, or selling Ted and his buddies off to a group of nomads for some fuel. You know, typical road trip shenanigans.\n\nBut seriously, Skyshine's Bedlam is pretty darn fun once you adjust yourself to the difficulty and figure out a few reliable strategies. My first run ended in a fit of desperation as I had a mere two units left from the rather large stock the game provides for you at the start and I just barely made it. I was saved by the simple fact that I had squirreled away enough resources to pelt enemies my dozer weapons and shield my two remaining veteran badasses as they tore through everything and everyone. Hugely satisfied when I finished my first run.\n\nThe combat is something I see a lot of mixed feelings on in the other reviews and I certainly see some of the concerns that people are bringing up. Often times in the early stages of the game it can feel like units just get chewed up before they can do very much and I think that's at least partially intended. If you could pimp out every single unit Bedlam would probably end up being far too easy to clear. As to whether or not it's fair...you can certainly move to minimize casualties through liberal use of the dozer's equalizer abilities (Shield!) and holding the squishier units back. I found that a veteran frontliner can be a rather useful shield/feeder for your rookie units. Regardless, I didn't find the game to be unfair most of the time.\n\nOne thing I do wish the game had was a way to get a lay of the land before each encounter, just to plan out which units to take. The random placement of said units took some getting used to but I don't mind it too much, a simple lay of the land would suffice.\n\nThere is also the willingness of the developers at Skyshine to keep tweaking/improving the game as demonstrated by their swift response to player feedback. That's probably the most comforting thing a new game could possibly have, attentive devs.\n\nSo, in sum the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n-Variety of Races/Dozers lends to replayability\n-Unit ranking/leveling system\n-Tons of different routes to take and dozens of events/points of interest to investigate (or run away from)\n-Equalizer/Dozer Weapons add tactical depth\n-Resource management creates a nice air of tension in both battles and travel\n-Element of chance keeps things interesting\n-Excellent Artwork/Animations\n\nCons:\n-Difficulty curve is a bit rough for new players\n-Two turn system can feel a bit restrictive\n-Tons of exposition for the lore\n-Tough to retain units and the ones that make it, may end up overpowered\n\nOverall: Worth playing if you like strategy games, roguelikes, and/or trading innocent passengers for fuel!","September 18, 2015","true","12.8"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","0"

The initial difficulty curve has been smoothed out a bit (and having played a few runs prior made me more thoughtful before even clicking my first POI).\n\nThe game still retains its tough-as-nails difficulty, but now instead of a 0.1% fighting chance, it's bumped up to 1% and for a game like this, that is enough to turn it from frustrating to satisfying.\n\nI now recommend this game but it's definitely not a game for everyone. You must really take the effort to invest in learning the game because its strength (the 2AP combat system) is also its weakness (if you don't get to know it properly).\n\nIf you are considering buying this game, I strongly urge you to check out some Let's Plays of other people doing runthroughs. But if you decide to get it, then welcome to Bedlam!\n\n-----------------------------\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n-----------------------------\n\nThe current iteration of Skyshine's Bedlam is not recommended for most people unless you live purely on the thrill of dying repeatedly due to factors outside of your control (and a very small segment of the gamer population does thrive on this!).\n\nI'm REALLY trying to like this game because the art and concept is so amazing, but it's such a shame that the combat gameplay is a letdown.\n\nI feel that the combat is too random such that your victories and losses have a lot less to do with your skill and more to do with your luck (namely initial unit placement or deployment phase, rookies dying too easily but not as easily replaceable). This game would often be compared to the new XCOM and FTL, but both managed to hit the mark on letting you feel you can usually triumph with skill.\n\nThis game would also be compared with chess, but whereby the latter has a consistent deployment layout and a strategy develops over time as you play, this doesn't happen in Bedlam as combat is too short to have a sense of chess' grand strategy, and the deployment issue has been mentioned earlier as well.\n\nThe good news is that this can be rectified by balancing the stats and lowering the initial difficulty curve so that rookies are slightly beefier and easier to level up, as well as letting melee units have some stopping power to delay enemy advancement into your squishy damage dealers.\n\nEssentially, instead of feeling satisfied and enjoying that you one-upped against all odds of randomness when you win, you just feel disengaged with your units and just cross your fingers that they don't die each time. Outside of combat, the Dozer has no character and is simply a fancy looking stats-tracker (which is fine if the combat is improved).\n\nIf you look at the forums, the above issues are generally consistent with why people are unsatisfied with game, so hopefully the devs consider how to balance the hard roguelike intent against user enjoyment. I hope the devs are not discouraged by these feedback and see that a lot of us really want to enjoy the game, but certain aspects of it must be significantly improved to entice us to try it again.\n\nI hope I can return to it later once some patches have gone through to help improve the above issues.","September 17, 2015","true","12.0"," 41 of 56 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","41","56","0","0"

Hard hard. Titanium hard. And if you like that? Good.\n\nWith that out of the way you need to know something that the game kind of glosses over if you want to get anywhere in the wastes of Bedlam. You NEED to upgrade your dozer. So first thing, before you click any destinations on the map you need to click that dozer icon up top, right in the middle and sink ten power cells into your fuel systems and meat system. I had to die six or so times from running out of fuel till I started searching for what I was doing wrong.\n\nThe game mentions upgrading your weapons and equalizers to reduce costs, but you won't get ANYWHERE if you run out of crude three times.\n\nThe art is fun. The Turn based combat is actually a little cruel with the enemy getting a blitz, and you needing to conserve power cells to upgrade systems. But I think it's doable. On Normal.

Think early stages FTL with a different setting and XCOM-esque combat.  It's getting a lot of bad reviews and that feels unfair, especially since they're already addressing the things that everyone is downvoting for.\n\nPros:\n-Soldier classes and leveling: Would be nice to choose the stats to level, but it's plenty rewarding as is.\n\n-Concept and setting:  It's basically post-apocalyptic FTL, what's not to love\n\n-Replayability:  It's hard to unlock new dozers.  I mean like scouring the correct regions AND getting a little RNG love hard.  Similar to a few of the ships in FTL, where you have to get the right event in a specific race's region.  That said, I totally want to try the other dozers and this gives you subgoals aside from just beating the game.  There are also dozens of different weapons and boosts you can find in your travels, making each game a bit different.\n\n-Combat: Combat is fun and gratifying.  A lot of reviewers seem to hate it, but if it was too easy to outsmart, then it would be dumb.  You'll likely have to sacrifice some soldiers to get levels on others, or to simply beat a battle.  Don't buy this game if the thought of playing god and having to sacrifice soldiers for the sake of your masterplan is an absolute deal-breaker for you.\n\nCons:\n\n-Troop placement at the start of combat:  Honestly, this one isn't that bad.  Reviews keep saying you insta-lose snipers etc because they spawn nearest to the enemy.  While this does happen, you always get the first move.  So really, at worst you're losing a turn relocating your troops.  This is something they are updating anyway.\n\n-Dozer upgrades:  Resource management in BEDLAM is pretty good.  Not overly complex, but managing fuel and food requires some forethought.  That said, there are dozer upgrades to reduce your food and fuel consumption that are pretty much completely necessary to survive.  You just end up leveling those to max before you can even consider your other options.\n\nLast Thoughts:  If you really like FTL, even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RNG and the sometimes unfair boss fight, and $20 isn't going to make or break you, then pick this up.  It just released, it is good, and the cons listed here are already being worked on.","September 17, 2015","true","5.2"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","0"

I can definitely see what some people are saying, those battles are a tad much.  However I still had fun and enjoyed the game.  I think it needs some tweaks, especially the end game, but overall I liked it and still would recommend it.\n\nOriginal Review:  I liked it.  I can understand why some people don't, some complaints are valid, but even still I enjoyed it lot.  Perhaps I got lucky, but I beat my very first run on Easy.  It seemed...  well... easy to me.  Heck, I lost 3 crew in the very first battle because I had no idea how battle mechanics worked (I skipped the tutorial and just dove right in).  So I was starting off a bit handicapped, and then I figured out how everything worked and cruised right to the end.  I lost a lot of guys.  I was down to 7 or 8 left.  I learned quickly you have to be prepared to sacrifice some crew members to get and save your veterans.  Perhaps some people don't like this, but you basically have to treat the crew as just another resource that slowly depletes.  Anyway, all in all, I like the game, and even if I had gotten unlucky and died on this run, I still would have enjoyed it (I might have even preferred it, as winning on my very first run seems almost too easy, though I'm sure the higher difficulties will set me straight).

No question about it. Make one wrong move and you can easily destroy every chance of getting to Aztec city. But it is possible. After 13 hours of playing, it's become completely addicting. It took me probably 10 hours of playing before I reached Aztec city on Normal Difficulty, and there's definitely a strategy involved. Once you find out that strategy though, it quickly becomes a well thought out game of chess, except with more blood.\nThe art is of course absolutely gorgeous as well, a gritty comic book style that is clear and easy to read. Just look at the images and video above.\nSince the game is difficult and it took me a while to learn the strategy (have yet to master it though), I wanted to share a key staretgy that I learned while getting to Aztec city the first time: Use the Weapons with a rookie crew. The kills from them are counted towards getting to be veteran or leveling up. In later levels, I use a few veterans and always bring on a rookie, use the weapon right away, and with the nuker or the rocket one, level him or her up immediately. Hopefully that will put you on the right track.\nBedlam is all about strategy. The combat and managing resources. Once you learn the strategy, it's still difficult yes, but much more in grasp. This game is a unique blend of past favorites but with its own flair that truly sets it apart. Its hard to find games like this now.

They removed the power cell bonus from combat. Made it a LOT harder (power cell farming was my bread and butter). Boss STILL has a shield that stops 50% ranged dmg. That's kinda BS since 3/4 the classes are ranged AND his attacks hit like a f&$%ing truck. Throw in the "dozer weapons now cost an action" update  and I can't even get past his first fight. Seriously wish they'd do something about that...At least unit placement seems less random now (yay no more butt rapege right from the get-go)\n\nSept 22: OK, this game is NOT easy. While it's similar to FTL and throws a nod in Xcom direction, IT IS IT'S OWN GAME. The worst part is just trying to keep rookies alive long enough to level. Well...That and the starting "weapon" is pretty crap...Good for getting elites though (IF you're used to the combat).\n\nMy advise? Don't take more than 3 troops into combat for a while and stick to the mutant areas to begin with. After a few play-throughs, I got a decent stratagy going and just MURDERED everything. Right up until a certin boss...He's a little overpowered btw.\n\nYet to unlock another Dozer either.

Even the combat you have to say is unique.\n\nBut at the same time its hard for a logical mind to enjoy the combat. It doesn't really make sense in alot of ways. I feel like they had to make a lot of compromises to try and balance it for difficulty, which ended up really screwing up the combat overall.\n\nI kind of get the feeling that I am making compromises to try and minimize my losses... but then there is this runaway effect once you do level up a guy... you want to use him over and over and no one else.\n\nSPOILER------------: Took me about 2 short normal games before I understood the combat in any reasonable way. Then I decided to plan a path through the rogue AI territories just to try and see some kind of important plot point. That didn't seem to happen, and I felt a "borderlands moment" where I stopped really reading anything because it was all too samey. I did make it to the end of the map, and near the end i made a choice to try and power through quickly because I had only 2 guys left. Although once leveld up 2 guys can kill almost anything. I did make it to the end of the map... then it gets kind of random unfair could never see it coming stuff...\n\nIt is definitely better than convoy at least.\n\nIn the end I recommend it just to hope they make something else good in the future.","September 17, 2015","true","8.6"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

It's a budget game, the mechanics take some getting used to.  I woulda preferred normal initiative combat, and the enemy does start to close (I can't get 2 hp snipers out of the killing field many times) and I hope they keep making it better with patches.  Nice overall concept and art style and FTL/XCom-ness to it.  It's a budget game, but fun so far.  I'll see how it goes, don't regret buying so far.\n\nREDUX UPDATE:  So, I'm real impressed so far with the update.  They fixed my biggest gripe, you have the option of an Xcom (variant) type combat which I'm really enjoying.  The polished alot of little stuff along the way, I tried Arcade and Campaign mode and I'm having alot of fun.  The basic game had obvious potential, good theme/art/production value and for once a company listened to feedback and the end result is good.  This is how Early Access is supposed to go.\n\nMy one minor complaint (like the original Xcom) there is no notification when a character dies ("My trencher just got blown away, who was that again?") and there's no Memorial Wall.","September 23, 2015","true","26.5"," 60 of 89 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","60","89","0","1"

Sounds bad ♥♥♥ doesn’t it? But that’s not it!\nYou’re also in charge of a Crew, which will fight and ultimately die for you in Battles, while you have to manage your resources and upgrade the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of your trusty Dozer, the Boneshaker, while navigating through the Wasteland that is Bedlam.\n\nGameplayAs the Mechanic you take Control of your faithful Dozer, the Boneshaker (sweet name Pal), and a bunch of other People. You probably won't have company for long since Bedlam is a grim and dark place and most of your companions, be it goons that fight to the death for you or just some passengers, have a pretty big chance of ending up with a Bullet or Fist in their Face (head) or they decorate a Pike with one or more Limbs … or the Head. To make it short dead. Anyway don’t get too friendly with them. If you manage to be lovey dovey with one or some of your Companions they might end up turning into real Bad Asses also known as Veterans. After earning three kills your Pal turns into this shiney and white Veteran and gains a Damage or Health Point bonus. A Veteran can then level up again after snagging five Kills.\nSo your Dozer let’s talk about it.\nIn order to advance through Bedlam you need Crude and Meat. The first one is fuel for the Boneshaker and the other one for your Crew. I mean a Girl’s gotta eat. There are several ways to snag Fuel. The most common one is to kill Bad Guys on the Battlefield. If you manage to snag some of the Boxes you might end up with double Crude or Meat or even Power Cells.\nThe other one is by visiting POI, short for Point of Interest, and encountering random People that either give you some for free because they like your Face, look at you beautiful!, or they want to trade it for something.\nOh Power Cells? I nearly forgot those. Oh boy those are awesome!\nYou need those to upgrade your Dozer. There are four Rooms that you can upgrade and each of those Rooms can reach Level five.\nOne of those Rooms is responsible for healing your Crew and reduces the amount of days it takes. The other one decreases either the amount of Crude or Meat used per Day whereas the last one decreases the amount of Power Cells it takes for you to use Weapons or Equalizers (more about those later).\n\nSo the whole Veteran thing ... I guess you see where this is going?\nFind Bad Guys -> Kill Bad Guys with the same Guy -> ? -> Profit.\nYeah that’s not a good idea. On paper it might be but in general it’s a terrible one.\nI’ll explain shortly but let’s take about combat and your friends first. Heh friends ....\nSo anyway the game features a two action turn. That means that you have two actions per turn (Duh!). So what exactly does that mean? You can move and then shoot someone in the Face or do either of those twice. That’s it. The enemy can do the same so you’re on equal Grounds. Unless the Blitz Meter fills but let’s take about that later.\n\nSo let’s talk about your Crew for a while.\nThe game features four Classes.\nThe Frontliners are the Meat Shields of your Group. They have the highest Movement Range but the lowest Damage. In general you want to retrieve all those lil’ Boxes on the Battlefield with those Guys since it’s the easiest way to do it with them.\nNext up are the Deadeyes. Yup you guessed it, those are filthy Snipers. Since Snipers are a bunch of cowardly Jackasses, they have to stay back so they, hopefully won’t get sniped (always makes me giggle when this actually happens). They have the highest Damage, of course, but the lowest Movement Range, not to mention they have a very specific attack range so you have to be in a good Spot to kill some People in their Faces.\nAnd if you’re missing Shotguns here are the Trenchers. Those guys are the average Joes/Janes of Bedlam. They deal medium damage and have a medium Movement Range but in exchange for that their Attacks knock Enemies back. So make good use of’em Pal.\nLast but not least are the crazy ones, the Gunslingers. Yeah those guys must’ve mistaken Bedlam with the Wild West since their acting like Pistoleros. They also feature medium Movement Range and Damage but whenever they take Damage from an Enemy in Range they get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Shoot Back. Oh yeah that’s right you better kill them with one shot or they’ll just unload a Clip right into your Balls you filthy cowardly Mutant! Face.\nYou might even run into some odd special looking Fellas while cruising through Bedlam. If you manage to defeat those Posers they will join your Crew and Boy let me tell you … If you manage to do so the Battles will become so, oh so much easier! Not to mention those can level up as well. So take good care of those Buddy.\n\nRemember me mentioning the Blitz Meter? Good, well let’s talk about the Meat of the Game for a while the Combat.\nCombat in this game takes a lot of thinking. You can’t just rush in and one man show the whole Battlefield, unless you wanna end up Dead. So make use of that thing between your Shoulders.\nYou start of with random positions on the Battlefield. There are certain object you can take Cover behind and if you choose to do so you do gain one bonus: Being able to Dodge.\nUnless you hide, glorious I must say, behind something you will always get hit. Always, there’s no way around it but the same goes for your Enemies.\nBesides that you have to think twice whether or not you’re moving this character to kill this Idiot because it might be that you lose another one in the next Round due to him being too close to another unfriendly Unit.\n\nWelcome to later! Time to talk about the fun stuff!\nWeapons and Equalizers. Let’s be honest. There comes a time where you just go What the actual BEEP!?, because you find yourself outnumbered. There’s no way that you can win this Battle. Not a Chance. Unless you use some Weapons or Equalizers. You could either Nuke them down for example (always fun when Stuff just goes BOOM!) or you could heal Crew on the field. The choice is all yours but be advises that those all need Power Cells so it’s best to keep some at the back of your Dozer. Just for worst case Scenarios. I mean everything is a worst Case Scenarios but I mean real worst Case Scenarios.\n\nVisualsWell it’s okay. I can’t say it’s bad nor good. I mean at the end of the day it does fit the game perfectly but I would have liked to see more Diversity. By that I mean if you’re on the Battlefield every Class looks exactly the same. Unless it’s a special Unit or a Veteran.\nBesides that the game does look good. You always have the feeling that you’re ♥♥♥♥ed in a Wasteland full of Mutants, Rogue A.I, you name it.\nThe game does look really good but again … Just some diversity would have been dope.\n\nSoundIt does fit the game. It’s not perfect and lacks here and there but overall it’s good. Though I have to admit that I do get a Borderlands Vibe, which I greatly enjoyed and consider one of my favorite Game Series, so I might be biased in that regard but the sounds overall are quite fitting. The explosions, Shots and Enemies are all fitting and keep you in the Wasteland.\n\nWhat else can I say?Skyshine’s Bedlam is a good game. Yes it’s hard but People come on. It’s a Rogue-Like.","September 20, 2015","true","7.7"," 61 of 91 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","61","91","0","2"

Since units have specific ranges they can shoot at (they get more options of shooting ranges as they level) it has something of a puzzle aspect to it.  Takes some patience to get to grips with it, but if you don't dismiss it for not being x-com style combat and persevere to learn the games nuances then it's rewarding.\n\nHas quite a lot of FTL style random events (about 350 I believe currently) and it's important to visit the (!) points of interest to build yourself up rather than making a beeline for Aztec City. There is no real pressure to go directly there anyways aside from the difficulty rising as the days pass.\n\nArt style and graphics have a nice look to them, and I like that veteran units get a different look to their armor. The sound and music compliment the game nicely too.\n\nOverall a good game, that I feel is being a bit misunderstood. I can certainly see that the game could have unfair moments which would be frustrating, but I also feel that as you learn how to play it more it feels pretty rewarding to get farther than before. Judging by the dev posts currently on the forums too there are changes planned to make the easy mode (which is recommended for learning the game although unlocks aren't available there) more welcoming to new players, as currently it isn't really much different from normal outside a slower escalation of the difficulty level.","September 17, 2015","true","5.0"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"

Anyway.\n\nTHE PROS:\n\n-The game is beautiful. You shouldn't just take my word for it on that, just look at the screenshots and trailer. Great art, great animations, great designs. All in all, high quality visuals.\n\n-Nice UI. Thematically fits, and is non-intrusive. This is good.\n\n-Great concept. The idea of travelling in a mobile fortress, trying to reach a utopia and save the people you have with you is awesome, and in this era of post-apocolyptic games everywhere, it's different enough to stand out.\n\n-The writing. There's a lot of flavor text, for pretty much every event. The fact that even the most generic of this text is well written and very thematic speaks volumes about the care that went into this game.\n\n-The events. This ties into the writing, but the events, for the most part, feel very fleshed out, and your decisions feel like they have meaning.\n\nTHE EHS:\n\n-The combat. Now, don't get me wrong, I love tactical combat, and I think they handled it fairly well. Unfortunately, due to the "two moves a turn" system, you feel punished for bringing lots of people into combat, as most of them won't be able to do much. There are still some balance issues to work through as well, as some classes (like trenchers) are generally much more useful than others (like gunslingers). Sure, a gunslinger can hit from slightly further away, and counter-hit for 1 damage, but trenchers push enemies back, can hit targets in melee range, and do more damage with their attacks. You only need to bring gunslingers when you're out of trenchers, for the most part, or as a warm body during a tough fight. It's still fun though, and that's what's important, it just doesn't feel as good as it could be.\n\n-The Bosses. The bosses are all well designed, and fun to use once you recruit them after beating them (a system I enjoy). Unfortunately, most of them are fairly easy. Every boss I beat during my first run was taken down using the same strategy: use my Dozer weapon (the one that makes enemies hostile to each other), watch the boss take damage and destroy their squad, kill boss with one or two attacks as they try to close distance after drunk effect wears off. There's no reason to do anything other than this, no reason at all. The bosses all have cool abilities, but you don't really see this in their fights.\n\nTHE CONS:\n\n-The music. Now, the music isn't bad, it's just very, very, very forgettable. If you heard a song from this game by itself, you most likely wouldn't be able to identify the game, like you could with, say, Binding of Isaac, or Fez. Soundtracks are super important to me, and this one just doesn't stand out. Most people would put this under EH, but coming from a musical background, I count it as a CON.\n\n-The bugs. I know the devs are working on this, but I still need to count it, because they are glaring. I had one fight that had half my squad all occupying the same space just off the movement grid, and later, after using an ability on my Dozer that makes temp clones on my units during battle, the unit I cloned disappeared from my Dozer, despite ending the battle with full health. These were both during the same run, and if they hadn't happened as late into the run as they did (when I could recover from them easily), I might have lost the run overall.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\nSkyshine's Bedlam is a diamond in the rough. It's great in a lot of areas, but the few flaws it does have are major ones that hold it back. As a KS backer, I'm not disappointed, nor do I regret my backing, but I do feel Skyshine has their work cut out for them. I don't like numbered ratings, but if I absolutely to give it one, it would be 7.5/10. It's solid, it's fun, and it's beautiful, but there's a lot left to be worked on that, once completed, will make this a much better game. Give it a try, but be patient. The devs are being very responsive to the community (something I love, especially in indie devs), so if you have a complaint, give them a bit of time, and it'll likely be fixed quickly.","September 23, 2015","true","2.3"," 40 of 55 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","40","55","0","0"

Being the first game from Skyshine Games, it was backed by a Kickstarter campaign that recieved a fair amount of support, even managing to exceed their goal. What we got is a fairly challenging title, one that makes even diehard strategy/RPG fans say "ouch" when they get their balls rocked and have to rethink their strategy.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nUsing your very own Dozer, you traverse the wasteland trying to reach the Aztec City on the other end of the map. Your dozer is pretty much a giant tank, but keeping it running requires a steady supply of crude (fuel), meat (food for passengers), and Power Cells (used for upgrades). Your dozer uses certain amounts of these resources per day when travelling. They can be found during random encounters, at the end of battles as rewards, or even during battle; this requires you to order a unit to pick them up. If you run out of either Crude, the game is considered over as you cannot advance further. It's very important to use your Power Cells, as they can decrease the amount of crude and fuel used per day, thereby ensuring you can travel deeper into the wasteland and closer to the Aztec City.\n\nThe meat of the game is in it's tactical battles. You have 4 different classes to use: Gunslingers, Frontliners, Deadeyes, and Trenchers. Gunslingers are your balanced damage dealers, with medium movement and attack ranges, as well as decent damage output. Frontliners are your melee,damage sponging tanks, with high HP and movement ranges. Deadeyes are basically snipers, but they have very specific attacks ranges. Trenchers are another damage dealing class, equipped with a shotgun that knocks its target back. Each side of battle gets 2 actions per turn, whether it be moving a unit, or attacking with another. This means you have to choose your actions VERY carefully to ensure you don't find yourself in an early grave, as each character does not get an individual turn.\n\nEnemies come from 4 different factions, each with their own unique behaviors and tactics. Something you will see if you drag battles out for too long is an Enemy Blitz. This gives the opposing side extra actions for that turn, which almost assuredly means you will lose a unit or two. Finish up encounters as quickly as possible to avoid these blitzes. Defeating enemy units can cause their Blitz meter to drop as well.\n\nYou also have access to special Dozer abilities that can be used in combat. These includes deplying a special grenade that hits enemies in an area, or heal all of your units by a small amount. These abilities cost Power Cells to use, so keep a few on hand just in case you run into a tight spot.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nBEDLAM features a pretty slick, unique art style. While the designs are a bit simplistic, the animations are awesome and over the top at times. I faced an encounter where I was overwhelmed by a special gunslinger who literally shot all the skin off of half my units! It's these animations that really make BEDLAM shine (ha, get it?).\n\nThe world map is where a lot of information is presented to you. Lots of icons represent what you'll find in many areas, and are easy to identify. Factions are represented by different symbols, as well as Crude and Meat.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe sound effects in this game are VERY satisfying. Shooting enemies, explosions, your dozer plowing across the wasteland...everything sounds very nice. The only downside is the music isn't as great. Not bad, just not as great. It does it's job and keeps you in the game, and in the mindset that you are in a desolate wasteland.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nI had no issues running the game on my mid-tier rig. It ran at a steady framerate at all times, with no drops or stuttering. Usually new games has some varieties of glitches or bugs, but I never noticed any.\n\nKeyboard and mouse is the only, and recommended, way to play this game. It was very confortable to play using this control scheme.\n\nMy only complaint is that the loading screens before and after battles take a bit, anywhere from 5-15 seconds. While this doesn't sound like a long time, it seems like so much more when you are actually playing.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nIf you are looking for a difficult rogue-like in a new setting, Skyshine's BEDLAM should be right up your alley. Although it sometimes feels unfair in some instances, it's extremely rewarding when you find ways out of tight spots and rough situations. The apocalyptic setting is done well and integrated into the game nicely. Worth a buy, especially since you get hours of endless fun and challenge.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVEmnAFKp1M\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nIf you liked this review or found it helpful, please consider rating it up.

It draws all the things I loved about Banner Saga into a different setting;  you can attempt to make nothing but squeaky-clean decisions, but, very quickly find yourself having to make hard calls which will ultimately decide between making it to Aztec city or ending short in complete annihilation.\n\nThe combat is really addictive, and the ceiling of mastery is surprisingly high.  I love the replayability if I fail, and I love the replayability if I succeed (keeping unlocked dozers).  If you like turned based strategy, regardless of setting (and they really nailed apocalyptic wastelands) I'd say it's a must buy.  There's a really great blend of surprises and consequences-from-tacticle-decisions that keeps me going dozer run after dozer run.  It's brutal, and I think that's why I like it so much.","September 21, 2015","true","43.7"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

This game is harsh and unforgiving. It's how a rogue-like should be. Combat is tight, even if unit placement is a bit too random at times. Resources can be hard to come by. With common sense and a bit of strategy, you can get through half the wasteland and last over 2 months on a few playthroughs. But with the right crew selection, combat strategy, upgrades and levelling of your crew.. It can be possible to get to your goal with resources to spare. I almost managed this on my 3rd playthrough on normal difficulty before finally being brutally massacred. Luck played very little part in that run.\n\nI feel the negetive reviews are rather harsh.

In case my opinion is going to change I will adjust the review accordingly.)\n\nThis is not FTL. And it doesn't have to be. This is not Banner Saga. And it doesn't have to be. This is not Mad Max. And it doesn't have to be. And it's also not XCOM.\n\nSkyshine's Bedlam is certainly inspired by all those, be it regarding gameplay or scenario. And kind of like Blizzard, one of the masters of adapting an existing formula and distilling or refining it into something really awesome, Skyshine Games managed to combine lots of influences, lots of ideas and gameplay mechanics into an amazing new game.\n\nIt has a rogue-like structure, meaning each time you start a new game or "run" all locations you visit and all events you come across are reshuffled and randomized. The same goes for your crew and your dozer (which is the vehicle you happen to travel in).\n\nOne part of the game reminds me of a mix between FTL and Oregon Trail, where you travel across the land(?) of Bedlam and encounter mean bad guys, traveling merchants, bands of nomads and so on. You decide what you want to do by selecting given options and watch how things play out. You have to manage your resources (mainly fuel and food) and be sure you got enough of everything so you can keep on driving and feed your people. It comes with interesting choices and gives you a good feeling of immersion into the world. Love that part, it is very simplistic but it does the trick. No need to be complicated here.\n\nThe crew (your fighters) is also managed in between driving and those guys are needed for the second part of Bedlam: the fights. Those are best compared to turn-based games like Wasteland 2 or Banner Saga. Though again, far more simplistic. I love the fact that there is no turn order and you (and your opponent) just get two actions per turn. You can spend both of them attacking with one of your guys and you can do so 10 turns in a row if you choose to. I like that kind of freedom. Other than move and attack there is not much to do, but that is enough. (The cover system is super-simple but perfectly fine) The combat plays out on a randomized battlefield and is much like a puzzle where you have to utilize your fighters best, according to the ever-different setup.\n\nAll in all I do not expect Bedlam to suddenly surprise me (in a bad way, that is) and to come up with something I will not like. It is built on solid mechanics, it is simplistic yet challenging and highly enjoyable.\n\nIf you like games like Banner Saga, FTL, Oregon Trail (or Organ Trail) or Wasteland 2 you might wanna have a closer look at Skyshine.","September 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","0"

I think the great presentation carries the sometimes-underwhelming combat mechanics.  Several of the negative reviews seem to expect Bedlam to be sequels to pre-existing franchises.  If anything, it feels more like Atlantica Online's gameplay (which was basically high-speed chess) than a tactical rpg, or something like FTL/XCOM/etc.  This is it's own game and should be treated as such.  It's a fun game, but could use some depth.  I still recommend it as it's a great indie effort in a sea of mostly terrible $60 AAA games.  If you have an appreciation for aesthetics in games, I think you'll really enjoy this one.  Lots of love in this game, and it certainly deserves more love than a lot of scathing reviews it's gotten here.\n\nI will say that I haven't encountered any bugs that other users have including crashes, end-game errors, etc.  I can see how that would ruin other players' experiences.  The team is very clearly operating while listening closely to the players, so any glaring issues seem like they will be fixed rapidly.

The fact that I'm calling that the absolute best thing about this game says more about most strategy games than this particular strategy game so I'll review the thing properly too.\n\nBedlam is Banner Saga (engine and all) meets Mad Max meets roguelike. It's a largely randomized game where your goal is to get from the top of the screen (a city called Bysantine) aaaaall the way to the bottom of the screen (Aztec City) in a Dozer... which is a tank. Sure it might sound like a bulldozer but I assure you it is not. You must upgrade your Dozer with power cells, feed refugees with MEAT, and keep your fuel gauge as full as possible with CRUDE. You've also got soldiers who fit neatly within four classes: Deadeyes (squishy snipers,) Frontliners (tanks with bonesaws and riot shields,) Gunslingers (adaptable mid-range damage dealers) and Trenchers (close-range shotgun specialists.) These soldiers are renamable and have unique backstories that you will not read because they will die very quickly. Oh yeah, this game is HARD! It IS a roguelike after all.\n\nDuring battles, which are faster paced than most in the genre, you and the enemy can move twice per turn. Not per character ala Banner Saga, per turn. Everyone is randomly placed too so you'd better move your squishies to cover so they'll get a 50% dodge chance. Along with cover, there are also MEAT, CRUDE, POWER, and explosive boxes littered around the map. Pick up some of those and you'll get more supplies (which you will need.) If you've got the power and the enemies are tearing you up, your dozer can fire off huge weapons or bestow helpful boons to your party. As you need that power to upgrade your dozer, though, you'll want to think carefully about deploying it. Soldiers can die in Bedlam. It's a roguelike after all. Guess what, though? There are elites! They suck! They can murderlate the holy hell out of your team but if you beat 'em, they (and their mighty abilities) join you... because MAD MAX, amirite?\n\nAll in all, Bedlam is a brutally difficult game that is also rewarding for anyone who, like me, enjoys brutally difficult games. It has twists and turns that I sure ain't spoiling here and like I said in the beginning, the text is infinitely readable... so YAY for accessibility.\n\nOh yeah, it's not accessible for newbies yet. There are tutorials and they do their job very well but the game is blisteringly hard, even on easy. The devs have said they might fix that. Here's hoping. No game should be painwalled after all. Inclusiveness for newbs and pros alike, right?\n\nSo that's my review. I recommend the hell out of this game.","September 16, 2015","true","13.1"," 53 of 79 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","53","79","2","0"

In my last playthrough I ommited snipers completely and I didn't miss them\n-Late game becomes a series of one shot kills on all enemies but mini bosses, I was able to kill the final boss in 3 turns due to highly stacked damage (24 every attack, 2 attacks a turn)\n-Dozers are FAR too hard to find.

Distance between crew and enemies has been doubled. Battles are now winnable in the early game, and veteran units are easier to get. Lots of bugs were fixed and the final boss is finally beatable.

I managed to find the Cyborg Dozer, but instead of getting the Dozer I got 36 power cells. Come on! I explored literally everything and that's what I got? Maybe the devs could make it so you can find one every playthrough? I really don't want to explore the whole map again.

I would say its a tactical combat game with some light rpg and roguelike elements and....\n\nUPDATE 3/31 - Version 3.450860234??? something like that...is out! The developers spent a ton of time rebooting the game and changing the mechanics from the two guys move per turn setup to the more standard XCOM style of move each of your guys then end turn. You can still play in the original mode via the options menu if you so choose.\n\nThe update also brought in a number of tweaks and additional content as well as a slightly altered path to victory that makes the game seem a little less grindy.\n\nOverall all of the changes have been on the positive side and I stand by my original review with maybe a half point bump.\n\nIf there is one thing left to complain about (there are several but I'm just picking one) I wish there were some unique mechanics or skills behind certain elites passed the basic units of each faction. For the most part the units within each class all do the same thing more or less and it gets pretty bland after awhile. I've finished the game twice now and I am not sure if I'll be revisiting the wasteland anytime soon but I've def got my money's worth out of this title.\n\nKudos to the Dev for not jumping ship when the initial run of poor reviews came sliding in btw.\n\nOG REVIEW:\n\nYour ability to get enjoyment of this game will start and end with the combat. Since the combat style/mechanic is different than any other tactical style game I can think of you really need to spend a few minutes at least watching a "let's play" and go from there.\n\nPersonally I enjoyed the combat style a great deal and it helped me to get over a number of blemishes I found along my journey through Bedlam.\n\nPros -\n\nSolid Tactical Combat Puzzlesque Fights\nUnique (as far as I know anyway) mechanics\nColorful artwork helps bring the bleakness of the game world to life\nUnlockable dozers for future runs\n\nAc/Dc -\nExtreme Challenge at Times (more on this later)\nViolent\nVERY Grindy\n\nCons -\nRepetitive Gameplay - There are some choices to be made that can affect your journey via text choices but 90 percent of this game is going to be on that combat map.\n\nTo elaborate...\n\n-Units and their abilities are very much interchangable same stats for all units within a class (only 4 of those) regardless of whether you start the game with them or pick them up along the way\nthere are Elite Units that contradict this with boosts in HP and damage but slower overall progression\nLack of individual skills makes many of the fights nearly if not exactly the same. If you do not mind grinding a bit this might not be as much of an issue.\n\n-Replayability is Low\n-The method of unlocking the Dozers are completely random\n\nBALANCE - The begining of the game - Brutal\nAfter a few runs - You realize that your gonna lose some people early on for most of\nYou can and should shrug these losses off.\nMiddle - Long and gets pretty easy once you have the hang of it.\nEnd - Pretty tough again unless you spent about 8 hours or so grinding to get there.\n\nSo I would give this game a 5/10 but would recommend it if your a fan of tactical turnbased games and want to try something different. The combat mechanic is pretty intersting and takes awhile to get use to. Once you do your going to see a surge in success rate.\n\nI hear there are still plans for substantial improvements to the games content and have some fixes in the works to restore balance. I would say this game probably should have be considered an Early Access Title until they come get through a couple more updates. There's potential for a much bigger game with more depth that could show up here in the next few months.\n\nIn the meantime its not a bad tactical combat game....its just not really a rougelike.","October 6, 2015","true","19.8"," 39 of 55 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","39","55","0","0"

It's of that genre, and you will die! Not every run will be successfull, and sometimes RNG will cause your veteren sniper to be killed in 1 hit  (delicious permadeath) - with no possible way of you avoiding it. Yup, these things will happen, so if you are fine with that and enjoy games of a simular nature (X-com being a good example), then this game could be for you.\n\nThe actual gameplay comes in two halves. The first involves navigating the worl map and essentially plotting the course for your 'Dozer', choosing which path to take and where to stop and explore. Travelling the waste will use resources, which you can restock during your travels. These resources (meat, crude and energy) can also be used to upgrade and enhance your Dozer / units throughout your journey.\n\nThe other half of the game is combat. It's turn based, and uses a 2AP/moves per turn system. It's worth noting that unlike X-com where you can controll/move your entire squad each turn, this game just allows the use of those two action points. So after selecting a unit, moving it, and then ordering it to fire. Your turn will end and the enemy will then do the same. Those 2 action points may be spent however you wish (moving the same unit twice, ordering a unit to fire twice, making one guy move and another fire, etc). As a result of this you really do have to study the battlefield and consider your movements before doing anything, acting too hastly can have serious consequences (did I mention delicious permadeath?).","September 16, 2015","true","6.8"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

It's a game that will ♥♥♥♥ you off, and for a lot of people, after a few rage quits they'll be done with it.\n\nHowever, should you stick around, you'll find that it's not actually a tactics/strategy game. I mean, it is in a sense, but the combat is almost a puzzle game. While random unit placement can put you in awful situations, with planning and proper management of your resources, you can overcome huge odds. In fact, I'd say Bedlam's strong suit is in how it makes you feel like it's impossible, but as you play and learn the mechanics, you start to really improve. Bedlam will drag you through it's brutal world with style, visceral brutality and a ton of character.\n\nSkyshine is currently looking at ways to make the game a bit more accessible, so if you're on the fence because of other reviews, give the game a 'Follow' and see how things pan out. And while the 'FTL meets Mad Max' thing is not wholly far off, it's also not very accurate. Bedlam obviously owes a bit to both entities, but truly it's its own beast. I'm having a lot of fun with it, but I also enjoy the trial and error aspect of learing the ins and outs, and I absolutely adore the setting. If I had to give it a score, it would be a solid 7, if not an 8. It's a good game for those who are willing to try something new but at the same time familiar. While it's no FTL, it's a strong showing for Skyshine and I will gladly support any future endeavors by the team, especially if one was a full blown RPG set in the Bedlam universe (hint/hint).","September 17, 2015","true","9.3"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

You definitely start out being pretty bad at this game which is incredibly punishing, for instance the sniper class can be 1-hit by other snipers for instance, so your positioning on them is incredibly important, which has lead to a fair amount of bad reviews.  But once you get a hang of the combat system, its a lot more manageable and you get to see what this game is about, each battle is a mini puzzle, essentially how to get through each fight without losing a crew member and using the least amount of resources.\n\nAs for balance, its not perfect but I think its pretty close, for instance at the moment all 4 classes are very good and useful, though it seems to be the gunslingers might be a tad too strong right now.\n\nAnyways, the feel, music, and gameplay of this game is pretty stellar.

I expected not to like the art, but it grew on me right away. It's closer to Borderlands than Fallout in tone, and that's not a bad thing.\n\nThe game is fast-pased enough that taking early loses is not overly punishing. And you will take loses, in your first fight. The combat is well balanced, but does not work like XCom or Fire Emblem, and if you try to play it like those games, you will certainly lose. It's closer to Chess, you will lose units, often in a single hit, but that does not mean you fail the battle. You don't have a ton of units to spare, but a single veteran unit can often carry an entire fight on her own, so once you start leveling up, the game gets more forgiving. Though losing a veteran is incredibly tragic, which, honestly, is why we play games like this right?\n\nOverall the combat feels more like a puzzle than other tactical games. Because units will die so quickly, figuring out what units counter each other is very important to succeeding, and a large part of the fun.\n\nThe overmap portion is not incredibly deep, but still more fleshed out that something like FTL, and is beautifully rendered. Resources are rare enough that it's worth taking risks to gather more, but I didn't feel like I was running on empty the whole time. You start out with a good deal of breathing room, but bad choices and lost battles will quickly erode your supply.\n\nIf you like the look and setting of the game, enjoy interesting and new tactical challenges, and don't mind learning by losing a few battles or a few games, Bedlam is worth picking up.\n\nIf you were looking for XCom with a Fallout skin, this is not that game.","September 17, 2015","true","15.3"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

The longer you roam the wasteland, the more notoriety you have which is reflected by levels of threat (low -> guarded -> eleveted -> severe -> bedlam), akin in theory to the FTLs chase system, where it discouraged 'farming' or basically taking too much time. However, in practic, the threat level of bedlam does not coexist with its combat system, through which threat is represented. For each threshold you surpass, the battles are supposed to get tougher by simply putting more enemies on the battlefield. You face the same type of enemy units throughout the game, so they have the same health and damage throughout your whole journey. What is broken here, is that late in the game you encounter the same weak (as compared to your badass elite units) henchmen, but there are just way more of them, however, the numbers advantage they seemingly posses is mitigated by the two moves per turn system. Therefore, out of 15 enemies, only two, or even one move towards to attack you - easy pickings for your hardened lot. The rest is just grouped in the corner waiting their turn to enter the meat grinder.\nThe only battle headache is the random placement system, which can really put in a tough predicament right from the start. Still, you always go first in battle so you can immediately activate shields, damage absorbers or flat-out nuke clustered enemies.\nIn essence, you just drive around wasteland, hoping to unlock a new dozer (I didn't unlock anything yet), and scoring levels (= more damage output). And boy, you'll need your elites levelled if you are to have any chances with boss. What does it mean? If you manage to survive your first 20 minutes, you're rolling and the game gets grindy fast. Still, the potential is there, the game just needs tweaking.\n\nUpdate 17/09\n\nSo I kind of finished the game on normal.\n\nLet me say this. There are two difficulty bumps after which the game is a breeze (at least on normal). You hit the first bump right after the start - you only have rookies, who, for the most part, won't withstand more than one shot. Keeping them alive and leveling them is the tricky part. Some of them will die, but their sacrifice allows you to keep a force of capable veterans. Then, you gonna find the first elite recruitable. After the moderately hard battle, he/she joins. Elites are powerful units - they have more health, and their damage output raises each time they level. By the end of the game, one of my elites dished out 16 damage per shot (which means one-shotting regular and elite enemies, the only exception being the boss). I'd say that's pretty deadly.\nThe second difficulty bumps comes right after you established a foothold with your now veteran troops. The resources. All of a sudden, your fuel and food are almost depleted. If you manage to gather some, you good. But that's random, as most of it comes from points of intrests that hide a random encounter. It could be your precious fuel, or a band of cyborgs.\nAfter that, you just steamroll. More elites join you, they level, you gather more powerful equipment for your dozer to use in battle (like a nuke, or a shield granting immunity to damage and regenerates your health each time someone hits you for one turn), etc. Most of the time I fielded my 3 elites and they mopped the floor with like 15 enemies without taking a scratch.\n\nAs for the random encounters, I'd like to see more crew-specific, contextual interactions. There were only a handful during my 3 hour playthrough, and I'd would greatly enhance the feeling of accomplishment and connection to your crewmembers if they had more options to interact during encounters. As it stands now, half of the encounters don't even give you any option to pick - just a quick, flavor text and that's it. Hell, I don't mind losing my guys because of a choice I made in a random encounter!\n\nEverything written below still applies.\n\nAlso, I cannot comprehend how you can compare this game to Xcom (the new one).\n\n---- Original review ----\n\nI cannot recommend Bedlam in its current, underdeveloped state, as it lacks certain, IMO, fundamental features.\n\nI do not share many reviewers' concerns about overall unbalance of the combat mechanics. I think two moves in a turn spent on whatever by whoever is an interesting concept. It just requires getting used to. However, I do have an issue with how uninteresting and not varied the characters are mechanically-wise. I.E. You start with 4 snipers, each of whom has the exact same stats. Like carbon copies. Same for your 4 gunslingers (each has 5 health, 3 damage, 3-4 range, 4 move). A wasted opportunity right from the start, a little mix up in the roster would greatly improve the decision-making process. Said gunslingers should all bee a wee bit different. Like imagine, one gunslinger with 4 health and 3 range, but 3-5 damage. Another one with 5 health, 2-4 damage, 2-4 range, and 3 move. You know, some tactical flavor.\n\nOnce a character levels up (after scoring three kills), their combat usefullness increases dramatically, and their stats go up in a fixed manner, which means we do not get to allocate any skill points. A real shame - the way it was in Banner Saga kept things interesting - there you could specialize classes, having direct control of how and what function a given unit would perform on the battlefield. What a wasted opportunity! For instance, I would heavily invest in health for my sniper given the chance, granting him survivability, but at the cost of lower damage output. I would increase the range and quickness of my shotgun unit, making them glass cannons, etc. Choices is what we need, to further adjust the characters to our playstyle.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no active/passive skills either (sniper is the most 'exciting' class, as they have a passive chance for a headshot each shot), so there is no incetive to use your lesser units, as they are prone to dying extremely fast and cannot really dish out any proper damage. If the vanilla troops had a skill, like for instance your tank having a charge, or granade to use once per battle, that would justify using them in certain situations, even if they do not scale to the enemy stats-wise. Currently what happens is you end up using your two moves on your badassest guy, and reasonably so! A skill-tree, like choose one skill out of two per level - that's what Bedlam needs.\n\nSame goes for equipment. It's all bound to a character and is unchangable. Your frontliners will use a simple melee weapon, always dealing 2 damage. After the level up, the damage will increase, but it's always a fixed value. You cannot influence it in any way, your troops gonna deal the exact same amout of damage each time they attack. Instead of a boring 3 damage each shot, why not introduce a 2-4 mechanics? What about finding weapons as you travel along the wasteland? We don't need an abundance of them - just a few to spice it up.\n\nApart from combat and character progression, the Dozer's upgrade system seems to be lacking. There are four areas of research - bio research (slower food consumption), armory (less power cells spent for using dozer's special equipment), barracks (faster soldier recovery), and engineering (less fuel used). By spending power cells, you can improve each, up to a level 5. Each level grants a % improvement in efficiency. And that's it. It could have been a small research tree for each research area, with at least a few passive bonuses to choose from, maybe an active bonus here and there. As it stands now, it just feels underdeveloped.\n\nNevertheless, the art, the feel, the world, the atmosphere, it's all here, and it creates a fantastic coherent entity.\n\nIn essence, the potential of Bedlam is huge, it may even surpass FTL, but as it stands, I cannot recommended it, even though I wish I could.","September 16, 2015","false","13.7"," 87 of 142 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","87","142","0","1"

Was happy. Until the end. (SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! AVERT YER EYES!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis game isn't FTL. It isn't XCOM. It shouldn't be compared to it. This game is more akin to Chess, than any thing else. The graphics are beautiful, the animation is top-notch, and the writing isn't bad.\n\n\nDo NOT mistake this for me thinking that the game is perfect, oh no no no. It's far from it. The game still has a long way to go, and it could definitely improve on some aspects. The game's 2-actions-a-turn isn't the issue, it's not the random spawning, hell, it's not even the difficulty. No. All of that equates to this game being what it is; a Rogue-like earning its place in the sea of Rogue-likes now-a-days. The issue here is the lack of information about what you'll be going into and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ENDING.\n\n\nThe game's ending isn't what you'd expect. First off, (AGAIN; HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD! AVERT YOUR EYES NOW IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT SPOILERS!!!)  when you get to Azteck, the game does the classic, "Haha! You get here! Now you have to go BACK!" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Nobody likes that, it is NOT fun, it is NOT original, and it is NOT fair to throw at somebody who burned their resources getting to the end. Not cool guys, not cool.\n\n\nSo you once again set out into the wastes, having to go back to your original starting point to collect more travelers to bring the the sanctuary that is Azteck. This time, though, you're given an instantaneous travel item, that will allow anybody, and everybody to teleport to Azteck. The game gives you a legit reason to go back. So you're thinking, "Ok, I'm upset as a gamer, but as a story/plot device this DOES make sense, to a degree."\n\n\nHere we go. The boss fight...s. You hear, throughout the WHOLE game, tales and deeds of "King Viscera". Obviously, this guy would be the final boss. Ok, that makes sense. Suddenly, as you're traveling, you get no warning that you're about to fight him and he up and jumps on you, forcing you to fight him even if you weren't expecting it and were trying to get supplies together. Throughout the WHOLE first part of the game, you get icons on the map telling you about the events that are awaiting you at each major stopping point. It could be a warning about resources, or about a hard fight with an elite enemy. This is part of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n\nKing Viscera, big, bad, difficult if not prepared. Luckily, I was STACKED when I reached him, or, rather, when the game forced a fight with him with no warning. I defeat him. "Sweet! I just beat the game! All I have to do is get back to the starting point, and it's gg!" WRONG. THINK AGAIN. He comes back as a mutant. Yay...\n\n\nThis time he has a shield, and is able to shoot at you. He was a melee unit the first time, or a "Frontliner" as the game calles them. Now he is a mutant, acid-slinging, spike-shooting ♥♥♥♥♥. He's a "Trencher", now. WITH A SHIELD THAT STOPS HALF OF ALL PROJECTILE DAMAGE. Lovely. But the fun doesn't stop there! He has a squad of goons... AGAIN. Same formation, same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Except this time, he has a big hammer-wielding meat head with him. So you deal with all this, MAYBE, IF YOU'RE LUCKY. (Hope you have the power cells to use the "Abuse Absorber" equalizer... EVERY ROUND.) If you're lucky enough to have the elites, the man-power, and the resources to defeat him again, you're STILL not even done. Guess what? Just guess.\n\n\nHe's back again! Ahahaha, wow, so whacky and fun, amirite? This time he's a Cyborg. With a double-stacked chaingun that ramps up his damage every turn at the cost of 1 health. Which he has somewhere within the realm of 80. Oh boy. Abuse Absorber spam again! Hope you have a beefy elite! Oh yeah. He also has more goons. This time instead of the hammer guy again, he has 2 elite Trencher-class mutants that spit acid as well, and have 20 hp. Each. (He's a gunslinger this time, by the way. That's 3 of the game's classes down... bet you can't guess what happens next!)\n\n\nYep! That's right! Phase 4 baby. Oh boy, so original. So fresh. So crisp and cool... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it it gets old fast. He's a "Deadeye" now, which is the game's sniper class. Whoopdee-♥♥♥♥in'-doo. Let's get this over with. This is probably his easiet form, he has the same restrictions as an actual sniper class, so if you, yet again, use the Abuse Absorber, or as I like to call it, "Mandatory to Finish the Game" equalizer, and stuff a high-damage unit next to him, he'll focus on something he CAN hit and you can pelt him all encounter. He has goons, again, as with all of his encounters, again, in a much-similar or EXACTLY the same positions, except he has 2 robots whose classes are Gunslinger... I think. I couldn't really tell. Hopefully you have enough people left and STILL have enough resources to last through this fight. You REALLY need to stock up on power cells between fights. It's a must-have if you even want to be in the REALM of coming CLOSE to winning the game.\n\n\nYou beat him! (Probably not, I had to restart from Azteck by quitting 5 times.) Good game! You win! Hope you feel satisfied... that is, if you get to the starting point with whatever remaining fuel you have. The fight gives fuel, so you should be fine as long as you made it to the FOURTH fight with the SAME guy, AGAIN. You waltz up to the starting point, and the city hails you! You saved around a thousand survivors, defeated the evil opressor of the Bedlam, and gave people hope! Now all you need to do is activate the transporter device and save humanity!\n\n\nLOLNOPE. REKT NURD. "Oh, the device has run out of power! Haha! Too bad. Oh but we'll devote all our time and resources to trying to fix it! Yaaaay..." That's pretty much the ending.\n\n\nThen the game spits you back out into the map. No joke. No ending, no credits. Just... back to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MAP. THAT YOU WENT THROUGH TWO TIMES ALREADY. It doesn't even say what you need to do! So I went into the city, and the SAME cutscene/dialogue was presented... ok, a bug? I'll give it the benefeit of the doubt. The game just realeased! A bug like this could've been passed over... maybe it was a bug with my copy of the files!\n\n\nThen I finish the dialogue. I'm not all the way in the starting city, so I decide to go to the VERY first point, the starting point IN the starting point/city. The game freezes!.. or does it? I still can't tell if it's just ♥♥♥♥ planning, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending, or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story, wait, it's all of the above! The game isn't frozen, the game decided to lock the screen to make it look like my vehicle has stopped inside the walls! Yet, there is a gas all around and the game hasn't presented any ending credits. I can still open the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu for exiting and accessing the options. This was the biggest letdown I've ever experienced in gaming history. I think, "Maybe if I click exit, the prompt will give me some insight as to maybe going into new game plus... or something..?" It tells me "All progress since reaching Azteck will not be saved." Bull. ♥♥♥♥ing. ♥♥♥♥. I put all this time and effort into beating the game, and I get NO fulfillment, no acknowledgment, no directive... nothing. I could still travel on the world map before it did this screen lock, but it didn't tell me what to do, or even where to go! Nothing! I was just abondoned like a lost-child at an airport! I had NO clue what to do! That's why I kept moving TOWARD the start point, because there was no directive!\n\n\nThe game punishes you for winning. Best game 2015, 10/10 m8.\n\n\nJust kidding. I mean, you think the game would be too, but nah.  It's just spouting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n\nOverall, I can NOT reccomend this game as it is. I like the game for its gameplay, I like it for its mechanics and difficulty, but the story isn't good and the reward you get from beating it is literally, in all sense of the word "literally", NOT THERE. I give it... 5/10? Fix it devs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 17, 2015","false","4.1"," 92 of 154 people (60%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","60","92","154","18","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/recommended/367600/","Gamingtrevor","Gamingtrevor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gamingtrevor/","203 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RBMyIu6YzY\n\nFor my full written review, and to leave me a comment, visit MouseNJoypad at; http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/skyshines-bedlam-review/\n\nWhen I first saw Skyshine’s Bedlam at this year’s E3, I got to talk to John Mueller, Art Director on the project. Sitting down with the game, he told me of his team’s love of post-apocalyptic tales of survival, and their drive to bring it to the public. The idea originally started as a modified game of D&D, heavily inspired by properties like Judge Dredd, Dune, and Heavy Metal. As he showed me the basics of his game, I became lost in the world of Bedlam, as he spun me the tale of how this universe came to be.\n\nSadly, despite how well the world was painted for me at the event, Skyshine starts the game cold, with no introduction or even what the need to travel across the titular lands might be. I understand some won’t care, but the lack of an intro movie or narrative was a travesty, considering how absolutely amazing the world is once you get absorbed into it. This sad oversight, I wanted to treat like a band-aid and get it over with; because the rest of this review is going to be more positive.\n\nBedlam is like putting Mad Max, X-Com and The Oregon Trail together in a blender, and seeing what shakes out. Gameplay follows your giant technological wagon as you travel across the hostile wastelands of a world covered in sand. Players get no restore points, no redos- if you die, you go back to the beginning, Rogue. You’ll start the game choosing your race and dozer (your transport), and then you roll out of your factory, ready to cross the map like a barbaric Indiana Jones. I should mention however, my review copy only allowed me to play as Humans.\n\nAs you push on down the road, you may check out one of the points of interest on the map. It’ll consume some time, gas and food, but you may find something really important that you’ll need later on. For example, I went to one and found a small cave; and upon entering found a bizarre creature’s home. They gave me a Gremcatcher; something resembling a stone dream catcher, and possibly just as useful. Everything you find may seem useless, but you’ll discover uses for them… most of them… I think.\n\nThese story-based moments are delivered via short descriptions, but still manages to paint a vivid image of the pile of twisted metal blocking the road you’ve been traveling down, and the shriek of the mutants who have trapped you. While I would’ve loved to see more artwork in these sections, I’ll forgive it due to the large variety of traps and missions that have been placed in the game. This leads to constant mental debates, questioning if you really have the manpower to try and save a random group of survivors from some hostile Rouge A.I.. Sometimes, you’ll be rewarded- and sometimes you’ll test if fortune truly favors the brave.\n\nBut, no matter how well you play- eventually you’re going to get caught in a firefight, and it’s a joy to play them out. Battles play out like Advanced Wars, where you move troops around the board, seeking cover and utilizing squad tactics in order to keep your guys alive. Each character has their own strike patterns, power level and dexterity, and the more you bring onto the field, the less of a resource bonus you’ll end the battle with. This provides a real incentive to challenge yourself before every battle, as you try to think about how confident you are with two powerful characters over six disposable ones. You also have to worry about healing times, where injured soldiers must recuperate between battles. This keeps you from cranking out a ton of “trenchers” (shotgunners), and just huddling up in battle.\n\nEach turn, you’re only able to complete two actions, be it moving one of your soldiers or taking a shot. This too adds to the desire to try to minimize your troops, otherwise you may end up with soldiers who stand there the whole battle, clueless. There’s also a challenge to delay that final death blow, because there are resources lying all around the map, giving you additional resources after the match. This is a job for the weak Frontliners (Shield and baton soldiers), as they’re able to run around faster than the other classes, and take a ton of damage. Each battle encourages you think strategically, and rewards you precious supplies for taking difficult risks.\n\nDespite the difficulty, the game strives to be a journey through an unforgiving wasteland, and it succeeds. As I dug deeper into the game, discovering more about the lore of Bedlam, I found myself enamored with the game. It’s a difficult one, that offers very little forgiveness, and when you do fail, you usually have yourself to blame. This would be a great introduction to gamers unfamiliar with tactical role playing games, and a fun experience for veterans.","September 16, 2015","true","8.8"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

Maybe it gave up being it's very own thing and turned a little more casual, but becoming definitely much more fun in the process.\n\nIf you, like me, already own this game and gave up on it, you should give it another try. If you, also like me, came here for the amazing heavy-metal retro sci-fi, you will additionally find a fun little game. If you, unlike me, are looking for some punishment, you might give the classic mode a try, which is still included.\n\n+Style: Smash zat beer can on yer cybaskull and blast thos' muties!\n+Sound: Sparse but on spot\n-Depth: Gorgeous but somewhat shallow\n\n","March 20","true","10.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Although, they took away some features I kind of liked (modifying your Dozer and upgrading it). So far, so good though. Even when combat was wonky, almost broken even, it was close to being a "Recommend" due to it being so solid in all the other components.

While many people may have liked the two actions per side each round design, it seems far more flocked forth to give Skyshine's Bedlam a bad review.\n\nPersonally I held off on writing a review, because the Early Access portion of the title's existence was a week that existed only in an effort to avoid offending those Kickstarter backers who had paid extra to get the title early. I get the feeling that they may have had financial need to release the game when they did, and so I wanted to give them time to straighten the game out.\n\nFrom what I have seen so far the Redux patch has made what was always a gorgeous strategy game into something a little more similar to games that have come before. No longer do you have to sit and watch the enemy take a step toward your highest level character, and then instantly kill them in one shot over the course of their "turn". There's a reason chess has people move one piece at a time, the potential for two successive moves to put someone in checkmate would be insane. I feel like Skyshine did the right thing here, there was no need to reinvent the turn based strategy wheel.\n\nAnother complaint I had about the game as it had existed was you were forced to choose, do you act and kill your enemies, or do you gather supplies for the long road ahead and likely suffer deaths. For some reason you're apparently not allowed to scavenge the battlefield after the enemy lies dead at your feet. The entire team moving allows you to split up the duties, acquiring more resources and killing enemies at the same time. Troops are more durable as well, no more will a character who has been the focus of all your efforts die in one hit despite being behind cover. There's still a risk/reward balance here, but it's no longer an 80/20 split.\n\nThe art of this game was always beautiful, and that was why I backed it on Kickstarter. I'm glad to see that with the Redux patch the game has conformed to strategy genre standards. They're standard for a reason, two actions per side was by far the strangest attempt to innovate I have ever seen. I am personally very glad they ditched that, because the AI had a clear advantage in the sense that they have legions of fodder, and your troops were always very finite and easily killed. This new system will likely take a little tweaking to balance perfectly, but Skyshine has shown dedication to making their game as enjoyable to play as it is to look at.","March 17","true","8.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The new "Redux" update transforms the game into the deep and addictive strategy roguelike it was always so close to becoming.  The developers deserve a ton of credit and respect for sticking with it and evolving their game into a nearly perfect state.  Now is the perfect time to take the plunge and fire up your armored war wagon!\n\nEasily described as XCOM and FTL mashed together and thrust into a postapocalyptic, Choose-Your-Own-Adventure world that would give Mad Max nightmares.  Complex where it matters, sleek and efficient nearly everywhere else.  BEDLAM takes turn-based squad combat and makes it effortless (and addictive).\n\nThe new update reworks the Action Point system in combat, leaving much more opportunity to experiment with employing different strategies against your enemies.  There's also a significant amount of new content, including additional art, many more story branches, different crew and dozer types and the addition of a fast-paced "arcade mode" as an alternative to the grueling campaign.\n\nBedlam strikes a pitch-perfect tone between pulpy science fiction, cutting satire and postapolyptic horror.

The most recent reviews tended to be positive and it was on a 75% sale. I launched it yesterday for the first time and couldnt be more pleasantly surprised. From the user reviews I read, I got the impression its been vastly improved (I can't pass judgement) but that there were still flaws (weird battle mechanics, repackaged downgrade from FTL (which I loved)).\n\nSo if you had the same sentiment or hesitation, then I'd suggest giving it a go. There are similarities to FTL, you jump from point to point, it makes sense to try and travel as much as possible so that you have the best possible chance at the final stages. You have different 'ships' which are unlocked after different runs. That's pretty much where the similarities end. The combat is totally different and I really enjoy it. You have 2 action points per turn for the whole squad (of up to 4 people) giving it a twist on the standard xcom, warhammer etc. every unit has action points mechanic.\n\nWithout spoilers:\n\nPros:\n-Really hard and feels rewarding, I jumped into it blind and still dont have a preferred set-up (im looking at you xcom squad sight and snipers).\n- Different resource management, food, fuel, power cores and people. The first 3 which are mainly gained during combat which is brilliant because they are on the battlefield, so if you dont pick it up and slaughter everything, you've lost resources. This makes for some interesting choices, should i let this squad member die in order to get all the resources on the map (there are some tough calls)\n- Great art style, music and overall feel.\n- Mad max type theme which I also enjoy (I know thats FOTM for most games right now, but still :))\n\nNeutral:\n- I played about 6 hours straight and finished one run (I think I had 7 attempts), so each individual run is fairly long and that can be especially rage inducing when you make a mistake one stop away from the final boss. However, also makes it that much more rewarding.\n\nCons:\n- Still feels a little unfinished.\n- There are typos and I've run into one or two bugs and one CTD\n- Lack of content while exploring. For this to make sense, I'll compare to FTL, even after dozens of runs, you found new quests, new dialogue options became available depending on your crew. After about an hour in Bedlam, I started seeing the same events over and over and over again, which only have 1 outcome with 100% chance depending on the choice you pick.\n\nReal Conclusion: I'm writing this review because I think the overall (mostly mixed) steam user reviews are not representative. The developers really shot themselves in the foot because all of the negative reviews upon initial release. Again I cannot compare, but perhaps that provides an opportunity to give an unbiased perspective. I was hooked for 6 hours and am typing this fast to jump back into bedlam :). FTL and XCOM are 10/10 games for me, this has elements of both and is a solid 7/10. As a final note, that the developers put so much effort into improving it (read other reviews) instills further confidence.\n\nTLDR Conclusion:\n\nPlay FTL and if you like it, then this is different enough to be called its own game that has a lot of potential for replayability","November 19, 2015","true","10.8"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The art style was great and the writing was interesting and varied. The problem was, the gameplay itself just wasn't fun. The whole 2AP per side per turn was just too large a restriction on doing anything interesting and the necessity of needing to pick up resources during combat (they weren't rewarded afterwards) further messed up the flow of combat.\n\nHOWEVER, to their great credit, the developers listened to their customers, and have spent the past several months revamping most of the game. The biggest change being that combat now functions like most other turn-based tactical isometric games; which is exactly what most people wanted. The combat itself is a little simple, due to the lack of activity abilities (other than the battlefield-wide dozer abilities). But between 4 classes, 5 factions, and the elite units there's enough passive differences to still allow for variety in combat.\n\nAnd the result is that I'm having a lot of fun with the new REDUX version of the game. I can't spreak for other people, but bear in mind that reviews of the game that came out before March 2016 were reviewing a much different game than what it is now.\n\nI do wish there were more unlockables than just the different types of dozers (your mobile home base), but that's the nature of rogue-likes I suppose. And if the developers continue to focus on improvements to the game, I would like some active abilites for units, at least some sort of overwatch system. But even if that doesn't happen, the developers deserve enormous credit for listening to their customers and doing so much work post-release on the game.\n\nIts definitetely not perfect, but if you're looking for another turn-based tactical isometric game this is a pretty good option.","March 20","true","7.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Sound and music are good and unobtrusive. The strategic map offers interesting choices: do I go here and proceed with the story, or perform a side mission?

Not easy, but hours of fun and replayability. It dispenses with a lot of the standard BS and dumps you right into the action.\n\nThere is a significant learning curve to battle and you have to figure out how best to use the different types of fighters you have or you will quickly deplete your snipers and gunslingers (don't let Frontliners get too close to your Deadeyes and have Gunslingers behind cover nearly always). If you do not click on enemy soldiers to see how far they can move their next turn before you make your moves then you will find out that one of your hard earned upgraded fighters can get killed because you didn't move him far enough out of range from the enemy (the game is very much like chess in this regard). You also have to upgrade your Dozer carefully so you don't run out of crude or food. Along the way you try to pick up upgrades for your ride and new soldiers to fight for you in battles. The key to the game is gathering as many power cells as you can to use in battle and to upgrade your Dozer.\n\nGraphics are pretty cool (Borderlands cartoon style). I have not yet come close to finishing the game on normal, but I just keep restarting and employing the tactics I learned the last time I got myself killed in Bedlam.

Do not feel discourage from this because like Madmax or any other wasteland, you gotta play hard to survive.\nSo what's the story? The trailer for the game explains it to you but basically you commaand some giant Truck called the Dozer full of people to take them to the mythical land of Aztec City. Yea I know, the name sucks get over it. But you'll be traveling across a giant ♥♥♥ wasteland that are controlled by 4 factions. These are the Mutants (Duh), the Cyborgs, Rogue AI and Marauders (Think madmax).\nThe gameplay is seperated into 2 different gameplay, Travel and Combat. Travel is where you direct where the Dozer travels to, similar to how FTL works. There are 3 resources that you will be managing, Meat, Fuel and PowerCell. The first two are crutial as you burn them when travel and can be replenished via some of the random events of the travel and during combat. Powercell, on the otherhand, is power used to upgrade the Dozer or use any super weapon/abilities during combat. During Travel, you might come by events that could grant you nothing, items, weapons, abilities, new crew or even a new dozer to try. Sometimes these random events can be ♥♥♥♥♥ and just kill you.\nCombat is a seperate entity of the game. While the game may look like it's xcom or banner saga, it's really not. The controls are simplistic but really really difficult to master. Basically each turn consist of 2 moves similar to Xcom EU but you perform it for the amount of people you have on the field. The Enemy have the same condition but also have BLITZ, a special event where if the enemies aren't killed for a number of turns they will gain an extra move. This may be very challanging and discouraging majority of people but this also promotes quick thinking and strategy.\nAs for what else to  explain, I prefer for you to try the game out yourself. Hell, I haven't been able to beat the game once thanks to the difficulty of the game. And bloody hell am I not gonna give up on beating this game.","September 17, 2015","true","10.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I love x-com/banner saga fighting style. This game took a chance to try to differentiate itself by giving you 2 turns that you can use for any character. They did this obviously to try to be different. People have been comparing it more to chess than X-com. The problem is this is not chess and it doesn't make sense to move 1 guy 8 times in a row while your other guys sit there. I tried it and have to say I don't like the move this piece at the expense of that piece style. I bought the game and so will continue to try to put some more time in but this is a core piece of the functionality of the game. Turn based strategy games are 90% the fights and this really hamstrings it for me.

I say wait until it drops to $4 and then pick it up. :)\n\nNot going to spend a lot of time writing a review for this game, it's simply not worth my time. Apologies for the shortness... 3.5/10 for me. I did enjoy the graphics, but that's about it.\n\nI bought this expecting a roguelike Xcom. But basically they throw you on a very small map with zero ways to prep and you get 2 moves. For those 2 moves you typically dive behind some cover if any randomly spawned around you. Then the computer takes it's 2 moves and kills one of your guys. Since you only had 2 moves you can't save everyone I guess. then you take your 2 moves and kill one of theirs. It gets old fast, zero strats involved.\n\nThen you finish killing all the enemies, you get in your truck and randomly spawn on another small map and  guess what? Lose a guy, rinse, repeat until you're out of guys. There is some skill involved and a very slight learning curve, but only being able to move 1 single guy (out of your entire army) 2x, or 2 guys once, really doesn't give a lot of options or enjoyable game play. What can you really do with that? You can't really get a game plan together on such small maps, or devise any tactics. Maps are about 20x20 tiles. You pretty much count on the luck of the draw, where your troops randomly spawn, and where the enemy randomly spawns. You have zero control over what happens!\n\nThen let's talk about troop combat. Your troops all have places where they can attack. Melee can attack adjacent which is fine. Shot gunners can attack a couple spaces and knockback, which is also fine. But anything else is complete garbage. Let's say you have a guy who can attack 6 spaces out in a circle around him, not 4, 5, or 7 mind you, it's exactly 6, otherwise you cannot touch him. Lets say you want to cover a tank as backup. The enemy just walks to 5 spaces shoots your guy and stands there. Now you have to waste both moves on your turn taking one step back and shooting him. There is no overwatch, so it's not like your sniper can sit there guarding someone. No, he has to waste his entire turn moving a single step back and then shotting the bad guy who is now exactly 6 blocks away. Most games you play, the shots get easier as you get closer and a higher chance to hit, not so in this game. you actually have to be the exact # of blocks away to make the shot. The enemy understands exactly where this range is and makes sure you have to waste both of your turns moving and shooting. It's probably one of the worse game mechanics I've seen this year in a turn based strat game.\n\nSo in closing, I should have watched a couple more youtube videos before purchasing this. I would have seen this game breaking flaw. Hopefully you can now learn from my mistakes and avoid this game until it goes on sale for $3.99 or something. Good luck!","September 16, 2015","false","4.1"," 74 of 134 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","74","134","9","4"

And those bad things happen with a fair amount of requency, either in combat or while managing your convoy through the random encounters. So if you don't like permadeath or the board game Chess for that matter, this is likely not the game for you. I reference Chess because a lot of the games combat machanics revolve around spacial positioning and you have only 2 actions per turn for your whole side (up to 4 units per mission from your roster of crewmen). Units only have certain ranges they can attack and with low hit points coupled by the limited action, Chess makes a good comparison for how to approach the combat because you need to know how to cover the field have you units support each other. Much of the game is rouge like, but after a few playthoughs you'll have a good idea what to expect in the world of BEDLAM. Visually the game is like playing a graphic novel, much of the story is told from the point of view of the caravan as a whole as oppoed to individual characters. For the most part I like the feel of it all, although I still rage quit from time to time playing this game, and this is from someone who generally like to keep on playing through permadeth games like XCom & Darkest Dungeon. I'll look forward to more content and maybe an update or bod that'll let you position units before the start of a battle - the lack of which is my biggest gripe about the game. But I'd still reccomend it for those whom like games some stakes and odds just risky enough to keep you on the edge of your seat without walking away from the game.","November 5, 2015","true","21.1"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

The redux version is a huge improvement over the original. Arcade mode is now more action orieted and will satisfy your lust for endless battle. Campaign mode requires more careful resource management and route planning. The campaign map is set up in a way where you can take longer routes for better rewards but face the danger of running low on resources and have to expend precious power cells because chances are you will be facing more enemies.\n\nPower cells are the most important resource in the game. Some negative reviews point out that the combat system is not as deep as Xcom but that is an unfair comparison, the game is not meant to be an Xcom clone. It emphasizes over-the-top weapons and animations in a humorous little package. Most of the tactics revolve around how you use your power cells. Do you want to AoE nuke your foes when they are bunched up or do you want to buff your squad members ? Some abilites are very powerful but the game is balanced in a way where you can't use them frequently. If you attempt to do so, you will eventually run out of juice and lose your precious levelled up team mates right there when you had Aztec City just in your sights.\n\nDevelopers are constantly updating the game and interacting with the community I therefore expect the game will continue to improve.","April 8","true","12.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

What makes this game different from similar games is that instead of a turn order, you have two actions per turn to use per turn, and then the enemy makes two actions, etc. (Like Chess). The result of this is that even though you will be heavily outnumbered by the AI later in the game, it really doesn't matter as the AI can't move all its troops anyway. A lot of people complained about the game's difficulty, pointing to things like the AI faction teleporting units (this has been somewhat nerfed in the 1.5 patch), but I thought it was a suitable difficulty curve.\n\nThe game features four classes of units: Deadeyes (snipers), Frontliners (tanks), Gunslingers (pistolers) and Trenchers (shotgunners). With three kills, a rookie levels up to a Veteran (and gets a change of outfit to white), giving more hp and damage dealt. With every five more kills, the Veteran levels up, doing a further point of damage. This means that by the time you reach Aztec City, you should have Veterans at level 20-30, dealing 20+ damage per hit. To me this is an imbalanced mechanic as it favours certain classes over others. Deadeyes are close to useless in the late game due to their pitiful 5 hp as Veterans, meaning that they will be one shot killed regularly. Gunslingers I have found of limited value too. Trenchers are the stock troop of your army and you'll rack up a lot of kills with these guys. In my first successful playthrough, Maygrim reached level 30+ and had something like 150 kills. But now I've realised that Frontliners are BY FAR the best class due to their 7 movement and 12 hp as Veterans. Early they only do 2 damage, and then 4 after reaching Veteran, but if you nurse them through to level 10 or so they become godly, one shot killing anyone. In my second successful playthrough, I had Den on level 30 doing about 35 damage. That's overpowered and basically breaks the class system, as leveling up only gives more damage, not hp.\n\nTravelling around Bedlam is relatively fun, but lacking variety. There are four enemy factions (Mutant, Marauder, Cyborg and AI) and some variety in the battles as each faction has a different mechanic, but once you learn what these are the variety fades. You'll need to upgrade your dozer to improve various efficiencies, but here I found that I maxed out the upgrades WAY too quickly, like within the first 30 mins of play. You'll encounter Elite enemies (helpfully signposted on the map when available), which join you when you defeat them. They are bigger (take up four squares), stronger (more dmg and hp) but seem to level up slower, so increasingly I have been using the normal units instead. It's harder to get them in cover too, on account of their size. Various random events will get you more units along the way, but you can't otherwise buy new units. As this is an Ironman game, you really need to babysit your team.\n\nAnd this is where I encounter my main problem with this game and the thing that will kill its long term replayability unless patched somehow. There's a Bedlam meter rapidly increasing that encourages you to get to Aztec City quickly, but NO consequence if you don't do so. Sure, at Bedlam level there are more enemies, but due to the 2 move mechanic this really doesn't matter very much. It just makes the battles longer. The enemy troops basically DON'T get stronger, just more numerous. Because you need to level your guys up to 20+, and because you need a lot of power cells to defeat King Viscera, you basically need to grind your way around the map. In my first successful game, I spent over 600 days in game and explored basically the whole map, and in my second game I got bored by around 400 days. Just by exploring every side point of interest, you'll collect passengers, crude, meat and most importantly power cells. I had over 4000 food and crude and 600+ power cells by 400 days this time, meaning I could either grind some more or go straight to Aztec City.\n\nOne of the replayability factors is the unlocking of new dozers, but this is very hard (and random) to do. I unlocked my first dozer (Cyborg) after 27 hours, even after completely scouring the map on my first playthrough! And the dozers themselves aren't that interesting. I still haven't unlocked the other three dozers. There are some bugs, such as when you defeat E-Radik-8 and he's supposed to join you. He doesn't appear in your roster but DOES interact in some quests. This game needs more variety, more rewards for playing. Some of the achievements didn't work before the patch, and some aren't working after the patch. There needs to be some reason to stop trawling the map, because currently that is the way to win. The Bedlam meter goes up far too quickly, the upgrades are far too easy to get, and once you get your guys levelled the game is too easy and grindy overall.\n\nThese caveats aside, for a game I spent $16 on, 28 hours of play is a big win, even if I never played again. And I will. The devs addressed some of the issues in the 1.5 patch, and I'm hopeful that in time they might add more variety and spice to the game. Skyshine's Bedlam is a good indie game in the squad based TBS genre, and I've enjoying playing it and can recommend it to fans of the genre!","September 28, 2015","true","48.5"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","6"

Well, one of the many runs/journeys you can make. This is a very difficult game which punishes you in regards to every choice made. Good tactics seem to be beaten by the sheer luck of the computer who seeming has the upper hand in every battle, playing on normal unlocks nothing. Skirmishes slowly wittle you down, men and women from your crew dying frequently and your resource pool tends to be pityful. Yet as desperate as it all seems and as frustrating as it can be, I really enjoyed it. The graphics are great, the character models cool (especially the elite units) and the gameplay fairly satisfying. I don't think this has the same charm as FTL (another rogue-like I'm a big fan of) but you might find yourself investing a fair amount of time into it. Despite me having completed this game and not FTL, the difficulty is annoying. Where FTL is hard it feels fair or justifably unfair (if your ships unprepared), this game is random and as stated earlier the A.I. is really lucky (at least it seems it). The route your taking is guess work at best. When trying to avoid a faction which I hate due to its abillty to disapear I had to enter it's area to progress. My whole crew including my best men were wiped out really early on therefore making it very difficult to comlete the game. Prehaps I am being slightly wimpish and forgetting the rogue-like priciples. I bought this game months after it came out so didn't encounter some of the bugs people did upon release. I also bought it in the sale so I am very happy with my purchase, therefore I whould recommend it despite some, probably, minor complaints. It will fill my post-apocalypse void until the next Mad Max film is released or I get bored of Fallout.","December 29, 2015","true","8.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Since posting my initial review for the pre-3.0 version of the game, which was a thumbs down due to massive problems with the old combat system, the developer has updated the core gameplay with a 2ap per unit system in their new "Bedlam Redux" edition. This is exactly what I and other players have requested for the game. Not only have the core combat mechanics been updated, but tons and tons of new events and content have been jammed into this game. Bedlam Redux is now a must-play for anyone who likes tactical combat and/or roguelike gameplay! If you already own it, boot it back up and enjoy! /END UPDATE\n\nI love roguelikes, the original and new XCOM games, brutal survival games like NEO Scavenger, FTL, Darkest Dungeon, etc. I like Iron-Man game modes. Some times losing is fun, like in Dwarf Fortress or Crusader Kings 2. The post-apocalyptic theme and wonderful aesthetic of Bedlam are a great fit for some seriously cool procedurally generated mayhem. Let me count the ways:\n\nTHE GOOD: ++ POLISH Bedlam Redux is a polished game and it shows in the menus, events, and evolved combat and loot mechanics.\n+++ ART Bedlam Redux has some amazing cyberpunk artwork. From combat animations to character art, the game oozes atmosphere.\n++ INTERFACE UI/UX design in this game is untuitive and first rate. Other games could learn from Bedlam Redux.\n+ SOUND The sound design in Bedlam is chunky and visceral, with evocative music that is a snug fit with the atomic wild west theme.\n\nTHE BAD: --- COMBAT SYSTEM I like that the Skyshine took a road less travelled and tried something new, BUT I think that the experiment on this one crucial system ultimately did not pan out. The combat system is pretty flawless now, wonderfully updated with the rest of gameplay elements being adjusted accordingly for a vastly improved experience\n\nTHE UGLY: Nothing! Bedlam is a treat for the eyes.\n\nVERDICT With Bedlam Redux edition, this game finally lives up to its potential. This is basically the best parts of FTL and XCOM presented in a Fallout/Cursed Earth/Mad Max setting. If a tactical roguelike piques your interest, do yourself a favor and PLAY THIS GAME.","February 17","true","22.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","6"

When you first load it up, beating the game feels like a pipe dream. It's not impossible, of course - it's just a trick to figure out how to exploit the tactical system to win more easily. The flavor is excellent, though there are some encounters that happen too frequently, jarring the suspension of disbelief. It's not for everyone, but if you are a fan of Heroclix-style move-limited tactical games, give it a go.\nPROS:\n-Good writing.\n-Excellent art direction.\n-Moderate amount of depth - hardly Dorf Fortress, but you can plunge in face first and find some interesting bits.\nCONS:\n-Steep learning curve for combat.\n-Unlocking anything is an exercise in luck.\n-Frequent repeats of certain encounters.\n\nBottom line: 5.5/10. Above average, certainly not for everyone, but fun for those that like the genre.","January 24","true","1.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I think people who are giving negative reviews now are mostly just predispositioned to not like the game because of its mixed reviews. Be an individual try it for yourself and form your own opinion.\n\n\nWhen I first saw this game I fell in love with the artstyle I think it's a beautiful looking game and the style reminds me so much of Borderlands which is a series I'm very fond of. I also heard it was a roguelike which is a genre I've really been getting into lately. To my dismay when I looked at reviews for the game they were all very mixed. So I watched a few videos of the gameplay and the way you traversed the map reminded me of FTL and even the events have similarities at every node there are chances for a bunch of different things to happen be it combat or some kind of trader wanting to trade fuel for passengers. The combat looked pretty cool too I'm into turnbased squad games although this game definitely does take a unique approach with its point system so you can only do a few actions per turn for all of your characters so most of the time you're only moving around one or two of your squad. Needless to say I bought the game and I really enjoy it so far.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful artstyle\n-Interactive devs*\n-Interesting turn based combat system\n-FTL style exploration\n-Tons of replayability\n*I know the devs are planning to add more content and that they've been taking everybody's complaints and criticisms into consideration. Initially I think they only had arcade mode, but they added tactical mode because it was what the players wanted don't hold me to that though I'm not positive.\nNeutral:\n-It's a very challenging game, which some will hate and some will love\nCons:\n-Leveling system feels like it could be better maybe adding a perk system per level would help\n-Range system is annoying at times I don't understand why snipers have the longest range but unless leveled have very limited hitboxes\n\nOverall I definitely recommend this game if you are willing to keep an open mind about the combat system and you are into the roguelike-lite genre. I don't think this game deserves all the bad rep it gets and I'm looking forward to the new content.","March 5","true","12.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Problem though is the silly two action a turn mechanic. There is no strategy, meat shield your sniper until she does flippin 12 or so damage a shot. You can't move and shoot so the enemies just runs at you as you merc them with the sniper, the lower level units that seem fit for hit and run, are more like run in and get killed. It is just very slow, you really just set ambushes behind cover. Damage is so high compared to the low health pool. I understand you want the whole, one move and your dead thing, but when a melee unit goes in, he will die. Now, this isn't SO bad that I didn't enjoy myself playing and beating it a few times.","November 4, 2015","true","6.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The Tactical RPG Strategy Roguelike combination is a brilliant blend and mixture of different genres, with the inclusion of an Invigorating Mad-Max word filled with rich lore and an unforgivingly psychopathic landscape truely makes the game feel grand and enjoyable. The Simplicity of the game and with the addition of the brilliant tactical battle system I kept on finding myself returning to the relentless Bedlam again and again.\n\nHowever, after a while, It does start to feel ever so slightly tedious as there really only are only a couple events and each one having more or less the same exact outcome.  Added with the fact theres not really much to do in terms of exploration. I really want to explore the lore and the people of Bedlam and I feel there should be more aspects in terms of exploration and things to do in the Game. Maybe having NPC towns that are owned by a non-hostile faction that randomly dot the map a different time each gamemode. In the town you have the abillity to buy and sell supplies, maybe even buy and sell crew members and even do quests for extra rewards and goodies.\n\nThats my only real complaint of the game in general. However the game itself is still brilliant. The great artstyle and music really does give the game its overall charm and atmosphere. All in all the producers did a cracking great job at this game which hits the Tactica Stratlegy Roguelike combination straight on the head.\n\nIn my opinion, its worth the full £15 (or $20 for my American Buddies)","December 12, 2015","true","6.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","4"

It's been updated to hell and back and a new gameplay mode exists that fixes all the problems without removing the old style.\n\nIN SHORT: Recommended, ESPECIALLY to people who have always wanted a bit more "roguelite" XCOM and love post-apocalyptic themes. To those people, this is manna from heaven now. Also to people who liked FTL. The game has two ways to play it, "arcade" and "campaign", first one is more like FTL (turn based, though) and the latter is like FTL met XCOM and they had a child that looks like FTL but acts like XCOM.\n\nIN LENGTH:\n------------------\nSo originally, and the reason for the mixed reviews initially was that there was only the "arcade" mode and a random unit placement on map. So instadeath at the start of the combat for units was a real thing. Further, the game system was so that there was two action points that you could distribute however you wanted among your units, and the actions they did, then the enemy did the same.\n\nThis meant that people died, often, and easily. The game was won only by husbanding one unit and getting him/her to Elite status and then using that unit to murder enemies mercilessly with the two AP you had per turn.\n\nThis mode still exists, it's called "ARCADE" and you can go and play it. Sans the random unit placement, that was fixed pretty soon, for obvious reasons that really should have occured to the devs while making the game. It's a bit like more unforgiving FTL with more content (random encounters, etc).\n\nBut now it also has a "CAMPAIGN" mode that it's like a XCOM meets FTL kind of thing. It's pretty damn nice combination that I haven't seen before. There is a very simple leveling system for the units, so it's not super full of special abilities or any such things. Interestingly, upgrading your units is crucial for the later game, so distributing kills is arguably as important as winning the fight in the first place. This exists in XCOM to some extent, but it's more of an annoyance in that game. However in Bedlam as the maps are pretty small, this is not actually annoying, but instead adds an another layer of strategy on top of the actual tactics of the combat. You absolutely want to make sure you level up your units in a sensible manner, so just "winning" a fight is not always the perfect solution. Of course, sometimes you just have to make do with what you've got.","October 29, 2015","true","2.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Two I love turn based games especially ones that focus on small team tactical combat. So this game speaks to me, I wouldn't say the art is for everyone and it is certainly more in the in-game animation and setting where this game grabs me. I also really like the complexity of the combat. I find trying to outmaneuver and fire on targets while in turn avoiding fire in this game suits me. So my enjoyment of this game is derived primarily from the moment to moment combat. I do like the overall art and the story is fun and cheesy and full of B Movie tropes. I am certainly a product of the generation that likes things like Cyborg, games like Wasteland, and some table top gaming. This game has the feel of a little bit of all of those. It has a system somewhat similar to FTL in it’s about good runs.\nMy negatives are few (so far) I wish when attacking all combatants would be facing the right direction for strikes. This game could do with a good tutorial as well, as some of the Movement and order of operations I find obtuse. All in all though this game is right in my wheelhouse and I am really enjoying it.","November 6, 2015","true","16.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I don't know if it's because of the new mechanics offered in the 2.0 version of the game, the fact that there are faction based chars that now have that sorta variety of unf (Just got a cyborg champ that takes damage to buff her damage, and a mutant champ that appears to heal himself etc) but it's pretty cool so far. The biggest 'bleh' I have is the combat, but as it is in the 2.0 beta, I'm enjoying it. I get far less frustrated, it has a bit more challenge when planning things out, and since your party doesn't lollevel quickly it actually adds that bit of hard that I enjoy.\n\nThe new addition of 'destroy all the bedlam factions' is nice too. I donno if any of my passengers will make it to azteck since i've got a mentality from my last playthroughs of 'not caring for them at all', I probably should now. But, point is... In the 2.0 version, which to my knowledge is a beta you can opt into (They have it in the information!) It's pretty fun. Like I said, biggest eh is the combat, it's a gimmick that is interesting but, it feels like I'm just dragging in big champ chars to back my main one champ I level as a 'just in case I needa save them' or something.\n\nNot sure if they should keep the combat or dunk it but, I'm enjoying the game now. I give it a tenative thumbs up-- Especially since the devs do seem pretty active on fixing everything and reading fan feedback. I think. I mean, I'm sure there were a lotta people complaining about the lack of variety and bam, it was fixed. Or maybe that was the plan from the get go..

The devs said they would address some of the biggest concerns and I feel they have done enough to justify a change on my review. (which you can find below)\n\nIf you are enjoy rouge-like/lite games then this should fill your need. There are enough elements to the game to make learning the best path take a few runs. After which you will be working toward getting the ending.\n\nI want to point out that my only minor complaint is with the fact the game gives you plenty of champs to fight with, but for the most part they are useless still. This doesn't really impact the game in a negative way, so I can't take points off. Just would be nice to see each of these champs be unquie or give value to them other then wasted meat to sheild my elites.\n\nOld Review\n\nTL:DR - In combat there is a 50/50 chance every encounter that enemies will be placed right next to you, or one of your champs is placed right next to them (this is not a good thing). Nothing you do, sort of cheesing (using an OP item) will prepare you for the end game. Getting extra characters is almost pointless (nothing will replace the guy you just lost with 23 kills).\n\nMy extended thoughts\nEnd game\nI was expecting some RNG tactical game where you build up a squad of fighters to go toe-to-toe with a big bad boss. After an epic battle, I would get a gratifying feeling knowing that I played my cards right with progression, that RNGesus blessed me just enough and my tactics were sound.\n\nAt this point, I feel no sense of achievement. On my first play-through, I did not lose anyone, had a badass sniper that did 12 damage (thats alot) and a squad of strong champs. Then the ending happened.\n\n****spoilers****\n\n\nMutant king form is unreasonably strong. I didn't have the one equalizer that heals when you get hit (didn't even know it existed on my first play) and I got rekt. What is worse? when you go to fight him again your whole epic party is gone and the whole fight starts over. You literally have 1 chance to beat him. There is no battle of attrition.\n\nCombat-\nI like the 2 turn thing. More realistic then a whole team moving.\nThe rock, paper, scissors feel to each character is alright.\nThe blitz mechanic gives a feeling of pressure to keep moving\n\nBiggest game ruiner for combat is the random placement at the start of combat. I can deal with not being able to place my team exactly, but the idea that the enemy can be placed behind my line is absurd. Imagine starting off where you are in a position to lose two champs at the START. I echo what someone else said- "I would never place my team like that" and add how did they get that close without getting shot first.\n\nEverything else\nPretty much everything else in the game is exactly as you would expect.

Personally I'm so happy with the new changes to combat it's made a huge difference to me. My team set up feels like it matters more and each character has their use. Rather than a wait till your useful approach. The death animations are still glorious and now I get to see many more of them. The combat feels much better when everyone can act. The old system made it so whoever was closer or got in trouble first was the one you played until they basically died or someone else was in more trouble. This new system provides much more in my opinion. Serious kudos to the dev for listening to peoples feedback and making it a choice so you can either play with the new redux rule set or the legacy ruleset. Seriously awesome work. Completely 180'd my opinion and It's something I can now confidently recommend thanks to the improvements.\n\n\n\n(Old Review)My first impression thoughts & gameplay below\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JcUFx8vWyew\n\nI loved the look of this game when I first saw the title. I'm a fan of rogue like games & the stories they can create comapred to someone else. Bedlam was looking to be a strong game with some great design. I love the combat animations and the environment. Sadly the main part of this game the combat feels dull rather than strategic. You get 2 actions across your entire team as does the enemy. So that one move one attack or 2 moves etc etc. However I often find both me and the AI are using one character for both our action points until one of us  loses that fighter then we move onto the next. The rest of our team just waiting patiently in the corner watching the action happen until it's their turn to be thrown into slaughter. The game is hard I won't deny which I do like. Leveling up a character if you can make them live that long and get enough kills will gain veterancy and start to just become all round better fighters. The challenge is a good challenge but where I thought I'd find myself loving the wasteland combat and losing my mind if I scored that lucky headshot or one of my best fighters just got butchered I'm finding myself sighing whenever combat begins. Not what I expected at all and it's a shame. The animations in combat are great so not getting to see them at their full potential kinda saddens me. As much as I want to I generally don't think I could recommend this game. Hopefully they make a seperate combat mode as a difficulty setting or their future games take a longer look at their combat.","September 18, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

I haven't managed many more hours with it (due to life, not crashes), but what I've been able to play was much better than what was originally offered.\n\nThe fights are still hard, no question - but they're supposed to be. There's far less nonsense as a factor making these fights hard. Don't plan, you die. Simple as that.\n\nThe 1.5 Patch made the game far more enjoyable, though I've yet to unlock anything (again, haven't put as much time in as I could). Still, your veterans make all the difference, and it feels a bit more rewarding to be able to accomplish things. The game feels like it has moved from an early access buy (we've all had enough of those, right?) to a full blown game.\n\nThat, and they listen to feedback and care what people post. It's now a recommendation from me. I look forward to seeing how the game continues to grow!\n\nPS: You're no longer screwed in fights from the get-go. You screw yourself by not moving the right way when enemies start advancing on you. Make the fault your own; give Bedlam a try!\n\n(read my former post just under this. Sad pandas were had.)\n----\n[OLD REVIEW]\nI've sank the better part of two days into this game and I do like it... in theory.\n\nThe problem(s) with it are what a lot of people mentioned, but even when you get past the combat, the "rookies will die / you're stuck with what you got" motivation and the fact that everyone you pick up (except for some special, special units) also starts at rookies, the game does have a method to it's madness.\n\nHowever, I find myself restarting if the first fight goes poorly. Usually, it does. If the first fight goes badly, you have First Fight 2, which usually doesn't go any better (because you have no veterans). If you DID get a veteran, that veteran is now Rocking House (capital letters), with no need to level up any other characters. It's kind of disappointing to not pick up any other veterans or anything while on the road.\n\nHere's the meat and potatoes though.. this game crashes a LOT. Got a neat looking event pop up, leading into a fight? Crash. Go back into the game, event is lost (as well as all other side events). Travelling between two different zones? Crash.  Finally start using a chain of event items that may or may not give you a new dozer (dozers are your ships, essentially, for the FTL comparison)? Crash.\n\nIt's frustrating, and it's disappointing. I backed this game and was waiting for it to come out for a long time.. I only hope it can be playable, because I'm sick of being irritated at no obvious probability displays, random crashes, and ludicrous encounters. I honestly think the game would be 100% better if they let you place down your own troops before the fight, but they aren't inclined to do that.\n[OLD REVIEW]","September 18, 2015","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This is a game that's always had great character and potential, and is now worth picking up. I can finally enjoy the game I've been waiting for.\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nThe concept and style of the game coupled together was an instant YES from me.\nHowever, the combat system feels clunky and unfair (the opposing force tends to have more players and better placing). I'd like to have seen each class with a more distinguished play style, perhaps a special move that uses up both turns to be able to use.\nSomething like:\nGrenades for Trenchers (like the enemy have)\nFlurry attack for Frontliners (multiple hits with a 50-50 chance of hitting)\nOverwatch style mechanic for snipers...I mean Deadeyes\nSprint move for Gunslingers\nAgain these are just basic ideas but I feel as though they would have given the combat a lot more depth.\n\nIf you're looking at getting this game you should ask yourself one question...\n\nDid you like The Banner Saga or FTL?\nA) Yes - Go and play those\nB) No - Buy either FTL or Banner Saga and play them instead\n\nIt's BEDLAM's combat system that is its biggest letdown.

MAJOR props to the devs. They've come a VERY long way from their restart and have worked closley with the community and taken all their feedback to make this game great.\n\nOkay, now to the actual game. It takes place in a post-nuclear world where your objective is to get your passangers across the wasteland from the only safe city known to the planet called Byzantine to a mysterious and legendary floating palace that is the only true safe haven called Azctec City. You use a veichal called a Dozer to traverse the wastelands which comes equipped with different weapons and battlefield upgrades.\n\nTraversing the Wasteland: You have X amount of Food, Crude (Fuel), Power Cells, and Passangers. Food and Crude are consumed daily, when you travel from one place to another x amount of food and crude is consumed for x amount of days it takes to get there. You can use power cells to upgrade your dozer or use it's weapons on the battlefield. Upgrades consist of Reduced Food and Crude consumption, Reduced amount if time it takes for combative crew members to heal, or reduce the amount of power cells it takes to use dozer weapons. Upon starting a game you may chose which faction you want your crew to be.\n\nFactions: Humans, Rouge AI, Mutants, Marauders, and Cyborgs.\nHumans: Well.... They're kinda average. Nothing special about them. At all. (As far as I can tell)\nMutants: Every time their cobmative turn comes up they regain one HP.\nCyborgs: Every turn they lose one HP but gain one Damage (This ability will not kill them, when they reach low enough health they will no longer gain damage and will not lose health)\nRouge AI: Every few Turns they become invulnerable to damage\nMauraders: Every few turns they gain the ability to move a few extra spaces.\n\nThe Crew: This consists of all the four classes and ranks of crew members.\nWhile selecting your Dozer and Faction, you also get to choose from four crew setups.\nNo Leader, No Elites, No Veterans, 12 Rookies.\nNo leader, 0 Elites, 3 Vets, 8 Rooks. Leader, 0 Elites, 1 Vet, 7 Rookies.\nOr Leader, One Elite, No vets and 5 Rookies.\n\nLeaders are a unit specific to the dozer but some can also be found as a weakend version of itself as an Elite. Leaders are very powerful. Elites can be found in the wastelands and are also powerful, Rookies are your average crew members that, if they achieve three kills become a veteran.\n\nThe four classes consist of Gunslingers, Deadeyes, Trenchers and Frontliners.\nGunslingers: Dual pistols, medium agility, medium damage, High Health. If hit from a target within their firing pattern they return fire.\nTrenchers: Shotguns, High agility, Higher damage, Medium Health and has knockback. If next to their target they ignore the benefit of cover.\nFrontliners: Highest agility, Lowest damage, Most agile. Considered to be the tanks of the crew and they only attack with Meele, Baton and shield. Always ignores cover.\nDeadeye: Lowest agility, Highest damage, Lowest health. Can inflict immense damage and if lucky achieves an instant kill headshot. Snipers of the crew, but very fragile.\n\nThis isn't like XCom where you can attack in a certain range, each class has a shooting PATTERN, it's hard to explain you're better off looking up gameplay and looking for the red dots as people move and shoot. After successfully completing a combative encounter you gain resources immedietly. If you lose, you either lost all your deployed crew (4 people) or fled. Upon losing passangers leave the dozer.\n\nThere are two modes, Tactics mode and Arcade mode. In tactics mode each squad member gets two turns, if they fire upon their second turn their attack only does 60% damage. (Please note, later in the game the enemy has MORE units then you do and WILL overwhelm you if you do not make use of your dozer weapons. Upgrade earlier, so you don't need to be afraid of using your powercells later.) I'll be honest, I don't play much of Arcade mode so I won't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you about it. I can't help you there, I'll come back and edit this section later.\n\nTo win you must traverse the wasteland and find four artifacts, then fight the supreme ruler of the Wastelands, King Viscera. While traveling to find these artifacts you may come across resources, but more importantly Points of Interest. POIs can be anything, from simply a fight, to stumbling upon a new recruit, all the way to finding new battle upgrades and weapons for the dozer. Also equally as important are Elites. Elites as mentioned befor are powerfull units that can put up a real fight. To achieve these units, you must find them marked on the map and defeat them in combat. This will go a long way in helping you get to Aztec city.\n\nSO I would definetly recommend this game and I must give huge props to the devs for sticking with this game for oh so very long and making it great, working closely with the communits. I'll summarise quickly at the end here but please read the whole thing. <3\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful Artwork/Graphics\n- Clear path to goals via tutorials.\n- You feel accomplished after finishing a run and unlocking the next dozer.\n- Combat is quick to get used to and easy to learn\n- Character designes for Elites and Humans are pretty cool.\n\nCons:\n- Traversal system is just a little bit unclear... At times you'll want to get to somewhere on the map, but the problem being is you can't see movment options past either what is immedietly available or what has already been traveresed, so sometimes you'll be RIGHT NEXT TO your destination, but you can't go to it and have to go to three other places first without knowing how many places you'll need to travel or which path to chose (major waste of resources) but it's usually dealable and dosn't get too bad.\n- The combative system in this game IS NOT for everyone. Some people will despise the way in which classes are set up to be able to shoot in a pattern instead of a range. Example: Your dual pistoled gun slingers become stupid and can't bring themselves to shoot someont standing right infront of them because they have to be X amount of tiles away, in a certain tile pattern away from the gunslinger. (This is for all classes, in different patterns.)\n- Crew designes for factions other then humans get dull. All the Females have one portrait and all the Males have one. The Humans are the only ones with diversity. And they don't have an ability (as far as I can tell).\n\nAnd that pretty much sums it up! After reading this you should look up some videos befor buying it to really be sure if this game is for you. It's a good game now, a really good game. But it is not for everyone. At all. HUGE props to the devs though! Go check out their other games, give em some support. ^^","December 19, 2015","true","34.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

The new combat system is indeed way more enjoyable and instinctive now.\nOn the world map, your soldiers can now interact and speak to you in the events you encounter, which is nice. Some events involves the passengers, I don't recall that from my previous runs so that's cool too.\nA few tooltips here and there could be nice to have, for exemple when you choose your dozer at the beginning of a new game, you can't see its specs or special weapons.\nBut it is overall a far better game now, and it is pleasing to see how the developers listened the reviews and improved their game. Good job to ya!\nI have changed my mighty seal of approval to a glorious green thumb.\n\n\nWas really interested at first by the art, the setting and the concept.\n\nBut the game has many flaws. You are supposed to transport a bunch of people accross the wasteland, but it is just, litterally, a number. You begin with 1000, can loose or gain some depending of scripted events, and that's it. No interaction, no dialogue, no empathy. A number.\n\nThen the fights are based on an arbitrary rule that you can only move twice a turn, even if you have more soldiers (4 max).\nTruth be told, that is the same for the ennemies. They do have a rule called "blitz", though, meaning they can from time to time move 3 times. And not you. You also have to gather ressources on the battlefield to continue your journey. All put in the nutshell, it is a greatly frustrating gameplay. It is compared to chess because you have to "chain-cover" your soldiers with others, but the range of attacks are not either 1 case or a straight line, meaning the fights are often confusing and I forget some dude in the process resulting in immediate death among my ranks.\n\nThe early game is really difficult, but after some time you can kill everything with just one dude and a huge shotgun. That very dude was killed in the end by a random sniper that has apparently a chance to one shot everything. We are talking about a basic ennemy here, that slained an elite soldier you have to keep levelling up to be effective.\n\nI like difficult games (for exemple I like Darkest dungeon a lot), and I gave this game many tries, but I just don't have fun while fighting, and I don't feel like the commander of an armored vehicle and its inhabitants.\n\nThis is however a nice try and the concept is nice.","November 14, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","6"

I'll be keeping, adding, and removing to my original review as needed.\n\nWhat is this game?:\nBasically...  Xenonauts + FTL + in a wasteland = Skyshine's Bedlam REDUX.  The premise.. you have a giant map with a bunch of winding roads.  You load up a massive APC-like super vehicle of your choosing, then trek off across the map to reach the end.  As you travel between nodes along the road paths, you will often have to choose which direction to take at crossroads and what detours to take, in order to collect resources like fuel, weapons, allies, and special storyline objects needed to complete the game.  However, the more stops you make, the higher your threat meter becomes, making tougher enemies appear, and in larger groups.\n\nAlong your journey, you will run into many randomized events that may help you, or try to stop you.  Many of these will be battles which take place in isometric "Tactics" style randomized battlegrounds.  If you have played Xenonauts, Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre Tactics, Front Mission 3, etc etc, you'll know exactly what kind of fighting I'm talking about.\n\nIf you succeed, travel the lengths of the map, and defeat the boss at the end, you are rewarded with unlockable vehicles for future playthroughs.\n\nPros:\n- Turn based combat system resembling classics like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fallout Tactics: BoS, Front Mission 3, etc\n- Very cool Art\n- The game seems a lot more polished and easy to get into now.\n\nCons:\n- RNG Heavy.  This can lead to stressful games, as there is a large amount of luck involved before a fight begins.  As an example; just like my previous review of the game, I ended up in a battle semi-early on against 5 enemy frontliners that immediately surrounded me and were far tougher than I.  It was also taking place inside my vehicle, so I couldn't use vehicle weapons to AoE/soften them up.  Despite having 4 veterans, the 4 enemies also were nearly 1 hitting my guys, which was making my vehicle heal ability pointless.  Up until this battle, I was doing quite well, having not lost a single unit.\n- Tiny battlefields.  This makes attempting strategic fights sometimes impossible.  Often enemies will spawn already in weapons range and/or so close to you that you can't back up out of their move/attack range due to an invisible wall directly behind you.\n- Very little cover.  Each fight, a random assortment about 2-8'ish cover blocks will spawn, sometimes far enough away from you that you don't get to use them before already taking fire.\n- 4 units per fight, with no AoE units.  This requires some explaining.  You can build up a fairly huge roster, yet only 4 can ever come out at once.  The enemy however, will start greatly outnumbering you, the further you make it on the map.  If one of your unit's HP hits 0, perhaps due to a rush of enemies that focus fired all on one ally, the unit is dead.. no knock outs, no bringing it back, no salvaging anything from it, all it's hours of kills lost in a single turn.  This creates a scenario where you end up choosing 4 units to be your main force, and focusing all your leveling into them, to stand up to these overwhelming odds.  Which in turn, makes losing one to RNG or a bad battle decision, all the more catastrophic.  You'll be stuck having to relevel a new unit against stronger enemies, in greater numbers, before the end of the map.  You do get AoE abilities in your vehicle which can help deal with huge numbers.  But that's assuming you can get them into range, have the spare energy cells, and can target the enemy without hitting your own units.  This is probably an intended gameplay mechanic, but it's a very high stakes one that may leave you flustered when a unit gets assassinated, extremely dropping your chances of success.\n\n\nSummary:\nI feel like the game has gotten a lot easier to play since my last review.  Enough so, that I can see some people enjoying it.  I myself, will probably put some more time into it.  The RNG aspect has gotten seemingly a lot better than it was previously...  as it feels like I can now work out strategies to combat really bad luck situations.  But that's assuming I haven't just gotten lucky so far in my recent games.  The restrictive battles also make me feel like the available strategies for use in a fight are pretty limited.  But that simplicity can also be a plus side to some.  Shoot stuff, bigger numbers win, use cover/buffs/AoE to shift numbers in your favor when overwhelmed, rinse and repeat.\n\nAll in all, I feel I can recommend this game now.  Much less infuriating lol.","September 17, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","15"

Below are a few points that I thought were improved:\n\nCombat system\n\nOh man, this is so much better than the last time I played.  Each character on the battlefield gets 2 actions per turn now instead of a shared pool of actions.  Also, there is now a penalty for decreased damage done that round if you have to move your character, which rewards players for thiking ahead and placing characters in strategic positions.\n\nResource collection\n\nSo far i have only played the campaign version of the game, not the arcade, but I love that resources are now provided to you after a successful battle instead of you having to manually pick them up during the battle themselves.\n\nAdditional death animations\n\nI love the enemy death animaltions when killed by your sniper, however, the frontliner's bad ♥♥♥ elbow drop is still my favorite.\n\nAll in all, this game is way more awesome since the REDUX update, and I will be spending more time with it.\n\n\n---------Below is my original review---------\n\nThe Good:\n-Artwork\n-Soundtrack\n-The writing, its not great but I found it entertaining\n- Some of the death animations\n\nThe Bad:\n-Combat system.

I found the combat system clunky and frustrating.\n-Over-reliant on abilities that cost power cells (in game currency) especially at the end of the game, felt cheated several times when I got to the end.\n\nFor me, Bedlam was about 25% entertainment and 75% banging my head against the keyboard.

I'll be keeping, adding, and removing to my original review as needed.\n\nWhat is this game?:\nBasically...  Xenonauts + FTL + in a wasteland = Skyshine's Bedlam REDUX.  The premise.. you have a giant map with a bunch of winding roads.  You load up a massive APC-like super vehicle of your choosing, then trek off across the map to reach the end.  As you travel between nodes along the road paths, you will often have to choose which direction to take at crossroads and what detours to take, in order to collect resources like fuel, weapons, allies, and special storyline objects needed to complete the game.  However, the more stops you make, the higher your threat meter becomes, making tougher enemies appear, and in larger groups.\n\nAlong your journey, you will run into many randomized events that may help you, or try to stop you.  Many of these will be battles which take place in isometric "Tactics" style randomized battlegrounds.  If you have played Xenonauts, Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre Tactics, Front Mission 3, etc etc, you'll know exactly what kind of fighting I'm talking about.\n\nIf you succeed, travel the lengths of the map, and defeat the boss at the end, you are rewarded with unlockable vehicles for future playthroughs.\n\nPros:\n- Turn based combat system resembling classics like Final Fantasy Tactics, Fallout Tactics: BoS, Front Mission 3, etc\n- Very cool Art\n- The game seems a lot more polished and easy to get into now.\n\nCons:\n- RNG Heavy.

I\'m a big fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, and having it be a roguelike got be all hot and bothered about this game. I\'ve been waiting ever since it was announced on Kickstarter. Additionally, when I heard it was using the Banner Saga engine, I completely lost it. Having said all that, if you\'re expecting the same level of heavy strategizing as Banner, you\'ll be disappointed. The beauty of Banner was manipulating the small and large characters around the board, and the physical health and defensive health dichotomy doesn\'t have the same importance as in Banner. I do enjoy the different class of soldiers you get to use, the Dozer\'s special abilities, and the chance to recruit unique characters. Furthermore, they recently updated the game, so it now offers a campaign and arcade, the latter which is for more casual gamers with no interest in managing resources.\nAll round, get this game.","June 1","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is way too expensive just for a bunch of artworks.\n\nThe characters you recruit all have a badass biography but they actually have the same stats as the lower ennemy mooks.\n\nThe first time a character levels it gets a significant boost in all its stats (dmg/health/range/mvt) and gets a full heal (btw the new costume is crap). The next levels only increases your dmg by 1 each time. You don't get to choose which stat to upgrade. There is no perks or skill tree.\n\nThe level system is completely broken since the only stat that change is dmg and there is no level/stat cap.\nA soldier starts with 5 dmg and can level to 100 dmg if you grind enough. The consequence is that you can 1 or 2 shoot bosses. It is even more ridiculous with sniper units that stay at very low health: they can one shoot anything but any random mook can one shot them.\n\nYou can recruit elites. Elites tend to have more health and more limited movement but any over-leveled unit you have will deal considerably more damage.\n\nYou can unlock extra dozers but they don't get unique abilities or weapons. Their screens use the same art as the starting dozer even if the current dozer is a giant mutant creature. The APC unit is the same for all dozers. The starting crew of a faction dozer is not fully staffed with unit from this faction.\n\nThe enemies are basically all the same but with a different skin and a lame ability on top. Mutants should rarely use guns but instead use mutant abilities (acid spit, spikes, tentacles/extensible tongue, etc.). Some factions should have pets (war dogs for marauders, mutant beasts for mutants). Factions should differ in numbers, abilities, stats and technological level\n\nThe combat is crap but could be easily improved:\n-allows 4 ap by turn with a limit of 2 ap by unit\n-introduce special abilities (the gunslinger can throw grenades for instance)\n-introduce special attacks: charged/spread shot - a minigunner may be able to hit multiple targets at once. This is one of the biggest issue with combat: you have to slowly take out ennemies one by one and you can have 10+ at the same time.\n-implement a real cover system\n-give the unit the ability to carry items in battle\n-have not all the battles be with a ton of low level mook but have battles with less enemies but more veteran/elite enemies.\n-have more weapons on the dozer but with a tiered system (the more powerful a weapon the more it costs in energy, has a longer cool-down, may actually require a specific ressource such as individual nukes)\n-have unit movement & range makes sense\n-weapons & powers may cost less but have cool downs & the amount of energy may be capped\n-have new classes (the rocket cyborg shouldn't be treated as a sniper) & hybrid classes\n\n\nThe combat is bad but what is much worse is the complete lack of content and replayability: you will get the same events over and over with the same outcome. Also there is too much points of interest their number should dwindle the more you explore a location.  Interesting point of interest that require a specific item  should stay on the map so that you can revisit them later when you find the item. Of course there is also way too many battles. It gets old extremely fast.\nThe game is also lacing events such as mechanical problems, freak climatic events, conflicts inside the dozer, etc.\nThere is no choices & consequences. The game is missing towns where you can trade resources & recruit dudes.\n\nSome mechanisms do not make any sense:\n-Why do 300 passengers flee after a lost or abandoned battle ? They will die in the wasteland.\n-Why can I recruit passengers from warring factions ? It will bring war to the dozer.\n-Why the marauder dozer can recruit cyborgs their sworn ennemies and vice-versa ?\n-Why does the mutant dozer consume crude ?\n-Why can I sell my passengers to slavers or merchants to get ressources ?","December 23, 2015","false","38.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","2"

Interesting ideas hampered by appauling lack of consideration\n\nThis game is closer to chess than it is x-com, with the move limit being 2 per turn for the entire squad rather than a move per unit. You also tend to find your units in a Dead or Not dead situation, simmilar to being "taken" in chess rather than actualy having a hope in hell of surviving.\n\nThe issue is unlike chess you cannot afford to sacrifice units in this game. you have a finite number of troops per run and no way of reliably getting more. Compound this by the game forcing you to gamble for resources and random events which may kill you but are still crucial to being able to advance and you have a game that is frustrating in how harshly you are punished, while at the same time it forces you to make these bad choices.\n\nEach unit was clearly meant to fill a certain role but that gets a little fuzzy because they all perform the same two actions, move and shoot. Sniper = damage dealer, Frontline = meat shield, Gunslinger = generalist risk taker, trencher = target practice. With none of them possessing any real useful abilities and the Sniper being the only one who can deal enough damage to dependable take out the enemy you will find yourself rarely activating some units. I feel if each class possessed a unique feature to differentiate themselves you could have had a far more tactical game experience.\n\nTo compound this further you and the AI use identicle units, adding to the chess illusion. however the AI has advantages that you have no equivilant to, such as the Blitz mechanic where after a certain number of turns the enemy gains a one off additional action. This is serves no real purpose but to punish the player for being cautious or trying to gather resources (which you need to stay in the game). The player version of this are resource draining boosts you can use, but they start out so expensive early on as to be unusable until mid/late game at which point you have bigger concerns.\n\nAfter two attempted runs and some internet research I have no desire to play this game. I feel unrewarded for good play and punished for choices I had no real option but to make.","November 4, 2015","false","0.9"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","1"

This leads to unexpected deaths when the cover rules work differntly than expected (could use a lot better UI on when cover applies or not, sometimes when you are flanked it stops working, sometimes not).  The abalnce of resources seems a ittle random as well, with some games they not being that scarce, and others extremely dear to the point of impossible.\n\nThe art/music/writing/ and core programming are all excellent and I hope for more great things from this team, but sadly this game just isn't that fun as is.","March 12","false","7.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

Just be aware that the combat system is like that in The Banner Saga, not like that in Shadowrun / Fallout 1/2/Tactics / Divinity:Original Sin / etc. - your characters don't have individual action points, but each side in the conflict get 2 moves each round, to spend on moving or attacking.\n\nWell, and sometimes your enemies get 3 moves if you don't kill any of them over enough turns in a row, presumably to keep you from just sitting there doing nothing while your enemy has to spend all their moves to get in range to attack you - only to not be able to attack because they're now out of moves - allowing you to blast them to pieces effortlessly during your turn since now they're in range.\n\nAnyway, it's just sad that it gets so annoying a few hours in. Sure, if you can deal with the combat system, it's a pretty good game for the first few hours. Pretty simplistic, but entertaining enough. Then you make it to the aztec city, and turn around to fight king viscera. He's pretty hard, but you manage to beat him, probably at the cost of a good chunk of your stored up power and probably a couple of your best fighters. Then you face him again. And again. And again. And by the third or fourth time, you're either completely out of characters strong enough to actually fight him, or you're out of the power required to use the 'equalizers' necessary to have king viscera not just kill one of your characters every turn.\n\nThe game's combat system reveals itself to be very broken in situations where one side has a character vastly more powerful than anyone on the other side. Your characters have 5-20 health and do 5-10 damage per attack, while your enemy's character has 60+ health and does 10+ damage every attack.\n\nSo what happens is just he walks up to your characters with his 2 action moves, you shoot him twice with your action moves, then the next turn he kills 1-2 of your characters (unless you spent moves running out of range of him, in which case you weren't shooting him, never mind how you just have him BLITZ points, which generate when you're not attacking, so if you do that enough he gets a 3-move turn), then you shoot him 2 more times, then he kills your 2 remaining characters and you lose. Only way to actually beat him is use 'equalizers' that keep your characters from dying every turn, but those cost power and power is limited.\n\nOnly way I can even imagine being able to beat the game is by, in a very un-roguelike fashion, literally spending hours (with no savegame feature as far as I can tell) grinding in the wasteland to gather enough power to be able to spam equalizers constantly during the king viscera fights.\n\nOverall... I want to recommend this, but I just can't. The first few hours are pretty good, but the final part of the game is just, well, not very.","October 2, 2015","false","7.2"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","12","26","0","1"

This enables them to move, shoot twice and kill one of your people, and then move another unit.\n-Little difference between novice and elite members.\n-Dozer abilities are too costly and appear to be one use / combat.\n-Little reason to trust any group you encounter, so no reason to treat any encounter as anything other than flavor text.\n-Foes jump onto the dozer and cut into it in about every encounter I've played so far.  What use is it to have an armed dozer if it can't be used to fight them off?\n-Guns in combat can't be used above or below the set range.  This severely limits combat.  Combat is boiled down to a pseudo knight's dance to get your man to the right range to shoot.  Keep in mind that with 4 AP, this takes 3 of it (1 for movement, 2 for combat), leaving only 1 AP to move another.","March 6","false","0.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","3"

I'm sort of new to the whole XCOM-type combat system, but I've played a little bit of it and it's very simple to figure out.  It's literally chess.  Some units can attack with only 1 space of range, some give you a much broader attack range (like a shotgun, for example), and some require a certain distance (a rifle unit cannot attack unless they are a certain number of spaces away from the target).\n\nWell... the idea, and the combat, is fine... but the problem I have is how the game progresses.  There's no skirmish mode, campaign mode, or any of that stuff.  There's only one type of game mode, and that's the roguelike thing where you drive around this big truck on a giant map with a countless number of random events.  In between battles, your units basically don't heal at all.  It says like, 25 days to heal each unit, so basically do not expect a single hit point to be healed ever.  If they die, they're dead forever.  You have a limited number of units, fuel, and meat.  You can pick up fuel and meat on the battlefield, at the end of the battles, sometimes in random events they are given to you, and you may even find a meat/oil trader along the way.\n\nYou are given meat and oil bonuses if you take a fewer number of units on the battlefield, but since you can take as long as you want in between turns, I always take the full 6 units out with me, this gives me a much broader choice of actions.  So your 6 units are placed on a battlefield against their 6 units.  The amount of damage each unit does and the amount of hit points they have varies, but you and your opponent are equally matched.  Often times I would lose 2 or 3 units, since they die on 1 hit most of the time!  Some enemies doing upwards of 5-6 damage, when your units may only have 2-5 health.  The units which have 10 health, which is actually a pretty decent amount, only 2 damage to your enemy, and can only attack one single space in front of them.  Since they'll have to attack numerous times to take anyone down, you can expect them to be at least half dead after each enemy.  Remember, there's no healing in this game either.\n\nLet's say you played a game of chess against someone, and you lost half of your chess pieces, would you feel confident enough to face another opponent using your remaining pieces?  I don't think anyone's ever tried doing that before, a sort of 'survival' chess...  Probably because it's not that good of an idea.  Yet this game embraces doing exactly that.\n\nYou start with 16 units.  After 3 or 4 battles, you'll be lucky to have 6 good ones left.  The enemies will slowly chip away at your team.  And so far the only way I have found to recruit extra team members is to defeat a boss, then the boss joins you.  This is a really cool feature, actually, but those bosses do like 7-9 damage per hit.  You might be able to take him down with 3 well placed rifle shots but they are not easy to kill, and you may end up losing half your team in the process.  It sounds easy enough, right?  Shoot him a few times.  But the unit movement is very awkward, you will lose turns trying to line up your shots.  Sometimes you can kill them with ease, but they also have equal opporntunity to kill you with ease.  And they do.\n\nSo basically, I have not survived more than 18 minutes before getting a game over.  I'm not big into reading the long dialogs so I just skip them and get right into the combat as soon as I can.  When it's 6 against 6, there's a good chance I lose a unit or two in battle.  After 4 battles, I barely have anyone left.  Then it's game over.  Is this really all there is to this game?  I think this game would be better off if I had twice as many units, or twice as many hit points, or something.  I'm playing on the easy difficulty, too.  Never tried normal.  And I still can't seem to last 20 minutes.  The gameplay isn't rocket science.  You move into range, click to attack, then they do their turn, either killing you instantly or cutting your health in half.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game.  Seems a few other reviewers are also having the same experience, but not all.  The developers have even said in the discussions that they are working on balancing the combat system...  They should have done that prior to release in my opinion.  I can't give them tips on how to improve it, though, as the concept sounds great but it's just awful in practice.  I didn't even get into detail of the limited fuel and how annoying it is to get a game over because you run out of fuel.  You have 1000 fuel to start.  It takes anywhere from 30 to 200 fuel to move your truck a space.  That's another aspect to manage and it runs out very quickly.  Move your truck 5 times and then it's game over, play the whole thing over from the beginning!  Rediculous.  Just play XCOM, if you are into these types of games, at least that game gives you a fighting chance.","September 16, 2015","false","6.5"," 58 of 121 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","58","121","0","2"

As a KS backer, the development hype was pretty constant.  I was a bit salty about them not delivering on the launch promise of OSX support which dampened the enthusiasm a bit.  But as it turns out, it was a blessing in disguise anyway since there were so many issues with bugs and gameplay mechanics that were fixed later.  Credit to the devs for continuing to listen to feedback and make adjustments.  However, even in its second iteration, while an improvement from where it was, still doesn't scratch the itch of a deep, tense, tactical....well, squad tactics game.  The simplicity with which the battle mechanics were implemented is a disappointment - much more checkers than chess as I've seen others describe it.  Units do not truly provide counterpoints to each other, the leveling incentive is more about grinding to stay alive rather than developing unique assets that you feel invested in and are fun to use/play.  Hits are almost always guaranteed minus whatever equalizer was used - even then I've only ever seen one missed hit in 6 hours of play.  6 hours ain't a whole lot compared to what I've sunk in many other games but I don't feel the desire to spend more time to dig out whatever additional incremental value remains in this game.","April 4","false","6.5"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Have not yet played the new version.\n\nSo this is my first review ever so I'm unsure if I will be doing this right or not. Though I'll try to keep it short since who has time in this generation to read nowadays amirite? (ﾉ´ｰ`)ﾉ TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nI am an avid fan of xcom style of games. Currently clocked at 110+ hours on both Xcom 2 and Xenonauts with many more hours off steam which is unaccounted for so I feel I have a good grasp on the genre.\n\nCurrent relevant cons are:\n\n- Although the devs have been attempting to balance combat prior to release, difficulty ramp is still exceptionally difficult. You go from 1-2 enemies to 5, to 9, then +11 very quickly. This coupled with -\n\n- The turn system is unlike xcom etc, where your whole team takes a turn and then the enemy. You each get two "moves" in rotation, move move or move shoot etc. This discourages you against bring more troops on the field as a "bodies I can lose resourse" since you can't use them all in a given turn. In addition to this you get more rewards the less units you have in the field (and you really need these bonus resources to get through the game) meaning, when you be bring 3 guys against 9+ and you lose a guy to oneshots things get hairy real fast.\n\n- End game is still broken. Fighting Freeza going through all his forms as say Krillin you know your gonna have a bad time. Didn't stock up on energy cells before you got to the end? Tooooo baddddd.\n\nLastly my biggest gripe with the game is that, its mechanics is against all the turn-based games it associates itself with in the genre. The most loveable aspect about its kin is the attachment you grow with your units that you have kept alived through the entire game. That feeling of naming yourself and your friends ingame and you try to keep your guys alive through it all. However with the randomised spawns and the current design of everyone being oneshottable it is impossible to keep anyone in this game alive to grow any sort of attachment to. Your guys spawn in a cluster facing a crossfire of the aforementioned 7-13+ enemies with only 2 moves before the enemy gets to act means every battle you bring someone to the field as a throwaway meatshield which I myself find extremely unfun and is against what I look for in such a game.\n\nTL:DR. As of this date I do not recommend purchase of this game if you someone that plays the genre for the attachment value of your troops.  + End game broke.","September 16, 2015","false","2.2"," 42 of 90 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","42","90","0","4"

TL;DR is it doesn't live up to any of those influences, and game-breaking bugs had me restarting the game every 10-15. Disappointing. Don't buy. If you do buy, don't play for more than the refund-maximum 2 hours before you decide whether you've had enough of the bugs/wonkiness of the game design.\n\nPros: Art style, setting, style of game. I really really wanted to like this, for the designer's ideas To Work, especially after they took pains to push out a new combat turn system for the Redux.\nCons:\n-Bugs. Crashes on ability use, on end of encounter, on character deaths, on random event proc, and most frustratingly during final narrative cut-scene dealio.\n-Roguelike elements go out the window when after your first wipe your ONLY option is to "resume campaign" from your last autosave point, even more critically with a new seed on random encounters, positioning, etc. Savescumming removes what little difficulty this game could have...and the game forces you into savescumming. Hoped this was a bug. Had to reinstall to start a new campaign. Same thing. Sooo...not a bug?\n-Lack of difficulty under the new combat system, frustrating-gameplay-as-difficulty mechanic under previous.\n-You have the illusion of choice in your route, but to win you have to hit the same 4 points. Other main interest points highlighted on the map are Strongly Recommended, especially if you cranked the difficulty up when you started. You can go back to previous points. Less engaging than randomization of FTL path.\n-Where FTL had the looming armada-catching-up-to-you to drive you forward, difficulty here is intended to gradually scale the longer your trip takes, the more victories you rack up. Longer time farming side missions/making your way=more health on enemies=hurry up, Leroy. In theory, neat. In practice, you just end up taking your high damage units and abusing abilities with the "threat bar" maxed out, with the only option to reduce "threat" being to intentionally lose fights/sacrifice units. My first few encounters at maxed threat (relatively early on the map) was challenging-ish, until I realized you could spend ability resources to reduce ability costs and out-of-combat healing time. Game then became "which I-win button should I use?"\n-Cover mechanic is poorly implemented. Enemies huddled on the same side of a barrier as your Thuper Awesomesauce Unique Sniper Man take reduced damage as though they were BEHIND said cover. Shotgun pushback is the only consistent way to push a unit out of cover, and is inconsistently applied. Can't destroy said cover. Can't deploy cover.\n-Lack of variation/depth in factions. Factions! NEAT! FTL had those! But here each faction encountered or played as has very little variation in playstyle, either in their units or in abilities on their faction meatwagon. Abilities unique to one faction are obtainable as on-use abilities picked up as overly frequent drops as you truck along, and didn't seem to meaningfully change how fights played out (either as or vs. said faction). Faction abilities being based on turns (every other, every third) at first seemed like a depth-adding element (FOCUS DOWN THE KILLER ROBOT BEFORE IT GOES INVISIBLE WARGLARBLE) but effectively...didn't add much at all.\n-Lack of depth/variety in units. Vanilla units get better with kills, up to a rank cap- neat!!! But these levelups only add 1 more damage, some units get more health. Elite units have higher health than their normal versions, have unique looks or are at least a reskin of their baseline version. Else, just different effective ranges, movement values between classes.\n-Non-elite units are meat fodder until you can replace them with elites. Some thought went into making your starter guys feel special (unique interactions with specific random events) but effectively...nope. You're going to take whoever has the shiniest damage score and the largest health pool. AKA elites, or veterans you pick up randomly and regularly.\n-No ability to customize units. Not asking for X-COM 2 levels of visual or ability customization, but...damn.\n-Unique aspects to each of the classes felt...half-♥♥♥♥♥:\n->Snipers: Squishy high damage, nothing to see here. Need to be positioned Just So to pull off damage vs. other games' accuracy mechanics, scaling damage based on range, etc.\n->Shotgunners: Randomly (if you don't want them to/if you don't really need them to/if squint reaaaally hard at the screen before clicking attack) MIGHT push enemies back, might even push them out of cover. Woo!\n->Gunslinger reactive shots: Get hit by enemy in targetable squares= counterattack tiem. Neat! No overwatch, but ok, something newish. Only...reaction shots seem to be bugged, do not proc as described/intended/with any regularity and by endgame/high levels of threat the plink damage from reaction shots doesn't stack up to merit bringing gunslingers over meatshields/snipers/shotguns.","March 19","false","4.4"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","1"

Please take this into consideration if you choose to read on\n\n-------------------\n\n\nSo, Skyshine's BELDAM. Where to begin...\n\nThis game, as with many others like it, falls into the cracks made by FTLs earth-shattering redefinition of the roguelike genre. It's so painfully, agonisingly close to a good game but for me it just doesn't quite measure up. Let me cover this bit by bit so I don't miss anything out.\n\nThe Dozer. You'd think this'd be a decent chunk of the game considering the amount of work that's gone into it's art and how it's front-and-centre of the games lore, but it doesn't feel like you're in one at all. It lacks primarily in two ways.\nFirst, the dozer is presented as a sort of Ark for people looking to make it to Aztec City. The number in the dozer menu says you have 1,000 souls on board, but it might as well be zero as they don't have any bearing on the gameplay. They can be traded away to various encounters just like fuel, meat or power cells. The Banner Saga wracked me with guilt and anguish by visibly seeing people abandoning the caravan or starving to death. In this? Gimme the power cells!\nSecondly, the dozer has very limited gameplay influence. Outside of bombardments, it's absent from combat. You frequently fight inside it, but this just means you can't use bombardments and if you lose this particular fight it's game over (negative reinforcement gaming booo). You can (re: must) spend power cells on upgrading various efficiencies, but there's no choice here, no interesting decision to weigh up. Your best choice is to upgrade them all when you can. This is neither FTL nor Convoy in highlighting strengths and weaknesses of a given vehicle. It's just a thing you see on a map.\n\nThe combat. The difficulty spikes and troughs are gargantuan. The early-game is incredibly difficult. You'll lose virtually irreplaceable rookie units at a steady rate through no fault of your own. The enemy plays by the same rules as you do, but with a much less greater sense of self-preservation. They'll move their guys into suicidal positions to kill someone on your side, and while it's no big deal for them in this random battle, steady losses means your guys don't live long enough to level up and be useful. Playing in any way other than perfectly defensive will lead to heavy losses that you can't claw back from. Better units are recruited only by defeating them, so if you've already got a depleted roster and lose a few more trying to recruit a heavy hitter...\nIf you're able to keep one or two rookies alive long enough to get 3 or more kills, they become significantly more useful. Recruiting said heavy hitters then become much easier, who drastically improve your roster further, and from then on until near the end of the game it's easy street. I've only encountered the end few fights once but holy Moses does the difficulty explode to astronomical levels again.\nBoth ways that the game handles increasing difficulty are unpalatable. In one way they turn guys into massive bullet-sponges (which is unsatisfying as you've worked so hard to have upgraded soldiers to just have it negated ) and the other by drastically increasing the number of enemies (which is also unsatisfying because they still only get two actions a turn, so you end up churning through a steady trickle of weak enemies, which make you a lot stronger a lot quicker). The enemies themselves stay the same in terms of weapon and movement range.\nMy overall impression of the combat is that there is one correct way to win, not many ways to win.\n\nDon't even get me started on how the Robot AI enemy-type blatantly cheats. They can teleport to what appears to be anywhere else on the map for an action. So while you've got a front line of defenders and you've made sure that your heavy-hitting snipers are well out of the way of suicidal dives by the enemy, they'll teleport well beyond their movement range and one-shot the sniper. Thanks, game! Super jerk-like of you.\n\nThe story stands on it's own two feet in terms of having its own tone in a crowded genre, but the presentation falls flat. In FTL you come across encounters that are risk/reward based on who you've got on your crew and what type of ship/weapons you've got. So far I haven't encountered a single negative affect from investigating every text-based offer presented to me. Many encounters will just be story with no choice and no resources gained or lost, so it feels like a waste of time. You don't really encounter stores, just people willing to trade, but you're never told how much you're going to get or how much you're going to trade.\n\n\ntl,dr: Garhhhh this game has so much potential! So many things are already there and in place and working that could turn this into something fantastic. Certainly not FTL level, but at least up there with The Banner Saga. But alas, no. The 'base' of the dozer is very underutilised in gameplay, the combat frequently feels cheap and lacks a lot of strategy found in similar titles, the encounters feature heavy repetition and little if any risk...\n\nI can't recommend this game even for fans of the genre as you're better off playing something I've mentioned earlier. It's so bloody frustrating, this could've been great! I can see it through all it's shortcomings, it's 95% of the way there... But no, it's not. This isn't the game I hoped it would be.","September 20, 2015","false","16.7"," 27 of 60 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","27","60","0","3"

I'm not finding it fun, but hey I'm probably playing wrong (using dozer weapons would probably help).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xplorplays/recommended/367600/","xplorplays","Xplor Games","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xplorplays/","565 products in account","Skyshine's Bedlam is a strange, strange game, with cool ideas, great game feel, and a completely anti-fun combat system. This game feels like it should be in early access. Videos of my run will follow, to prove my points.\n\nIt's odd limitations make it beneficial to bring nearly no soldiers into battle. I found that 3 soldiers were enough. Until the near end of the game, I brought 3 soldiers every fight, and had so many resources I couldn't use them all. the core thing to realize is that bringing more troops DOESN'T make you more safe. It just means you lose more troops. You'll generally end each fight with 3 troops, whether you bring 3 or 6. The way the engine works is simple. 2 actions for me, 2 for you. Any of my pieces can use the actions on my turn. This means that numerical advantages really don't matter at all, and in fact are a kind of disadvantage. A force of 3 can move together, cover themselves, and pick off the flanks. The large force can only move, at most, 2 pieces a turn, meaning it's esstially a Thermopolae situation every fight. The player forces stand back, hold position, and let the opponents run into a gauntlet of fire until they're all dead.\n\nThe class system is a good idea that is executed poorly. The sniper class is literally useless. They start with 2 HP, and can move 3 spaces. They do good damage, but it doesn't matter, because the next class makes them useless.\n\nThe Frontline can move 6 squares, has 10 HP and does 2 damage. One hit from any enemy kills any rookie sniper. And the AI targets them 100%. I actually started bring rookie snipers to bait the trap for the AI, because they make it the top priority to kill them, ignoring everything else.\n\nThe shotgun class often ends up killing itself, by blasting targets out of their own range. Basically useless.\n\nThe only class I found really useful was the Gunslinger, who had decent range and decent damage, although the class ability (When attacked, you return fire) never worked properly. It would happen sometimes, but not others, with no explanation of why that would be.\n\nThe random placement of your troops, often within shooting range of the enemy, leads to a mad scramble that results in multiple deaths on your side before you even get to fire a shot.\n\nOn my first run, I made it across Bedlam, but by the 30 minute mark I found that I didn't care. The upgrades to the dozer were maxed out in the first province, and the few people who survived their first encounters were far too strong.\n\nThe designers realized, or course, that this game would revolve around players biding their time and waiting, as the enemies charged at them (as seen by the Blitz meter at the top of the screen, more on that in a minute), but the AI is so useless that turn after turn, 2 enemies would move into range, and both would be immediately killed on my turn. On the next AI turn, they'd send 2 more to their doom, for no reason. Some of the enemies have grenades (which you don't have, by the way), and when they target 3 of your people, you don't get to attack that turn. You have to move 2 people out of the way, and the 3rd still gets hit.\n\nThis game has a lot of cool ideas. I like the Dozer, I like the resources, but again, I was never even CLOSE to running out of any resource. EVER. Except power, which I spent carelessly and freely the whole game long.\n\nUpon fighting a named boss, you will, guaranteed, lose a crew member. The bosses do 7-9 damage, and the only member of your crew that has more than 9 health cannot do enough damage to kill a named boss. There are just so many problems. I want to like this game. I think it has great combat animations, and the grid system and cover mechanic is nice, although I wish they had a % chance to hit shown, instead of random guess. I also wish cover worked sensibly, where you could shoot over your cover on your turn, and hide during the other side's turn. I wish that being "in cover" didn't help you when I'm shooting you in the back from the same side of the cover.\n\nNow, let's talk about the Blitzmeter.\n\nThe game teaches you NOTHING about it. There's a random tip on the loading screen that informs you that when it fills up, the enemies get 3 actions, instead of 2. It doesn't tell you that killing an enemy resets the counter. It also doesn't tell you that enemies can move farther during their blitz action. This is not the kind of thing that is "a cool trick" that players need to learn by playing, it's a frustrating mechanic that the game doesn't tell you about. Ever. There's no notice that you're resetting the counter, not even a sound effect. The bar goes down in silence, and it doesn't tell you why.\n\nI played one run, and the game crashed after I made it to Aztec City.\n\nAlso, achievements are broken. Unless not one person on Steam has won 3 battles in a row.\n\nP.S.: This game uses ellipses where it should use periods.","September 19, 2015","false","1.8"," 18 of 43 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","18","43","0","2"

Sure it makes no thematic sense to have just two actions for the whole team, but there is a lot of strategy and risk management involved. Apart from the last battle, i didn´t find the game´s difficulty to be unbearable.\n\nHowever, when i FINALLY defeated the last boss, guess what? The game froze. That´s it, no ending score, no achievements, nothing. I turn to the forums and find out that EVERYONE WHO BEATED THE GAME IS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\nPROS:\n+The art style is really well done. The characters are stylish and each drawing is a joy to see.\n+ I loved the battle system. It´s tense and makes you think. Most people won´t like it though.\n\nCONS:\n- The writing is terrible. 80% of the words in each paragraph are made up. For people that do not have english as a native language, it´s almost incomprehensible. Plus, the lore and events are bland and uninteresting, and do not impact the gameplay in any meaningful way.\n\n- The events are also poorly scripted. You get a lot of items in your journey, but very, very rarely get the chance to use any of them. And when you finally do, the payoff is disappointing. The events also often repeat, so there´s not much replay value.\n\n- After a lot of hours, and tense battles, when you finally complete your mission, THE GAME FREEZES WITH NO VICTORY SCREEN. And this is not an isolated ocurrence. Honestly, this is unacceptable.\n\nConclusion: Unfortunately, this game is simply not worth the asking price. Even if they fixed the problem with the ending, it would still be advisable to wait for a major sale before you consider buying it.","September 18, 2015","false","11.0"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","13","33","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/option1live/recommended/367600/","option1live","Option","http://steamcommunity.com/id/option1live/","538 products in account","I really hate to 'not recommend' this game considering the beauty and obvious effort put into it.  However, I have to be honest and say it's simply not up to release or genre standards.  If there are adjustments made I will be happy to change my review to 'recommend' but for now I'd hold out on purchasing.\n\n(EDIT: I said I would be happy to change my review if changes were made; perhaps I should have been clear that I meant 'changes that come quick before I stop caring'.  It's been six months; I stopped caring or holding out for change long ago.)\n\nI want to start by saying this game really isn't difficult- it's just badly designed.  Battles are wildly random with regards to initial unit placement and having a good/bad encounter can depend entirely on where your troops are stationed when the battle starts.  Add to that a forced encounter as soon as you leave the city and the entire run can be stalled right out of the gate leading to simple resets until you get a favorable first encounter.\n\nI'm not complaining that it's 'too hard' because once you figure the battle system it's really quite simple.  Deadeyes (and their Veteran upgrades) are completely broken in regards to the other classes and you can take out the majority of 'recruitable' bosses with 2 Deadeyes alone.  The game 'balances' this by making every AI enemy rush straight for your snipers which, again, can make or break an encounter depending on where your troops spawned in.\n\nOther classes have wonky ranges that don't make sense.  Both 'mid-range' classes (the Gunslinger and the Shotgunners- can't remember what they're called because I never use them) can't fire directly in front of themselves forcing 'no-win' situations if an enemy gets close.  IE: if an enemy comes close, you have to move then shoot taking two turns which means you can't get the kill and at least one unit will for sure die.  It's clear the developers didn't grasp what makes a good tactical shooter/RPG.\n\nIt is important to note the issues with the battle system because that's all this game really has.  You'll quickly find the game is quite shallow (in comparision to games like FTL or other modern Roguelikes) and so far it seems that 90% of all POIs are either A) have item = get resources B) get item needed for 'A' C) get resources D) start battle encounter.  There's no real 'choice' or varying consequences.  I've only been playing for a few hours but I feel like I've seen everything to see.\n\nIn one run you could be swimming in resources by the halfway point, blowing through enemies left and right and the next run you rapidly lose every unit you have because of bad encounter positions.  I understand Roguelikes can be punishing but bad and random design isn't challenging, it's just that- random.\n\nOutside of the battle system you'll find a UI that lacks usability and is overly cluttered.  Lots of encounter dialogs filled with made up words but lacking basic grammar proofreading.  Glitches galore, crashes, and missing assets; the worst is the lack of sound options (other than ON/OFF) because the sound effects are so drastically loud it's nonsensical.  No video options either...\n\nIt seems like this could have been a really amazing game with heart, a solid aesthetic, and building on a genre we all know and love but it comes out half-baked, lacking content, polish, and even basic necessities for a release.  Most offensive is that it doesn't seem to understand ITSELF (every single tactical RPG I've ever played has a 'deploy phase', now I understand why) and punishes the player for it.  Here's hoping they get it figured out and update the release before abandoning this to mediocre reviews.\n\nEDIT: So apparently a 'Redux' version has come out and a developer ("SkyshineJeff") has tried to post an addendum to my post letting readers know this review is for an old version of the game.  That's a complete load.  I payed full listing price 6 months ago for a barebones, half finished, poorly thought out attempt at a tactical roguelike.  I gave it my best and after 5 hours (past the point of refund) I posted a review.  Half a year later the developer 'fixes' the issues and tries to reverse the negative reaction.\n\nIt's too late.  This was the bed you made 6 months ago now you have to lie in it.  I have no interest in giving your game a second chance just as I'm sure you have no interest in refunding my money.  If you didn't want the reviews to go the way they did you should have pushed back release.  Hindsight is 20/20 and mistakes can be forgiven but trying to post on negative reviews telling the people you've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off (because they paid full price for your crud game) to revisit it in the hopes they'll edit their reviews is beyond rude.  I payed for your damn game and tried to play it, now it's my job to give it praise so that you can sell your 'fixed' version to new people?","September 17, 2015","false","4.9"," 22 of 52 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","22","52","0","4"

The game won't shut down properly, when I've been able to play the five minutes of story/campaign gameplay that I was able to, because the game stops responding once battles start. Even then, if I switch screens from research to whatever else, the game tends to lock up as well, and upon exiting in either case, says I'm still in-game. The only way for it to stop registering me as in-game is to restart my system; I'd not noticed it kept me in-game, and "strangely" I accumulated over two hours of gameplay even though it'd been left on through the night and much of the following day. I'd inquired about that, but again, thread deletions and the odd ignored comment here and there in their stickied threads, so make of that what you will. It may be a not-terrile game, but I'm unable to tell due to the buggy nature of the product they've put out. It's now roughly two or three weeks after their launch, and the problems have neither been fixed nor addressed, so meh. I'll just take note of their studio's name, and any mention of "having previously worked on Skyshine's Bedlam" if they split up but somehow think attaching that buys them some gaming credibility, and  never purchase anything from them again, and advocate to friends and whoever else to be wary about doing so, as well.","October 3, 2015","false","3.1"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamdrain/recommended/367600/","steamdrain","Drain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamdrain/","175 products in account","I kickstarted this with a decent enough expectation... liking turn based games and all... but soon after playing it... I was already preparing to pan the game top to bottom. I really tried to force myself to finish ONE run of the campaign, squeezing out any fun that could be found for my wasted pledge funds, but simply couldn't because it's too frustrating. TL DR=don't buy this. Not recommended at all. If you want more details why I consider this game to be in every way a complete flop, read on...\n\nRight from the start, the game falls flat. It's another one of these games with no volume sliders and only 1 resolution. Really? In 2015? It comes off as a cheap flash game. Sound, on or off. Music, on or off. Resolution, full or box, which is 1 tiny box at about 1024x800p, a standard resolution... 10-15 or so years ago. Is this the best they could do? Is this the top resolution they use themselves? For 20$ in 2015 I think our standard these days is a bit higher, no? I do like the graphics and art style for the game, there is that. It's quite comparable to Borderlands, which is probably where they got it all... but that's pretty much the only + I'll be giving the game here. But even this comes up short because the in game combat models are highly repetitive and do not in any way represent character models, except 1 for male, and 1 for female. If every character on the field was unique to match up with their character screen models, that would have helped.\n\nSo you start playing... and the real frustration begins. Just using the menus and controls is annoying as the developers don't seem to have ever played other video games before. I can't just click to add or remove crew from my squad, no no, I have to click and drag each time to do either of these. I also can't right click to go back a screen, which is a simple concept of convenience. They instead want you to select the icons every time to go forward or back. I'm not new to video games, you know. Lords of the Realm 2 is a more convenient game than this one in terms of menus... and it's 20 years old. You left click something to go forward a screen, and can right click to go back. Not complicated. This kind of crap reminds me of Rogue Legacy, another game crippled by terrible menu controls, but at least that was otherwise a good game itself. Then there's this game's combat, where you left click to move the screen around, right click to move a character, but then left click to shoot. I mean, what the hell? Why not just left click to move the camera or select units, then right click for both of the other options??? It's so confusing the way they've done it, and I can't imagine why they would have done it this way. You even get characters or their health bars blocking each other or other units on the screen, making selections more difficult. Sometimes a character can't move somewhere you want at all, when nothing is actually blocking the squares, which is absurd. I know I'm complaining about small things, but they do bother me, and they're worth mentioning in my book.\n\nMore small things I'll complain about before getting to the real deal breakers are the cheering audiences in every fight and the announcer. Who are these people? Are they following my dozer around? When I fight, where is this cheering audience coming from? Who is this announcer guy yelling out worthless crap? This isn't a sports event. You know what's really immersive in a barren desert? Cheering crowds and a derp sports announcer. Why can't I turn these offf, at least? No no, they're shared with the sound effects option for the whole game. Stupid, pointless, and unable to turn off without muting the whole game.\n\nGetting past the small things finally; what "really" kills this for me is the terrible combat system, and I don't mean the mouse controls this time. Get this. Your entire team shares 2 action points. Yes. Really. That's not a joke. 2 AP, for the entire team, per turn. This is where the entire game train wrecks itself. Who the hell thought this was a good idea? So basically, only 1 person can do something per turn, and everyone else just sits there picking their noses. Why can't it be 2 AP per character per turn, like any non stupid game would have done? Have these people even played a turn based game before? You're supposed to get a turn per character, not a turn per team that everyone shares. There's not much incentive to bring a bigger crew when they can't do anything! Bringing a bigger squad basically means they sit there as reserve, totally unwilling to help because they don't have any AP to use. What sense does this make? "I'm sorry pal, but I can't help you fight. We only have 2 AP, and you're using them. So I'll just sit here, do nothing, and watch until it's over, or you die. If you die, then I'll fight. But we can't fight together like any squad normally would. The developers said so." But the funny thing is that having reserve soldiers on the field isn't exactly a bad thing, trust me on this, because you WILL lose soldiers every fight. It's damn near impossible to avoid...\n\nThe next glaring problem that just builds upon the last one is how the fights start. The enemy starts within spitting distance of your soldiers every fight, and with only 2 AP for the entire team, you can't properly position or conduct any kind of strategy before you start taking bullets(and then deaths). Avoiding damage or deaths is damn near impossible in this game. There is no "Overwatch" in this game to help defensive play, either. The enemy can just move+shoot right in your face, with no way to prevent it. Btw, another thing "not" in the game is an "End Turn" button. If you don't want to do anything, well, too bad, you have to move, or your turn will not end. They don't give you the option to just opt out of spending your point(s) and end turn. After all this, you still have to suffer through the game's terrible range and targeting issues. I could never figure out why my soldiers can sometimes shoot and other times not, even though they SHOULD be within range and/or SHOULD have CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT to the target. Sometimes it's downright insulting. I look at the range icons, and an enemy is clearly in the correct distance, but the game tells me I can't shoot... for some reason. Also the game tells you that you can't shoot your sniper rifle within close range or your shotgun beyond melee range. The shotgun literally has a max range equal to the swords in this game(derp). Terrible.\n\nThe game uses classes... which in a better game could have been fun. You see the game also uses a rank up system that revolves entirely around killing hits, nothing else. So good luck ranking up your close range sword guy that barely does any damage. Basically, your shotgun or sniper will get all the kills because they do all the damage. To rank others, you have to take even more risks in an alreadly overly rigged and dangerous combat system to charity them killing hits. They should have just put in XP per mission instead. Like most design decisions they went with, I can't imagine what they were thinking.\n\nAll things said, I consider this game to be a complete bust. The only other positive I can think of is the random events and choices they clearly ripped from FTL. I like that... but it's just wasted being attached to this game rather than a better one. I can't recommend this at all. I mean, you could just get yourself FTL or Convoy instead. Hell, the 20$ dropped on this could have gotten any 1 of 3 great Shadowrun games, or put towards Boston Lockdown(30$). This market is heavily competitive now days, and this game just doesn't measure up to any of its competition.","September 23, 2015","false","2.3"," 14 of 38 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","14","38","0","9"

The combat(at the moment) while solid feels completly unbalanced even at low bedlam levels. The AI completly outmatches me because i'm lacking some pretty basic feedback in the interface that should be there, stuff like an actual grid option on the floor to plan movements better and easier to see/understand range markers.\n\nI get that the theme of the game is that your suppost to have the odds stacked against you as you progress (i play a lot of XCOM so nothing new there) but even with veterans and max level guys the combat balancing feels horriffic in certain fights even with equalizers avalible to you. Plus theres no real padded out progression on your soldiers other than flat stat increases. Normally i wouldnt have a problem with this but whats the point in having all those cool backstories and lore for your guys if all they get on a level up is a sole re-skin job and some +1's. The Dozer isn't much better with flat percentage upgrades and a few (but admititedly intresting) unique abilities per vehicle.\n\nDespite all of that i do have some hope for the game, we are only 6-7 hours into open release, im a picky *ss lol and most of what i see wrong with it can be patched out or changed, there is a solid game under the hood somwhere here and with some luck the devs will change some things for the better.\n\nPros:\n- Lovely art style and setting\n- Interesting characters even with individual backstories\n- Solid turn based combat\n\nCons:\n-The combat (at the moment) feels completly broken and unrewarding\n- RNG is huge (yes i know its a rogue-like but 2 HP sharpshooters getting RNG'ed on spawn 4-6 tiles from the enemy every fight is just stupid)\n-Any lack of meaningfull upgrades on the Dozers or soldiers","September 16, 2015","false","5.1"," 23 of 58 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","23","58","0","2"

I'll try to elaborate on what I personally like/dislike.  Others' experiences may vary.\n\n\n\nThe Good:\n\n-The game conveys the suspense they were trying to achieve pretty well.  Through the fear of losing your squad members, or outright losing your game (encounters)\n\n-The combat is pretty fun, for the most part.  It's unforgiving, but once you get the hang of how to set yourself up to attack and make them waste a turn moving into position, you'll fare better and better.  But you're gonna be heavily outnumbered later on, and your ranked-up members will still get rekt pretty quickly (esp in boss battles) so you have to be really tactical\n\n-There are a lot of bosses/special characters you can defeat/recruit to your side.  They are usually pretty strong, but definitely can still be killed if you're not careful.\n\n-The graphic style is pleasing and the controls are simple.  the turn-based aspect is definitely fun (only two actions per turn).\n\n-The narrative is fun and different.  There are a lot of random encounters, some good, some bad.\n\n\n\nThe Neutral:\n\n-Combat is hit-and-miss.  It feels very savage.  The attacks are pretty awesome and the sounds convey impact.  The squad members all have attack ranges which is nice, but the way they implement ranged attacks is kinda frustrating.  The gunslinger can attack medium-long ranges (about 8-10 tiles) but only at that range.  any closer and you can't attack.  but at least he can reposition to attack on most turns if necessary.  The sniper can hit about 10-11 tiles away but can only move 2.  Which is very very annoying since you're rarely within the correct range to attack, unless you're specifically trying to use him.  I feel his range should be longer, like 10-14 tiles.  Makes him more useful without having to be EXACTLY at the correct range or get too close (10 tiles is WAY too close when you have 2 health).\n\n\n\nThe BAD\n\n-The game is extremely unforgiving.  Which, I know, was their intent.  But it's really annoying when you have a sniper that you've fed enemies, in order to get him ranked up, and the enemy sniper moves just into position and wastes him.  (the highest health a sniper can get is 5, and the rookiest snipers do 5 dmg, so a rookie can one-shot your all-star, 25+ kill, sniper.   This can happen with every one of your squad members.  Ranking them up is quite tedious.  You're doing well if you can get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rookies to actually kill 3 enemies and not die.  Only to have them get blasted later.  I understand that this is their intent, but it's not fun (to me).\n\n-The easiest difficulty is pretty pointless.  It's just as unforgiving and has the downside of no achievement awards.\n\n-The pacing is pretty poor.  It's fun and challenging at the start, but ramps up to ridiculous levels really fast.  You're guaranteed to lose squad members, which is fine, but I have yet to be able to recruit ANYONE that's not a boss to my side.  The only time I've gotten more players to my side is when I reached a certain point (no spoilers), and even then it was only a handful.\n\n-Random encounters usually end one of two ways.  Usually you get attacked or you find nothing of interest and leave.  There are, of course, several outcomes, but they seem so rare to actually have happen.  The ONLY reason I explored everything was to find another ship to use.  Other than that, you're just risking losing squad members due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battle-RNG only for piddly scraps.  Waste of time and possibilites.  Could've been awesome.\n\n\nFinal Note:\n\nI was really on the fence about this game.  I pre-ordered it because the gameplay looked awesome.  I was so excited to play it.   The combat is really fun.  Turns out that the combat is not as often as I'd have liked (I wish there was a combat-focused mode like in Blood-Bowl).  I cannot just recruit new fighters like xcom can.  So you're going from one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battle to the next just slowly losing more and more members till you're down to nobody left for when the game really gets hard (won't spoil it).  I really wanted to like this game.  Hopefully it will be improved, but I'm not holding my breath\n\n\nUPDATE:  After putting a few more hours into the game, in an attempt to force myself to figure it out a little better.\n\n-Recruiting new non-bosses IS possible, but very rare.\n-Frontliners are the best class, everyone else is just inferior for several reasons (ranged classes have low mobility and weird range requirements, and shotgunners have same range as frontliners, but less mobility, plus knockback usually ends up making consecutive attacks impossible). Frontliners have great mobility, good scaling damage, the most health.  i was killing 13+ enemy battles with just two frontliners after a while\n\nGLITCHES (spoilers!!!!)\n-If you are in battle and someone gets killed, if you hit Esc and quit, then "resume" you effectively skip the battle, with no deaths.\n-If you are on the last part of the game and you run out of fuel, you pretty much can't fail.  You play the roulette game, but the negative events only kill your passengers, of which you have none.\n-THE GAME CRASHES ALL THE TIME!!  The most annoying time:  when you're on the last part of the game and it crashes, you cannot resume where you left off.  If you're on the last variant of the final boss and the game crashes, guess what?  now you have to do ALL the variants AGAIN!\n\nFor these reasons, I've uninstalled this game.   I refuse to torture myself with this game.  The game play is bad enough at time, but losing all your progress because of a crash is absolutely intollerable, especially when they happen pretty often (several times in one hour)","September 17, 2015","false","12.0"," 11 of 33 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","11","33","0","1"

I may end up revising this review.\n\nBut, for right now, it only feels like half a game. The main issue is that there simply isn't that much to do. You drive around the desert on rails, random stuff happens, you fight. Problem is, the fighting system isn't all that robust. I understand that the devs are currently reconsidering the two turn activation system, and I think they should. As someone who has played numerous tabletop wargames over 25 years, this system makes no sense to me. It's both needlessly complex and too simplistic at the same time. There are lots of better ways to achieve what I think the devs were going for with it.\n\nI hate to say it, but, as the game is currently, it's basically Oregon Trail with really awesome art design and lore. But it's got potential to become something great - the art design is quirky and beautiful, and the world they've created is very rich. Make the combat a little more robust, add some playable races, and make Bedlam more of a sandbox and this game will be great.

But NO, this is an official release!\n\nThe main issue is broken mechanics. Developers say that this is “roguelike design”, but it is not. It’s just total random. You are so limited of actions that nothing depends of your skill. You can lose the combat before it starts, just because of unlucky random unit deployment. In addition to broken mechanics, you should fight the poor balance. There are 4 classes, but at least 2 of them are useless.

If $20 is free to you and you lke FTL type games I would pick this up because it is fun for a few hours even if the experience will probably leave you a bit annoyed by the numerous weak design decisions. Hopefully the game will undergo substantial changes and I could easily imagine this game becoming a real gem but there is substantial work between here and there.\n\nMy play experience (note I include some spoilers):\n\n-Three normal games, excluding about another three that I restarted after carelessly losing the first battle. Of these three games that progressed past the first battle, I won two of them (i.e. this review isn't sour grapes because I thought the game was too hard - I don't).\n\n-First run lost to the boss because he is basically cheesy and just a test of how much power you have stockpiled and I hadn't stockpiled hardly any power\n\n-Second run I won, but just barely and the final fight I got through with one soldier left and only won due to egregious AI mistakes. I started the "ascension run" with about 300 power\n\n-Third run I also won, but I started with about 1000 power. This ascension run was a joke, because there are no limits to how often you can use equalizers and weapons excepting your stockpile of power. There is also a guaranteed "physical invulnerability" equalizer when you reach Aztec. So my level 15 sniper stands in range of the boss and I spam invulnerability buff until the boss goes down. Total ascension run took about 500 power but I wasn't trying to be efficient.\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Art is excellent, the apocalyptic game world is interesting and well-presented if a bit thin\n\n-Most encounters are fairly well written, although they are not that numerous and they aren't intelligently balanced around risk / reward the way FTL encounters are\n\n-Class system is good, and nurturing high experience soldiers is fun (although its weird / boring that after achieving veteran status, i.e. the first level up, subsequent level-ups online just provide +1 damage irrespective of class)\n\n-General structure of the game is good, assuming you like FTL-style play.\n\n-UI is generally good with some weird quirks. I don't love the right-click to move, left-click to attack system. Notablly, I lost one high level unit when intending to select an enemy unit to check stats (i.e. left click) and I caused my guy to attack. Not sure why developers think this is a better system than right click to act, left click to select (hint: it's not a better system which is why no one else uses it... fortunately this is an easy fix)\n\nThe Less Good:\n\n-"Chess-like" battle system of two moves per player turn irrespective of # of units doesn't really work. That's a big problem, because it is the core combat mechanic. It basically means that one uber unit is vastly more valuable than lots of weak units, because the one uber unit can act as often as all the weaker units combined. So for example the boss is pretty broken and can easily bulldoze over your best units if you don't have the right buffs.  Also, the player bringing twice as many units doesn't really make their squad stronger unless those units are getting killed, which they shouldn't be.\n\n-Resource bonuses for bringing small squads don't make any intrinsic in-game sense and just force the player to basically always bring three squad members or lose the 2x power bonus. Power is a god-like resource in this game, providing infinite healing, shielding, damage to enemies etc. as long as you have enough of it\n\n-Non-power resource constraints don't really work. I never had any issues with running low on meat or crude, although maybe it is more of an issue on hard.\n\n-Encounters are well-written but thoughtless. I never felt like I had interesting decisions to make - the right choice was basically always to explore, go in the shack, whatever. Also, unlike FTL where investing in the right crew / tech benefits you with blue encounter choices, here in Bedlam you have little ability to control what crew and tech you have so there is no real strategy behind optimizing for encounters. Either you will have the right stuff to get a gold choice or you won't, but you won't have anything like trying to protect your lone slug for his encounter benefits or considering getting a teleporter early, etc.\n\n-Soldier growth could be a LOT more interesting. Let them find items that give bonuses, let them get more interesting stat bonuses on level-up, let them get unique abilities, etc. That will take work to balance, but it's not like the game is balanced right now so I don't see the harm there. Also, it is egregious that all your soldiers have the same stats even if they are a different race. It would be nice if the mutant soldiers I find had something interesting about them aside from a different picture. Also, it is ridiculous that all the elites within a class have the same stats. Acid barfing lizard should not play identically to giant guy with a uber-gun. That's just deeply boring.\n\n- 4 class system gets a little tedious over time. There is more variability during the ascension run, but prior to that everything you face is the same handful of units over and over again.\n\nOverall:\n\nThere is the potential for a great game here, but the slices of excellent content and design tend to get washed out by the broken aspects of the design. Hopefully, the developers will think seriously about many of the core game mechanics and it will eventually become a much, much better game.","September 20, 2015","false","8.8"," 9 of 31 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","9","31","0","1"

The gameplay is just boring. Upgrading your Dozer feels like a chor. The only reason to upgrade is so you can farm bedlam for a longer time. Thats it. Period.\nWhile we are at farming. All you do is getting as many power cells as posible, while using as little of the Dozer Weapons as possible...great. All that is left are a cheesslike combat system, with a bugged AI. Every encounter is the same, only varyies in size of the enemy units and your positions. While in games like FTL you can just use Autopilot to farm easy enemies, this isnt possible in bedlam. There are no easy enemies. Your units are weak, no matter their level. All that you got left is using your Dozer, but as said before you dont wanna do that because of the endgame.\n\nSo this leads us to the endgame...simply put: Boring and OP. Either you waste enaugh time farming you Powercells, or boom you got no chance.\n\nThis game has just so many design flaws when it comes to gameplay that I just dont want to paly it, not because its frustrating or too hard, no it is jsut boring. I stoped my farming after 2 hours and went straight to Atztec City coz I got so bored. I could have explored the whole map if I wanted to.\n\nFinal Verdict: Boring game.

For the most part player end up controlling just a handful of characters and when the art of those characters is same body with different heads slapped into it ala dress-up game those characters dont feel like individuals that you can get attached to.\n\nNot random enough for it to be a rouge-like. All pathways seem to be the same, the only random factor that you will find is the faction type slapped on to a map territory. All side missions layout follows the same un-varying formula of 4 points of interest per route stage. This just makes a game a tad too predictable to be of any actual interest and you end up ignoring most (if not all) of those pois most of the time.(what a waste)\n\nLazy Random events. Those are made in the form of multiple choice with a bit of writting slapped on top of it. The writting itself is bland and too repetitive for the starters (it follows the same template too closely.. no literaly value in those at all). And once you encounter an event you memorize it and never make a bad choice in the playthroughs which make those boring and not up to par with a good rouge-like desing.\n\nCombat, while is using The Banner Saga engine, falls heavily short.

When I saw the trailer I was expecting combat similar to the first Fallout Game. It is actually closer to Valkyria Chronicles but with stupidly low unit HP, no penalties for activating the same unit more than once, no extra point cost for activating elite units, only 2 actions per turn regardless of the amount of units fielded, and maps too small/empty to really have any interesting tactical options. Just imagine that they took VC combat and took out all of the parts that made it interesting and balanced.\n\nThat said the devs are asking for more feedback on combat due to all the negative feedback. I personally think it is a little late to be asking for said feedback after the 1.0 release. Maybe they will make this game into something good. It does have potential but the devs, even though they are industry veterans, seemd to think that design wasn't a skill that was needed.(Team is an experienced artist, programmer, and animator). I guess they fell into the trap of thinking that anyone could do design. It really shows with such great art and animations and such horrible balance.\n\nProbably the biggest mistake the devs have made is putting their name in the title.

My expectations for this game were fairly hi which is suppose is my own fault. I really thought this would be something like an FTl fallout hybrid. Sadly this game is just bedlam. I’ll start with the combat. The combat is just bad plain and simple. I was expecting combat to be tactical like Banner saga or Fire Emblem instead your units are dropped in a random cluster. You are only given two actions per turn this means if the enemy has two or more snipers in attack range of your men you are almost guaranteed to lose a unit on the first turn of combat. This happens because there is almost no unit balance snipers for example insta kill almost everything or die to everything. Melee units do pretty much nothing they die to fast to be effective tanks and don’t do enough damage to kill even snipers. Even after units level up pretty much all of them die to one or two shots so investing time in leveling units is meaningless. Aside from the poor combat the game is ok at best. The art style is interesting and fun, there are plenty of cool death animations you will see these a lot. The wastelands themselves leave much to be desired. At a glance at the map there are a number of unique zones with different factions and interactions. Upon closer examination every zone is pretty much exactly the same with enemies being graphically different and that’s it and the events themselves are all pretty much the same regardless of the zone you are in.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobaninja/recommended/367600/","bobaninja","bobaninja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobaninja/","596 products in account","== Update for Redux ==\n\nThis update is amazing. Each squad member having their own set of actions is exactly what I thought it would be from the beginning and I love it. Arcade and Campaign modes are both great ways to replay the game with different pacing. The reworked health and damage is nice since you don't have to worry so much about your units getting one-shot. Being able to finally choose your starting crews and factions is great. This feels like the game that should have been released from the start.\n\nI can't give the devs enough credit for their response to player feedback. They've been awesome.\n\n== Update 02-11 for Patch 2.0 ==\n\nBleh. I still don't like combat, and now you're forced to waste you're already limited actions per turn to farm resources on the battle grid because of the loss of the resource rewards after combat. I hate that change. Should I attack the enemy in the middle of combat or should I run to some corner of the battlefield to collect some steaks? It's completely anti-fun to me to do that.\n\nThumbs back down.\n\n== Update 24-09 for Patch 1.5 ==\n\nPatch 1.5 is a big improvement for perceived difficulty caused by RNG. Board placement is fair, though I'm not sure if completely eliminating ambush maps was necessary. It was bad getting them 3-4 times in a row, but now it doesn't seem to ever happen. Achievements seem to work now (aside from the high score achievements not also counting for the score achievements below it) and now you can actually complete the game after you kill King Viscera's 4th form.\n\nThe cover change is great since now you can rely on it when planning your two moves. It seems to be a really harsh penalty to Gunslingers though since after rounding their damage becomes 1. You can pretty much ignore enemy gunslingers in cover now. Frontliners and Trenchers can ignore cover at point blank and Deadeyes at rookie still do at least 2 damage. I never see my Gunslingers retaliate either; they might need some kind of buff.\n\nI'm so far not really liking the leveling changes. It was already grindy to me before and now it seems more so. Elite units take 8 kills to level now instead of 5, which wasn't in patch notes. With reduced numbers of enemies and the elimination of the mandatory fight, there is less kills to get before you get to the first elite. A lot of times I get to the first elite without any veterans now, which makes that fight pretty rough. Badlam difficulty is slight easier to level than Normal now because there are slightly more enemies - which seems backward. Recruiting new non-elite units still feels like a waste; like I want to bring some rookie unit into a Severe/Bedlam threat level combat. With the normal unit leveling change, it seems like more level grinding now to fight KV.\n\nThe loss of the x2 Power bonus kind of sucks. Power seems much harder to get now and reliant on risking units to collect the map powerups. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet, but KV fights still seem reliant on hording a lot of Power before Aztec City (based on continuing the unfinished game I had pre-1.5 waiting for the end game bug to be fixed). This combined with the leveling change maintains the POI grind you have to do before Aztec City. I'm not sure if that fits with the fast-paced rush to AC that the developers seem to want. I feel like leveling should be either quicker or easier to spread among units (instead of funneling kills into a few units). Farming every POI you can to gather Power shouldn't feel necessary either. KV still has a crap-ton of HP, so fighting him still requires equalizer spamming and hoping that you find the good ones by then.\n\nOverall, I really like this patch. I think it just needs a little more tweaking to the pacing (i.e. grinding), maybe slight balance tweaks to KV (which would decrease grinding and improve pacing), and some improvement to the random events to make the decisions you make seem more impactful. Even though I'm still not much of a fan of the 2AP system, I'd be more inclined to recommend the game to people who like roguelikes and chess so I'm flipping my thumbs down to a thumbs up. Developer response to feedback has been awesome; they deserve a lot of credit.\n\nThe Good:\n* Post-apocalyptic setting like Wasteland/Fallout/Mad Max always makes my nipples hard.\n* Graphics and animation. Nothing is more satisfying than melting people with Chunderok's barf attack, blasting the flesh from their skeleton with a Gunslinger, or kicking someone in the nuts and elbow dropping them as they double over.\n* Losing due to randomness is much less decreased, and more likely your own fault now.\n* Turn-based combat (with a caveat below).\n* Developer response to feedback and patching.\n* Seeing my name in big gold letters in the credits.\n\nThe Bad:\n* 2 actions per turn isn't my cup of tea and not generally well-received by players. It resembles chess and I don't like chess. If you do, this isn't really a bad point.\n* Random event decisions don't really matter much. Some events have no impact at all except for wasting your resources to get there.\n* Leveling and farming Power Cells is tedious, despite the intent for a fast-paced game.\n\nThe Ugly:\n* My pants after I rage-sh!t myself because I made a mistake that kills one of my Elites or high level Frontliners.\n\n== Update 18-09 ==\n\nRecent patches made the Blitz much less catastrophic, so it's not as punishing anymore. I still wish it was a usable mechanic for players and not just CPU. The limited actions still makes it seem like chess to me (I hate chess). Patches brought much improvement though.\n\nI'd say if you like roguelikes and chess, this is right up your alley. If there was a rating between "yes" and "no" I'd upgrade to that, simply because devs are so responsive to tuning yet not giving in to lowering difficulty. I was always fine with the difficulty; it was just the random elements that crush you were too annoying. I feel like the game could've used more time in Early Access for tuning, when people may be less critical of flaws. Games like this are hard to evaluate in the 2 hour limit that Steam gives refunds, so that first impression for a final product probably brought a lot of negative response.\n\n== Original Review ==\n\nIt sucks not liking this game when you're a Tier 7 backer. I just can't recommend it because the combat system is so abhorrent. Having just two actions to split among your team is so crippling. Even if the difficulty was drastically lowered, I can't imagine having two actions will ever be fun. It ensures that only one of your units can move into position and attack per round. It forces you to choose just 2 units to move into cover after RNG surrounds you with enemies from the start of combat. It makes having a team of more than 3 or 4 units useless. It's hard trying to convince yourself that there is strategy when there's so few options on what to do each turn - either move 2 units, move and attack with 1 unit, or attack twice with 1 or 2 units. And the Blitzmeter just punishes you for even participating in combat. It might as well be a random tornado that kills 2 or 3 of your units. It's a horrible mechanic. It makes you want to avoid combat as much as possible, but unfortunately that's 90% of the gameplay.\n\nIt plays similarly to FTL, but in FTL failing felt more like my fault rather than just being a victim of randomness and the Blitzmeter.\n\nNice graphics and animations though.","September 16, 2015","true","35.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

You get no chance to care about your characters, pretty much zero development of characters...

The tag isn't there now.  For what is now being advertised, I think that the game plays well enough.  Keep in mind that it IS NOT an RPG at all.\n\nWith the last few patches, battles are more enjoyable.\n\nWhile the game looks like an in depth Mad Max style RPG/CTS almalgamation, it's not.  It's a chess game with a resource management minigame and a map encounter minigame.\n\nYour soldiers are underpowered for being understaffed.  You get only a max of 4 to use each battle.  One dies?  That sucks buttocks.  Better hope that doesn't happen too often.  Maybe you'll get another one through a random encounter.  Maybe your soldiers will die too much because you are facing 12 enemies in a battle, and you just got pwned in 5 battles just like that.  And while you are trying to maneuver your soldiers so that the enemy can't either double team one of your soldiers and kill them in one turn or have an opportunity to first: walk up and then secondly: horribly murder your soldiers, you are also expected to gather resource pick ups on the battlefield to ensure your "dozer" vehicle can continue the trip to the mythical Aztec City.  Maybe you try to use an equalizer in the battle, only to realize they aren't that effective and cost way too many power cells to make their use practical because power cells are a precious resource, and you already used all of yours up last battle.  It's challenging.\n\nYou get 2 actions per soldiers per turn.  So does the enemy.  Some points of interest have a silhouette with a question mark, where you will have to face 3 to 5 baddies and an elite.  The elite will one hit kill your soldiers most of the time.  If you win, then the elite will join you.  You will probably lose 3 of your soldiers killing them.  Do we call that a victory?  Draw maybe?\n\nAnd if you manage to pull off the journey, which you probably won't, you unlock another vehicle with worse stats and 1 more equalizer with which you are expected to try again.\n\nI tried the new version and found the gameplay much more enjoyable. There is NO character development, NO equipment, NO merchants to sell said equipment, and NO level up management. It doesn't look like the game I thought I saw in the trailer or an RPG when it was tagged as an RPG at the time of purchase.  Be aware of what the game is, if you buy it.\n\nI did not enjoy this game as much as I thought I would.  Cheating did make it a little better.\n\nThe developers seem willing to listen to review feedback from players, which is a good thing because they will end up making more money if they do.  A lot of independent game development companies don't care about reviews and will even ban people for negative feedback, which only results in their being blacklisted among prospective customers.  The willingness of the developers to change and expand their product is a refreshing positive change for an indie game company, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this game changes over time.","December 22, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

The problems come with the story and battle mechanics.  As many reviews have mentioned, none of the choices feel like they have any actual weight (and after many playthroughs I'm pretty sure they don't).  You accept the battles, you accept the new members, you say no to shady cloak-wearing dudes (most of the time).  It doesn't feel interesting and is not at all effected by your crew, dozer type, etc.\n\nThe biggest problem of all is combat, holy ♥♥♥♥ the combat.  I'm all for challenging, but c'mon.  Two moves worked in Banner Saga, why can't it work here?  Likely because you're being pulled in too many directions.  You need those resources?  Well then your team is going to lose a few members.  Want to kill off the enemy?  You might survive, but no resources for you.  And if you try to go for resources, you'll immediately be put on a clock in the form of the "Blitzometer."  In my opinion this should be done away with entirely.  This element essentially dissuades you from ever collecting resources unless you want to face horrible combat consequences down the road (which you cannot afford).  This, in turn, leads to eeked out victories that do nothing for you except perhaps a promotion.\n\nWith these seemingly minor issues the game turns into a chore, slogging through a series of "victories" only to realize you don't have enough resources, or gathering all you can and ending up with three team members.  I can understand balance, and I can understand sacrificing some things for other things, but these things arent choices, they're imperatives.  I like the setting of Bedlam, I just don't want to feel like I'm one of the poor fools in the steerage of the dozer.\n\nEDIT:  As per the request of SkyshineJess, I'm updating the review following the "REDUX" update.  This is based on an arcade run on medium difficulty.  Overall, I like the changes quite a bit.\n\nYou can now pick from two different versions of the human dozer, with one team buff changing from the original dozer.  You can also pick 14 random crew or take less random crew in exchange for leveled up or elite crew, cool twist.\n\nBlitzometer is still there but is bearable as I now only have to worry about spending energy cells on dozer weapons and team buffs.  This takes some of the edge off combat and gives me the opportunity to take some risks and go for resources.  Perhaps this is only in arcade but doing away with dozer upgrades was a great idea as it lets you focus on combat and resource collection much more.\n\nRandom encounters have definitely increased.  Some new encounters have been thrown in and the first 10+ stops of my arcade run were random enounters that benefitted me, might have just been luck though.  After those random encounters there were a few random battles and elite battles, all felt balanced and appropriately challenging vs. rewarding.  You can now take some risks and see the rewards, but if you take the risk and fail you're not completely screwed.  This makes combat, and the game overall, much more enjoyable.\n\nThen cam the first boss battle.  At this point I had had so many random encounters that I only had 2-3 leveled crew.  And with this crew of semi-competent wasters I faced....Viscera, with 50 HP and 4 support (each at 10 health).  And to make matters way better the four support crew had my team surrounded.  Again, not sure if this is just terrible luck but the game went from balanced to janky in one move.\n\nOverall, while I did get my ♥♥♥ handed to me by an early Viscera from out of nowhere, the game has improved significantly.  Combat is now more balanced, choices have increased, and the overall game is much more fun.  Kudos to the devs for interfacing with players and implementing these chances, for free.  The game is now easily recommendable.","January 30","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Taking a note from DS, Bedlam won't hold your hand (it does tell you the controls, which is nice), which lead to my first loss (I attempted to leave a boss fight 'cause I thought I was unprepared, turns out the "give up" button really means "end entire run"), but is still fun in the "now go do whatever you want" kind of way. Only thing I would change is that a acquiring a faction dozer doesn't give you a faction crew, that part is disappointing (if you buy it, you'll get what I mean). Otherwise, I would recomend this to any who can appreciate a good strategy!","May 30","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
