What are you waiting for?\n\nSeriously though, this game is a lot of fun. It's easy to learn, but has a lot of depth if you want to rack up a lot of points. It's extremely satisfying to get a long combo going. I feel like a master physicist when I get a nice long swing and can hit a bunch of long bars. Best game with a ball and lines this year.\n\nYou could have downloaded this and tried if for yourself in the time it took to read this review. I have photos bigger than this game. Just try it. You won't be disappointed. Check out Mr. Francis' other game, Gunpoint. It's incredible.","June 6, 2014","true","1.2"," 139 of 147 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","139","147","0","0"

This Game is special, not in the bad way, This game has calm chilled music, but sadly not enough of that. Though i do hope that there will be more music later on (As Far As i know there are 7 Songs according to the Bandcamp album that is) but if not it's not too big of a problem, even though the music could get annoying after a while. Now for the Game mechanics. This game is basically a movement based game where you move around as a Pixel with a Grappling hook, while trying to earn Points. How to do that? Well just don't touch the Walls and stay fast to get a lot of points for collecting the Red bars that raise the longer you stay away from the Walls. It is hard though to get speed though (found a good way for myself for now). And Thats it for the Mechanics. So This game is a 7/10 in my opinion, mainly because there is not enough music to it. And i would really like to see a Scoreboard in future Updates to compare the Points to my Friends (and a way to save the points too that is). If there is a Scoreboard i am sorry and i did not see it.\n\nTL;DR:\nGame is a 7/10,\nNeeds more Music.\nFun to Play though.\nGo and Play it, Gets Addicting really fast.\n\nI'll excuse myself for any Grammar and spelling errors since English is not my Main Language.","June 6, 2014","true","0.7"," 97 of 112 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","97","112","0","2"

Or maybe you just dream of being Spider-Man and think that superheroes who fly are just cheating. If neither of those applies to you but you want a zen-like platforming (as far as platforming is involved because the game features platforms to avoid rather than traverse) experience that isn't loaded with spikes, traps, and pitfalls, this is the game for you too.\n\nThe graphics and presentation are minimalistic and sublime, the soundtrack is soothing, and the gameplay itself is simple. It runs smoothly, making those moments when you hit top speed feel ever so good and your graceful arcs that take you above and below the water's surface show that physics simulations need not be infinitely complex.\n\nI personally find it less a 'game' and more a relaxing experience that brings a calm smile, reminding me of games like Flower. And for the price tag, you don't have anything to lose.\n\nNinja Rope Simulator 2014 gets a 10/10 red dots from me.","October 27, 2014","true","0.6"," 62 of 64 people (97%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","97","62","64","11","0"

It's very easy to learn and master, but even inexperienced gamers will have no trouble playing the game, as there are no time limits, no restrictions, it's simply level after level with the only goal being to "collect" every "red bars" on the current level to move on to the next, which is pretty much the same thing over again.\n\nThe game is particularly relaxing and a nice "time waster". It's simple, fun, easy to pick up but hard to let go.\nIt's the kind of game you just launch and play for a few minutes while waiting or doing other tasks, or simply to relax and unwind for a bit. It features an excellent and equally relaxing soundtrack.\n\nAnd finally, the strongest point for the game? It's absolutely free. No pay-to-win, no exclusive content, no DLCs, you just iniciate the very small download, launch the game, and enjoy it freely. To be honest, I consider this game better than most paid games on Steam. Turns out there are some hidden gems in the free-to-play section of Steam.\n\nThe only cons I can think of for this game is the fact that the gameplay can get rather repetitive; No real goal, not much challenge, and it most certainly won't give you much sense of achievement. After a while, just going level-to-level can get slightly boring.\n\nOverall, I HIGHLY recommend this one. It's free, so you know you've got nothing to lose. Heck, I'd recommend it if it were a paid game either ways.","June 20, 2015","true","2.5"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","31","35","2","0"

It appears (and is) simple, but takes a biiit of time to understand. You swing the point from block to block and bar to bar as you make your way around each level. Once you know how to balance your speed and grappling hook length, the real beauty of this game comes out. Graceful movements abound as your point flows through the map at hand. Some bars may be easy to reach while others may be perplexing and take a while to get just the right curve to reach. The music is simply perfect for this game as it relaxes you and complements the flow of the curves.\n\n10/10 Peaceful, Relaxing, Challenging, and most of all...

The controls are simple and mostly intuitive, and it isn't long before you're having a blast.\n\nIt's oddly relaxing, yet exciting; you're swinging over--and occasionally under--what I can only assume is some sort of ocean, looking like the unholy spawn of Spider-Man and a laser pointer, and at times it's difficult not to shout, "Wheeeee!" as you swing around hitting the targets that get you points.\n\nThere are no bad guys; the challenge is in your skills, your ability to hit all of the targets. There is no death, and you can change levels whenever you like. You never really feel like you're fighting with the game, just your own ability (or lack thereof), and that's part of the appeal, part of why it's actually a relaxing experience more than anything else.\n\nWould I reccommend this game? You betcha. I like to play it while watching a video (with the music turned off) just to keep the ADD at bay. :)\n","July 12, 2014","true","46.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/g6in3d/recommended/302380/","g6in3d","G6In3D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/g6in3d/","5 products in account","Floating Point first caught my attention via an article on IGN, in which the rather acclaimed Tom Francis (who had previously developed Gunpoint, a decent game in of itself) announced that he would be releasing a new (not to mention, free) game on Steam known simply as "Floating Point".\n\nTom Francis described the creation as (and I quote), "It’s a peaceful game about swinging gracefully around randomly generated levels. It’s played entirely with the mouse, it’s easy to play, you can have fun with it in five minutes, and it has relaxing digital music by the excellent Form & Shape. The only objective is to collect points, and the only thing that increases your points is swinging swiftly, smoothly and elegantly without hitting anything. As you pick up momentum, you start to glow, the bars you’re collecting rise up, the music kicks in, and your trajectory burns a bright red line in the air, drawing huge, beautiful mathematical curves of your arcing flight."\n\nSo logically, I decided to download Floating Point (right before E3 2014 began, no less). Because, you know...quite frankly...it's free. Anyways, I must say that I was indeed pleasantly surprised by Floating Point. There's no need to worry about attacks from enemies, annoying NPCs, trolls, or PTSD. Nope, just nice and smooth swinging (as a red dot) with no clear objective other than occasionally passing through those red (and technically non-existent) pillars.\n\nWith some relaxing music to boot, Floating Point actually serves as a great stress reliever, or as a soothing change of pace after playing some Monster Hunter and Zelda (or whatever you're into). Granted, this isn't exactly a game that should be played for than half an hour a sitting. Quite frankly, it'll become boring after that. Luckily, I can still enjoy the game a day or 2 later if that's the case.\n\nOverall, while Floating Point isn't going to be the 2014 Game of the Year, it is certainly quality enough to warrant a download. Not to mention, the game is free!...and it doesn't take a lot of space either! So what are you waiting for? Go download it on Steam!","June 26, 2014","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The game is free, and it's only an 11MB download, which means you could have finished downloading it by the time you've finished reading this review.\n\nThe game presents itself in such a way you don't want to let go. You're this Spiderman-esque dot, swinging around by clicking in the direction of different blocks, throwing yourself into these lines. Once you go through them, it adds to your points score which offers no reward in itself, other than some sort of milky satisfaction for completionists.\n\nIt's hard to criticise a game that presents itself so lovely, and the fact it's free makes it hard to refuse. But unlike, for example Angry Birds, there is no sense of progression, and can get bored very quickly. Each level you move on to is just random block placement. I believe that lack of goal is what makes Floating Point what it is - it doesn't dress itself up, and there's no penalty for whatever.\n\nIt's a lovely game, but it personally isn't for me. It is very peaceful and relaxing, which some may find as a stress relief - which I imagine makes this someone's perfect cup of tea. Sadly, I prefer coffee. But I find myself firing this up now and then for some relaxation, and Floating Point works a treat.","June 27, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There isn't much to it. But what there is, it does really well.\n\nThe swinging is responsive and if you practice enough, allows you to completely avoid every obsticle, giving you maximum points. There are 2 areas, air and water. In the air, gravity pulls you down. In the water, buoyancy pushes you up. This forces you to be able to switch your swinging techniques as you fling yourself between the 2.\n\nThis game rewards good players. The beacons that must be collected grow when you move quickly without hitting obsticles, and shrink when you crash or slow down. This means that if you're not good at the game, the game becomes more difficult just to rub it in. This, however, is not a criticism. Too many games are letting the bad player get off too easy these days.\n\nThat said, this game is not challenging. Then again, it's not supposed to be. As is written above in the "About the Game" section, Floating Point is a "peaceful game". There is no failure state, no time, and when you beat a level, you can spend the next hour drawing squiggly lines and patterns.\n\nIt's a small, but fun game, with a great, yet simplistic artstyle, calming music and enjoyable swinging mechanics.","July 18, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Sometimes simplicity is best.\nFree and small.\nMusic changes as you enter the other half of the level. Bonus points for not fading the music until you can't hear it like Sonic Generations.Things I did not like:\nThe inherent lightness and floaty qualities of the dot made control somewhat difficult. I understand that this is so momentum can be built faster, but sometimes this can be hindering.\nWhile the small size is also a plus, it is indeed a downside. This game gets old very quickly, but this is to be expected from something free.All in all, Floating Point is a good game to try. I just don't understand why so many people are giving it a perfect ten. This game is not without it's flaws. But I do want to give it a higher rating than IGN gave Shrek Superslam.\nOverall, an 8/10. Excellent work by Tom Francis to make a game that is free and fun. Am I too harsh with this game? Yeah. I know it's free and I shouldn't rate it as I would one that isn't, but I was bothered by the absurdly high scores it was recieveing. I wanted to make a review that was more realistic.

It's not difficult to get into in any shape way or form. You just grapple your way through the air and under water to collect red columns. Each time you finish a stage, your goal in the next one is to simpley beat your best score with each stage looking different as in the placement of the blocks. Yes its a very simple and casual game but its a good relaxing stress free game. Trying to keep the flow going without touching any of the blocks can be challenging but when you put your mind into the world of Floating Point, you won't even care all that much.\n\nThe music also helps you to relax and let loose your hard day at work stress. There's an interesting element behind the music as well. When your above the water, the music is loud and clear but upon entering the water, the music tones down into a low softer tone. Giving you that element of putting your brain into a summer warn pool.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who just wants to play something extremely simple and at the same time feel relaxed.","June 24, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just don't understand why so many people are giving it a perfect ten. This game is not without it's flaws. But I do want to give it a higher rating than IGN gave Shrek Superslam.\nOverall, an 8/10. Excellent work by Tom Francis to make a game that is free and fun. Am I too harsh with this game? Yeah. I know it's free and I shouldn't rate it as I would one that isn't, but I was bothered by the absurdly high scores it was recieveing. I wanted to make a review that was more realistic. But of course, this game is free and takes 2 seconds to download.\nThisisfreesopleasedon'tkillmeit'sagoodgameandIamcyncial.","July 12, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aim and click, you'll be attached to a platform where you can then swing with momentum, hold the click and it will retract you adding to your speed.  Right click disconnects you from the platform, that's about it.\n\nThe swinging feels natural and the soundtrack is amazing, the options are alright before you start the game. In game however there are quite a few options to change how the game reacts, even reversing the point mechanics of the game, to where hitting objects raises the bars.\n\nSpeaking about the.. mechanics of the game, your... how to say, objective is to swing into the red bars and score points. The higher the bar the more points, you don't have to hit all of the bars to move on to the next level however hitting all of them shows your path.. which can be interesting.\n\nThe point of this game isn't stated or even implied, I use it to relax and have fun swinging point to point listing to the music, it helps calm me and at times when I get up great speed even excite me.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, especially since it's free!

After jumping in, the concept may take some getting used to -- but, once you get the hang of it, your actions feel much less random and pointless (something like button-mashing), and once you get good at it, it's anything but boring.\n\nSooner or later you'll figure out how the scoring system works, and you'll really be pushing to beat your high score which can be especially frustrating with how slow the ball moves. However, that doesn't matter, because this game offers settings that allow you to change the values of the game properties (the strengths of retraction, block density, etc.). Every time I found something I didn't like about this game, there was some way around that catered to my personal preference. There are a number of little extra things you'll run into that will leave you thinking, "oh, hey, that's kinda cool!"\n\nYup yup, obviously I recommend this game.

The interesting concept of points both rewards and challenges the player to conserve their momentum for the maximum points possible for the "bar" and will have the player both defying gravity and natural bouyancy in an attempt to get the best run. The music is calming at best, and the simplistic design of the levels are both uniquely placed and innocently randomized for a new challenge every level. Recommended as a single player experience with headphones/listening devices.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Unless it is inspired by Just Cause 2 of the grappling hook from Team Fortress 2. But that is very unlikely.

I mean, it's a bit interesting to play, but not really fun enough for a hardcore gamer such as myself. This one's for the casuals out there.\n\nWhen you start off the game, you're greeted to the controls. Nice and simple. As stated in the system requirements you really can't even try to play this without a real mouse. Then, you're off. Obviously, this is one of those physics games without any real theme or setting, so don't expect any of that. Now, here's the best part of the game: you get to fling your little dot around the rectanges and collect the little squares (that extend into collumns when you're going fast).\nSounds fun, right?\n\nRight?\n\nYeah, it is, but the game tends to get quite boring once you've been playing for a few minutes or so.\nIt's a nice idea, but I'm not sure if Steam was the right place for it. This feels like something that should I should be playing on my Android phone as opposed to on my laptop.\nAnd, I know it sounds like I'm just plain out complaining, but the music kinda doesn't fit with the theme. It's great, but really doesn't belong with the game.\n\nThis one's kinda stuck in the middle for me. Likewise, it gets a lukewarm 3/5 stars.","July 24, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 22 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","4","22","0","2"

When I first started Floating Point up, I was immediately lost and frustrated as I kept hitting walls, unable to speed up at all, and there was no incentive to spend time getting better at it. The controls are counterintuitive and don't take advantage of the natural human perception of momentum and centrifugal force. It seems like a nice concept that wasn't translated effectively for the casual gamer.\n\nThere are other games that have a more effective swinging mechanic, such as Aether, which throws a storyline integrated with the mechanics and an immersive art style into the mix, being free in addition. Floating Point isn't really worth playing in light of those. It may be more polished both visually and aurally, but when it comes down to actual gameplay it's more of a struggle than a relaxing pastime.","August 14, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 22 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","4","22","0","4"

Add in to that the lack of feedback to let you know how much or how fast you are retracting the rope and it measn you end up making mistakes becasue the game is not telling you what is going on.\n\nHaving said that, when it works the game is great and I love the look and sounds of it.\n\nI just hope these little niggles can be fixed.","June 6, 2014","false","1.0"," 7 of 34 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","7","34","0","1"

(Please note that this list includes the mundane and repetitive Red Faction: Armageddon.) Floating Point is made by the creators of the wonderful and successful Gunpoint. The point of the game is to swing and collect blocks, really that's all there is to it. While I am very supportive of simple visual styles and low intensity gameplay, this takes it a step too far towards comatose. It does not have the interesting story, humor, or gameplay that made Gunpoint such a unique and notable game and it does not surprise me that they are giving it away for free. My recommendation: avoid this game and play either Gunpoint or (if you’re in the market for a free-be) play Hearthstone.","June 8, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 21 people (5%) found this review helpful","5","1","21","0","3"

Its so simple yet so good. If you didn't know already Floating point is a physics based game with no real objective(besides getting points). The ball you play as moves so fluently and natural with momentum and swing that a grapple type physics game should have. The randomly generated stages are so amazing to play in even though the color isn't amazing yet it still captures a very calm feel. The stages also have a very large and cosmic feel or a very small and confined feeling depending on what setting you have. The soundtrack is very atmospheric with a blissful and easy going ferl to it. To sum it up its an amazing free game and if you ever had a hard or stressful day at work or school this game will instantly put you in a good mood. Theres no dumb hat collecting or K.D just blissfully hopping around from block to block with a cool calm soundtrack. In my books the game gets a 10/10 due to its simplicity but but overall amazing form and presentation.","July 12, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schrai/recommended/302380/","schrai","Schrai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schrai/","32 products in account","I feel like this game could be summed up pretty succinctly with a single phrase:\n\n"Move to the next level, when you're ready."\n\nIt may be a paraphrase, but the meaning is still there all the same. It's a nice, cathartic game that takes into account your preferences and other such things. There is no complexity, there are no complications. There is only you, the platforms, the bars, and the grappling hook -- and because of those things, there's much more care directed towards what makes this game; well, this game.\n\nThere's much more care directed towards let's say, the controls. The little dot does exactly what you tell it, and even conducts a rough estimate if you don't specify which brick you would like to grapple to; and might I add, it does a good job.\n\nAesthetic is a big one. It feels fantastic when you get some momentum and the entire level glows this warm red. It sneaks up on you, rewarding you whenever you're able to surmount the minute learning curve and actually become able to swing around and maneuver the "obstacles."\n\nI personally don't utilize it, as I believe in playing games the way they're meant to be played, but you can edit almost every aspect of the game. The density of the platforms, how fast your line retracts, how fast your line retracts when you aren't going fast -- stuff like that. There are plenty of niches to mess with to optimize your gaming experience, which I feel only epitomizes the fact that this game is catered to the relaxation of the player. I can devote long spells of time just mosing about the austere landscape.\n\nAnd the music, oh man. There isn't a segmented soundtrack, just one continuous loop that intensifies as you accelerate. It's a great listen, and it never really applies to you that it actually IS looping because it's so inconspicuous; that is, whenever you do deign to hear it, it's always playing a different portion of the loop. It's extremely unlikely for it to intensify on the exact same "movement," and whenever it does you don't notice it. On top of which, it's simply nice to listen to, I don't really feel the need to elaborate.\n\nThe things I mention work in synthesis, and culminate into a very pleasant game. Play it when you're frustrated, play it when you've got nothing better to do, play it when you want to pass time... play it whenever your head is preoccupied. It's almost therapeutic. I highly recommend it.\n","February 16, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can even make it to where you get over flowed points that was probably added in because I didn't crash when I broke the game, there's no bugs or anything, and every computer can play this game. There's no reason why EVERYONE shouldn't at least try the game out, if the default settings are boring, then go ahead and break the game.\n\nIt can even be used as a teaching tool to teach momentum and physics, seeing as how its a PHYSICS game in the first place.\n\nIn short, I give this game a 10 out of 10 for being shockingly addicting.","July 22, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am not saying the game is not playable or boring or anything like that. But with its very few features, it wouldn't live up to a paid game, BUT since it is a free game and I am happy that the developer had his head screwed on and gave this game away for free, as although it has some few features and limitations (like no achievements, Steam Overlay doesn't work, no settings page, no Co-Op or Online/Local Multiplayer) it lives up to a free game, and what made me enjoy this game so much, is how small this game is with its great mechanics and music, it made me inspired to continue making more games, although my games are amateur and not that great, this game made me more inspired to make even more games just like this one!\n\nWELL DONE Suspicious Developments Ltd.!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

The music combined with the colours and the simple control scheme make for an enjoyable game that you can turn on for 10 minutes and have some fun.\n\nThe points system is brilliant, and completely unnecessary should you want to ignore it. The more momentum you build up, the more points you can gain from the bars you must swing into. Or, should you prefer, feel free just to swing around like an absolute maniac.\n\nFloating point is almost a thank you to the community from it's developer, Tom Francis, for allowing him to do what he loves.

There's really nothing else in this game, but it's really a simple and fun game that will relax you. If you don't enjoy it, don't worry, it's only 10 MB and takes only 30 seconds to download. I'm giving it 9.5/10. This review is avalible on Awesome Net (http://awesome-net.weebly.com/) and is made completly by me!","June 7, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a 2D game in which you shoot a grappling hook and collect the bars that are dotted around the level. The more momentum you gain, the longer the bars become and more points you earn. The levels are generated procedurally and get progressively harder with more platforms at greater height and depth. The trick is to shoot your hook in such a way that you keep up the momentum while trying to get as many bars as possible in one swing. All that without accidentally hitting a platform and loosing momentum. Definitely worth a spin. And it's free too!","June 8, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is extremely well-made, the grapchis are simple, so it all looks so smooth and the physics are smooth, so the whole thing is soothing. When you begin playing you soar over the map and make a sharp turn around this block. Then you go gliding down and hit (what seems to be water) and you slowly drift in the opposite direction and fling your little ball-self-thing into the air gracefully... until your whole airshow ends abruptly with you slamming into a block. The only time when I tense up; MY GRACEFUL ART IS RUINED!\nThe whole objective of the game is swing around the map and collect or destroy all of these red pillars that escalate in height if you don't hit anything and if you're speedy enough and shrink if you're super clumsy and slow. Once you have collected all of them you advance onto another randomly generated level. The game is so great for passing the time in situations such as: your internet is down so you need a game to pass the time or you're waiting for a game to download or you just REALLY don't want to do your homework.\nSo beautifully made and so beautifully perfect for passing the time.

The music combined with the colours and the simple control scheme make for an enjoyable game that you can turn on for 10 minutes and have some fun.\n\nThe points system is brilliant, and completely unnecessary should you want to ignore it. The more momentum you build up, the more points you can gain from the bars you must swing into. Or, should you prefer, feel free just to swing around like an absolute maniac.\n\nFloating point is almost a thank you to the community from it's developer, Tom Francis, for allowing him to do what he loves.

The way you swing around is pretty similar to the Spider-Man 2 game- you connect to a block and you swing around it, and your rope wraps around any blocks it hits. It's pretty cool when you can get a lot of speed up and get more points. The controls are simple: left click to connect with a block, hold left click to reel yourself in, and right click to let go.\n\nThe music isn't anything spectacular but it fits well with the game.\n\nOverall, Floating Point is a nice game to get if you want something to play to kill some time. The file size is really small so it will only take a minute or so to download. Plus it's FREE. Very unique and very fun.\n\nI give Floating Point a 9/10.","June 24, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
