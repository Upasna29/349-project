It takes the game on the new level, drastically changes gameplay from idle "search and kill" to more or less sane "explore and make decisions". New missions (including new side of the conflict and prologue), new weapons, new situations and far more means to make gameplay convienent, but still complex. Car management,  human needs, interactive objects...Everything is done with care and love. Reaaly good job, guys. thank you!","October 2, 2015","true","201.3"," 132 of 144 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","132","144","4","0"

Yes. Is this a great game? Far from it.\n\nYou are a mercenary, and you are in a foreign country that is ruled by a dictator. There are a few different factions that you can side with who are vying for control, including going it alone. You hire and manage personell, fight battles on generic 3D maps, and complete quests. There is a large selection of guns, equipment, and vehicles to use throughout the game.\n\nIf you were a fan of Jagged Alliance 2, you will almost certainly enjoy this game. It is similar in principle, but far more in-depth in many ways than Jagged Alliance. The biggest gameplay difference is that this game doesn't use action points, it uses a real time system with pause/auto pause.\n\nThere are a couple of things to keep in mind:\n\n1)The game is very buggy.\n2)The inventory/stash system is terrible. I have probably spent at least 20 hours of my play time trying to organize items.\n3)The game is poorly translated.\n4)The first few hours are extremely difficult.\n5)Most of the objectives are straightforward, but there is not much hand holding in this game.\n6)Performance seems to be poor. I have a medium build (i5 3570k, GTX 480, 12GB RAM, SSD) and have played with the settings. Lots of AI movement seems to result in massive drops in framerates.\n7)Speaking of AI, it is, more often than not, very bad.\n\nDespite all this, I still recommend the game,  It has a blend of TBS/RTS, managment, and RPG elements that is very rare in this setting. Worth a look for any JA2 fan, just don't expect much polish. For $5, you can't go wrong.\n","November 20, 2015","true","116.2"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","18","18","3","0"

Second mission include your squad of 7-8 unprepared people vs. 40 bandits.\nThis is no Rambo so many enemies shooting at one target make a hit.\nMicromanagement hell.\nI love it.\n\nI'm the strange guy who still read manuals to basically everything.\nHard Life have none. Or does have but in barbaric language.\nSome things can't be found with the intuition and common sense, mostly because engine limitation and workarounds done because that.\n\nAlso you should know that Hard Life is old russian mod that made backbone for Blue Sun Mod for High Calibre, so good and important it's avaliable on Steam.\n\nConfiguration tools touch many aspects (like "random encounters" frequency), add features like hunger, vehilce mainentance.\n\nDescriptions of everything have more details and contain vital informations. Don't use Old/Dirty/Rusty guns with Cheap/badly made ammo. You either do nothing to enemy or it can blow in your hands.\nMore and more niuances, no manual, you need to read forum posts to find answers or by yourself.\n\nStill - big thumb up because game IS good.","January 11","true","7.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

(its very hard even on normal)\n+Gun physics are great.\n+Looting system is very good too.\n+Wepon modifications.\n+Other physics in the game are great too. (except what buildings can be destroyed)\n+All your crew members are very important for you if they die, thats it, you lost them and there is no way to get them back.\n+Health and injuries system, its very realistic, and you can easily bleed to death or get to bullet in your head or just a scrap from explosion what you or your enemy made and THATS IT you are DEAD!!!\n\n\nCons: -No good toturial.\n-It's way too hard at the beginning of the game.\n-Bandits will keep attacking you and you will have to last stand against them for really long time until you get bigger squad size or better cars.\n-Mercenaries (squad members) are way too expensive.\n-Map isnt very big and only few towns.\n-Few Combat Maps outside the towns, so you will keep fighting in zones again and again, but that isnt the main problem.\n\n\nMy verdict about this game: 1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play","May 8","true","32.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The interface makes very little sense. I've spent two hours wandering around talking to NPCs and so far, leaving the base camp has proven impossible. I've looted bodies NPCs have killed and traded them for money and hired a dude and bought him a shotgun. But leaving camp is impossible. Did I say the interface is confusing? (I was a fan of Silent Storm and since this game claimed to be along the same vein, I bought it. So far, I'm not seeing the similarity.)\n\nWhat would fix this game? Maybe a tutorial would help. Perhaps some sort of indication as to who to talk to for missions would help.
