SurrealVR's use of the controllers gave a good experience in being able to interact with a virtual world and others in it. I liked the set pieces and atmospheric sound design. This game offers a few different game options that help illustrate the power of the Vive (and VR in general), and gets me excited to see what new updates come out for this game.","April 18","true","0.1"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","0"

It has several well textured environments that offer a convincing atmosphere. Communicating with other avatars was automatic and easy. Moving takes a little getting used to, but I figured it out after about 10 minutes. My first hour flew past and then I ran into some interesting people where I had a good laugh with them.

It has great potential and developers always trying to find new ideas for the game. I did not have any bugs&crash. Some say there are lots of bug etc, weren't there bugs in Altspace or V-Time's developement too? Yes, there were.\n\nAlso MOST of the bad reviewers played the game for just 10 minutes or less. I think some are from Altspace and V-Time. At least we are not just sitting and talking with people like V-Time. Even if it's not the best social game, it will be.

I first had a chance to play with Surreal a few months ago, and it was quite impressive.  I was chatting and interacting in real time with people all over the world as we explored the environments the Surreal team put together.  It looks like some of their more recent features they were demoing at the time aren't in this version yet, but I can't wait!  I spent some time with their team and they are avid gamers who are really excited about their plans for Surreal.  I'm counting on regular updates and patches, please take a look at locomotion.  There might be a reason for it being somewhat slow but those of us used to running around in FPS find it frustrating.

The teleport function has no clear indicator to where you will land\n2. Physics and collision are not functioning\n3. Dinosaurs and other animals have no impact i.e. no splash effect\n4. the avatars are rigid and can not interact with the environment i.e. pick up someone else's maraca in the club\n5. Falsly advertising the fact you can use Google Cardboard or another headset WITHOUT hand controllers\n6. Menu doesn't come up when you press the grip button - sometimes I have to press it 16 times for it to appear\n7. Falsly advertises leg, face and mouth tracking in it's advert as well as customising avatars facial features\n\nIt needs a whole lot of work (maybe a couple of years and a couple of decent designers) for it to actually feature the lists of expectations described in it's trailer.","May 3","false","0.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","5"

The menu button works fine, you just need to hold it for around half of a second.\n\nThe character creator? You mean the preset selection of characters to choose from right?\n*I've read the comment by the SurrealVR developer and see that i was wrong, there is a character creator with many options.\n\nThere's also no push to talk, which is weird for me. everyones mic is always on. I'm guessing theres a certain DB level you need before it actually transmitts but that doesn't really change much.\n\nthe Inverse Kinematics were OK i guess, but if you look down your always looking inside your own body. The other people in the game all look like they are moving at 10~FPS and so do any object that arent thrown by you.\n\nOh right the locomotion, the teleporting is very annoying. It doesn't show where your going to teleport to and i was only able to teleport short distances half the time i pressed the touch pad.\n\n*I just cant find the fun in the game.\n\nTo expand on that, there's no character in peoples movements. What i mean by that is the movement doesn't look natural so, for example, dancing in the club room with people doesn't have much of a connection for me.\n\nI can see the devs are working hard to make the game better and are taking feedback, once they improve the game I'll be sure to come back and re-do my review.","April 17","false","0.2"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","2"
