In No Pineapple Left Behind you assume the role of Principal in nine different schools (though not at the same time). For each school you will be set a challenge that you have to complete in order to unlock the next school as well as unlock a new way to play that school. While the challenges vary in what they ask of you the general idea of the game is to manage your school in a way that maximises the grades achieved by your students. Since “Children have lots of wants, needs, and feelings” you’re going to need to transform your students into pineapples for the best results because, as everyone knows, pineapples are solely focused on working to their full potential and achieving the best grades.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the developer.\n\nWhile No Pineapple Left Behind (NPLB) does look rather silly when taken at face value it does perfectly get across the issues with the current education system. The game is presumably based off of the US system (due to where the devs are based), a system I have little knowledge of but since I see the problems covered in the game that I see in the UK education system I feel I can still talk about it. Just keep in mind that I’m speaking from a UK perspective. Over the past few years there’s been a shift away from teaching kids towards getting higher in the education league tables. A shift away from doing your best to doing the best. While some individual teachers do still care about doing right by their students most of them are simply see their students as the grades they achieve, certainly not helped by the fact that, at least in my school, teachers are given pay bonuses based on the grades that their students achieve in their GCSEs and A-Levels.\n\nTo be successful in NPLP you have to find ways around the human nature of your students (or even stop treating them as humans, i.e. make them into pineapples), you have to figure out how you can minimise costs as well as maximise profits and most importantly you have to get the best grades possible. Sounds a lot like the real system, that’s because it is. Unfortunately NPLB’s fantastic representation of the issues with the education system isn’t quite enough to save it from its rather dull gameplay.\n\nOn to how the game actually plays, there’s just not much to the gameplay. Once you’ve figured out the strategy for a given level there’s absolutely nothing to do but execute that strategy for each day of objective, for all the schools I played whatever strategy worked on the first day worked for the rest of the objective’s duration. Some of the objectives are pretty straightforward, there’s one where you just need to earn $1000 in a certain number of days to win while another requires that you get rid of a certain trait in a child by the end of each day for a certain number of days. The basic strategies for getting through a week of school remain the same but you’ll need to tweak them to fit with what it is you need to do.\nThe main management/strategy in NPLB comes from the teachers in the game. You decide who to hire. You decide how much to pay them. You decide what spells and lasers they use. Spells and lasers? Yes, spells and lasers. Each school teaches a combination of a possible five subjects, how many subjects are taught has an effect on the structure of the school day but that’s not overly important, the longer the school day is just changes how complex your strategy will need to be. Every subject needs a teacher and you’re given a choice of two teachers to hire for that subject. The teachers will have different hiring costs based on their starting energy. Once you’ve picked a teacher you need to choose their spell and laser, effectively a passive and an active ability. Both of these consume the teacher’s energy, how much energy depends on the type of spell or laser and that means you’ll need to choose those two carefully so you don’t use too much energy. The lower your teacher’s energy is the less likely it is that their spell will be successful. The spells are one of the factors that decide the grades of your students and are triggered automatically at the start of a lesson block. Lasers are only used on one student (though you can use them on multiple students providing you have enough energy) and have effects such as decreasing humanity or removing a negative trait for the child.\n\nYour teachers can have a maximum of 100 energy and chances are you’re going to use most of that in one day, especially if you’ve got three or more lesson blocks. Energy is restored by the salary you pay your teachers, the more you pay them per day the more energy is restored for the next day and energy restoration is doubled over the weekend (allowing you to reduce salaries significantly on a Friday). Paying your teachers minimum wage leads to them having less energy. Less energy means less chance of their spells being successful. If their spells don’t succeed then your students will get lower grades which means less of a money bonus or even penalties if the school’s average grade is particularly bad at the end of the day.\n\nPineapples may not be perfect but they do have better stats than kids. Once a child’s humanity is reduced from 100 to 0 they become a pineapple which means they’ll do better in class, in turn raising the average grade of the class. Humanity can be decreased by through the use of lasers and supplies as well as through achieving good grades while getting low grades or failing parent phone calls are among the ways of increasing humanity. Supplies are a resource in the game which can be attached to a teacher’s spell. You have one of each kind of supply and they increase in price as they get better. As I mentioned some of the supplies decrease humanity but there are quite a few different effects including increasing grades. Parent phone calls are introduced several schools in, they’re basically secondary-objectives for you to complete. A parent will call in and give you a certain objective for their child, such as make sure they achieve at least a C+ in History. Failing these phone calls usually just means you get fined $200 or $500 but every so often, failure means an increase of twenty humanity for all students, something you really want to avoid. Thankfully phone calls can be ignored by spending an influence point.\n\nThe two main reasons I’m not recommending the game are simple, the uninteresting gameplay and the presentation of the game. As I’ve said the gameplay is pretty simple because once you’ve worked out your strategy there is literally nothing to do, in my experience there aren’t any random events or anything like that to shake things up and so you’re left with about five minutes of real gameplay for each school you play. The other problem is its presentation, not as important as the gameplay but important nonetheless. There’s nothing particularly special about the actual graphics, they’re pretty bland in fact but the real problem with the presentation is with the UI. The UI is just so clunky, taking up far more screen space than it needs to. It’s also not as responsive as it should be, far too many times I found myself having to click on something two or three times for the game to register it, particularly when clicking on classrooms to access the teacher and when using the salary slider for the teachers. It’s not a big deal but something so basic should be fully functional in my eyes.\n\nVerdict\nNLPB tries to tackle a serious issue with comedic and challenging gameplay. Sadly the game falls flat on both fronts, hence I’m not recommending it.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","February 18","false","3.3"," 126 of 187 people (67%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","67","126","187","8","10"

Your role, as the player, is to manage a school. However, in this school, all that matters are the grades. Children are dirty little things that tend to have wants and needs, Pineapples, on the other hand, are ideal students. All they do is take tests and get graded. We want more pineapples.\n\nIn NPLB, you will mainly be managing the courses that your teachers are giving. These courses (called spells in the game) will influence the humanity and grades of your students, should they succeed. Success will depend on how much energy your teachers have, and it generally only recovers at the end of the day when they get paid.\n\nWhile I did have some issues with game (detailed more in my full review), if you're looking for a somewhat different type of management/sim game, then this is a game worth giving a shot. However, with that said, this is one of those games I wish I could just give a neutral review to. As it is, I can only give it a shaky recommendation, as there were some elements (Fruitbol, for example) that I just did not enjoy about it.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a copy by the developer for review purposes.","February 23","true","9.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/350090/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","I received a review copy of this game.\n\nIf you’d prefer a video review, have a look here: https://youtu.be/h7zr_PsQN6k\n\nNo Pineapple Left Behind is a game with attitude, humour, and, at least I believe, subtext. It’s a management game where you run a for-profit school where the higher the average grade, the more you get paid. The ultimate goal of the school is to turn its students into emotionless pineapples that follow rules and get grades, and the teachers do this by casting spells on  the children and controlling their minds. Children are troublesome; they make friends, they have off days, they sometimes skip class; while pineapples, well they’re much simpler. I think you’d need to be blind to not see that this developer is trying to say something about the way schools in the US are run, and I think the sentiment and the ideas are fantastic; I just wish it was a better video game.\n\nPresentationHonestly I felt like the game was presented pretty terribly. It’s not particularly stylized, and looks generic. From what I could tell there was no dynamic lighting, all of the shadows seemed to sit perfectly under the sprites, the colours were really drab, though while that may have been the point it still wasn’t pleasant to look at. Really, it doesn’t have a particular art direction, and there’s nothing impressive about it technically. Where it does get some points from me, is the music theme at the title screen along with the still image art there, and the funny sound effects when you click on a child or teacher. But that’s about it. There’s not much else to say other than the fact the visuals of the game seemed like an afterthought.\n\n\nMechanicsSpeaking of afterthoughts, the presentation was not the worst aspect of the game for me. The mechanics are horrible, and for so many reasons. There’s almost nothing good about the actual game. The UI is all over the place. It takes up so much space you’d think it was an IOS game. The UI is supposed to be helpful and make your playing experience more convenient, not clutter the screen like it does in No Pineapple Left Behind. And convenience? Let me tell you about convenience. It takes far too many mouse clicks to do almost anything. There’s no reason why I cannot change individual teacher spells or salaries from the teacher menu. It’s fine to have a menu for individual characters, but to change a spell I shouldn’t have to open the teacher menu, click on a teacher, click on the spell currently equipped, click on the new spell I want, close the spell menu, and do that 4 more times just to change all of their spells to something that isn’t televisor or memorizor. Same thing with casting lasers on individual children; I have to physically click the child I need something casted on, which is impossible at higher game speeds. Why can’t I just tell my teacher to do this from the menu?\n\nSo even if all of that was ok and convenient and worked, there’s no depth to the game. There’s one or two strategies that work for making money, and that’s it. You have to follow the exact same paths. The game tries to add in special objectives and limitations to shake things up, but it just adds to the tedium. If I absolutely had to say something positive? It would be that sometimes it’s satisfying when you manage to earn money, but it’s not because the game is designed well, but because I have a stupid ape brain that likes to see numbers go up.\n\nStoryEverything, and I mean everything in this game, was designed after the story was set in place. This is a game that was made to say something. Someone in the development team had some ideas, and this game was built around them. Because of that, the story is, clearly, a head-height above the other elements of the game. There’s some really funny writing in the game, such as the students learning cantaloupian, some students having the trait “fruity” that meant they are attracted to pineapples, and so on. And the game is clearly making a point with the way the school gets paid in grades, and how little you, as a player, are supposed to care about the actual needs of the children, and instead prefer that they be empty, soulless zombies that get good grades, follow the rules, and nothing else. It’s not a new idea, but it’s new for video games; I don’t think I’ve seen a criticism of the US education system to this degree in a video game. It's just such a shame that the story is so unsupported by every other element of the game.\n\nVerdictThe game is $10 which is... far far too much. I wouldn’t recommend this game to anyone. Save your money. Don’t buy the game. Again, the sentiment and message of the game is great, but great games are not just made of ideas; they’re made of an innovative, compelling presentation, solid mechanics that are satisfying to play with, and a cohesive story that makes you, laugh and/or scream and/or gasp and/or cry or maybe it just speaks to you with its message or theme which this game did for me. But a third of a great game just isn’t enough, and I’d maybe even argue that, depending on the game, the story is the weakest of those three elements.\n\nScore\nPresentation: 4\nMechanics: 2\nStory: 7\nPrice/Quality:\nPersonal Enjoyment: 2\n\nFinal: 3.8/10\n\nNo pineapple left behind gets a final score of 3.8 out of 10. The presentation was pretty bad, though it could have been worse; they have a pretty sweet title screen theme and art. The mechanics are abysmal and just not intuitive or deeply thought out in any way. The story was the shining star of the game, and happened to be the only part of the game that really stood out to me as controlled and carefully planned. Though it still could have been more; deeper lore that could be read up on and the addition of character bios would go a long way. I don’t know the price of the game on launch so I can’t comment, though I’d say the game is only worth it if it’s like, two bucks and you really really care about the theme and writing. And unfortunately, I just had an awful time with this game. A really really awful time. I got very little enjoyment and satisfaction from playing it, and outside of the rare s♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I got from the writing, I didn’t want to play more.","February 18","false","5.9"," 56 of 104 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","56","104","3","6"

Just as a note, I would have bought the game otherwise.\nI have so far invested 8.1 hours. The only level left for me to do is the last one. After that it is achievements.\n\nNow what do I think about it? I think it's a good puzzle/satyrical game. Do not go here, if you wanted a more sandbox experience like Prison Architect or Theme Hospital, as this is not that kind of game.\nIn this game you control teachers, that all have energy. Energy can be spent on using special abilities (like for example unfriending two kids from one another to make them more focused on the studies), or lessons (use more energy on a lesson that will give better grades to kids if it goes well, but also has a worse effect if it fails). Teachers get energy from you paying them at the end of the day, or buying special equipable buffs (for example if you equip something along the lines of coffee it can cost 50$ a lesson to do that, but your teacher will have more energy). The goal for the most part is to make money. You make money by either cutting spending or increasing grades. The game outright tells you that you can fire teachers to avoid paying them. However if you fire a teacher, they won't gain experience and in turn won't get better skills and lessons. There are obviously little things on the side, like hiring a headmaster that will allow you to make sure that no students skip classes, a policeman that reduces students humanity (and turns them into nice pineapple puppets), or a librarian.\nThe game's goal is to find the right solution to passing each level. It's a puzzle game. Now if we remember that it is a puzzle game and not a prison architect sandbox, it's quite a good puzzle game for 10 Euros. You get about 10 hours worth of gameplay for your money (which is more than I got out of some games).\n\nextra potential that feels wasted - the game could have done with more optional people, therefore including more ways of solving problems and more ways of playing it, like for example making the food that children eat also influence stats and cost money. It would also have been nice if they included harder level modes, even though I do appreciate sandbox modes as I did take a bit of joy of just getting a school full of nothing but pineapples.\n\nTLDR: if you like puzzle games and this game remotely interests you, go for it. I think that honestly for what it is, it is not known enough and quite undervalued. If you want something along the lines of Prison Architect or Theme Hospital, this is the wrong place to look.","March 16","true","8.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"
