As an arcade game, the focus is on the action; and so: the controls are simple, the storyline elements are minimal, and the overall depth of the game falls somewhere between “puddle” and “kiddie-pool.” But it’s all good. Because it’s fun as hell. Anyone who is looking for some wild, mindless action should give Thunder Wolves strong consideration.\n\nIt is of medium length and is pretty easy (even on the high difficulties). It is one of those games where you are basically a god among men and your biggest challenge is the scoreboard. The controls may take a few levels to get used to, as the helicopters have three axes of motion; and so your standard ‘W-A-S-D’ will need two more helpers. I preferred using a controller. As for the graphics and animations: they are decent. Nothing special or jaw dropping, but they do a fine job of displaying destruction as you mow down everything in your path. It all comes together to offer an enjoyable experience that holds true to the genre and feels reminiscent of classic arcade quarter-eaters.\n\nI know many PC gamers don’t usually care for it, but this game also makes for some wildly fun local-coop. In fact, I only played solo for a small fraction of my total playtime to mop-up achievements. I initially played through the game’s entirety with a friend, sitting next to each other on a couch, using controllers and the big screen, like it used to be in the old days. And it was fun as hell. The mindlessness and simplicity of the game is perfect for supplemental entertainment when you’re kicking-it with a buddy. And with PC gaming becoming more accessible from the living room, Thunder Wolves is a good game to keep in mind for such occasions.\n\nAnd so, there isn’t anything extraordinary or incredible about it, but I feel this game accomplished its mission of providing what it was intended to provide. So if you’re a fan of blowing stuff up, and enjoy the simplistic action of arcade genre, then you should give Thunder Wolves a shot.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","January 17","true","12.9"," 80 of 85 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","80","85","0","1"

The story is a typical 90's story in which the bad guys is ... and you have to ... but you don't know until the very end. ( I won't spoil you ,hehe)\nAnd let's not forget about the music , you will have in the background around 2-4 songs, old 80-90 rock, if you like rock,like me, you will enjoy it even though it might become a bit too repetitive at some points but the music feets the gameplay .\nIn the end, the game worths a try but don't buy it at full price, as for 15 euros (my regional price ) you can get a better game , wait for a discount or for a Bundle but if you see it on sales don't hesitate, is really good game and it will keep you busy for about 3 hours and more if you want to get all the achievements which are easy to get and fun trying to get them.\n7.9/10","November 25, 2013","true","6.5"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","30","37","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notoneofus/recommended/232970/","notoneofus","Not One Of Us","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notoneofus/","621 products in account","Going into Thunder Wolves, I was expecting an arcadey Desert/Jungle Strike.  What I got was what Desert/Jungle Strike would've been if they were made for an actual arcade.\n\nThe game is played loose, with the core focus being shooting and blowing up as many enemies as quickly as you can - chopper control being simple and extremely responsive.  Machine gun ammo is infinite and the weapon has no cooldown, while the various missle types you can use recharge rather quickly, and you can switch between the types while waiting for one to restock.\n\nThe graphics are kept simple and clean - really something you'd've seen in an arcade from the late 90s/early 00s, only with a bit more polygons.  These visuals work perfectly for such a straightforward game, giving you a clear and quick understanding of the immediate area to focus on what to shoot and what not to shoot (most the time what to shoot).  Additionally, a good amount of the buildings and whatnot are destructable, adding to the fun of just blowing ♥♥♥♥ up for the hell of it.\n\nAs for the sound, well, it's satisfying. Things go boom, and they sound like they go boom.  The music is fitting hard rock.  The voice acting, taking itself as seriously as a self-aware 80s action film, is perfect.\n\nThe only negatives I could say is that, while the music and sound settings are seperately adjustable, the voice overs are attached to the sound control, and at times the action can really drown out the characters' speech.  I could also say the game's a bit on the short side (about four hours for my first playthrough), but for ten bucks, hard to complain - and if it's still too much, you know there's always the seasonal Steam sales.\n\nI recommend playing this on Expert.  Going through Normal was too easy; six missions in wondering if I could even be killed.  Expert provides an actual challenge, making the game more intense.\n\nWhile this would've been perfect for the arcades toward the end of their golden days, it's still a great time on PC.","August 14, 2014","true","4.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/232970/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Thunder Wolves can be best described as "Mercenaries" (the shooter series) in helicopters (and sometimes, tanks). Basically you have a bunch of wisecracking mercenaries screaming "yahoo!" "oh yeah!" while you deal out plenty of destruction via your various weapons onboard your helo, from the MG to 3 types of missiles/rockets. Pick the chopper proper for the role, and sometimes, play a bit of "rail shooter" and other sequences.\n\nThe graphcis are quite good, "fast and furious" sort of way, plenty of muzzle flashes, ping / boing and other bullet sounds, but if you play on casual just go hide behind something for a while and you're okay to continue. The catch is... since you have infinite ammo, enemy does too, and there's bazillion of them and just one of you.\n\nThe game's usually played in a 3rd person perspective, and virtually requires a gamepad or joystick, as there are plenty of things to control, as you may want to fly one way and shoot another. Missiles varies from unguided rockets to seeking missiles (require lockon) to self-seeking missiles to TV guided missions (fly it into the target). The idea of course, is to cause as much damage as possible, and sometimes, plenty of collateral damage. (You get bonus points for big explosions and "streaks")\n\nOn the other hand, the game sometimes switch to "minigames" such as "rail shooter sequence" (game flies the chopper, you just control the machine gun), "sniper sequence" (snipe guards from way back out), drone sequence (take a FireScout drone into a tunnel and blast everything), and APC/tank sequence (it's on the ground instead of in the air) for certain segments of the game.\n\nThe helos are based on real ones, but obviously they all pretty much fly alike (albeit with different armaments), and they should have different flying characteristics, but you're probably too busy shooting to notice.\n\nIt's a pretty good game for mindless shooting fun, and it's a little deeper than it appears to be. Think someone took Choplifter HD and made a full 3D game out of it, with loudmouth mercenaries, and you got Thunder Wolves. It's not a "deep" game, not does it pretend to be.","December 22, 2013","true","5.5"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsiAurora/recommended/232970/","ItsiAurora","Aurora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsiAurora/","96 products in account","Yes. I recommend this game.\nAs usual, I'll post the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Difficulty and difficulty levels (I mean, stages get harder as each stage goes, and you have a choice of three difficulties to start the mission with, casual, normal, or hardcore)\n- The art work is great! (I love the font, and textures for this game)\n- The destruction is amazing.\n- EXPLOSIONS!\n- Plenty of achievements, collectables and unlockables for hardcore Thunder Wolves fans.\n\nCons:\n- The graphics, as much as the textures are great, the graphical elements are not as good. I mean, I have a PC capable of running this game at maximum settings, but it lacks quality, the water reflections are okay, the shadows could have been better.\n- The controls are awkward. "E & Q" are default elevation settings, ALT is boost/nitro. And the could have been better. I find the mouse controls are sloppy. Realistically, you wouldn't have a point three second delay to move your crosshair.\n- The information about these helicopters could be expanded. (I don't mean, type, name, although it would be great to have information about those) I mean, weapons for other helicopters. Some are obvious, others are not. So there's like, three icons, one is a plane moving, the other is I think flares? and then there's the rockets type. And all I see is either multiple rockets, a single rocket, a single rocket and lock on GUI icon, and I'm sitting here thinking. Where the hell do I find out about what each of these icons mean? I am pretty good at identifying pictures and small mistakes, but I can't work out what each icon means.\n- You are not told (As far as I'm aware) that there are more unlockables by collecting collectables or completing missions on harder difficulties. So I'm gonna leave this game as is.\n- There's no free roam option (I don't think). It'd be great to roam maps, blow up buildings, and hey, what about a screenshots feature? I want to make helicopter selfies, but that's difficult to do.\n- Some map and mission design is poor. (By some, I mean one or two missions) I was getting bombarded by anti-aircraft equipment in one of the missions, I forgot which one, but I was running out of rockets to shoot and had to wait five seconds for it to fill up, because I had lock on rockets. (This was before I figured out what some icons meant).\n- The hud is confusing at times. I don't know why, but there are sometimes enemies and objectives marked with >>[  ]<< on the hud, and I assume that there is just a major threat to the objective or yourself. And I fly up to it. Oh look, a dude with an M4A1 firing puny bullets at my flying tank.\n- Not very many missions, and the story isn't exactly clear or interesting enough to follow. Firstly, the missions, I was disappointed to find out a game (£7.99) is about only four hours long. I would expect five if an extra £1.99 was added, but then there's other games, which are around £39.99. Grand Theft Auto V for example which I played on console. That game takes from 6-20+ hours. And I expect a good story and lots of interesting stuff for a game that expensive, but this isn't exactly worth the cash you pay, but I can give it a thumbs up for being a game related military infantry.\n- What's the deal with that tank mission? There was a mission where you controlled a tank because your helicopter got shot down, like... wtf? We were in helicopters. OH WAIT, OUR HELICOPTER TOOK YET ANOTHER TANK SHELL UPON ANOTHER 100. NOW WE'RE GOING DOWN! QUICK, DEPLOY THE BLOW UP TANK AND GET US OUT OF HERE!\n- Some bad optimisation is areas. (I found my framerate not dropping, but frames were stuttering)\n\nIt's a great game anyway. It's tough to find a game related to air vehicles that cause destruction and death.\n\n","October 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/232970/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I will recommend this game but with MUCH CAUTION. If you're looking for a helicopter combat simulator this isn't it. If you're looking for an action packed, things exploding and cowboy dialogue this is it. The extreme plus side to this is the game is relatively cheap on sale. Still though, I know a few people that would rather keep two bucks than spend it.\n\nThunder Wolves caught my eye as I used to play Urban Strike relentlessly on Sega Genesis. I came in hoping for a reboot and got something a little different. Is this difference bad or good? Depending on what you like will guide your decision. Thunder Wolves is a game in which you are given control of a helicopter and usually have to blow a lot of things up. There are extraction missions and escort missions but all involve over the top violence. There are cameo's in a sense where you get to control a sniper, a guided missile and even a tank. I should add here that the game is indeed LOCAL CO-OP! If you do end up playing two players, one player will be the gunner where another player. You each DO NOT get your own respective helicopter. This would have been awesome if it was the case.\n\nHaving the campaign add these little tweaks in where you have a different sense of control adds a bit of variables to the game regarding it's enjoyment. There is a point where even the devs realized that simply blowing everything up may get boring. The explosions themselves aren't bad. I wish there was a little bit more boom especially when unleashing loads of missile. There is enough destruction though to keep you hyper stimulated. At first, the player is given a single helicopter with not too many options to choose from. As you progress throughout the game, different skins and different helicopters will be available later on. You cannot customize exactly what weapons the helicopter will use. Instead, each helicopter will have a different set of skill. Some helicopters will have guided missiles and be able to launch about 10 missiles at one time whereas another helicopter may have rapid fire missiles and can call in an air strike. The controls themselves are probably the best feature of the game. Whether it's how the helicopter moves, how it reacts to inertia when it begins/stops movement or whether it's fairly easy to control makes it absolutely enjoyable.You definitely don't have to be a professional helicopter pilot to play this game. They've also added a boost feature which is extremely useful in tight situations or in traveling to another location on the map. Careful though, not all helicopters have the same boost ability. A counter ability feature on all helicopters (by pressing "X") will release flares to misguide homing missiles.\n\nAll helicopters have the basic ability of machine gun ("RT") while "RB" will handle most of the missile weapons. You can move your helicopter along the Z axis (meaning up and down) but you cannot control a hoist upon your discretion. It would have been cool to have complete control over this and maybe even pick up a few enemies to take them for a ride.\n\nThe visuals themselves can be boosted to max performance and do look like xbox 360 graphics. This is okay but the next gen feel is definitely not here (which is ok). To make up for this, there are a lot of explosive animations. The animation concerning the demolition of buildings is decent. I wish you could level them to the ground but you can't. At least you can do some damage! Which is also a little weird is that in one level where you drive a tank, the tank treads don't move. Weird eh? The sounds overall are okay and they tried varying the gun sounds as well as the explosions. They seem like they took their dialogue seriously as you'll have some good old 'Murican F-bombs dropping regularly. So if you don't like swearing, beware!\n\nOverall, this is AT BEST a decent game. For the price it's worth, I think it's a fair asking price (especially on sale)!\n\n\nRATING : 7.0/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nI was eventually allowed to take this crane down\n\nHelicopter blow up? Don't be afraid to ask for our special rates of $9.99/hour for our tanks\n\nHow's the view from up there\n\nEscort mission\n\nThis is pretty cool. I got to hoist a tank but in the midst of battle forgot to put him on the ground\n\nWanna land randomly somewhere\n\nNice screenshot with a submarine\n\nThere will be certain scenarios where you'll need to crash land. This is the control scheme\n\nPredator missile\n\nSniping portion featuring night vision\n\nWhat 2 player looks like\n\nI wish I had this many options in my life","February 12","true","2.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Good engaging storyline, variable gameplay with multiple weapon systems including several types of helos, a remote helo, C-130 gunner, helicopter sniper and missile guidance via camera view.  The dialogue is a bit goofy, but it works for what this game is:  a quick paced heli shooter flying game.  The player flies for a PMC (private military contractor).  Combined with the crazy shooting and dodging action, this makes this game stand out as you're not another military pilot with special privileges by virtue of being you.  The designers open up the opportunities with storyline, colorful characters and helicopter skins by putting the player as a flyer for a PMC.  I can't help but think of the movie Expendables when I think of this game.\nIf I can add two things for improvement:  game control and engaging characters.  I get that this is a fast pace arcade style game, but at the same time, it's a bit over the top with all the shooting/dodging, but yet very little aim is required.  I'm not saying this game should be a Jane's Longbow game.  You should however play this game to win, not win by merely playing.  While I flew all missions on normal, I died a grand total of one time.  While you also get to fly different helicopters, there's no different feel to it.  I can't see the advanatage of taking a Little Bird vs. a Blackhawk (though in the game, they are under different names).  While they have their different categories, I apparently can take a Blackhawk for a job better suited for an Apache.  Weapons on the helo are also the same, regardless of air frame.  The machine gun sounds and looks the same while the missiles the player launches are bright smoke trailing fire streaks.  I will say the flare graphics and game mechanics are nicely done.  Flares work and look cool in the game.\nSecond is the engaging characters idea.  While the players are colorful and comical, they aren't as engaging as the Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction Characters.  Players simply follow along with the characters as their dialogue helps put the details of the storyline together.  Perhaps if players had the ability to choose the pilots they fly with; they would have more of a vested interest to engage with these characters.\nBottom line, I do like this game and am happy with this purchase!  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this game a solid 7.","November 1, 2014","true","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The plot is quite good, some characters have a strong personality, the framerate is rock-solid (60 FPS), the gameplay is good, and it's freaking fun. I recommend this title if you're looking for a crazy arcade shooter, better if in sale (at full price is quite short). Let's see pro and cons.\n\nPRO:\n+ Arcade and frenetic action is really fun!\n+ Framerate is solid (60 FPS)\n+ Controller and Mouse/Keyboard input mode\n+ Local coop\n+ Achievements aren't very easy to get\n+ Quite good plot\n+ Metal music during destruction is awesome\n+ Some characters are well created\n+ The photography department did an awesome job! Locations are good!\n\nCONS:\n- In 3h or less you will finish the game\n- Graphics aren't awesome, animations neither\n- Sometimes airstrike doesn't shoot (very bad. it's hard to reload!)\n- All helicopters look the same, lack of customization\n- Except 4 big families, weapons are all the same (tiny difference)\n- I couldn't play it with my old laptop, it crashes after 5min (with my desktop is fine)\n- Repetitive: shoot, shoot, take an object, shoot, shoot, take and object, shoot, ...\n- AC-130, tank, machine guns, sniper, refuel, etc they all look near the same to use (even sniper looks like shooting missles!)\n- Do change some key bindings: change guns with q/e and increase/decrease the altitude with shift/ctrl (is much better!)\n\nI recommend this game only because I took it on sales, and because it's fun as hell! But don't take it on full price, with simulative or longevity expectations, or you will be disappointed.","January 25","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You get unlimited ammo and rockets, you can blow pretty much anything up in the world. Graphics are OK for the price you are paying, some tedious voice acting makes you wince and cringe at times but nothing which can't be ignored.\n\nControls are a little difficult to grasp to start, certainly not one to be played with a controller,   stick to your mouse and keyboards for this one. The added local co-op is a nice feature which more games should include wherever possible in my opinion.\n\nThe length is just about right for the story mode, however the plot is somewhat unbelievable.

(HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who is a fan of either of those games)\n\nFun Factor 8.3\nGameplay 7.9\nPerformance 8.4\nSound track 9.0\nSound quality 6.9\nControl (KB+M) 8.0\nGraphics 7.1\nAnimations 6.0\nReplay value 6.6\n\nThe Soundtrack is pretty awesome, some nice hard-rock from the 90s, mixed in with some metal. Although almost every track in the game is pretty good, it can get a little repetative. (I would love to get a copy of this soundtrack)\n\nDecent variety of choppers, and skins. (unlocks with progression)\nWeapon variety is pretty good, and some nice ones too.\n\nSome parts are a little too linear, but it was a nice refreshing play, and semi-scratched an itched that hasn't been tended to since the last Strike Series game.\nStory is ok, campaign is pretty good, has some nice missions, and some nice segments in them. There are also a few secrets to nab as well, (crates to grab, and a special guy {Pedroz} to kill on every level)\n\n(also there are some pop-culture, and historical referrences if you look around the levels)\n\nNot a long game, and local co-op is all but unplayable due to the mapping of the 360 controller being horrible off, and you can't do anything about it. (only real complaint) Hopefully the devs will release a patch.\n\nI will probably play through and get gold starts on Expert on all missions before uninstalling, but I really look forward to more games like this, or even a sequel!","August 20, 2013","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Over-the-top style takes the front seat and you'll find yourself mashing the trigger while flying in crazy circles and getting shot from every direction.\n\nIt's not a simulation game by any stretch of the imagination. You can get hit by dozens of tracking AA missiles and stay in the air. Each mission includes pumping rock and roll and dialogue consists mostly of the pilots exchanging witty quips. Each helicopter comes with three rocket varieties and different handling characteristics.

In my opinion the developer had a rocky start but is atleast trying to fix their games (As far as i've heared)\n\nBack to the game, this is a great Arcade shooter. It's a very linear tho, but packed full of action. The Music in the game is a bit monotonous and that can be quite easy to spot if you have an ear for music. Alot of small jokes and good personallity between the pilot and the gunner ingame.\n\nThe game plays out mainly as you being the pilot of the helicopter, you can jink left and right, go up/down and turn in any direction. Alot of invisible walls in the game forces you to move in one direction tho (as said before). Mostly you gun down everything you see but sometimes you even have to protect something or winch up some cargo just like in the good old days of Desert/Jungle Strikes games.\n\nThen we have the parts that play out like your everyday arcade shooter, where you take control of the nose/side gun of your helicopter and gun down everything you see while the AI pilots the helicopter.\n\nYour helicopter comes equiped with a Machine Gun, often sometype of unguided Rockets, Guided rockets and one special weapon (Controlable missile, Airstrike et.c.)\n\nCo-op is nothing to brag about tho. One player controls the helicopter and can use one machine gun as he pleases while the other player can use a controlable cursor and aim anywhere, firing the helicopters second machine gun and missiles. So in short, the Co-op experience just feels throwed in  the last minute.\n\nGame consist of 13 average to long missions and have alot of helicopters to choose from (Real helicopters, fake names). Some of the more popular Helicopters are the Eastern Hind and Havoc, or the Western Cobra, Apache, Blackhawk or Kiowa Warrior Helicopters.\n\nGreat gameplay, and i do recommend it full priced. If you find it on a sale (even better!) and want some good solid action then pick this one up.","November 26, 2013","true","4.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So I went into this game the same way I went into watching the movies "Taken" and "Edge of Darkness". I was thinking "Eh, looks like good mindless action. If nothing else I can watch stuff blow up for a little while".\nBut just like those movies, I was actually extremely surprised! Playing Thunder Wolves gives you the same feeling as watching "The Expendables" or playing the game "Broforce". Basically:\n\n"F**K YEAH! *EXPLOSION NOISES*"\n\nThunder Wolves is an arcadey helicopter action game, obviously. It's fairly tongue-in-cheek and doesn't take itself too seriously ("Hmm, a region of the world full of conflict starting with the word 'Middle'... I wonder where THAT could be??") As you swoop around, blowing up wave after wave of faceless, stereotypical enemies of freedom, you get point bonuses for chain kills and group kills. Messages like "IT'S ALL YOU BRO!" and "YOU A BADASS!" splash across the screen, all while heavy metal guitar solos play in the background. Good stress relief in Thunder Wolves!\nFrom watching gameplay, you'd think it's fairly repetitive. But you'd be wrong. You have a decent selection of different choppers to grind enemies with, with a fair variety in weaponry. Notice I use the terms "decent" and "fair". It's not off-the-wall or even above average, but it's not bad either. Adding to the variety are some unique segments. For example, there are parts where you snipe sentries from the side door of your chopper with a rifle and a segment where you actually get to gun for an AC-130 Gunship. In fact, at one point in the campaign, you are actually shot down, and you have to hold off enemies with the door gun until rescue arrives. So the variety in each level comes as a pleasant surprise!\nOverall, at it's absolute worse, it's you blowing stuff up to heavy metal. Who doesn't like that?","April 28, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Thunder Wolves seems like a modern take on those games which brings modern graphics and an updated video game engine to the table.  The POV is a bit more zoomed in than I remember but still a nice tip of the hat to them old EA games.\n\nEssentially you're flying a helicopter around rescuing people and accomplishing tasks... all while blowing up enemies and oposing defenses.  Movement and control was fine once I stopped using a gamepad and went to the WSAD keyboard control.  The gamepad options don't allow for your own configuration.  It only has preset gamepad configurations to choose from and I couldn't get used to any of them.  Once I went to WSAD, I played with no issues and is actually more comfortable than you'd think.\n\nThis is a fun game if you like strafing over the landscape blowing everything up along the way (which I do).

This title is easy to pick up and delivers its action in quick, high explosive bursts filled with cheesy dialogue worthy of a goofy grin. Like an Arnie movie, it's best to enter this theatre expecting action and fun instead of a good story. Some nice variation in chopper choice, though this is limited depending on the mission: helicopters seem to be divided into Assault, Supply and Recon, with each mission choosing only one category.\n\nIf you have this, then you likely picked it up in a bundle. If so, it's worth the download. Otherwise, definitely grab it on the cheap if you're interested in some mindless arcade action.\n\nI have been playing this with an X360 controller (which the control scheme appears optimised for), so take this with a pinch of salt if using a keyboard and mouse.","December 21, 2013","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you identify with that, then there are aspects of Thunder Wolves that are pleasing for those who aren’t looking for a complex time and just want to cause a mess. Unlike all those memorable classic 80s flicks, though, Thunder Wolves is a game that doesn’t have enough charm to be a worthwhile return and will be forgotten from memory in the near future. It’s the summer blockbuster movie of the arcade-shooter world, then – a short but mildly enjoyable piece of entertainment, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing to be.","December 26, 2013","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What a great way to unwind from a crap day and take out all your anger flying around and blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything in sight. With the killer hardcore metal soundtrack pumping while you blow the fk out of everything that moves, you cannot go wrong. Well you could, but they made a great game here so get ready to head bang and pound bad guys up the ♥♥♥ with rockets. Good graphics and effects, surprisingly solid controls (WASD move LMB/RMB fire) although changing your missle type with mouse wheel does not work very well which is dumb but thankfully you can also press the 2 key to change. Cool chopper types, cool rocket types which is different with each chopper, and is a decent challenge on normal and especially hard mode. It starts you on casual mode which is too easy so be sure to switch it to at least normal. The game is pretty linear, no real opportunity to fly around as you wish, but what is cool is that on missions even after you kill a target in an area you can stay and mop up all the rest of the guys. You get to go into different modes too just like stuff from when you fly attack planes in Call of Duty games: black and white vision attack mode, night vision sniping from inside the chopper, and a few times manning the machinegun on the chopper in rail flight mode. Its downfall is that it is too short, around 4 hours from what I've read, which totally sucks. But hey, if you catch it on sale like I did for $2, then you are getting your money's worth and then some.\n\nOverall if you like action games I see no reason why anyone would not want to enjoy this game. Thankfully it was done right in the spirit of the old SNES game that (I think) it is a rehash of. It has plenty of cool guy bravado and a killer hard core metal soundtrack pumping while you fk sht up all over the place, 8/10.","May 26, 2014","true","3.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Extreme Cursing for no reason. I mean its really over the top and not nessesary. The controls are ok but the flying from the 3rd person perspective thats not straight on makes navigating a bit off and when it puts you flying through caves ( the game says were flying through a dungeon!)  it throws the flying difficulty in your face ( and curses you while doing it) . The aiming was tough at first and then i realized it had a auto aim that works well for the many land targets. It will lock on the flying ones but often your bullets fly by as it locks on where the target is and when you fire the bullets are slower than the target so you have to lead flying targets. The forgivable Damage model means all that ramming into walls (in the caves) and enemy fire wont knock you out of the sky too much. With all this negativity whats the final virdict? Is it fun? Well yeah its fun, if you can look past the cursing and get used to flying from a 5 oclock side position this game seems to be fun. I do wish the recommend system in Steam was a little broader and offered a 10 pt system  or something.... Im going to give it a 7 and not recommend it because the language alone its out of context and over the top the controls and viewpoint I can get over .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/recommended/232970/","atebash","Atebash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/","1019 products in account","This game is such a perfect stress reliever! It offers hours of endless destruction without limits and is a lot of fun along the way. Flying around in a helicopter, armed to teeth with endless missiles and overheat-free cannon... priceless!\n\nThunder Wolves is simply being what it is - a brainless action flick that never gets boring. There are 12 missions + tutorial and they are all unique in its own way. Yes, you fly a helicopter and shoot at hundreds of enemy soldiers, structures, vehicles, aircraft, cannons, ships... but every mission offers something new. In one of them you get to fly a drone inside a cave. In the other you are shot down and have to escape in a tank. Later in the game you are carrying an armored vehicle and need to drop it on a beach for a D-day-like encounter. One mission makes you cover a field agent while he infiltrates a moving train. Some missions feature a gunner mode where you no longer fly the chopper but control the machine gun (LucasArts' old game Rebel Assault comes to my mind as reference for this). I am really really happy with the game makers' effort to keep this game fun throughout all of its missions and I think they did a great job at it. And when you add some hard rock tunes, adult language in communication between the pilots, lots and lots and lots of explosions... And that's what it's really about, isn't it? Thunder Wolves simply never gets to be boring. Not even when you replay the missions to get a better score and get more stars (these serve only for achievements on Steam).\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels but neither is too hard, not even for a casual gamer. That's my only objection to the game, I just wish there was another difficulty level to lift the challenge bar high up and made it nearly impossible to complete. There's a lovely co-op mode that is really fun to play with a friend, but it simply screams for more challenge.\n\nThe game has a total of 20 achievements on Steam: about 5 of them are easy to get and you will achieve them as you progress, while some require some effort. There's this guy named Pedro who hides on each level and if you find and kill him on all 13 - you get an achievement. There are also 25 hidden crates throughout the game and if you find them - you get an achievement. Other achievements are about collecting all stars on all levels and all difficulty levels, ramming 10 enemy vehicles, killing a miniboss by crashing into it etc. Overall, achievements are okay and will not ask you to do the impossible.\n\nWhat else to say... I really enjoyed playing through Thunder Wolves. It took me about 12 hours to complete the game and get all the achievements and I had a lot of fun with it. With the current Steam summer sale, the price is down to under 4 Euros/USD and it's well worth the money. Have fun with this little jewel!","June 27, 2014","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are awesome, it's a pure pleasure to watch how buildings are collapsing from the rocket fire (Havok Engine in works :)) Though the animation of humans is bad, IMO it's a good thing, because then we would be doing mass murder on every level, and right now it feels like we're in firing range, shooting some paper targets. You can choose different helicopters for each mission, and you can play it in co-op on the same computer, which is rare thing on PC this days. The controls are very easy even on a keyboard. The only thing that really bad here is voicing - though it's clear, that developers didn't push themselves hard for the script or dialogs.\n\nIf you want to spend your free time with fun and pleasure, then turn it on "casual" difficulty and enjoy. If you want some challenge, on "expert" difficulty this game will make you sweat. The game is cheap and worth it's price, but if you see it on sale, you should grab it without thinking.","July 14, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not going to win any awards for dialogue or story, but it compensates with some good action, infinite ammo, and a lot of stuff to blow up.\n\nThe controllers are fairly simple and straight forward. The voice acting was decent and the dialogue had me laughing quite a bit, and reminding me of some of the 80s action movies I used to watch back in the day. Also, raining death from above and having the ability to destroy pretty much anything man made actually made me forget a few times to follow the mission objectives. Parts where you switch to the machine gun and sniper rifle were also well as well.\n\nPerhaps my only complaint with this game was the missiles being a little good at tracking you even after you drop flares. The sniping sections were also a little tricky to aim, but they give you a big enough hit box as to make it forgiving.\n\nOverall, I definetely would recommend this game. If you like flying choppers, cheesy old action movies, and raining death and destruction, this one is for you.\n\n","September 25, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Enjoy :)\nThunder Wolves is one of those games that every casual player should play. It's full of action, humour and of course explosions!\n\nThunder Wolves is developed by Most Wanted Entertainment and originally published by bitComposer Games but now published by Nordic Games, even though the game's opening starts with the original publisher's logo. What a confusing world of publishers we live in...\n\nThunder Wolves is a sort of top down 3D action shooter game where the game's missions are split up into 13 missions each with they're own set of difficulties which are; Casual, Normal and Hard. The Casual difficulty is the easiest mode from the whole\n\nYou control a helicopter where you can move in 360 via the WASD keys, simple enough. You shoot with the LMB and fire missiles with the RMB and you shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of enemies. The story is pretty simple, the game takes place in the Middle East in 1991 and some flashbacks to Central Asia from the 1980's\n\nThe graphics aren't the best, you won't see people in this game. The very few people you see they look like from the early days on PC gaming, the graphics in the environment aren't bad but the close ups look a bit bad, but it didn't really bother me. Some animations are pretty poor but not that bad\n\nThe voice acting at first may be bad to some people but the voice acting is deliberatly set for the 90's cheesy style of voice acting. The length of the game is ridiculously short, clocking in at around 2-3 hours just playing in normal difficulty! So overall if you played all the difficulties with the same missions it would clock in at around 8-9 hours, not the best. The game does also offer Local Co-op, but I have no friends...\n\nOverall, Thunder Wolves is a fun game to play and it is a fun game for casual players who would like to play a short game for the reasonably pricing. Thunder Wolves is one hell of a ride!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","April 9","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

May contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and/or strong language.\nMature\nBlood, Strong Language, Violence\n\neh... i make mindfull as a movies, ios and android games.

Not to the point where I need devices to assist my daily functions old; but I am old to the point where I listen to music that people born in the ’90s can’t seem to easily identify. This means that I played a lot of video games that would fall under similar circumstances. NES, Genesis, and Super Nintendo were definitely the main sources of my entertainment in my developmental years, and I still take the time to indulge them. This is particularly true of my Genesis which gets a month tour of duty thanks to a couple of great games that I never seem to grow tired of, no matter how old I get. Those two games are Jungle Strike, and Desert Strike. Suffice to say, Thunder Wolves grabbed my attention from the moment I caught wind of its existence via Steam, if only because of its similarity to those two games.\n\nThunder Wolves is fairly straight forward, and doesn’t pull any punches. You pilot a helicopter and you will be blowing lots of things up. From the outset, things are pretty sharp. The controls feel tight, responsive, and are plenty easy to learn; and the game itself is sharp looking, with a great art style, and powerful little engine. Much like most retro titles, Thunder Wolves is built around completing levels at different difficulties. While there is no reward beyond an in game accolade, and a placing on an online leader board, it is still pretty cool to see old gameplay mechanics like this. In this way you can see that the meat of the game isn’t in revolutionizing anything, it is just going to try to deliver it’s experience better than others. In that regard the game completely succeeds, and sometimes this is in spite of itself.\n\nThe levels themselves are superbly designed for the most part. You will be given a clear objective, and oftentimes be given a specific amount of time to complete it. The levels allow for smooth navigation to these markers, and give you a decent sense of verticality to be able to take accurate stock of any situation. Decent being the operative word here though; the vertical ceiling seems to vary from level to level, and isn’t always as high as one would think. There gets a point when you would want to just get a few feet higher, and find that you’re unable to because of a level ceiling. This may seem like minutia, but it does become something that undermines the experience at certain points. Especially in tight dogfights with other helicopters where you could benefit from zipping over them, and the spinning around to dish out death.\n\nThe complaints of height limits aside, the other elements of the levels are all in place, and work to tremendous effect. You have a bevy of helicopters that will unlock as you continue to complete levels; and each helicopter has their own unique weapons and capability. Destructible environments, and a range of enemy infantry types, and vehicles all keep you on your toes and changing up your tactics. Dealing with certain land vehicles will obviously be a different experience than taking on an enemy chopper in the sky, and it is nice to see the game reflect that in the different strategies that you will consistently need to employ to deal with all of them.\n\nIn fact the game does a remarkable job of handling in-game monotony in a general way. While Thunder Wolves could probably get away with being a one trick shoot ’em up, and not wear out its welcome, it isn’t content with that. So the game will have you performing escort missions, defense missions, straight out attacks, and quite a few surprisingly good on-rails sequences. Thunder Wolves addresses the problem of gameplay fatigue in a way that a lot of larger developers completely miss, in a way that frankly surprised and blew me away. Of particular note is a sitting turret sequence that takes place inside your crashed chopper, where you’re using one of the side guns as a mounted turret. That type of creativity within the context and framework of the game is pretty smart and agile.\n\n\nThunder Wolves is a game that knows what it wants to be, and cuts through any of the other filler to give an experience that is as pure as possible. Plenty of games miss this, like missing the forest for the trees. Solid mechanics with superb delivery will always produce a quality game, no matter the scale or the budget. By focusing on what makes flying a helicopter fun, and making that a varied and rich experience, the crew behind Thunder Wolves have not only created a great game, but a great blueprint for other developers to follow when they think about working on their own helicopter projects. Just please, fix the vertical ceiling and ditch the cheesy nu-metal soundtrack.\n\nVersion Reviewed: PC","March 12","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
