A game that will make you question who you are and what you are playing. There aren't many games that can actually stimulate all parts of the brain while playing but this one get's as close as possible. Focus hard enough and you will be able to feel the colors and taste the soundtrack!","December 5, 2014","true","0.4"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","24","40","0","0"

Like the flame to a moth, that's what drove me to it. However, what lies deeper is equally as beautiful: a thought provoking plot centered around existentialism and how it relates to other forms of philosophy and the various arts and humanities. Both its narrative and its audiovisuals are bastions of and for creativity.","June 12, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I think people who don't don't feel questioning exsistence should be left to philosiphers and not gamers. Maybe that's the case, maybe not. The point is...if you enjoy cool looking game design, good music, and just a little bit of pointless questioning of reality...check this game out.\n\nGraphics 5/5\nGameplay 3/5\nMusic 4/5\nAnd u can invert the y axis (some games really wont let you do that....can you believe it?) For $10 ULTRAWORLD is worth checking out.","May 10","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It asks questions no other game would.   I highly recommend experiencing it.   It's Ultraworld.

But this is really just a massive letdown, from the screenshots it looks so nice and colourful but its just dull and boring. It has a bad UI, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking menus, a boring story, and boring gameplay.","February 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

It doesn't have very good performance, you can't even jump, you spend your time looking around areas for triangles, which of course become harder to find as there are fewer, and the story seems very pretentious.\n\nThe soundtrack is in my opinion very good, and some of the visuals are nice, but, it's just not worth it.","December 19, 2014","false","0.5"," 18 of 39 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","18","39","2","0"

Along the lines of Dear Esther or Proteus, except with an active narrative as opposed to a passive one.  And therein lies the crux of the issue at hand with the review of this game.  The story literally is why you'd want to play this game.  If I spoil it, I am literally taking your enjoyment of the game away from you.\n\nSo please forgive me if I am a bit vague, I'm merely trying my best to not spoil things.\n\nVisually speaking, ULTRAWORLD is top-notch and what probably got your attention to begin with.  Which is important for multiple reasons hint, cough..  Colorful, vibrant, eye-pleasing. Yet, there is only so much to do in ULTRAWORLD.  There is no action.  No combat.\n\nThere is mystery.  And it is intruging.  But if you are hoping for puzzles like Myst, you won't find them here.  ULTRAWORLD is like a linear 3D Visual Novel.\n\nIf this sounds good to you, I'm quite sure you'll enjoy your time.  Once I got myself in that mindset, I enjoyed it as well.","December 5, 2014","true","1.1"," 22 of 48 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","22","48","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KilyariAzure/recommended/331580/","KilyariAzure","Kilyari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KilyariAzure/","271 products in account","The textbook example of a pretentious indie project, an "interactive adventure" (I can't call it a game, my mind just won't let me) on par with stellar projects like "Gone Home" and "Walking simulator 983: Now with social commentary."\n\nCliche'd questions, cliche'd dillemas.\nThe game tries really hard to appear deep, but there is no suspense of disbelief big enough to keep this thing going.\n"Hurf durf I'm totally an AI who made a game as soon as I became self aware, now help me solve some existential questions."\n\nThe visuals looked good at first, but everything's so movie-grain saturated, so filled with glare and bloom then my eyes cannot stand looking at it without tearing up.\n\nThe OST is an assortment of electronic blurbs and weak attempts to pander to the TRON atmosphere, I suppose. Done quite poorly.\n\nZero gameplay whatsoever.\nGo from point A to point B, listen to a boring siloloquy which is supposed to stir some sort of questions in the mind of the player, proceed onwards.\nThe problem is - for people who have no interest in this kind of things, the game will seem boring due to lack of interactivity. For people who know even a tiniest bit about AIs from mass media the game will seem boring, since it's exploiting the same tropes that premate all the blockbusters about robots these days. The only audience who can probably appreciate it are hipsters, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ screw those people.\n\nTo sum it up,\nIf I wanted to be educated about AIs and their problems, I'd much rather read Azimov than play this.\n","December 7, 2014","false","0.9"," 33 of 96 people (34%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","34","33","96","2","0"
