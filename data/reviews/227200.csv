Waking Mars is a game about life and growth, not death and destruction.\n\nInstead of some space soldier, you play as an astrobiologist on a quest of knowledge and discovery. Along the way the game gives some educational facts about Earth and Mars as well as insight on possible interactions within an ecosystems.\n\nSo if you desire games that are about growth or exploration, this contains both and should be on your wishlist or cart.","August 29, 2013","true","15.9"," 72 of 74 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","72","74","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saere/recommended/227200/","saere","Saere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saere/","465 products in account","Platform games aren't at the top of my list - mainly because of their limited world, low replayability and (many of them) being highly linear - however, Waking Mars is one of the most enjoyable games I've been playing lately, and for me, one of the best platform games to date. Its sci-fi/ Mars setting and artwork caught my attention; but it was the goal of creating and encouraging an ecosystem within the Red Planet that sold me on it.\n\nThe story is simple and straightforward, but it is intelligently executed and really intriguing. Character development is little, but just right. There are no enemies, only yourself, the 'flauna' and the environment -  but you might be surprised at just how much of a threat you can pose to yourself. The goals are laid out before you in a no-nonsense manner: you are exploring, searching, gathering, manipulating, creating, and de-constructing to create, in a more favourable way to the environment's (and your) needs. There is something to be said for balance, and you learn by trial and error; but don't worry, there is nothing that you can't undo - though it may require a measure of patience.\n\nThe game mechanics are superbly fluid - the game runs without a hitch (it's enough for me to say that if I can run this on my present setup, anyone can - trust me). The time, work and research that went into this game is incredible. Overall gameplay is relaxing with adequate moments of doubt, constant wonder and dashes of uncertainty. It is a wonder to me that I do feel a sense of real isolation while playing - I think this is thanks to the beauty of the graphical style and the great music - but this is exactly what I would expect, it's the lonely and mysterious Red Planet, after all. The time it will take you to complete this game? It depends on you. I completed it at the listed time played.\n\nOne of the best features of this game for me was the ability to revisit any area at any time without limit. This alone makes this platformer just so non-linear. As well as being vital - you will have to travel around to resupply your seeds, revisit some areas dependant on other areas' progress, or just to re-balance an area if need be - it is a real treat to be able to return and see how the caverns have been thriving (or not) in your absence.\n\nIMPORTANT: If non-stop action, mayhem and destruction - i.e. death-n-glory - are your bread-and-butter, you will fast become bored with Waking Mars. BUT...\n\n...If you enjoy platform games, I believe this is a must for your collection and many will undoubtedly enjoy it. If you are a wary platformer like me, it may blow you away and you won't regret this purchase (reg. price is reasonable; on sale price, you'd be crazy not to try it).\n\nHappily jet-packing (and occasionally bouncing) around in the ever-deepening caverns of Mars to re-awaken it... 11/10","October 31, 2014","true","18.2"," 67 of 68 people (99%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","99","67","68","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/recommended/227200/","ichikumer","ichik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/","1268 products in account","Hard science fiction is a rare guest in video games. Not having any evil aliens or cool laser-shooting guns isn’t a good premise for dynamic action. Luckily, Waking Mars isn’t actually aiming at cheap thrills or fast-paced shooting, but rather prefers to be a meditative journey and succeeds at it.\nThe year is 2093, player takes the role of Liang, chinese astronaut, taking part in international planetary mission to Mars, studying life that was discovered in an underground cavern system. If the thought of some green evil aliens pointing their death-ray guns had crossed your mind at this point, shoo it away. Or maybe you’ve thought of some ancient ruins, secure vaults,containing secrets of advanced precursors? You’re wrong again. Life that has been discovered is rather primitive. It is a strange kind of hybrid between plants and animals. It’s called Zoa. Not much is known about these species; you will be the first and only human to make contact with it and observe it in its natural habitat.\nAnd that is the game: travelling and observing, filling built in-game encyclopedia with articles describing behaviour and features of all types of these “plants”. Yes, there’s actually quite a lot of them. Some stay in place, some move around; some feel good on regular soil, some require acidic loam for growing. There are even those whose spores are exploding, killing all other Zoa around. There you have it, this is as much brutality as you can get in Waking Mars. While this is not the first video game declining use of violence as the main plot progression device and problem solver, not even the first among metroidvanias, it’s still an admirable feat. You wander around the caves, first on foot, later using jetpack, unveiling the beauty of an enclosed ecosystem, where various types of Zoa form a perfect cycle of life and death.\nMost common obstacles on the player’s path are Cerebranes, gigantic membranes covering passages between caverns. In order to open them you’ll have to increase biomass. Picking up spores and placing them on fertile ground sounds easy enough, and it actually is… at the beginning. Increasing variety of species requires careful planning to achieve that sweet spot when that number is finally high enough. You’ll have to make everything work together with maximum “profit”. At its heart the game is nearly a city-builder where you connect houses with roads, provide appliances, keeping in mind the energy, waste and communications. Being a space “gardener” is a rather soothing process if you let it be so. This game doesn’t like those who are in a hurry, who can tip off balance so easily and want some obvious solutions. Eventually they will stumble upon a cave, where just picking up seeds and placing them on all the green spots won’t be enough. I can’t really say that Waking Mars requires out-of-the-box thinking, it’s not actually that hard, but there is space for creativity here. You can try different solutions, experiment with Zoa proportions.\nThe pace of the game is emphasized with main hero’s loneliness. Not in some metaphorical way, but in actual one. Liang is the only human here. His colleague Amani safely stays on the base and contacts him on the radio. This distant voice coming somewhere from above is as much company as you can get here. If you don’t count OCTO, mission’s AI, of course. It’s sci-fi after all. Dialogues being rare are wonderfully written, perfectly voiced and are presented in the right amount, are enough to keep the player’s head in the story progression, but not ruining that desolation mood.\nDistinctive art-style inspired by 60s and 70s illustrations of popular science magazines glues all of that together, making this truly unique. This is a niché game, sure. But it stands out even among other metroidvanias. Being slow-paced and reflective it never becomes boring. It has that long-lost sense of intergalactic adventure and discovery, which we lost decades ago, surrendering it to Lucas’ space fantasy. Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against that. And shooting can be fun too. But can we have more games like Waking Mars as well, please?","May 24, 2014","true","13.5"," 63 of 69 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","63","69","0","6"

But this game was compelling enough for me to keep going and actually get it 100% completed. I'll admit that it got a little frustrating / confusing towards the end and I ended up resorting to some outside guidance through steam discussions in order to figure out my next move, but I'm sure I could have eventually figured it out on my own if I had that kind of patience. The 3 endings for the game (not including the optional pre-mature exiting the cave ending) really helped keep me interested in re-loading the game to see the other endings, and of course, the other endings kept getting better and better. The voice acting was a bit weird in places though. Like the 3rd ending where he goes up into space, her reaction was a little anti-climactic and didn't really feel like a realistic reaction. As far as the guidance goes... the game really tries to help you out throughout the entire game, it even gives you an interface of details for each species in the game which helps a lot, unfortunately, if you forget something task related, or make a big mistake (namely the explosive seeds when you first get them and ending related areas)... it's possible to end up being stuck in the game with no clue how to progress further since you can't get the cutscenes / dialogs to repeat, so make sure to read and listen very well the first time.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game.

Really.  And it is quite good.\n\nBasically, life has been discovered on Mars.  You are one of the astronauts who has been sent to explore said life on Mars.  You make first contact with them and discover that they are these plant-like lifeforms, that produce seeds, which you can use to plant more of them.  There are also, conveniently, barriers that open when you have enough of them growing.\n\nThat last bit might seem like a convenient gameplay mechanic, but it actually ties into the story.  Yes, a surprisingly intriguing story follows from all this.  The whole game took me about 11 hours to complete, and I can vouch that the story is interesting.\n\nThe game is an exploration-heavy metroidvania, consisting of interconnected areas to explore and grow things in.  There is a certain depth of strategy to how to grow things, since different things have different biomass values, and you need to exceed a certain biomass value to proceed, or to unlock other features.  Also, you can pick up some seeds, but not others, and not all terrain is suited for planting all things.  And then there are more complex mysteries that lie deeper within...\n\nYour exploration is punctuated by your contact with your fellow crew members -- one person back at base, and one AI who is a little annoying (and the other characters lampshade this).  These characters are okay -- if anything, their voice acting is better than their actual scripts, which are a little redundant.  That said, the characters are (needless to say) part of the plot.  And there are even multiple endings.\n\nIn fact, you could actually make this game more like a silent-protagonist Metroid-like game with a strong element of the player learning game mechanics without being told -- I mean, heck, that's basically what happens anyway, except for the "I wonder how you might be able to do such-and-such" that the characters sometimes say.  I strongly recommend this if this game ever gets remade.\n\nAside from the somewhat chatty NPCs and the occasionally irritating physics (the player-character insists on taking a moment to get his footing very often), this is an excellent game, so I definitely recommend it.\n\n(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Humble Bundle with Android 6.)","April 5, 2015","true","13.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","0"

However, it is not really terraforming, like making habitable to human life, no, it's about "waking" the planet!\n\nSo what it is about, then? Basically, it's a puzzle game, with explorational elements, as you go through the caverns of deep and sometimes you have branching paths; though you can return to take the other way any time. There's a story to the game and while it is simple, it is just what it needs: A set of mysteries to make you want to explore the cavern.\n\nAs for the puzzle elements, that's the best part: Basically, in each chamber, you have to reach a certain level of biomass. How you do that? By planting strange animal-plants called the Zoa. Different zoa have different seeds, some just reproduce, other seeds produce water or explode. Some zoa can move and depend on seeds to reproduce. Then there are zoa that eat the moving ones. What your task is in this game basically is to kickstart a whole ecosystem! Every lifeform in the game effects the other in some way or other, making you soon create a whole jungle full of life, each depending on each other to survive and reproduce. It is just brilliant!\n\nThe only two downsides I can think of, first, the artstyle, which is really not the best, the animations are quite choppy (especially on the moving zoas), and while it certainly got its own charm, I did not find it that appealing. My other problem with the game is that maybe I would have loved if there would have been maybe a little more variaties of lifeforms with a more varied roles and dependencies. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's really like a bunch of them, but I would have liked more. Maybe because I just wanted the game to last even longer. :P\n\nDefinitely a buy for those who like 2D exploration and puzzle games.","March 11, 2014","true","13.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Maybe gaming skill or perhaps something more basic like keeping player engaged. You go through the process of planting seeds, deciding which plants to grow--which you are scored per area based on your choices--exploring, and collecting seeds. It's slow moving, and collecting seeds can be time consuming--even warping back to old areas, just to collect seeds for new areas, sometimes more than once per area.\n\nWatching plants through their animations can be slow growing.

The controls are far from ideal, with keyboard and mouse suffering being too imprecise, and controller support feeling tacked on do to a lack of full implementation. There are also times when the game just doesn't give you enough direction, instead forcing you to wander around until you stumble upon a path to the next area.\n\nIn the end though Waking Mars is an absolute triumph despite its flaws. The presentation is superb, and I couldn't help getting sucked into the game for hours at a time. It definitely isn't for everyone, but those that let it sink its roots into them will find an experience unlike anything else, and a world simply begging to be explored.","June 26, 2013","true","8.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","5"

Brought to Steam Greenlight and voted by the community to be sold on steam. And the community was very right in this one.\n\nThis game is much more an exploration adventure as it is a platformer, the story is dragging you in and there is allways something new to discover or to try out. Your exploration and experimentation gets rewarded. It starts of slow but gets more complex the deeper you go, unveiling the mysteries of Mars on the way.\n\nI do like the characters in the game, for some reason i can really identify with the main character, and the voice of the woman is just adorable.\n\nThe main theme of the game is building ecosystems in caves. Thats what you do to generate biomass to advance in the story... Sounds dry, yes. But belive me its interresting and fun when you get involved.\n\nYou also can mess it up. This game has the possibility of making and breaking the biosystems that you manage and build. Too many games have the possibility of failing completly eradicated, and thats not a good thing.\n\nThe graphical style... alot of pepole seem to dislike it. For me, it simply works. And its unique and gives the game its own charme. Also, because of this it will be remembered, even in some years from now. I prefer that than cutting edge graphics with zero gameplay.\n\nNow go and buy this gem of a game and play it, its worth your time and money!","January 14, 2013","true","15.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

It's a puzzle game based on manipulating an alien ecosystem.  Sometimes you need to find a way to get the plants to reproduce.  Sometimes you need to plant a particular combination of plants.  Sometimes you need to do something in particular with the plants (e.g. herd a mobile plant into a carnivorous plant).\n\nIf you die you will lose your progress since you entered the room.  If you keep at it you will eventually succeed.\n\nThe depiction of science is pretty accurate.  You will need to pay attention to what happens around you, read research, and experiment.  You will frequently learn things by accident.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the game is mildly grindy in places.  Sometimes raising the biomass in a room sufficiently takes doing something repeatedly, for 10 to 15 minutes, rather than just figuring out what to do.  The key to minimizing the frustration with these rooms is usually feeding seeds to the mobile plants while standing next to a plant that produces seeds.  Each time a seed is eaten the seed-producing plant will release another, so this makes the process pretty fast.\n","November 4, 2014","true","12.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

It feels awesome exploring the caverns, identifying new species and figuring out what their weaknesses, diets and method of reporduction are. The drawn and animated species in the game look really awesome, and species from the same group have distinct visuals so you can tell they are related. Also, I didnt expect a game like this to have a story but it actually has quite a nice interesting one, and some of the artwork in the game is lovely.  It does, sadly get a little bit repetitive as when not discovering new species you are simply planting old ones in an attempt to beef up the biomass meter, to progress into the next area. Adding to that, due to the fact that the game is set on mars, everything looks fairly similar, red, orange and barren. While this is nice at first it starts to get a little boring, as you descend deeper into the caves it would be nice to see some different areas. Coming back to this review, I will admit I have completely lost the will to continue playing this game, it becomes very boring and repetitive over the course of the game.\n\nPositive\n+ Lifeforms\n+ The story\n\nNegative\n- Repetitive\n- Lack of Diversity for Landscape\n\nConclusionWaking Mars has an interesting start, and is very interesting to begin with but while I love the art style and models for the lifeforms on mars, I generally would not recommend this game.","January 24, 2015","false","1.9"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

The artwork is really original, the controls are fluid and atisfying, the gameplay is intuitive with some quirky dialogue thrown in and there's a lovely sub-section of research information to read and learn about this bizarre planet we thought we knew so well.\n\nWaking Mars has a deep (you're traversing through caves) exploration asepct to it, there's no combat from what I've experinced so far, there's a lot of planting seeds and throwing stuff at random objects, and watching things grow and collecting water droplets and avoiding some weird acidic droplets or long protruding arm thingies that hurt. It looks very simple, it even plays very simply but it is still challenging enough, but not to the point where you need to stop and collect your thoughts, it's the type of game where you just keep going and eventually you (usually by accident) figure out where you're going and what you're doing.\n\nThe soundtrack is blissful, as I mentioned above, the artwork is glorious to look at and I find myself taking many screenies because every cave has its own distinct beauty that I want to capture.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpmrx/recommended/227200/","dpmrx","Viishnahn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpmrx/","159 products in account","Waking Mars is revolutionary. If I had to give it a genre, I would call it a Dynamic Puzzle Exploration Game. It is a 2D Platformer game with a very user-friendly item management system. It has definite influences from classic Nintendo games, combining the elements of exploration, isolation and atmosphere of Metroid with growing plants and food/nutrient management of Pikmin. Anyone who enjoys either of these should take a look at this game. Anyone who likes both (like myself) will probably sit down and play the entire game in one sitting. It is a rather short game, lasting anywhere from 5-12 hours, depending on how thorough you want to be. The 17 Steam Achievements are all very easy to get on your first playthrough if you give it effort.\n\nSYNOPSIS: The basic premise of the game is this: you are an astronaut exploring a recently-discovered cave system on Mars. The only other characters are the Mars HQ woman and your environmental suit AI.\n\nZOA: As you enter the cave system, you discover living plant-like creatures, termed "Zoa" by your AI. These Zoa grow from different types of seeds planted in patches of fertile soil within the caves. You can carry a number of each type of seed at a time, saving them for later use.\n\nRESEARCH: As you interact with the environment, your AI develops a research log. Once you have discovered all of the elements of a certain subject, you unlock a Steam achievement for that subject. Some of the elements are fairly straight-forward; others will take some serious thinking or random luck.\n\nBIOMASS: Each Zoa in a chamber contributes to a Biomass counter. Once different levels of Biomass are reached, certain events occur. Some include barriers opening to new parts of the map, certain Zoa waking out of dormancy, etc.\n\nSOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack is very ambient in nature and has an organic feel to it. It completes the atmospheric sense that the game presents well and does not distract from the action whatsoever.\n\nART: This game does not have your run-of-the-mill shooter 3D render graphics, as it is only a platformer. That doesn't mean that it has the pixelated style that has been popularized of late. Waking Mars has beautifully drawn background layers that fade in and out, giving the illusion of real depth. The art team did an impressive job with very original plant-form creature design. It is a bit on the minimalist side and gives a very realistic, tangible feel to alien Mars.\n\nCONS: The only real downside to this game is the protagonist's personality. The AI is bright, happy and humorous. The HQ woman is funny at moments and believable the rest of the time. The main character is cold and sounds like he's talking in a combination of dictionary-speak and Medieval English. It is very awkward compared to the natural characters he talks to. This only really gets on your nerves during cutscenes, which you can skip (right mouse button).\n\nI picked this game up on sale, but after playing it I'd say it's definitely worth the inexpensive standard price.\n\nFinal Score: 10/10","December 28, 2014","true","9.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's concept is unique and really stands out from other gaming experiences. Simply put, the gameplay consists in gardening, which may sound like one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulators at first, but it's so much more than that. For each plant you grow, you increase Mars's biomass (at least the cavern's) and you are truly "waking up" the planet from a life that existed a long time ago. The art and the soundtrack are also pleasant aspects of Waking Mars. If this has not convinced you yet, consider this: you are on Mars. You are an astronaut. You maneuver the character using a jetpack that's more fluid than AC Unity's controls. You wake up Mars on search of intelligent alien life. This title is worth more than your time and it's truly an original experience. On another hand the achievement hunting is not really a challenge to the player, but that's up to you if that's a pro or a con.

So I bought it hoping it would be something good and fun. And it was a correct choice, let me tell you why. The game is based on platormer gameplay where you fly around with a jet pack, you pick up various seeds and then plant organisms. These are different and there is actually a layer of research of these lifeforms which was quite interesting. Main point of almost each level is to gain most (or maximum) biomass in order to progress further. You do this while trying to balance the environment because all the different ogranisms want to kill each other. It was fun but did get very tedious and repetitive in some levels. Overall the visuals and art style are simple but pretty. You can see this looks like a flash game and it is also visible that this is a mobile game.

You can fly, so there's no platforming element whatsoever). As you explore you'll encounter a number of different plant-like creatures, each with its own behaviors and method of reproduction. You have to figure out how each plant works on your own; there's not a lot of direct explanation, and this discovery aspect is the main draw of the game. Once you've got an idea of how things work, you can decide which plants to grow where in order to revive each area of the cave.\n\nThe downside is that it's not all that well designed. The interactions between the lifeforms aren't very complicated, and growing the plants requires too much manual interaction, rather than organizing the environment so that it works on its own, like an ecosystem should. Still, it's worth checking out if you're interested in an experience that you haven't had before.","January 2","true","12.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There was some hic up with the audio at a couple of points where it clipped and produced and annyoying chirp. But it did not take away from the other audio. The gamepad integration was a nice touch. It does make for a better experience when playing a platform type game. I expect this game to have some staying power.

Great character dialogue and interaction, and a good basic and interesting story with multiple unique endings. For a planet that represents war and destruction, this ironic game made Mars seem like a prosperous, creative heaven.

Virtually no one on my friends list has it, and it has simplistic controls due to its mobile roots. It still manages to have interesting gameplay with decent balance with progressively increasing difficulty, but what really shocked me was the storyline. With its limited cast of Liang, Amani, and the A.R.T. emoticon robot who acts and sounds like Borderlands' Claptrap, it's managed to make me care about the two human characters. The dialogue intelligently mixes hard science with the fantasy aspects and sprinkles in just a little bit of technobabble. It's compelling to play and doesn't rely on overused gaming tropes like leveling up or endless gradual equipment power progression.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix of puzzle and platformer. It's also pretty original. There are few hazards you need to navigate and lots of places to restore your health. The challenge comes with properly filling each area with a sufficient amount of biomass, using the seeds you collect and the fertile ground around you. Though sometimes you may find yourself brute forcing a couple puzzles by herding Phyta into a corner and regularly throwing seeds at them.","January 26, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well, that's not entirely true. You won't be using guns and you won't upgrade any gear except for your jetpack. But the level design plays like any of them anyway, and unlike the Metroidvania games it's actually split up in smaller levels instead of offering one giant world. I'm not even sure if the comparison is now justified anymore... Anyway, moving on.\n\nYou've landed on Mars and your job is to discover the mysteries of the ecosystem when you become trapped in this huge cave. So you'll be picking up seeds and plant them in order to create life. Blue seeds go into the blue soil, green into the green soil, et cetera. Sounds fun, right ? It does. For a couple of hours, at least. Then it starts to feel repetitive, and it even manages to become frustrating, especially when you want to 5-star every level and your plants are eating or killing other forms of life around you, decreasing your rating.\n\nOther than creating life there are a few mini-games in the game to spice things up and to get the story going but it's nothing noteworthy to begin with.\n\nI do have to praise the developer for creating such colorful and sharp art. It looks great, but animating the cutscenes a little more would've been a good idea I think. Those parts are just too static.\n\nSoooo.... let's see. I have no idea why I finished the game in the first place so I guess it must've done something right in the end... ? I'm not sure. Check the game out and decide for yourself.\n\n[Rating: 72/100]","January 29, 2013","true","11.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Instead, this game tasks you with growing and cultivating all matter of plants as you traverse the caverns of everyone's favorite red world. The controls are responsive and simple, though the jetpack can be a little slippery if you're trying to push things in midair or corral creatures.\n\nThe visuals are a mixed bag. The environments are gorgeous, evoking an artistic, arts 'n' crafts style, and the talking heads during dialog are detailed and realistic. The flora and fauna you encounter, however, feel a bit stiff and oddly-detailed, especially your character. They all end up looking like the product of a Flash game. Minor gripes, really.\n\nA bigger gripe has to be the dialogue. It's pretty well-packed with information and delivered very well, but not an ounce of it is interesting to listen to, and you'll end up skipping the long cutscenes. Your AI companion's attempt at comic relief is passable at best.\n\nThankfully, the game makes up for the poor writing with some deep albeit repetitive gameplay. Introducing flora and fauna to the red planet is a balancing act; if you're not careful, you can find an area completely taken over by one kind of species, especially when you add different kinds of plants to the mix. Once you get a few hours in and have discovered almost every type of plant, the game falls into a bit of repetition as you wander around trying to find an ending.\n\nThe plot itself isn't too special, but the magic of this game is all in the setting. I am a lone man wandering the caves of an alien planet, spreading life wherever I go. There's no real sense of conflict or danger in the game, but the element of discovery and the research mechanic add a great deal of immersion and a sense of wonder about the whole thing.\n\nIf you want a "puzzle" platformer that will last you a weekend, Waking Mars is a fun expedition, and I had a good time with it, despite the so-so writing and inconsistent visual style.","October 4, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Enjoyable Exploration Extraordinaire.Genre: 2D Light Platformer, Exploration and Light Metroidvania.\nDeveloped & Published by: Tiger Style\nPlatform: Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Android and iOS.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by MyselfRead the unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nWaking Mars is a 2D platformer that's light on exploration and heavy on exploring the depths of a fictional Mars. Through this narrative driven story, you'll need to figure out how the plant and animal life interact with each other. Each area has a required amount of biomass so you'll need to solve the puzzle of the area while using physics to move plants or objects around to grow them. There isn't any combat in Waking Mars but you can potentially die thanks to lava and some aggressive species. So, you'll need to use your jetpack and wits to survive. All of which is to be learned by the player as they go along. There's unlocks to find and secrets to discover too.\n\nOverall Story Thoughts\nThe year is 2097 on Mars. You play as a astronaut named Liang who is accompanied by an AI named “ART”. He is teamed up with another astronaut named Amani who assists by analyzing the data he brings in and being helpful support. At first, Liang is at an outpost that was built for this mission to Mars to explore the Lethe caves. The mission is to find the alien life that had been detected by scouts years ago. Liang is contemplative, quiet and mostly a loner. Amani is more of a upbeat, friendly kind of person. She acts as support and isn't playable in the game though you’ll have plenty of conversations. They have pretty good chemistry and bounce off each other well. ART is an artificial intelligence who speaks like he’s an AI from some bad 70s movie. ART…well, he’s “cute” at first but his computerized speech can get on your nerves as the game progresses.\n\nLiang and his team have been sent to Mars after an initial recon of the planet discovered life on the red planet. You play as Liang as he travels into the depths of the Mars caverns named “Lethe cavern”. There he will find the strange lifeforms and begin unraveling the mystery of Mars. The outpost he was working out of is destroyed due to an accident and Liang must return to base camp or run out of oxygen. The conditions on the surface of Mars are too harsh to travel over. So, Liang has to travel through the depths of Lethe cavern to reach the base camp. The caves are filled with dangerous hazards & deadly lifeforms but its also filled with life and intrigue for Liang. His curiosity leads him to continue exploring the depths of Lethe cavern. You’ll have to discover for yourself what those mysteries are. Its an enjoyable story really and the lack of violence really helps keep this game focused on exploration.\n\nI did have one major issue with this game’s story however and that was the ending. It ends abruptly, regardless of which ending you choose. No explanation for what will happen to the planet or the lifeforms you meet. No explanation for what waking up Mars will do for the planet or even the human society. Just nothing. It irritates me to end when a game leaves you hanging. I can’t tell if they didn't know how to end the game or if they planned on doing a sequel.\n\nPC Port Report\nWhile this is a mobile ported to PC game, it comes with a reasonable settings menu. Keyboard config, resolution options and even joystick support. The art isn't as hi-resolution as I would have liked, but is passable in its current state. The PC port of this game is surprisingly solid. It comes with rebindable keys, joystick support, cinematic speed settings and resolution options. The resolution options were nicely varied and the game also featured resolution “auto-detect” which worked just fine. For the most part, the game stayed at a solid 60 FPS. Well done guys.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWaking Mars is a well done exploration adventure game. One of the most enjoyable exploration games to come around in a while. Tiger Style managed to make a game that was only about exploration fun and challenging at the same time and I have to give kudos. The characters were also interesting people to get to know. I also have to give them kudos for making a quality PC game from an iOS port. It's refreshing to see iOS app devs take care in the porting of their games. All that said, Waking Mars is an enjoyable game through the depths of a fictional Mars. While the game has some problems, the core of the game is a very solid experience. If you have any interest in exploration or adventure games, you should give Waking Mars a try.\n\nRead this review & more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","December 13, 2012","true",""," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are simple but nonetheless nice and colorful, and the environment, though only made of caverns most of the time, is varied enough. The gameplay is as simple as the visuals but original and interesting since it is aimed at creating and controlling a martian environment. I could say the same regarding the story. The voice acting and soundtrack are good. I could add that if you are curious and like to explore, you'll find a few secondary objectives to do, which will tell you more about the story or the characters.\nWaking Mars is not really difficult, but plants and wildlife do not remain passive and they can make environment control tricky if you're not careful.\n\nWhat I find really enjoyable is the whole scientific background, as your character does research on the flora and fauna while making progress, and all the findings are written in some sort of database that you can consult anytime. The theories and explanations regarding the environment are quite interesting.\n\nNeedless to say, a game that invites you to create instead of destroying is more than welcome.","June 20, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game offers a well written back story for any story driven gamer; including a well rounded character, and few supporting character.\n\nHowever, the gameplay fell a bit short. There are only a handful of different seeds available, and you're only allowed to carry a limited quantity at a time; for that reason, you'll constantly find yourself back in the same room replenishing your seeds. Had the game allows you to instantly replenish your seeds or simply making your seeds supply infinite, rather than making you slowly waiting at each individual plants, then this experience wouldn't be so bad to bear. On top of that, the game revolves around increasing biomass, which often pushes the player to plant those high value seeds rather than a variety of them. Adding that to the limited seed supply and you got a very repetitive game.\n\nIn summery, if a rich story is enough to carry you through the game, then be sure to pick this game up.

The game offers a well written back story for any story driven gamer; including a well rounded character, and few supporting character.\n\nHowever, the gameplay fell a bit short. There are only a handful of different seeds available, and you're only allowed to carry a limited quantity at a time; for that reason, you'll constantly find yourself back in the same room replenishing your seeds. Had the game allows you to instantly replenish your seeds or simply making your seeds supply infinite, rather than making you slowly waiting at each individual plants, then this experience wouldn't be so bad to bear. On top of that, the game revolves around increasing biomass, which often pushes the player to plant those high value seeds rather than a variety of them. Adding that to the limited seed supply and you got a very repetitive game.\n\nIn summery, if a rich story is enough to carry you through the game, then be sure to pick this game up. If you're more interested in a entertaining platorming or puzzle experience, you should look elsewhere.","March 10, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a great way, I must add!\n\nIn Waking Mars you're an explorer of Mars' caves and its newfound life. As you interact with more and more life, the game registers your findings in a log, showing the amount of work that has been put into designing everything about this game. Every piece of life is highly detailed, and it's worth reading the information you gather as you play.\n\nBUT this isn't a merely exploratory game, despite that being a big focus. After you learn about the life you encounter, you learn how to use it to your advantage, creating the most aproppriate habitat for a certain type of plant or animal to live. In doing so, they'll eventually interact with each other, prospering further and further, that being the main mechanic of this game. Each room has a certain Biomass level requirement for you to progress, a mechanic that makes sense in the context of this game , as the caves' natural defense is to block the exits until there's self-sustainable life in it.\n\nThe story was there merely to guide you through your adventure deeper and deeper into Mars, giving you a helping hand in this journey.\nAs you progress, you start grasping the game's mechanics, and you'll be able to create some pretty cool environments and interactions with everything at your disposal, which feels very satisfying.\n\nSo, I'd advise anyone to definitely try out this game. The sense of discovery is present at all times, keeping you emersed in the world from start to finish. There's a constant drive to keep you moving forward and exploring more and that's a really big plus! The game's world and mechanics fit perfecty, which is fairly rare, so yea, give them your money already and... enjoy!","December 31, 2013","true","11.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's very chill and the sense of exploration and experimentation in an alien environment  make for a good time.  Adding in a decent soundtrack and a light but okay narrative to it helps to create a nice dreamy atmosphere as well.  The problem is...it's just not very exciting after awhile.  While it's made well known that this isnt your typical action packed game going in, and I'm fine with that; there's just not enough here to keep me pushign on to the end when there are other games to play.\n\nThat said, Waking Mars is usually found for very cheap in various bundles, so it's worth checking out just for the experience.   While I have no intentions of solidering through it at the moment, I can certainly see times in the future where the mood is right for something more relaxing and thought provoking, and Waking Mars will definitely scratch that itch.\n","July 24, 2013","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From a Tablet/phone game it's pretty good.  From a PC game standpoint it's a bit of a letdown.  It's not a good platformer it's based around touvh controls and you can feel it.  It's slow and very easy to avoid things with a control.  It's more of a puzzle game that anything else, the story is decent but due to it pausing the game every time there is something to say it really slows you down and personally takes me out of the experience. Don't buy this for a plattformer game it's really not.  Being a port some of it feels rushed the menu isn't very good with a controller and it can be difficult to deal with at times.\n\nFinal though is it's not bad but not great, play it more for the story then the game play. 6/10","February 18, 2015","false","1.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

They launch a seed, seed rolls down a hill, seed hits terrain, seed plants and so on and so forth. I also love the art style. I notice it's become somewhat of a trend to do this kind of aesthetic, I don't even know how to properly describe it but basically it's a mix between photorealistic and game.

It feels like something that could actually happen through to the end. All four(?) of them.\nThe paper cut-out art style makes everything pop in just the right way. It's all very well drawn. Not only is the art good, but the characters are extremely realistic and likeable people that will accompany you via radio on your journey through the vast underground Martian ecosystem.\nThe best way to describe this game is as a casual 2-D puzzle platformer, gardening/ecosystem creation simulation. It's on the easy side, sure, but you'll definitely get your money's worth out of the story alone. For those asking a little more, you can try and perfect the game. All 110% of it! Personally, I reached 103% and two endings in 7.1 hours playtime, and I was stopping to admire a lot of scenery.\nThe only cons I can really think of would be after a certain point, things get tedious. If you're looking to squeeze out every last bit of exploration, dialogue, and completion from this game, you're going to be doing a LOT of backtracking to places where you can easily access certain materials. But if you're going that far, you should be ready to deal with such tedium and technically forfeit your right to complain.\nAll in all, I recommend this game for fans of simple puzzle games, space cadets, and anyone with general interest in good sci-fi. If you really want a deal, wait for it to go on sale or hope it gets thrown into a Humble Bundle again. Maybe even pick it up on Android or IOS if you rather game on-the-go.\nFinally, my recommendation for controls is a 360/PS3 gamepad. The keyboard and mouse controls just don't fit very well, but that's my personal opinion.\nHope you liked the review and thanks for reading.","February 21, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have the scientific method, and that's about it. You're given a journal, basic jetpack controls, and let out to play around on the inner caves of Mars. Seeds will spawn plants alarmingly quickly, and you record the attributes of the various animals and plants while balancing the populations in order to reach a "life force" cap to go to the next bit. It's a nice idea but after only like 5 plants it slows to a crawl as they drastically increase the cap necessitating hours of repetitive violent gardening. If you're tight for cash I wouldn't recommend as it's innovation is short lived. However if you're intrigued by the scientific method aspect I'd heartilly recommend.","June 15, 2015","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay begins very exploration-focused but becomes more complex and puzzle-like as you discover more lifeforms and must balance their properties to create a functioning ecosystem. This is all connected by a somewhat loose story that leads you to the discovery of the unknown history of the caves.\n\nOverall, it's a very enjoyable and well-made experience, however the tags might be a bit misleading. This is not really a platforming game nor is it a Metroidvania game.

For something that came from a random whim and a Humble Bundle purchase I could not have been more surprised.  The story was deeply moving, I found myself playing until 3 am trying to finish the game in one day.  I ended up giving up and going to bed when I realized there was at least another three hours left but I finished it the next day when I got up.\n\nThe characters are perfectly written; just enough dialogue to get you to identify with them as people and understand what is happening to the planet.  All of the conversations are thoughtful and while I was, at first, simply trying to ensure my guy survived to get off planet I later found myself ignoring my (technically) impending doom.  The planet and it's emerging ecosystem was far more interesting.\n\nConsidering the simple mechanics and that I even went for 100% completion (with some bad choices that required fixing) it's very surprising that the game took me 8.6 hours.  I wasn't rushing but even if I had I likely would have gotten 7 hours out of it.  I've beaten several AAA games in less time and been far less satisfied.  This game is worth a play, just don't be expecting action or horror.  You will explore not only a planet but why it is that way and how your simple bid to survive will impact that entire world and its inhabitants.","February 5, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story hook is just interesting enough without being overwhelming, and as it progresses and your objectives begin to change, it becomes thoroughly engaging. The puzzles are enjoyable and, particularly in the beginning, minimally frustrating, while the later levels provide enough challenge through the interacting elements to make achieving all five stars very satisfying. There's something just really sort of nice about trying to grow this Martian garden back to life, you know?\n\nI loved both of the human lead characters, who both seemed very genuine and personable, in a way that I've never really seen captured in a game before. I could honestly believe that these were two people who had known and worked well with one another for several years, and came to form a close professional relationship. And as much as it pains me to have to say, it was an absolute JOY to realize they were both people of color. That doesn't happen often enough!!\n\nI wish I had known going into it, though, that there are some puzzles throughout the game, and several back-to-back at the end of it, that require looking at a bright, flashing image in high-contrast colors for up to a few minutes to solve. I don't currently suffer epilepsy or any similar conditions (although I do struggle through feature-length 3D films, in case that's a useful data point), but after four or five of these visualizer puzzles in a row, I find myself with quite a headache, and a desire to warn folk who may be sensitive to flashing images of that sort.","January 6, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a very action-oriented game--those looking for their alien first contact story to be filled with bullets and lasers should look elsewhere. "Waking Mars" has been compared with "The Dig", but "Mars" is more fun as a platformer and puzzler, not so much a "gather and use items" adventure time.","December 22, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As one might expect from the title, they are met with some success.\n\nThe game revolves around exploration, research and biological reproduction of the life that is found on the planet. The map is large enough to give you several hours of playtime. The exploration involved opening up the entire map - fairly simple. Research requires you to "experiment" with what is at your disposal, to find out how the biology interacts with itself - simple, but less obvious.\n\nReproduction is  by far the biggest aspect of the game. You try and re-grow life in the various chambers found in the map. This requires you to evenly balance out different types of life. This can be tricky at times, because it is very easy to get "infestations" of a particular type of life. Also, worth noting: Although it may seem that you have rendered the game unwinnable, there is almost always a way to fix that, often explained by reading research notes.\n\nThe game can be controlled via. mouse&keyboard or with a controller. I found that the controller is not the easiest thing to use here, so best stick to k&m.\n\nThe 2-D graphics are generally very good. The player's sprite can look a bit static when hovering around, but apart from that everything else seems to fit in and look like it is "alive". Some screen tearing can occur, so it is best to enable v-sync in your display driver's control panel if that happens.\n\nThe music is very ambient and goes well with the "spelunking" experience.\n\nI didn't find any bugs while playing this game, and as mentioned before, you have to work really hard if you want to try and push the game into an unwinnable state.\n\nFor a game that has been ported to a computer from what was initially an iOS game, this is an extremely good game.\n","September 8, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not entirely off base to compare this to the older entries in the Metroid series, not that the actual gameplay is all that similar. Light exploration elements aside, anyway.\nRather it's mostly due to the fact that this game, too, manages to effectively employ sound and visual design to cultivate a unique atmosphere and capture the sensation of being alone on a strange and fantastic planet. The difference is that in this game, you're attempting to bring the dying ecosystem of the planet back to life, instead of destroying it.\nKind of a weird description, I know, but it's kind of a weird game. Nonetheless it's a really excellent and relaxing experience I'd highly recommend to anybody looking for a non-violent game where you can just relax, mess around, and discover all the ways the different forms of alien life interact with each other.\nPS the soundtrack owns","February 23, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the structure of a Metroidvania, but where a Metroidvania has you fighting your way through enemies to acquire new equipment that allows access to new areas, Waking Mars is entirely non-violent (except for the occasional environmental hazard) and has you manipulating the ecosystem in order to open up new paths to explore.\n\nThis is both interesting (going against the normal structure of the genre by leaving out enemies entirely) and terrible (it turns out that manipulating the ecosystem by growing and killing plants isn't a great gameplay experience). In fact, I once screwed up the plant life in a room so badly that I resorted to deleting the save file to reset it (fortunately, each room is saved in its own file, so I didn't lose my progress entirely). I suspect that it is actually possible to render the game unwinnable by accidentally eradicating some of the plant species entirely, although I didn't do this. I did kill off enough of some of the more troublesome species that it became difficult to remember where some of their specimens were in the game world in order to collect their seeds on the rare occasions I needed to use them to progress.\n\nWaking Mars is an interesting but not spectacular experience with some nicely drawn 2D art, good voice acting, actual minority characters for a change, and a gameplay mechanic that outlasted its welcome to the point where I took the easiest to obtain ending and didn't bother with the more difficult options. Not terrible, not wonderful, notable because  it is different.","February 23, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of shooting bullets, you shoot life forms into fertile ground to enhance the local biome.\n\nThe story is a powerful one, and is accompanied by a really nice sound track. The music is chill, and reminds me of the sound tracks from sci-fi games from the 90's. Ascendancy certainly came to mind (come on Valve, we need it on steam!). The story follows your character (A scientist named Liang) as he explores subterranean Mars for signs of life. You are joined via radio by colleague Amani and yout helpful robot friend ART. The conversations between Liang and Amani are one of the best aspects of the game, with some thought provoking exchanges.\n\nThe game mechanics are a real joy, as you conduct research on the life forms to meet your objectives. This pleased my inner scientist to no end. The game handles really well and watching your ecosystems flourish is particularly rewarding.","July 29, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It combines the exploration of the Metroid series with the cultivation aspect similar to Pikmin.  The first couple hours had me completely enthralled.  After that, the gameplay became more mundane, though there were still moments of intrigue scattered throughout.  Achieving two of the three possible endings requires a couple more hours than the first ending, and this is where things can get frustrating at times.  The soundtrack is excellent and quite varied.  You won't hear the same song over and over, provided you don't stay in the same room for long.  Even though the game was originally designed for touchscreen phones, it seems like the superior control option is a gamepad.  I recommend Waking Mars for anyone who can take a little relaxing with their gameplay.","June 24, 2013","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let the action tag fool you though, there isn't any combat, much less any real action to speak of, just lots of gardening and pseudoscience. Indeed, Waking Mars is a xenoecological adventure to recover a missing exploration probe as you uncover the secrets hidden within the Lethe Cavern.\n\nStart out in a chamber mostly devoid of life, introduce moisture, plant seeds in fertile terrain and watch them spring to life! But as they start to spread out in the area, you might find that it may not be the most efficient ecosystem, or that certain Zoa may threaten to eliminate the rest of it! It's all very simple and there are limited patches for planting, but the number of cross interactions between different species and their environments makes for a surprising level of complexity.\n\nYou may have beat a zone by hitting a certain biomass within it and unlocked new areas, but later you might want to revist them to increase the efficiency of the ecosystems in them, improving synergies and generating even more biomass. Or you just want to visit it to pick up some seeds for use in a new area. The game encourages you to build ecosystems that benefit heavily from synergistic interactions but isn't afraid to let you build insane unstable ones that have large amounts of biomass constantly in flux as life is rapidly reproduced as it is destroyed. Sometimes planting a single Zoa (ART, an AI program in your suit will tell you that they aren't plants!) too soon can make it hard to fix as it spreads all around before you can start planting your desired Zoa in other patches. Sometimes the easiest way to stop this happening is to kill it. You may however only carry a certain amount of each seed and that makes you have to think about how you have to go about planting them (though it also means  that it can be tedious if you are trying to populate an area with mainly one sort of Zoa). There is even the potential to wipe out an entire species, though many plants do reappear in later chambers if you accidentally do so in an early one.\n\nWhile many of the game's quirks make it arguably a better one, it is not without faults. You are almost required to revist some old chambers to do a quick restock of seeds every few chambers and while you can teleport between chambers you have visited I feel it could have been more streamlined.  Speaking of tedium, Ledon Zoa are amazing at providing biomass AND populating entire zones, but can be a nightmare to plant as they float upwards aimlessly, cannot be picked up and crumble with little force. ART is like a less charming Wheatley and can be quite jarring. Fortunately your player character, Liang, is the most likeable character in the game. The signal decoding segments can be a tad confusing and so can most of the endings.\n\nOverall an excellent title, more enjoyable than gardening.","January 27, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, it was an enjoyable game, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a casual exploration game that they can sit back, relax and enjoy (it has controller support).\n\nOh, and it's worth mentioning that the developer is/was active on several different forums, answering players' questions and helping them to get past parts of the game if they needed it, as well as fixing players' save files if bugs occurred (before they were patched).

I forget how I got this game, maybe from a humble bundle. I never really looked at it, so since I was bored I thought I'd give it a try. I was blown away by this game.\n\nThe art and visuals are simple but excellent; the characters look like they were hand drawn based on models, which adds a lot to the sweet and sometimes humorous character dialogue. You really feel like you're investigating the life forms you encounter, as the game encourages you to try everything to interact with it. There is a little bit of a grind as you sometimes have to backtrack to replenish your collection of seeds, but if you plan it out well then you can establish little gardens with whatever Zoa you need more of in small clusters. I often had to revisit the Larian Gauntlet to trick more critters into becoming compost for me, after reproducing them in sufficient quantities.\n\nThere's a certain honest charm about this game. You don't play some fantastic larger-than-life scientist fighting a military tough guy who's trying to take advantage of your discovery, and the aliens don't turn out to be xenomorph kill machines. You're just a dude with a jetpack who's trying to figure things out, and trying to stay alive at the same time.

The controls work well and the levels are very well designed.  Fast travel seemed like a strange addition at first, but it's almost open-world, with in-game reasons to go back and fix places you've already been.  The dialogue is well-written, all characters are well differentiated, and I'd say the highlight of the game is the story -- which is a lot harder scifi than I expected.  A pleasant surprise.\n\nGameplay is based off of studying and manipulating an alien ecosystem, with no weapons to speak of.  In particular, figuring out how to make each life form produce its seed pod, which can be used for many different functions, is vital.  It's one of those games that puts you in an unfamiliar situation, where you have to figure out what you can do all by yourself -- and unlike some of them, it pulls it off neatly.\n\nThe game IS short though.  It took me a little under 10 hours for a blind 90% complete playthrough.  Since I got it on sale for $2, it blew my socks off.  If I had to pay the full $10, or maybe $5-7 on a cheaper sale...?

The game has no real difficulty as you are presented with a room with continuing complex puzzles (Which aren't very hard and hardly thought provoking). What the game has going for it is the story and atmosphere. You are an astronaut on a mission to discover what happened to an early lost droid on the exploration of a cave network on Mars. The story progresses a little beyond that and is fully voiced, yet not very convincingly.

Like Metroid, it's built around exploration and puzzles that unlock access to further areas. However, unlike Metroid it's not built around combat - instead, there's a well-written and interesting scientific exploration mission underway, and your quest is to understand the ecosystems you discover.\n\nThe puzzles are interesting and the visuals are good (though perhaps unexceptional for the style of game involved) - but what really sets Waking Mars apart and makes me enjoy it is that it really feels like a game of exploration, rather than a game of exploring until you find the next enemies to kill.

I obtained the game as part of a Humble Bundle.  I'm a fan of Metroidvania games (action/exploration games like Metroid and Castlevania that focus on exploring a large 2D open world for upgrades and other goodies) so this did seem up my alley.\n\nThe gameplay of Waking Mars is similar to metroidvanias in its 2D open world and ability to wander, but that's about where the similarities end.  The core gameplay of Waking Mars is flying around with a jetpack through large 2D spaces manipulating each areas's ecosystem in order to unlock more areas and complete main/side objectives.  The ecosystem is a web of plants and a couple of "animals" that depend on each to thrive and reproduce (there's also a research journal that explains each life form's use and abilities as you discover them).  Later in the game you'll find yourself going between several rooms to obtain seeds to enhance other rooms to their maximum biomass level.  Each room has a different ecosystem to work with and different challenges to overcome so the game never feels repetitive or monotonous.  There's no combat here, so you'll purely be picking up and throwing seeds as well as trying to herd around some of the larger seeds you can't carry.  Some plants can hurt and kill you, but the game has a very generous autosave system so death is never more than a minor hindrance as a result of being sloppy (note that I played on normal, the game offers casual and hard settings which I imagine do nothing but change how much damage you receive).\n\nOn the technical side I was extremely impressed at the professional quality of this "indie" game.  Graphics are 2D but very detailed and look incredibly sharp and detailed at 1920x1200 screen resolution.  The screenshots on Steam really do not do the look of this game justice.  Voice acting sounds extremely professional and all dialogue in game is fully voiced.  The controls also felt fantastic for a mouse and keyboard user and zooming around on the jetpack and using the mouse to throw seeds felt extremely precise and natural.  The game also ran perfectly without a hitch in Gentoo Linux so clearly the developer has put a lot of effort into proper Linux support which is wonderful.  The only technical hiccup I had was screen tearing during scenes of heavy movement.  My monitor does that worse than many and I normally use vsync because of it but this game had no option for it and it wasn't bad enough to force it in the drivers.\n\nMy first playthrough, getting all 17 achievements was 7.9 hours.  That may seem on the short side but that time was devoid of tedium or reptition, the game never overstayed its welcome and progressed very naturally.  The quality of this was so good I regret getting it so cheap as part of a Humble Bundle, its worth every bit of its current $9.99 US price tag.  If you like exploration games and/or the idea of manipulating an ecosystem for life to thrive you will enjoy this game!","January 19, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'Waking Mars' requires less commitment, has less difficult gameplay, and a more transparent and readily exposed storyline and mission; 'The Swapper' has significantly tricky puzzler and gameplay aspects, a more subtle and evasive script, and requires a lot more patience.

It started off somewhat slow (and easy), but picked up fairly quickly and actually got rather interesting - learning about the different aspects of each type of life in the game is fun, and promotes experimentation. Additionally - and this is where the difficulty increases - the game caters to completionists by including alternate endings to players who enrich Mars' life to the fullest in each area. Overall, it was an enjoyable game, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a casual exploration game that they can sit back, relax and enjoy (it has controller support).\n\nOh, and it's worth mentioning that the developer is/was active on several different forums, answering players' questions and helping them to get past parts of the game if they needed it, as well as fixing players' save files if bugs occurred (before they were patched).

The basic idea is that plant-like life has been discovered on Mars, and over the course of the game you discover other types of organisms and have to spread them around into small ecosystems in order to progress further.  It's very analagous to tending a garden.  Eventually, the story kicks in and you find that these plants aren't the only secrets buried on Mars.\n\nThe story is well-done with enough surprises to keep it interesting, the atmosphere is spot-on, the acting is good, and the puzzles are not frustratingly difficult.  The pacing is also good, and the length is exactly right - not so short that I feel like I wasted my money, but not so long that the game mechanics become stale.

OOooooh how I was wrong. Sure its graphics are far from impressive, but that's not what they were aiming for.\n\nNow I'll start with what I enjoyed the most of this. The soundtrack. The music is so strange and unique, so it fits this alien world perfectly. But, truly, many of the tunes are just great tunes! You can check it out in the DLC, its free!\n\nWhat I'll remember most profoundly about this game is how unique it was. Its system is unlike any other game out there. Sure, it borrows a few generic concepts from Metroid, so yeah, its a Metroidvania game (but those are awesome!). But it differs in that theres no combat in the usual sense, no weapons, no direct attacking. Rather, you throw seeds around and grow different plants that have unique abilities, to suit your needs. Got hurt from acid or nasty plants? Grow a healing plant. Want to water a dry area to grow more plants? Grow a water plant. Then theres more unusual situations of having to grow predatorial plants to eat the "enemies"... but I digress.\n\nAnother unique thing is that there is no enemies, nor antagonist for that matter. Sure, the wildlife you encounter might attack you, but only if you invade their territory or get too close for comfort. They just mind their own business, being generally neutral, like the wild in real life. Its nice not to have stupid cliched "bad guys", and it just works!\n\nIts all about the exploration. This game is surprisingly deep and you'll have much to discover, everytime adding a new entry in a nifty little encyclopedia (like a Pokedex), giving you hints on how to interact with things in interesting ways. The game is very smart in how it always manages to surprise you. It presents you with a new lifeform, and you just gotta... experiment with it. Its really fun and I'm not gonna spoil any details.\n\nIf theres one thing that it fails at, sadly, is replayability. Its very long and tedious at times, but it was worth it to see what happens next. If you already know what next, however, theres very little incentive to go through the hoops a second time.  I'd replay it in a heartbeat with a friend though, to showcase it!\n\nAll in all, I REALLY recommend this game and strongly encourage game developpers to take a gander at it, this hidden gem of originality.","May 16, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story hook is just interesting enough without being overwhelming, and as it progresses and your objectives begin to change, it becomes thoroughly engaging. The puzzles are enjoyable and, particularly in the beginning, minimally frustrating, while the later levels provide enough challenge through the interacting elements to make achieving all five stars very satisfying. There's something just really sort of nice about trying to grow this Martian garden back to life, you know?\n\nI loved both of the human lead characters, who both seemed very genuine and personable, in a way that I've never really seen captured in a game before. I could honestly believe that these were two people who had known and worked well with one another for several years, and came to form a close professional relationship. And as much as it pains me to have to say, it was an absolute JOY to realize they were both people of color. That doesn't happen often enough!!\n\nI wish I had known going into it, though, that there are some puzzles throughout the game, and several back-to-back at the end of it, that require looking at a bright, flashing image in high-contrast colors for up to a few minutes to solve. I don't currently suffer epilepsy or any similar conditions (although I do struggle through feature-length 3D films, in case that's a useful data point), but after four or five of these visualizer puzzles in a row, I find myself with quite a headache, and a desire to warn folk who may be sensitive to flashing images of that sort.","January 6, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For something that came from a random whim and a Humble Bundle purchase I could not have been more surprised.  The story was deeply moving, I found myself playing until 3 am trying to finish the game in one day.  I ended up giving up and going to bed when I realized there was at least another three hours left but I finished it the next day when I got up.\n\nThe characters are perfectly written; just enough dialogue to get you to identify with them as people and understand what is happening to the planet.  All of the conversations are thoughtful and while I was, at first, simply trying to ensure my guy survived to get off planet I later found myself ignoring my (technically) impending doom.  The planet and it's emerging ecosystem was far more interesting.\n\nConsidering the simple mechanics and that I even went for 100% completion (with some bad choices that required fixing) it's very surprising that the game took me 8.6 hours.  I wasn't rushing but even if I had I likely would have gotten 7 hours out of it.  I've beaten several AAA games in less time and been far less satisfied.  This game is worth a play, just don't be expecting action or horror.  You will explore not only a planet but why it is that way and how your simple bid to survive will impact that entire world and its inhabitants.","February 5, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You essentially create ecosystems by planting seeds that grow into plants, building "biomass" to unlock new areas and move forward. It's not so much a puzzle game for most of its run as it is a game of discovery, observing how different plants react to each other and trying to build a stable enviorment while only understanding part of what you're doing. Most of the game's delights are in that process of discovery. I've played a lot of novel games, and this one felt like it was exploring a new, fascinating gaming idea, where you model little ecosystems on the fly.\n\nUnfortunately, it never goes very deep- completing most of the areas is effortless, and while the story leaves a tantalizing hook dangling for you to resolve, doing so apparently requires getting a perfect score in every area. Getting that score means messing with a lot of finicky parts that I thought was too frustrating to be worth the time. I wish the game went deeper by creating new puzzle areas and challenges, instead of forcing you to be a completionist. So I never finished this game, but the five hours or so I put into it were pretty rewarding. Bonus points for the amusing way your AI-assistent speaks: video games have a lot of "funny" talking robots nowadays, but this one is especially good.\n\nYou'll probably be seeing it a lot in indie bundles, which is where I got my copy. Pick it up if you have a few hours to spare for some inventive gaming.","April 23, 2013","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay begins very exploration-focused but becomes more complex and puzzle-like as you discover more lifeforms and must balance their properties to create a functioning ecosystem. This is all connected by a somewhat loose story that leads you to the discovery of the unknown history of the caves.\n\nOverall, it's a very enjoyable and well-made experience, however the tags might be a bit misleading.

The story is great and the artwork is beautiful. I found myself wanting to see what else the game would reveal, and wanted to get all of the research before the end.\n\nYou create your own biome within this cave on Mars, finding the best ways to get max mass, if you're a completionist. The whole process is paced well, and none of it feels like a chore. Backtracking is almost nonexistant, since the map includes a quick travel feature. I also really appreciate that the devs created an auto save before the two endings, so you can go back and get the other ending without having to restart the whole game. That is a big plus for people who want to play once and move on.\n\nWith that said, I really enjoyed this game. The length is perfect. The only way it could go longer is if the writers could keep throwing up new discoveries and mystery. However, they go quick, to the point, with no useless filler.\n\nWhile the journey begins as a scientific expedition, there is much more purpose to be found in the depths.

You play as a scientist exploring some of Mars' underground caverns when you're trapped by a cave-in.

It starts out pretty strong, there's a solid story throughout, the visuals are decent, the planting mechanics seem pretty interesting. For the first three chapters the game is quite linear, and the fourth (and longest chapter) opens up a little though I would never say it's that exploration-heavy, or much of a metroidvania.\n\nBut the game really starts to drag around chapter 4, with increasingly tedious work needing to be done to hit 4 and 5 level biomasses for the rooms. Thankfully there's an event that doubles the effectiveness of these right near the end, so if you hit 30 you're basically done. But it still takes a lot of work and some of the rooms can be really tedious and frustrating, the AI on the moving lifeforms is not very good.\n\nThere's also a number of glitches, stuff getting stuck in walls etc. but also game-breaking bugs that can ruin your file; thankfully I did not encounter this but I did get a kind of buggy ending the first time via skipping a large chunk of the endgame sequence by having enough core power to trigger the normal ending. It's a really weird oversight, honestly.\n\nBut yeah, this game is... solid. I've wrung about as much enjoyment out of it as I think I'll ever get though and I doubt I'll ever go back and replay it.

It's totally worth it (though I'm cheap and snagged it on sale)\n\nThis is an amazing game, especially considering it doesn't involve guns, sand-box elements, or horror.\n\nMost sci-fi games out recently have been heavy on the fiction and light on the science. This game does an excellent job being adventurous without losing the theme of experimentation, exploration, and logic.

Using mouse/keyboard or gamepad, the controls were wonderful and I didn't have a single glitch or crash.\n-Simple mechanics- Tossing seeds and floating on my jetpack. Super easy, but to balance the ecosystem, you need to do some planning. Challenging but not obnoxious.\n-Beautiful art AND music- This game nailed it with their art direction. Everythign is beautifully drawn and the music is appropriately surreal.\n-Great story- A nice storyline with two (four if you count AIs) memorable characters. You start off just searching for a lost robot and stumble upon so much more!\n-Three endings- You're given several options on how to end the game, each one with it's own footage.\n\nCons:\n-No room for a sequel-\n-Short-\n-Could benefit from some sort of "build your own ecosystem" map.

The controls work well and the levels are very well designed.  Fast travel seemed like a strange addition at first, but it's almost open-world, with in-game reasons to go back and fix places you've already been.  The dialogue is well-written, all characters are well differentiated, and I'd say the highlight of the game is the story -- which is a lot harder scifi than I expected.  A pleasant surprise.\n\nGameplay is based off of studying and manipulating an alien ecosystem, with no weapons to speak of.  In particular, figuring out how to make each life form produce its seed pod, which can be used for many different functions, is vital.  It's one of those games that puts you in an unfamiliar situation, where you have to figure out what you can do all by yourself -- and unlike some of them, it pulls it off neatly.\n\nThe game IS short though.  It took me a little under 10 hours for a blind 90% complete playthrough.  Since I got it on sale for $2, it blew my socks off.  If I had to pay the full $10, or maybe $5-7 on a cheaper sale...?

OOooooh how I was wrong. Sure its graphics are far from impressive, but that's not what they were aiming for.\n\nNow I'll start with what I enjoyed the most of this. The soundtrack. The music is so strange and unique, so it fits this alien world perfectly. But, truly, many of the tunes are just great tunes! You can check it out in the DLC, its free!\n\nWhat I'll remember most profoundly about this game is how unique it was. Its system is unlike any other game out there. Sure, it borrows a few generic concepts from Metroid, so yeah, its a Metroidvania game (but those are awesome!). But it differs in that theres no combat in the usual sense, no weapons, no direct attacking. Rather, you throw seeds around and grow different plants that have unique abilities, to suit your needs. Got hurt from acid or nasty plants? Grow a healing plant. Want to water a dry area to grow more plants? Grow a water plant. Then theres more unusual situations of having to grow predatorial plants to eat the "enemies"... but I digress.\n\nAnother unique thing is that there is no enemies, nor antagonist for that matter. Sure, the wildlife you encounter might attack you, but only if you invade their territory or get too close for comfort. They just mind their own business, being generally neutral, like the wild in real life. Its nice not to have stupid cliched "bad guys", and it just works!\n\nIts all about the exploration. This game is surprisingly deep and you'll have much to discover, everytime adding a new entry in a nifty little encyclopedia (like a Pokedex), giving you hints on how to interact with things in interesting ways. The game is very smart in how it always manages to surprise you. It presents you with a new lifeform, and you just gotta... experiment with it. Its really fun and I'm not gonna spoil any details.\n\nIf theres one thing that it fails at, sadly, is replayability. Its very long and tedious at times, but it was worth it to see what happens next. If you already know what next, however, theres very little incentive to go through the hoops a second time.  I'd replay it in a heartbeat with a friend though, to showcase it!\n\nAll in all, I REALLY recommend this game and strongly encourage game developpers to take a gander at it, this hidden gem of originality.","May 16, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, it has nonexistential difficulty, so all them hipsters won't have gray hair in their beards. It has weird "artsy", but pleasant graphics. It has forgetable, but soothing OST, charged extra. And of course it has pretentions, stupid as ♥♥♥♥ plot, so all of them herbivore gals and guys can boast, how deep the message of this piece was. Hello everybody, and welcome to Waking Mars review!\n\nThis game is everything i essentially hated in indie games. Pretentions, artsy, making no sense, and of course multiplatform (and with graphics which helps run it on every ♥♥♥♥ing Apple hardware ever created). After some time, it grew on me to the point, where i dont give a crap and can rip Waking Mars (and similar titles) a new one without thinking about how stupid the entire premise is. Oh well. Lets roll.\n\nGame takes us to year 2xwhogivesacrapx. We are an astronaut, our mission is to tinker around Mars, and see what we can find. After a short, but rather stupid mistake we made, the entrance caves in behind us. Now we must make our way to a secondary base. Plot is way deeper than that, but i dont want to spoil it. Its really stupid, and makes no sense, but this "mystery" will probably be the olny thing, which is interesting. Ish.\n\nGameplay is really basic, dare i say, designed to play on mobile devices. And it shows pretty much. We are flying around, throwing stuff and sometimes makes some really simple dodging. Puzzle game 101. Sadly, i dislike puzzle platformers to begin with, especially painfully easy ones, but i promised, i wont harp on it too much. So i wont. The olny thing I want to adress, game feels grindy at times, which is not that great.\n\nGraphics is artsy. That is all there is to say. I neither liked nor disliked it. Hand drawn, but not really my kind of thing. Moving on.\n\nMusic is sadly forgettable. I dont remember any song from the game, and I even bought OST. Sound effects, and especially voice acting on the other hand, is really, really good. It feels natural and pleasant.\n\nWaking Mars is an easy game. The time I spend on it, i managed to perfect it, and i would do it faster if not for the fact,  that im a bit lazy, and i specifically played this game while eating meals, so effectivelly did it with one hand (btw thats what she said apparently). Its good for beginners, achievment ♥♥♥♥♥s, such as myself, people who like pretentions and artsy games and apple fanboys. Everybody else will find little value in this game. ITs mediocre, but it have some good elements, so im giving it a recommendation.\n\nYes, this review is mainly to ♥♥♥♥ off apple fanboys, with each year they are more and more agressive in their conquest to make every game artsy and casual.

Waking Mars doesn't have to do much to stand out from such a thin crowd. And yet Tiger Style went above and beyond to make the game a standard-setting platformer on its own merits.\n\nThis is yet another mobile game that doesn't feel at all like a mobile game. The controls are tight and smooth. The art assets are gorgeous, including the face close-ups which accompany all the dialogue. The voice actors are engaged and well-directed.\n\nMuch has been made of the Metroid roots of the title. The chatty trio of protagonists somehow feel more alone on Mars than silent Samus did on Zebes. Tasks must be completed and resources collected in order to press forward. Paths branch and reconnect, many of them essentially optional. Still, Waking Mars feels like its own game rather than a derivative. The primary mechanic of the game - using alien seeds to establish life in the depths of a cave slowly waking from centuries of slumber - is novel and intuitively implemented. Waking Mars is no reskinned shooter.\n\nWhat most impressed me was the way the curtain was lifted on the final element of revelation. To some extent the game suffers from tutorial syndrome as your helpful companions chatter along; they always seem to be one step behind your own grasp of what you need to do. But the understanding of just what might really be going on under the regolith is something the game lets you deliciously realize on your own. This quiet revelation is well-paced with just the right hints along the way. The game is short, but it's full nonetheless and ends exactly where it should. The endings are brief but satisfying.\n\nIt's absolutely worth picking up, especially if it's on sale.","June 18, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork may be simple, but personally, I enjoy it a lot. The game has great voice acting, a nice soundtrack and a calm and friendly atmosphere. It offers three different endings, but you can see them quite easily and the replay-value is not very high. Also, it is a bit unstable, in its current state, expect some crashes.

Like Metroid, it's built around exploration and puzzles that unlock access to further areas. However, unlike Metroid it's not built around combat - instead, there's a well-written and interesting scientific exploration mission underway, and your quest is to understand the ecosystems you discover.\n\nThe puzzles are interesting and the visuals are good (though perhaps unexceptional for the style of game involved) - but what really sets Waking Mars apart and makes me enjoy it is that it really feels like a game of exploration, rather than a game of exploring until you find the next enemies to kill. For me, playing Waking Mars is like revisiting the best bits of the Metroid franchise.","June 4, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is very intuitive and easy to learn, although there is no tutorial so you have to just experiment with the buttons when you first start out. I had the opportunity to try it out with a mouse and keyboard and with a gamepad - both felt natural. The game also departs from the normal game trope of just "killing bad guys", and instead the main character explores and experiments with the game world. The game also rewards you with completed research points for experimenting with different combinations of seeds and life forms. I thoroughly enjoyed Waking Mars and would recommend it to anyone who is tired of the standard gaming fare. 10/10","July 4, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Massive kudos to Tiger Style on this gem.  No other game has been able to accurately portray the profound sense of exploration and discovery in an alien world like this game, except for metroid, and that's saying something.  Speaking of metroid, this game KIND OF has a metroidvania formula, albeit in a very basic way.  It does have labyrinthine maps with some necessary backtracking at times, but no upgrades to speak of.  The story is a very welcome foray into realistic science fiction.  A science team and their AI companion (which sounds excactly like claptrap, not sure if intentional or not) studying and exploring mars in the hopes of finding life.  The game was obviously designed with "diversity" in mind, no caucasian characters exist in this game, just an asian scientist and a black scientist.  The diversity aided nothing in the game and to that effect the black character is fairly annoying with her constant lack of understanding of basic concepts of how ecosystems work and her hyper fascination with acquiring more data regardless of what it means in the grand scheme of things.\n\nPros\n-excellent sense of adventure, exploration and discovery set in an alien world, evokes the same feeling from playing Metroid for the first time\n-very unique gameplay, you have no weapons and use plant growth to affect the world around you\n-interesting story that any true science fiction enthusiast can appreciate\n-"diversity"\n\nCons\n-Can become a bit repetitive after a while, sometimes you need to wait for certain plants to multiply enough to unlock the next room\n-Supporting characters are fairly annoying\n-"diversity"\n\nNot sure if I would pay $10 as this is the full price of the game, but I picked it up whilst on sale for $2 and would recommend it at that price without hesitation.","February 9","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
