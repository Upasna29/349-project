"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mo05eman/recommended/377480/","Mo05eman","Mo05eman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mo05eman/","400 products in account","FULL VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/uUqXRnxDrZ4\nPROS:Great cinematics show off the beauty of the most important stages in the story with a powerful impact.\nThe game does a good job of transitioning from one environment to an extremely different environment in a way that keeps the abstract dream feel of the game.\nEnvironments, especially large open ones, have a great feeling of awe and beauty.\nCONS:The lens flare in this game is so bright and overpowering that it completely ruins the aesthetic. There is no way to turn it down or off and will give you a guaranteed headache.\nPuzzles are laughably simple, all but maybe 1 or 2 of them take seconds to figure out completely.\nStory is predictable and short (game is less than 2 hours at a medium pace). It will still provoke some emotion but it’s more of a visual short story than a visual novel.\nOutside of the cinematics the game’s technical graphics are lackluster. Object pop-in and immersion breaking visual bugs are constant, no anti-aliasing of any kind, and amateurish visual effects especially in the water.\nSUMMARY:N.E.R.O. is a game that, if flawlessly executed, would still only appeal to a small handful of people who enjoy walking-simulator style games with very little gameplay. But N.E.R.O. is not flawless; rather it is full of bad graphical decisions, a mediocre-at-best story, and boring, uninspired puzzles. Outside of maybe 1 or 2 puzzles, each puzzle in the game has you looking at the environment to find a hint and then pressing a set of buttons in the right order with almost zero thought required. My CONS section contains a lot of negatives regarding visuals and rightfully so because at its core this game is a visual novel and each time my partner walked through a solid metal gate, or half a building popped in it took me out of the immersion of the story. The only extremely solid visuals in this game are the cinematics which show off a beautiful world that I wish I would have experienced in the game.\n\nEXTRA NOTE: If you don’t want to watch the whole video review just make SURE you at least watch some gameplay to see how bad the lens flare gets while moving; I am not just being picky there is a reason the only official steam store video is a cinematic.

The isn't good, nor bad, as long as you know exactly what you're going into, and enjoy that genre.\n\nIt really pains me to give N.E.R.O a negative, because I fell in love with the aesthetic. I love glowy stuff, and the world looks very fantastical. Well, I fell in love with the cinematic trailer on the store page. The game itself doesn't look quite as good. The bloom effect is a bit excessive, and the colours and world overall are a bit underwhelming. They feel lifeless compared to the cinematics. Of course I can see that it's harder to make the ingame world look that great, I'm just saying it was a disappointment.\n\nAlthough there are puzzles to solve, and a few things you can interact with, the game can still be classified as what many people call a "walking-simulator". I don't really like using that term as it feels a bit derogatory, but you know exactly what I'm saying when I use it, so it's useful. This is because the puzzles are almost all incredibly easy to solve, and the interactivity is reduced to simple things like pressing obvious buttons. You don't really feel like the world is real.\nJust to make it clear, it has much more to do than games like Dear Esther, because you can actually DO things, just not that many.\n\nWith that being said, I still enjoyed walking around the game. There are some cool visuals, giant structures and beautiful plants. It's just a tad bit too slow paced for me, even with the sprinting function. The areas are a bit too big with not much new to look at, or no environment or object to play around with. You're rewarded for exploring by finding some collectibles, whch is nice.\n\nThe story didn't really grip me. The narrator does a decent job, but the lines he's given aren't great. It all sounds out of context and doesn't make too much sense. I feel like when you go through a second playthrough, perhaps it'll make more sense, but the game sadly doesn't tempt me into playing it through a second time. It's also quite short.\nI like the way the text in the game is actually floating in the world, as opposed to being HUD on your screen. There's even a nice detail where walking through the text will cause it to ripple. Nice way of preventing immersion break.\n\nI really enjoyed the music. It added very well some moments of "woah" when you walk into a beautiful, vast room.\n\nOverall, I definitely don't think it's a bad game. I just think you need to know what you're going into. It's quite linear, doesn't have much actual gameplay, and it doesn't look amazing, but it's still an interesting place to explore. Again, I wish I could give it a neutral, but I'm forced to give it a Negative instead.\nConsider buying the game and giving it a try if something about it gripped you initially. Not to undermine the developer's hard work, but perhaps if you're unsure about your purchase, grabbing the game on sale will feel more worth it.\n\n(Review code supplied by developer.

I assure you that you won't find a single person that will like this game in the same way I did, or you will do.\nThis game is a unique experience, very much like a piece of art that can be read in completely opposite ways by every different player. So... just play it and make up your own idea about it.\n\nIn short: N.E.R.O. is a first person story-driven puzzle game. It tackles a very diffucult topic and tries his best to convey a strong message and a beautiful story.\nN.E.R.O. gives its best in carring your emotions through a difficult journey, through someone else's mind and feelings. It's, definitely, a game for a very narrow audience.\n\nWhether you will like it or not, it depends on your expectations and your sensitivity. If you are looking for a challenging and rewarding gameplay/puzzles, you're playing it wrong.\nThat's also its biggest problem, that it can be played wrong.\n\nYou might like it, you might not, or you could love it... it might make you cry or think you've wasted 3 hours of your life\nin any case, it will move your feelings in a way that very few games can. I say give it a possibility, you never know.","April 30","true","6.4"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","14","23","2","0"

Just don't waste your money leaving a bad review. As already said puzzles in N.E.R.O are not so hard, this because the game if focusing on something else. Every player will live this game in a different and personal way. You can love it, you can hate it. What you do is walking in this magical world full of meanings. What you should do is live this world reading all the texts, discovering all the puzzles and listening at the charming and relaxing voice of the narrator, without rushing too much.\nI suggest to live this journey.","May 7","true","3.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The lense flair alone made me feel like I was watching a JJ Abrams movie and REALLY needed to be toned down here. The options menu was about as robust as one would see in a mobile game and seriously needs revamped to offer a more robust feature set. The story had potential, but was just bland and rushed. I feel if the devs had spent more effort on the story, then the game would have been MUCH better.\nAnd, I have said as much before guys, but beautiful visuals do not a good game make. And while I definitely wanted to like this game, it ended up falling well short and at the full $20 asking price, I would recommend that you guys give this one a pass until it drops below the $10 price point."\n\nSee my full review here:\nhttps://youtu.be/e9c2R7BzYE0\n","April 29","false","2.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","2"

ReviewFull Website Review[gonewiththewin.com]\n\nHow important is game length or game quality? That will be the dividing line for those interested in this title. Those looking for a well done game, filled with impressive visuals and a superb score are in for a treat. Those that prefer more traditional game elements and length maybe put off.\n\nHowever NERO is a somber tale, that is told through various symbolisms and surreal myths. The narration is excellent. As well as its pacing, and emotional lifts and drops as you come to the inevitable conclusion. It set out to be a good story, and it delivered. Worth a playthrough to experience the great art  design, storytelling, and audio work. Puzzles are often too simple, too much slow paced walking, but very enjoyable.\n\nPROs- Surreal and beautiful aesthetics\n- Superb narration and score\n- Story easy to relate to.\n\nCONs- Short game.\n- Easy puzzles for the most part.\n- Artificially longer if you look for picture pieces, but not much.","May 4","true","2.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is no apparent introduction story; instead, the back story unfolds as you play through the magnificently designed levels. This is sometimes done by a disembodied voice which serves as the game's narrator, but also by reading glowing and floating pieces of narrative text that are scattered throughout the environment. And let me tell you; in a environment that is mostly dark and only lit by neon plants most of the time, this looks absolutely amazing. No matter how you look at it, the combination of neon objects and dark and mysterious environments is a surefire way to make things look awesome!\n\nThe story that unfolds is one of love, trust, feelings and questions that need to be answered; it's about a group of people who somehow got stranded in this mysterious place and are trying to survive. The main texts will be displayed in a green/yellow color, but you'll also discover blue text fragments. These fragments tell a more personal story about a family; a mother, a father and their son. I was immediately fascinated by these story fragments and, lucky for me, the story about the family becomes more and more important as you progress through the game.\n\nN.E.R.O. is a story driven game, set in a first person perspective. Just reading the texts and discovering what happened in the past is an adventure in itself. The world of N.E.R.O. is beautiful and the soothing soundtrack completes the calm yet mysterious character of the game. Apart from the journey through the events of the past, N.E.R.O. also provides you with a number of cool puzzles to solve. Most of the time, it's quite apparent what the game wants you to do and it's only a matter of timing or combining the right pieces to complete a puzzle. And, as in most games, the puzzles become more difficult with every new chapter. The cool thing about the puzzles is that they really support the game's story, so they never feel forced or out of place. N.E.R.O.'s puzzles are not too easy, but they don't require a university student to figure out what to do.\n\nIn chapter one, you will meet another floating creature. His cloak is black with red patterns. He will accompany you on your way and he can help you solve puzzles. Besides solving puzzles, always keep an eye out for pieces of photographs. Every chapter offers you the chance to complete one of these photographs, if you manage to find all the pieces. These photo's represent pieces of the family's story. It's not necessary to find them, but they help you to better understand what's going on.\n\nN.E.R.O. is a very beautiful game, featuring a moving story. It's not every day that you encounter a game which is sad and touching all at the same time. Together with an excellent soundtrack and amazing environments, this game is truly enjoyable for everyone who love games like Journey and/or Karma Flow. For fans of story driven/visual novel games (like me), N.E.R.O. is an absolute must!\n\nFor reviews, eventreports and more epic stuff, just check out our websit www.dumeegamer.com!","May 9","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
