It's a "puzzle" puzzle game that involves literal puzzles, not the kind of puzzle game where you move around characters.  The puzzle style is very intuitive and you will be able to quickly understand and jump right into it.  It is quite innovative and is somewhat like connect-the-dots but with the need to use logic to find the solution.\n\nIf you like the kinds of puzzles you may find in a puzzle book or the back of the newspaper, you will probably enjoy this innovative game.\n\nThe puzzles can be solved visually at first, but slowly they get complex and you need to use logic to figure out what order to connect the dots in, and which paths to take... and it's really quite fun to solve the challenging ones.\n\nThe game comes with more than enough puzzles (650), but the best part is, since the game has the ability to randomly generate new puzzles every day, you basically get a lifetime subscription.  If you log on each day, the puzzles get harder as the week goes on, starting over again on easy every monday, just like puzzles in the newspaper.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","October 26, 2014","true","19.2"," 119 of 129 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","119","129","4","4"

We bought this game to "Achievement Showcase" words on our profiles.\n\nLYNE is a logic puzzle game. It's calming and relaxing to play, the background music suits in with it. The price for the game is worth the game, there are many different levels and also different daily challenges for you to solve. In this game, there is the alphabet set, set A-Z. You need to connect the shapes to finish each levels.\n\nAt first, the game is easy as ripping a piece of paper. As you soon move onto the next 25-30 levels, it's like ripping a phone book.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/266010/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Puzzle games in my eyes need a few things to be entertaining, addicting tests of your wits. They should be easy to pick up, with basic rules that don’t require lengthy tutorials or wordy instructions to understand. They ought to be dynamic, built on a framework that can be easily reworked into a continual stream of interesting puzzles that don’t become repetitive despite being similar if not identical in design. And lastly I prefer them to be easy to pick up and put down, like a coffee table book that you can spend a few minutes or hours passing the time with, then set it back down for an unknown amount of time and still find it just as enjoyable the next time you look at it.\n\nLYNE seems to have unknowingly looked into my head and designed itself around these ideals, forming into a simple but exemplary brain teaser that I fell in love with from the very first screen. It’s a relaxing yet engrossing experience that excels at putting you in a zen like state as you clear puzzles and feel especially clever each and every time you do.\n\nIn essence, LYNE can best be thought of as a nonlinear connect-the-dots. You’re given two points that you must connect, while going through all of the requisite points between them, but the order in which you do so is entirely up to you. There isn’t necessarily only one way to solve a puzzle, and this freedom is but one reason I find LYNE hugely refreshing compared to so many other puzzle games. As you progress you begin to deal with multiple colors, points you must repeatedly run through, and more complex designs that have you connecting lines like a mad cartographer, which from the outside looking on would seem highly complex and difficult.\n\nBut, it never feels that way when you’re playing. The fundamentals are so basic that it feels almost innate, like you’ve already been doing this for years. Something about LYNE clicked with me instantly, allowing me to breeze through level after level without an abundance of difficulty but leaving that satisfying feeling of accomplishment when you flex your frontal lobe and solve a problem. The soothing ambient sounds and mellow colors do well to elicit a calm mindset, making this an ideal way to let loose of your tension and unwind as you focus on the problem at hand.\n\nIn a similar way that many treat Sudoku and crossword puzzles, LYNE has something of a habitual quality; something you can go back to every day to help keep you sharp and relax after the more trying events of a day. The structure is tailor made for this style of play, with puzzles grouped into sets that are just long enough to be rewarding but not fatiguing. Random daily puzzles (though you’d never know that do to them being just as well designed as the base sets) provide consistent new content, at which point I can think of little more I could ask for.\n\nBrilliant, Thomas Wowker, brilliant.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 17, 2014","true","1.7"," 94 of 107 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","94","107","0","0"

Well it was that and puzzle games tend to be more miss than hit with me.  It went on sale (today actually) for 89 cents and I decided there was nothing to lose.\n\nRight away I noticed this game suits me well.  It is very relaxing and easy to jump in and out of.  The puzzles, while they can be tough, are not brain burners, so you can play them after an exhausting day at work and just zone out.  There's also enough to keep you busy for a while.  There are 26 sets with 25 puzzles in each set, which comes out to 650 puzzles to solve.  Not to mention 2 more sets of daily puzzles.  I am almost at three hours in and I already solved 6 sets and today's 2 dailys.  I've noticed that the further in you get, the harder they become.  Still I haven't found myself getting close to frustrated at all and that is a huge plus for me.\n\nFor these reasons I recommend this game.  I am going to jump back in and get back to the fun.","November 25, 2015","true","4.8"," 53 of 54 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","53","54","3","3"

There are 3 different shapes: square, triangel and rhombus. Between them there are octagons which allow a certain number of crossings shown by linking spots. What it makes mostly difficult is that you often run out of possibilities. No chance to cross over a linking spot or you even have forgot to connect an object at least.\nSometimes you solve the puzzle in seconds, in other times you have to test every single way from both sides.

Its really interesting and feels fresh from other games that I've played. What does it involve? Drawing lines... yep that easy. You have colored shapes, each set of colored shapes has 2 'cap' shapes, where you can either start or end the colored line. So you start on a green box / triangle, then click and drag your mouse between the matching color shapes making lines. All shapes need to be connected and can only be connected to once. The lines can only go in eight directions from each shape. Its super easy. Then the game adds different colored shapes, so you've got green lines and red lines. So what's the catch? You can't cross the lines. So where's the challenge? Eventually directional octagonal shapes get added, these are neutral blocks that you're able to attach multiple lines on in 8 directions, no matter what color the line is, just as long as you don't cross the lines. It starts with simple octagon blocks that need you to connect to them twice.... then three times and so on.\n\nCan you lose? Nope. You have as much time as you want. You can't fail, if you do the puzzle inaccurately it just has a little red line around the box you forgot. Then you keep going. If you screw up, just click one of the cap shapes to delete the lines or back track your lines by clicking and dragging backward to remove the line you just made. If you ever get truly stumped, you can back out of that puzzle and go to any one of the 25 other puzzles in the group. You'll unlock a few groups at a time, so you'll always have 75 puzzles to chose from. The game goes in succession, once you complete one puzzle its immediately to the next. There is a legitimate sense of satisfaction when I complete a puzzle that I was stumped on. Not just that, but eventually I found myself thinking of the dynamics of these puzzles and realizing where I should start first.\n\nThe game has 25 puzzles per group and groups A - Z. 25 * 26 levels = 650 levels. Is that not enough for you? Well then there are daily levels with 25 levels of A B C making for 75 daily levels. The daily levels are considerably more difficult than the default puzzles. Its a nice way to keep fresh content and keep people in the game.\n\nIf you don't like puzzle games, avoid this. The first 50 levels are understandably easy, but they do get more challenging. It is a soothing game and the puzzles get complex, but still easy and simple.","June 27, 2014","true","5.5"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","0"

It's perfectly suited for everyone, who wants to play just some minutes or long sessions up to 2 hours. Your task is simple. Connect the two main knots for each color and all knots of the color on the way between both. All knots have to be used. You're not allowed to cross lines or to use the same way, you've already used before. Sounds simple, right? But it can become very challenging, if you have to deal with several colors and neutral knots, which have to be used multiple times. Your brain can really melt in longer sessions and you should seriously stop, if you're starting to see lines, where they aren't supposed to be.\n\nThe game has 2 game modes: chapter mode (26 chapters (A-Z) with 25 levels per chapter) and daily challenges (3 chapters with 25 levels per chapter), which will be random generated every day.\n\nFriendly advice: If you're not able to solve a specific level in 20 minutes, then give it a rest, do something else instead and pick it up later again. You will see it with a fresh view and maybe solve it in 10-30 seconds, at least this was my experience.\n\n\nPro:\neasy to learn\n650 levels (26 chapters with 25 levels per chapter)\n3 random generated daily challenges every day with 25 levels per challenge\nvery easy up to extremely challenging levels\nvery high replayability\nextremely addicting\nunlockable color themes for some visual variation\neasy undo function\nno time limit\nprice\n\nContra:\nthe audio effects don't vary that much and can become annoying in longer game sessions\n\nConclusion:\nExcellent game for a good brain workout. It's very cheap, addicting, easy to learn, offers difficulty levels in form of different chapters for everyone and has a very high replayability. If you love to use your brain, then LYNE will be perfect for you. Not recommendable for stones. Absolutely recommendable for everyone with a working human brain.\n\n\n10/10 - would draw another line anytime\n\n\n----------------------\n~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion?

To put the icing on the cake it has easy achievements which can be used to spell what you'd like using the achievement showcase. You also get 3/5 card drops for playing.\n\nReview:  LYNE  has hours of relaxing content with 650 puzzles to solve and the additon of 50 daily puzzles. Not to mention that it also has a soothing, dynamic sound track which works well with the simplistic visuals. The objective of LYNE is simple; Try to connect A to B without intersecting the other lines and fulfilling the requirements to complete the level. After completing all the levels in a set, you will unlock an achievement plus another set. After a while you will also unlock different colour palettes as an added bonus for completing sets. The puzzles start to get harder as you continue through the game as the puzzles are more complex and new mechanics are introduced, however the game does get repetitve at times, despite the difficulty curve.\n\nTo sum it up, this is a great game to kill some time or to play whilst watching something. It's pretty cheap too, and you can find a 50% off coupon somewhere, but is well worth the full price in my opinion.\n\nIf you like my review, any feedback is appreciated and if you would like to see more reviews from me in the future, feel free to follow me!","April 30","true","24.5"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","25","29","3","2"

Larger game grids, more colours/lines to connect or three-way instead of two-way blocks are some modifiers used throughout to increase the difficulty each set. Once you get into the second half of the game there are some real challenging levels that will leave you scratching your head for a long time (& occasionally swearing at your monitor)!\n\nTo give you an example, here is some unedited footage of me trying to solve a more challenging level (mistakes and all!):\n\nhttp://youtu.be/7FUkr6AqzlQ\nGraphics are clear, mouse controls are intuitive, achievements & cards, and also has daily set challenges of randomly generated puzzles to test you further. The daily sets, plus the 650 standard puzzles is a huge amount of content for such a small price tag.\n\nThere really isn't any negatives to this great little puzzle game, although if I was to be picky some of the colour pallette sets are a bit hard on the eyes :) Thankfully, not a big deal as you can set it to your liking once you unlock pallettes through game progression.\n\nIf you like games that challenge your mind (& sometimes your sanity!) then LYNE is well worth checking out.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","April 25, 2014","true","20.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","3"

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio.\n\nGameplay\nThere is no difficulty mode option that's assigned. But each of the puzzles has their own difficult.\n\nThe objective of this game is rather simple. Is figuring out on how to connect point "A" to point "B." The lines can't interesect with each other and where as shapes can't intercept each other. However, there's some exception where they can intersect each other.\n\nThere are two different kinds of sets: Alphabet sets and Daily sets.\n\nThe alphabet sets has twenty-six sets with twenty-five levels each and it totals out to six hundred fifty levels.\n\nThe daily sets plays a different than the alphabet sets. Each day there'll be one to three different sets of twenty-five levels to solve. This unique set can be unlocked only after the second set of alphabet is completed. Playing the daily sets unlocks more of the alphabet sets.\n\nThere's no time limit in this game. Allowing the individual take as much time that they want to solve each of the puzzles.\n\nThere's a option for color pallet customization section but it's only available after completing the first daily sets.

You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, it's an great game to play and enjoy.

Really easy to learn the basics, yet can be challenging later on. Really great thing about the game that there are no points, there is no timer - therefore absolutely no pressure. It's a peaceful game that you can solve in your own pace.\nI bought it on Humblebundle, so I got an android copy of it as well - working good on both devices. Even though it's a clearly a game developed for phones and talbets, works and feels just as good on computer. Usually ported games just painfully dumb because of the limited controls of phones, but this game perfectly melds the limits into it's features - you only need to swipe with your finger/with your mouse.  The simple controls are justified by the simple mechanics of the game.\nI soon plan to buy quite a few copies of the game for some of my friends, who would enjoy this puzzler - It's a good buy at the (otherwise really reasonable) full price of 3$/€, and and insanely good deal if it goes on a sale.","November 25, 2014","true","54.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/266010/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","LYNE can best be described as a minimalist puzzle game.\n\nEssentially it is a series of logic puzzles generated on a grid, consisting of coloured nodes and permeable gears.  Each puzzle must be solved on the fly by connecting paths from one primary node to another through the same coloured nodes and transitional gears.  The goal is to ensure that all nodes and all the slots on each gear are used in the eventual solution.\n\nThere are twenty-five individual puzzles grouped into twenty-six sets, which grow in depth and complexity the greater the progress made.  As you can imagine the puzzles start off deliberately simple allowing players to grasp the basic elements of gameplay.  Later puzzles require an ever increasing amount of convoluted paths to be drawn in order to use all the available nodes and gear slots.  In addition the game also generates a set of daily time-limited puzzles which vary in complexity and must be finished each day or they disappear until they are generated sometime in the future.\n\nFinding the solution to each puzzle can take between a few seconds and a few minutes depending on your ability. If you become stuck a combination of trial and error will eventually lead you to your goal.  If you really dislike puzzle-solving take heart, for what I found truly amazing about LYNE is that it that solutions become intuitive.  Drawing the correct paths take on an almost organic feel.  Someone on the forums said that 'it feels like LYNE rewires the way your brain works,' and it does feel like that.\n\nDespite the graphics feeling simplistic they are cleanly drawn and totally appropriate.  While there is no music to speak of the game uses a series of medolic sounds with every mouse stroke that rise in frequency the the faster the connections are made.  Together these sounds have an almost hypnotic quality which Im sure sublimally urges you on to complete the next objective.\n\nIf you dont like solving puzzle or find that your brain just isnt suited to play such games then this might be an exception.  It is such a wonderful distraction from the plethora of online shooters, RTS and RPG/adventure games out there that you should really give it a go.  LYNE is everything it says it is on the store page and worth the cheap price.  Glad I made this purchase.","November 20, 2014","true","22.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

This game was fairly cheap and runs on my macbook!\n\nI bought this game thinking it’ll be quick and easy, I’m a smart noodle what’s the worse that could happen? Ughhhhhhhh!! You will shed many tears, suffer from hunger and lose sleep over the course of a few days/hours if you’re determined like me to finish this game ASAP.\n\nThis game took me about maximum of 42 hours of gameplay because I like to afk a bit as I paint my nails or chat with friends. In that aspect, it’s a good afk game where you can pause and do other stuff but won’t lose everything you clicked. However, you lose your focus and cry to your friends that you have no idea what you’re doing!\n\nThis game is fairly repetitive and sort of boring, I don’t think this game is addicting at all. Each letter consists of 25 puzzles and each puzzle can take you a minute or 15 minutes to complete. You need to have some outside incentive to play this game quite honestly. I had a bet with someone that whoever gets to Z first would get nudes! This helped fuel me to get to Z because I feared I would lose the bet. Phew!\n\nWhat really kept me going were my friends who reminded me every passing hour that my nudes were on the line. Also, my lovely K-pop playlist that played in the background, so thank you Afterschool and hot Korean bad boy groups.\n\nWould I do it again? No! I’m not really a fan of puzzle games, I would rather play multiplayer games that involve killing bit*ches. But if you enjoy games like this to play leisurely and not about that steam profile life, then I would recommend this game for you. You got nothing to lose but perhaps your sanity!\n\nXO Jenny\n\nP.S.

The concept is simple, and the execution elegant and the final product represents a great casual game for the bored.\n\nThe Pros:Loads of Levels! - There are close to 1000 levels to be completed - a set of 25 levels for each letter of the alphabet. Each set has it's theme, such as number of colors, number of nodes and the size of the matrix.\n\nGreat Design - Vectorised graphics, bright colors, ability to unlock and apply color themes, seamless transitions through levels and an intuitive menu. This game looks and feel gorgeous.\n\nRelaxing - This is a great casual timekiller that you can pop in every now and then. The music is calming, the gameplay smooth and nobody rushes you.\n\nRandom Daily Sets! - Finished the game and feeling you need more levels? Don't worry! Every day you get a randomly generated pair of sets for you to complete!\n\nThe Price - Without discount, you can get this game for the modest price of 2,99Euros, which is great considering the ammount of levels you can get out of this thing.\n\nAchievements - Just as a bonus, the achievements unlock as you complete sets, and are each a letter. If you have an achievement showcase, you can write words with your acomplishments and it seems to be really popular among LYNE owners.\nThe Cons:Repetitive - The game runs out of new game mechanics early, as it presents them to you in the first sets, and then it's just a combination of those in the rest of the game. Which isn't a bad thing, but it means that this game is best enjoyed in small sessions, as doing many levels at once can prove to become boring.\nConclusion:If you enjoy a good puzzle game and a casual experience that looks and feels like a quality program, don't hesitate to grab this one off the "shelf", especially considering the small price tag.

At $3, you are essentially paying for 650 (divided between 27 sets) preset puzzles plus 50-75 (divided between 2-3 sets) puzzles randomly generated daily. The game has a broad range of difficulty so it's accessible to all kinds of players. You can essentially cherrypick which puzzles to do because the game rotates between single to multicolor puzzles that add an extra layer of complexity to the puzzles.\n\nAesthetically-speaking, the minimalist design is a boon for this game. The lack of clutter helps one get in the mood for some puzzle-solving. There's also an assortment of color palettes made available simply by playing through entire sets and earning 'seeds'. Overall the game is quite easy on the eyes.\n\nWith that said, I think that $3 for this game is quite a steal. I used to do all sorts of different puzzles on the newspaper back when that was more of a thing. It's great to have something affordable that I can default to if I ever feel like solving puzzles out of the blue (even after finishing all the preset puzzles). I implore you to at least consider this game if you are a fan of any and all puzzles.","May 21, 2014","true","18.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I imagine that if you could somehow go back in time and show LYNE to the ancient cavemen on their primitive stone tablets, that they would hardly believe what they were seeing.  They would probably club you to death and burn your body as a sacrifice to the sun god or something, but hey, what do those crazy cavemen know.\n\nFast forward to today, where we can play LYNE without being beaten to death, mostly, and the awe and wonder this game exudes are no less than they were in the hypothetical caveman days.  Let us take a look at what has made LYNE the number one line connecting game released on March 17th, 2014.\n\nShapes.  We all love shapes, and LYNE delivers several of the greatest shapes known to man.  Square?  Got it.  Triangle?  Bam!  Octagon?  You know it!  But there is more to LYNE than that.  You have to draw lines between the shapes!  Draw the lines the way they want you to and you get to move on to the next level; fail, and your life is an empty meaningless shell.  It really is perfection, a grim balance between glory and abject failure, a balancing act so delicate that one false move could send you spiralling into a vortex of existential dread so severe you would need thirteen Kierkegaards to bring you back.

Of those games, Lyne is easily my favorite, and one that I see myself playing over and over, for the rest of my life. The daily challenges add a lot of replayability to the game.\n\nIf you like circuit-based puzzles, you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are very simple, but also very easy/nice on the eyes. Different shapes of varying color on a basic background make for relaxing gameplay, completely at your own pace. There isn't really any music, however, the sounds made when you clear a level is very soothing, and when you get in the zone, clearing levels very quickly provides good, positive feedback. After you complete several levels, you unlock the ability to switch the background theme to different color palettes, unlocking more options as you progress through the game.\n\nThe controls are super simple - you just click and drag the mouse to move your circuit to (applicable) areas on the grid. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, however, the higher-difficulty levels can be extremely challenging. Difficulty is indicated by the number of triangles.\n\nEach "set" of levels consists of 25 levels, and there is one set for every letter of the alphabet (26). On top of that, there are daily challenges that are changed throughout the week, starting at the easiest difficulty on Mondays, and increasing to brutal, oh-my-god-just-kill-me-this-is-so-hard-and-I-haven't-slept-yet-trying-to-finish-this-level torture on Sundays. Achievement hunters will have a grand time trying to 100% complete this, and I play this regularly whenever I have some time to fill. As mentioned before, I see myself playing this game for the rest of my life.\n\nThe goal in Lyne is to get all same-shaped circuits to connect to each other - the two bold shapes are your start and end points (you cannot miss a non-bold shape, and you cannot continue the circuit if you connect the start/end points). As you progress, more colors/shapes will be added, increasing the difficulty. Nodes will eventually appear (double, triple, and quadruple sockets), and these must be filled completely for you to solve the level. Nodes are also critical in the later stages, as they will allow your circuits to cross otherwise uncrossable pathways (ex: if you have a green connection going diagonally, you cannot have other circuits passing through that diagonal line). You can undo your connections at will with no penalty, and there is no time limit - everything is completely at-your-own-pace.\n\nOne of the best attributes of this game is how it rewards patience, perseverance, and trial-and-error. Many times, I have solved a puzzle by trying every possible route/solution I can think of. Other times, I will go back a few levels and have a sudden moment of clarity because you will realize that most levels in set follow very similar "themes" to solve the puzzles. For example, one set may have a pattern of having you use the longest path (or the shortest path).

The biggest downside to this game is the music, there's only sound effects and I don't reckon hearing any music at all. The sound effects are repetitive, but due to the nature of the game, it is understandable.\n\nOverall, you should definately play LYNE if you like puzzle games. It is a very original game, with more than 15 hours of gameplay and infinite replayability!

From A to Z, each letter is a level with 25 different puzzles to solve. They're all logic and you're not limited by an unique solution, most of puzzles have many ways to solve and/or complete.\n\nYou have a decent amount of achievements, skins and levels to unlock while playing, not to mention the daily challenge chosen randomly every day.\n\nIt's hard to talk about the difficult level, because you start learning the basics. There are no specific tutorial, but you feel you're learning how to play since the most easier and early level, and this learning curve is very smooth to notice in a bad way. Each level difficult are represented by triangles from 1 to 5. From letter K to the end, you start to find some "serious" challenge, because of the 4 and 5 triangles difficult of these sets, but until that you can figure out how it works and then it's not a game you have to quit because it's too difficult.\n\nThere are no soundtrack, just interactive sounds, and i can't feel it like a relaxing game, like many other people feel it.\nIn my very own opinion, Lyne is one of the better puzzle games i have in my Steam account.","July 19, 2014","true","22.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/266010/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\n\nLyne is a simple, yet intuitive indie puzzle game that revolves around creating "pathways" that link matching shapes together without crossing paths of other color variants. Honestly, that is the goal of every puzzle in the game, but what I enjoyed about Lyne was the variety in which you could complete such a simple task. The game takes you through the letters of the alphabet and, as you'd probably guess, the further along you go, the harder and more complex the puzzles become. You start out with two colors and a simple solution is often identified quickly, allowing you to seamlessly glide through the first set of puzzles. As you progress, the game adds sort of "gateways" in which a set number of lines, or lynes if you will, can pass through without conflicting with one another; think of it as a sort of intersection.\n\nAs time progresses , the game adds more shapes to match and gateways to fill and it can become quite complicated, but never frustratingly so, in my opinion. What I enjoyed about the difficulty is it never really spiked; the game gradually increased the challenge as you progressed. I never felt annoyed or frustrated at puzzles I could not figure out and that is what I loved about Lyne.\n\nThe game's simple, yet soothing atmosphere makes it a pleasure, even when you can't, for the life of it all, figure out the solution. Aside from all that, what I enjoy most about Lyne are the daily puzzles. These are randomly generated each day and vary in difficulty - from easy to extreme. This added feature gives the game replay-ability when you feel like sitting down and cracking out a few puzzles to unwind, or for a mental challenge. If you like puzzle games, I'd suggest Lyne.\n\nPros\n\nChallenge - Lyne can be tough, but gentle. It never seems unfair just for the sake of challenging you.\nReplay-ability - With daily puzzles to try, even after you beat the game there is still always something to try.\nVisuals - Lyne is simple, yet nice to look at and to listen to. You may also unlock new color modes to select what works best for your eyesight and ascetic tastes.    Cons\n\nCons - It is hard to say. I like to think every game can improve itself, but it's hard to find something in Lyne I didn't enjoy. I suppose it would be nice to have more puzzles each day if you complete the daily ones; perhaps an option to randomly generate some based on your desired difficulty setting.\nOverall, I enjoyed Lyne. I originally bought it for the achievements to use in my profile, but found I got a lot more for my money than just virtual achievements and I was very pleased. If you enjoy puzzle games and are looking for something new, I suggest checking Lyne out.","October 5, 2015","true","17.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The gameplay is basic and increasing in difficulty as you unlock the latter levels. The player must connect the lines without intersecting, unless through a junction box, to go from a start place to the end place.  All pieces must be connected and in some instances a certain number of intersections must occur through junction boxes.  There is also a dailly puzzle generator that can be used to generate puzzles of differing difficulties randomly each day.\n\nAchievements are based upon completing sets of 25 puzzles.  There are 26 sets going from A-Z with an achievement for each one plus achievements for doing certain amounts of dailly puzzles. An achievement is also given for opening different color pallets.  Which are opened by completing puzzles.\n\nMy personal experience of the gameplay it was fun right at first.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/recommended/266010/","thesmolder","Akihiko Sanada","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/","105 products in account","Introduction: LYNE has been described as "deceptively simple", and it is just that. It encourages the player to sharpen and expand their minds as they struggle to work his/her way through a series of puzzles, varying in difficulty. LYNE combines soft tones, and pastel colours to make even the most perplexing maze a relaxing experience. I would recommend this game to new and experienced puzzle-lovers alike, as I cannot imagine a world where one would leave LYNE feeling less than satisfied.\n\nStory: LYNE is lacking in story, or rather, there is none - But this does not take away from the enjoyable experience that it provides.\n\nGameplay: The feature that stands out the most is the games progression. LYNE rewards its players through achievements, and not just the Steam kind. The puzzles are divided into sets of 25, in categories A-Z. As each set of 25 puzzles is completed, the player will be awarded a set of points (which eventually unlock different colour schemes and skins), and occasionally unlock another set. There is no rule for beating the puzzles in order, which prevents the player getting stuck on a difficult puzzle, and quitting the game. In the event that a player runs into one of these complex obstacles, they can simply move onto the next piece in the set, and return to the difficult one later with a fresh mind.\n\nThe fact that many puzzle games stick follow the concept of offering only one solution to each problem makes LYNE even more refreshing. There is always more than one way to reach completion through the labyrinth consisting of dots, colours and shapes. Furthermore, LYNE provides a fresh set of Daily puzzles to everyone, which keeps interest alive even after it has been finished. It is a game that can be picked up, and put down without the fear of having to restart it after a break.\n\nWhile LYNE is not the most complicated puzzle-game on record, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the feeling of well-deserved gratification after an intellectual pursuit. LYNE will make you think, encourage you to challenge yourself, and potentially rekindle ones love for problem solving.\n\nControls: Amazingly simple. I absolutely adore the controls of LYNE, for the purposes of casual gaming. All you have to do is click and drag, and sometimes that is actually a good thing. =)\n\nGraphics: The interface is heavily geometric, and filled with pastels. Of course, you can unlock various customization options that will permit you to change the appearance of your LYNE to your liking. The graphics are pleasant, but I would not go as far as to call them godly.\n\nSound: LYNE's soundrack is simplistic, and not it's best point. While the sounds are soothing and dynamic, I was not particularly impressed by LYNE's audio appeal.\n\nReplay Value: I will definitely be playing LYNE again, and can say that it won't lose its appeal after one playthrough. You might not want to play it everyday of your entire life, but sometimes, you might find yourself venturing back to it.","July 6, 2014","true","41.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The publisher and developer of this game is Thomas Bowker. This is an intriguing puzzle game, with actual puzzles, you don't walk around and move objects to opens doors and stuff like other puzzlers, in this one it is like a simulation with nifty graphics. The aim of the game is to connect all objects together, and you can't leave any untouched.\n\nThe game consists of 26 levels, each letter of the english alphabet is a level. Each level consists of 25 puzzles. All up you will end up completeing 650 different puzzles. But thats not it, there are also daily challanges with can have from 1 to 3 puzzles, some are harder than others.\n\nThe game may seem easy at first, but as you get to higher level letters it can get rather challanging. As you get to higher levels you will get harder puzzles, this means you will get more variety of different colours, different grey ones requering more numbers, and a bigger amount of shapes. It can get rather challanging at the higher levels.\n\nYou can finish the game anywhere from 10-15 hours, but of course it all depends on how good you are at this game. The achievments in this game are quite unique, everytime you finish a letter you will get an achievment which is that letter, so you can spell words and stuff on your profile in the achievment tab things, its pretty cool.\n\nThis game is pretty cool, its challanging, cheap... what more could you want, my final verdict is a 9/10","January 1, 2015","true","11.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/266010/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Now THIS is how you make a puzzle game! Both elegant in its simplicity and devious in its complexity, LYNE is a beautiful blend of pick-up-and-play accessibility and fair, reasonable challenge that pretty much never punishes and only rewards. I'm not sure of the exact terminology of every element of the game, so I'm just going to have to wing it and hope it all makes sense...\n\nThe easiest way to probably explain it is to say it's a game of join the dots. There are three main coloured shapes, or nodes, scattered across a gridded board, green triangles, red squares and blue diamonds (at least by default, the colour palette can be unlocked and changed throughout the game), with a start and end point for each shape. The object being to drag a line that joins each point whilst also passing through all the faded out nodes of the same shape. So the green line can only pass through the faded green nodes, and so on. There are also neutral nodes that any line can pass through which act as intersections for the different coloured lines. With the exception of these neutral nodes, each node can only be passed through once, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, and a line can never cross through another line. So, basically, connect each start and end point, and fill in the board along the way. As with most puzzle games, it can sound way more complicated in writing than it really is, but within thirty seconds of actual play you'll perfectly understand exactly how the whole thing works.\n\nThe game's first triumph is in teaching itself to the player. With the way it introduces each element of play, the only actions you'll be able to perform are the ones it wants you to learn, further reinforced by brief phases of repetition and minor variation. It won't take long for the series of light bulbs to come on over your head with each new method of covering the board that you learn and you'll soon find yourself steamrolling your way through the opening few stages.\n\nThere are 26 sets of puzzles corrosponding to each letter of the alphabet, with each set containing 25 individual puzzles for a total of 650... yeah, you read that right, 650 puzzles. On top of that there are also random daily sets, but unless I'm mistaken, they at least appeared to me to be a mix of various puzzles from the main sets. It's hard to say how long it takes to complete, given that each player will spend a vastly different amount of time depending on their personal skill level, but I reckon about 30 hours would be a reasonable guess, give or take a few hours.\n\nWhat I really love about this game is how success or failure rests solely in the hands of the player's own determination. With no time limit and no way to technically lose (you either finish a puzzle or you walk away from it), the game is a test of perseverance more than anything. There are a few tricks you can learn to criss-cross your way around a board, but really you'll have to poke and prod at everything and experiment with different routes before honing in on the solution. But rarely will the game leave you hanging, and it'll usually hint as to where you should at least start before working your way out, and from there on it's a gradual process of elimination. It also helps that many puzzles will have multiple methods to solve them, so there is some flexibility in play.\n\nTopping everything off is a slick, clean aesthetic that's minimalist but still appealing. I wasn't a massive fan of the audio as the pinging chimes gradually grated against me and I instead opted to play my own music in the background the entire time, but that's a very minor gripe given how it doesn't really serve any fuctional role in the game play and you can easily live without it. But what I was a massive fan off was the price which is the sweet little cherry on top that should be the final nudge to any fence-sitters still not entirely sure whether or not they should pick this up. Protip, you should.","September 26, 2015","true","30.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are still plenty of trial & error moments but at least it tells the brain to actually do something.

Yes, I admit that was one of the reasons why I got the game in its first place. But behind all the letters and showcasing there is actually a nice little game, if not 100% when it comes to enjoyment. I will still reccomend it, though, it is a really good game that is not too expensive even when it's not on sale.\n\nSo what's the good things besides the achievements? The simple concept of connecting shapes, or dots if you want over all the letters in the alphabet  plus extra levels that changes every day (Daily), and a nice bonus that you can change the colour pallette of the background and the shapes. 25 levels per letter set will keep you entertained(or frustrated) throughout the hours, days, week... depending on how fast you complete. There are excellent guides however should you get stuck somewhere. Also, a huge plus for the silence; no annoying music, just the occasional sounds when you connect lines and makes it to the next level.\n\nThe only downside is the later letter sets when you get the same colour and shapes on every level, sometimes it gets a bit monotonous to do a lot at once. It's getting better once you are closer to the end, though.\n\nLooking at both sides of the games, it is a really good one and well worth its price so get it whether it's on sale or not. Not much bad aside from above, either and if those would have had a bit more variety I would probably make huge shoutouts about getting it.

On a game with 95% review score?\n\nWell, as nice as this game may be, there are a few problems that make me not recommend it to others.\n\n1. Lack of variety\nSure, it has 500 levels. But after 50 or so, you've seen everything. Sure, there may be nodes with even more connections, but it's more of the same, really. The level set names are also quite un-inspired, and the achievements maybe even more so. Also, the unlockable themes are not that much of a novelty either.\n\n2. Not learnable\nThe gameplay itself has a problem too though. It's not learnable. There's not really a way to "become good" at this game. Solving levels is merely a case of trying many combinations until you hit the right one. There's a lot of trial and error. Trial and error is usually bad, and I don't see why it's good here.\n\n3. Lack of sense of fulfillment\nThe third problem is the level solutions themselves. They're too abstract, and don't resemble anything, and after a while, all levels look the same at first glance. Solving a level just doesn't give me that feeling of accomplishment that other puzzles can. When you solve a nonogram, at least you end up with a nice pixel art picture. Here it's just connected shapes - for all levels. It's all a bit too similar.\n\nAlso, someone could probably write an algorithm to solve these puzzles. :)\n\nThe game sure has its positives though. I like the minimalist look-and-feel, and I think the font choice and color usage are brilliant. Also it's easy to pick-up and play; it hardly requires a tutorial. It's also a nice original idea to toy around with. It's not a bad game. Certainly not! It's just, well, ...not much more than meets the eye?\n\nAnd it's not overpriced. For 3 dollars it's hard to be disappointed. So sure, pick it up if you think you like it. Just don't expect miracles :)","May 6","false","1.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/266010/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Brought to us by Australian indie developer Thomas Bowker, LYNE is a minimalist puzzle game that tasks you with connecting sets of colored shapes, without crossing or re-tracing any lines along the way. If it sounds simple, that’s because it is by design; LYNE claims to be “deceptively simple” yet “infinitely complex”. But does it do enough to set itself apart from the ever-growing library of puzzlers competing for gamers’ attention?\n\nLYNE is designed to be as streamlined and polished as possible. Your first moments with the game set the tone for the entire experience as you’re met with crisp lines, pastel colors and gentle sounds, making for a very refined appearance. The menus are easily navigated as well, and overall everything feels calculated and elegant. The puzzles themselves are divided into lettered sets of 25, and completing a set earns you anywhere from one to five points, depending on the difficulty. As you accumulate points, you’ll unlock additional level sets and color palettes. There are hundreds of puzzles pre-loaded, so there's no shortage of challenges to tackle!\n\nThe puzzles start off easy, acquainting you with the controls and basic gameplay with a few stylized visual prompts. However, after the first level set you’re on your own. Still, the difficulty curve is gentle enough to welcome even those who have never tried a puzzle game before, while still appealing to even the most hardcore of puzzle masters. No lives and no time limit means the pressures of performance and progression are removed, placing the focus on the player’s experience with the game. There is a surprising amount of variety in the puzzle design, all while only ever using four different shapes. It’s not overcomplicated, and if you ever feel yourself growing tired of looking at the same colored shapes in different arrangements you can simply change the color palette for a fresh visual experience. Completing a puzzle sends it sliding off to the left to be replaced by another, and a total lack of load time helps LYNE maintain a superb flow.\n\nAs excellent as the puzzle design is, the secret of LYNE lies in its audio. Ambient and echoing but never obtrusive, the soft tones that emanate from each connected shape combine with the minimalist visuals to create an impressively immersive and calming environment. I often ended up playing it after a stressful day, and found relief in its gentle, tranquil presentation. That combined with the satisfaction of puzzle completion means it easy to lose yourself in LYNE.\n\nAt $2.99, its price is a bit steep for a seemingly simple puzzle game. It’s a shame so many people will pass over LYNE without a second thought just because it’s not free or under a buck, because it truly does offer a unique and immersive experience.\n\nLYNE is a great game not only for its clever puzzles, but for the soul soothing elegance it emanates throughout the experience. Don’t let the price stop you: this is a game worth owning. If you’re looking for the next Tetris you won’t find it here, but LYNE distances itself from the frantic and competitive nature of other games in the genre for a gentle yet challenging experience that is perfect for nearly every gamer.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 26, 2014","true","50.5"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

I like to sort of just swallow them whole, kind of sink myself into them until I'm drowning on puzzles. Most puzzle games I go through in one night of glorious puzzle binging—but Lyne was never like that. It's a much more insidious game, one that I come back to again and again when I'm looking for a casual mix of mind-bending and mindless. It's, just as it claims to be, a game that will "knot your brain as it calms your soul". I put on some music in the background, fire up Lyne, and sit back and relax while my mouse sort of glides through the puzzles and my mind struggles futilely to keep up with my intuition.\n\nOther users have compared Lyne to a much more complex game of connect the dots. The goal of the game is simple: you have a board with different colored shapes. Connect the shapes. Make a line. Fill the board. Repeat. It's never more or less complex than that. It becomes a sort of mantra the farther you go in the game: Connect the shapes. Make a line. Fill the board. Connect the shapes. Make a line. Fill the board. Connect the shapes . . .\n\nUntil you get stuck, of course—and you will get stuck. Sometimes your brain tries to think about the puzzle more than it should and then suddenly you aren't actually going any where at all anymore. That's when you set aside the game, do something else for a while, and then come back to it when the urge to play strikes you again. That is the most intriguing thing about Lyne: it seems to be a game that you can only win by trying not to win. Too much effort breaks the peace that Lyne tries to create and will only serve to frustrate and annoy you.  You don't solve a Lyne puzzle, you just know the answer and complete it.\n\nLyne is, without a doubt, my favorite puzzle time-waster. It's what I play late at night, when it's too close to bed time for more video games, but I'm too far away from falling asleep to actually put my head down on the pillow. It goes well with a hazy sort of pre-sleep understanding and logic, one that can only be recreated during the day time by a fiercely zen attitude and some slow tunes playing in the background. I'd even call it the most productive sort of "zoning out" that I've ever managed to achieve.","January 12, 2015","true","21.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/forgottendawn/recommended/266010/","forgottendawn","Forgotten Dawn (KKS)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/forgottendawn/","182 products in account","I think LYNE's strong point lies in its simplicity and the way the few elements work symbiotically with each other. Let's take a look at why I consider LYNE a successful experiment in subtractive design.\n\nIt's a casual game, first of all. It's not meant for scores or competitiveness, it gives away a relaxing atmosphere. It is, therefore, designed to be picked up in - you guessed it - casual moments of your day. This puzzle game looks like a graphic designer with some coding expertise decided to gather up some ideas in his/her spare time and coalesced into this little gem.\n\nThere's only one objective, which is to link two shapes of the same colour and geometrical features through other shapes (we could call them "nodes" for convenience's sake) arranged in a grid-like manner. The rule is that the path linking those shapes must be one-way and cannot cross other paths or trace itself. The concept follows a similar route to that of another game called Transmission, but the mechanics in LYNE are even more stripped-down and simple.\n\nThe learning curve is quite forgiving at first as the game gives a generous introduction of the golden rule, and by the time players hit the third set, the difficulty starts ramping up considerably. The way puzzles are arranged and structured makes LYNE a flexible game system where it is possible to come up with an infinite number of puzzles. A hint of this can be tasted through the randomly generated Daily sets where players can test their skills beyond the preset alphabetical sets.\n\nWhen a puzzle game reaches that level of flexibility (i.e. Portal), that's where it becomes successful and functional to its premise. We could well say that for a puzzle game, LYNE is a triumph of subtractive design. There's no plot, no lore, no real soundtrack, no 3D graphics, but for the kind of format the mechanics make up for the lack of those elements. Which brings me to my next point, that not every game needs one or more conventional design elements to make it successful.\n\nSometimes it's about making a simple rule, thinking out of the box, cutting out excesses, and slowly build a functional world around it where every element carries its own weight to the system and plays its own fundamental role. There's no absolute rule regulating such aesthetic, but that's what makes it thrilling. That sometimes even a simple little game like LYNE does it right.","January 21, 2015","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Soon, though, the game bares its teeth. Shapes are positioned in a manner that makes successful pathways between them all far from immediately obvious, especially once you realize paths cannot cross. Junction boxes add to the task, demanding you enter them a specific number of times to illuminate all their lights. Failure merely results in a sadly pulsating red outline and the realization you must rethink, experiment, and iterate.\n\nAt this point, Lyne could have become a frustrating mess, but smart design eliminates any notion of such a problem. Paths between shapes can be partially created and temporarily abandoned while you fashion the route for another. There’s no limit on time or attempts, and levels are unlocked in sizable sets, meaning you can always try an alternative if you find yourself stuck. Conversely, if you become a Lyne guru in short order, there are procedurally generated daily levels available once you’ve worked your way through the first two sets of 25 apiece.","July 13, 2014","true","34.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I like to sort of just swallow them whole, kind of sink myself into them until I'm drowning on puzzles. Most puzzle games I go through in one night of glorious puzzle binging—but Lyne was never like that. It's a much more insidious game, one that I come back to again and again when I'm looking for a casual mix of mind-bending and mindless. It's, just as it claims to be, a game that will "knot your brain as it calms your soul". I put on some music in the background, fire up Lyne, and sit back and relax while my mouse sort of glides through the puzzles and my mind struggles futilely to keep up with my intuition.\n\nOther users have compared Lyne to a much more complex game of connect the dots. The goal of the game is simple: you have a board with different colored shapes. Connect the shapes. Make a line. Fill the board. Repeat. It's never more or less complex than that. It becomes a sort of mantra the farther you go in the game: Connect the shapes. Make a line. Fill the board. Connect the shapes. Make a line. Fill the board. Connect the shapes . . .\n\nUntil you get stuck, of course—and you will get stuck. Sometimes your brain tries to think about the puzzle more than it should and then suddenly you aren't actually going any where at all anymore. That's when you set aside the game, do something else for a while, and then come back to it when the urge to play strikes you again. That is the most intriguing thing about Lyne: it seems to be a game that you can only win by trying not to win. Too much effort breaks the peace that Lyne tries to create and will only serve to frustrate and annoy you.  You don't solve a Lyne puzzle, you just know the answer and complete it.\n\nLyne is, without a doubt, my favorite puzzle time-waster. It's what I play late at night, when it's too close to bed time for more video games, but I'm too far away from falling asleep to actually put my head down on the pillow. It goes well with a hazy sort of pre-sleep understanding and logic, one that can only be recreated during the day time by a fiercely zen attitude and some slow tunes playing in the background. I'd even call it the most productive sort of "zoning out" that I've ever managed to achieve.","January 12, 2015","true","21.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its a puzzle game that makes you think about every move you make. And the great thing is that it doesn't make you restart the level if you did it wrong. I spent no longer than 3-4 minutes on a sinlge level. And everytime I completed that level to go to the next one, I felt a rush like I had finished something amazing. There are daily puzzles that can range in difficulty everyday. Sure it might begin to get a little boring after a while of playing it because it seems like just doing the same things, but I think its a wonderful game.

It got pretty simple mechanics, but is still able to make it selfe surprisingly complex. Some might argue it's a bit repetitive, sense there's not really anything new being introduced later on in form of gameplay, but i personally never found it to be a problem.\nQuiet the opposite, it's the simplicity that's making it so very great. Because it makes it perfect to just sit down with a couple of minutes now and then and just.....relax.....with some nice music, your choice ofc. And with the daily levels you're always guaranteed with something new every day.\n\nSo quick summary, you get what you see. Nothing more, nothing less.

Soon, though, the game bares its teeth. Shapes are positioned in a manner that makes successful pathways between them all far from immediately obvious, especially once you realize paths cannot cross. Junction boxes add to the task, demanding you enter them a specific number of times to illuminate all their lights. Failure merely results in a sadly pulsating red outline and the realization you must rethink, experiment, and iterate.\n\nAt this point, Lyne could have become a frustrating mess, but smart design eliminates any notion of such a problem. Paths between shapes can be partially created and temporarily abandoned while you fashion the route for another. There’s no limit on time or attempts, and levels are unlocked in sizable sets, meaning you can always try an alternative if you find yourself stuck. Conversely, if you become a Lyne guru in short order, there are procedurally generated daily levels available once you’ve worked your way through the first two sets of 25 apiece.","July 13, 2014","true","34.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For me personally, I love this game. However I can see that this game is not for everyone.\nFor people who are looking to buy this game, it's a puzzle game with a simple concept. Just connect all the shapes with the same color together. Simple, right?\nIt is simple to understand and pick up. The artwork and music blend well together and I never feel tired of looking or hearing the game. There are plenty of levels for you. Like, a lot of them.  Basically, it is everything you want in a puzzle game.\nThere is not much bad to say about the game besides that this game is not for everyone. Some people just do not enjoy puzzles games like this. This of course is totally understandable. But this game is relatively cheap so it would not hurt that much to try it out.\n","December 3, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I personally like puzzle games, and while this game has a lot of achievements, they are all doable. It provides a challenge to the mind and brain, and is enjoyable (yet frustrating at times when figuring out some of the stumper puzzles, which if we admit it, happens in many puzzle games and gives it a challenge/a reason to play and beat it). The art style and animation is very well done, along with the addition of daily puzzles which change every day.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game.","November 14, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately it's not even easy to manually move the save game files as there are none, the game apparently uses a registry save system.\nSince the game is on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone as well, it would greatly benefit from a cross platform save system, so you could continue your game wherever you are or whatever device you are on, unfortunately that has not been implemented.\n\nNonetheless it is still an enjoyable game if you can get past the shortcomings as far as game saving and switching from device to device goes.\n\n","August 5, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love it because it is exactly what any game that has those isn't.\nIn all honesty, I'd rather have something that is both challenging and fun, and yeah a background color change doesn't hurt either, than have the newest high graphics, most detailed texrtures, and most complex physics engine out there.\n\nSometimes, when done right, "Simple" can be one of the best games out there and you don't even know because you don't even give it a chance because it's "Simple".\nGive this game at least a chance and who knows, you may like Puzzle games after all.","January 20, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/recommended/266010/","enixe","Enix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/enixe/","174 products in account","LYNE is an abstract, challenging puzzle game. Connect different shapes from start to finish in order to complete a level.\n\nDesign & Art The design of the game is kept simplistic, basic shapes and a background. Overall the visuals are appealing for a puzzle game, kept basic on intention, because a puzzle game does not really need good graphics.\n\nAnimations feel fitting and even help you out in some cases (see "gameplay" for more info).\n\nControls LYNE is controlled by mouse. The game gives your an understandable introduction tutorial on how to complete the puzzles.\n\nSound & Music A soundtrack does not actually exist. It is more like a shallow and eerie electronic synth playing some notes in the background. The soundeffects are nice, but could get repetitive if you play this game for too long. The option to turn the sounds off is available.\n\nGameplay Simply put, LYNE is a game consisting of 27 sets á 25 puzzles waiting to be completed. While you start fairly easy, it will get very difficult in later sets. The goal for every puzzle is the same: Connect both of the same shapes with each other by drawing a line between them. You drag the shapes in order to draw the connection. But it is not that easy: Later on, you will need to connect additional shapes with the same line or even multiple shapes at the same time. Another rule is that the connecting lines cannot cross each other. A little animation will hint you, if you try to make that mistake.\n\nBesides the alphabetical sets, there is a daily rotation of random puzzles. The rotation starts on easy on mondays and will get progressively higher in difficulty throughout the week. The weekend will use mixed difficulties.\n\nAn option to change the colors of the game is available, if you gather enough triangles scores for solving sets or daily puzzle sets.\n\nWeakpoints While LYNE has an actual learning curve, some of the puzzles seem really hard, sometimes trail-and-error was the last resort for me. I rather enjoy games that can be completely solved either through process of elimination or through finding creative solutions, hence I had some times where I put the game down for some time.\n\nAlso, be aware that this is a puzzle game and thus does not have much additional content. After you completed the main sets, there isn't much left to do besides fulfilling the daily tasks.\n\nThere only exist certain color schemes, a complete color modification would be much nicer in my opinion.\n\nAlso, while playing this on different machines, I noticed that your progress and score is saved locally, meaning if you have a laptop and download this game on said laptop while you already played LYNE on your home PC, then your score and progress in the alphabetical sets will NOT transfer.\n\nConcluding Thoughts LYNE is a little but nice, time consuming, challenging but fair puzzle game. The visuals are intentionally kept basic, in order to conform with the gameplay, which is clearly in the foreground here. While the game can look boring and bland, do not let yourself get fooled, this game is one of the teeth-gnashingly types. I can safely recommend this game for yours truly puzzle solver out there.

You click on the beginning block of a certain color, and drag a path to the finishing block. It's very basic and simple, but it gets more complex when more colors are added, as well as when conjunction blocks are added that can have multiple paths go through them. I only got a couple hours of fun out of it since it's incredibly redundant, but if you're bored or want to exercise your brain a little bit, LYNE isn't a bad place to start.

Yes.\n\nLYNE is a simple and crisp puzzler that requires players to connect shapes on a grid with lines that are not allowed to overlap (unless there is a later mechanic in the game for such a thing). The player must use limited space and combination of connector pieces to have all shapes connected to their "endpoints".\n\nThis game is very clever and I think it hits the difficulty curve mostly right on the head (I found some puzzles easier than prior ones). It also seems like the player can eventually figure out any puzzle through pure trial of elimination, though that may take much time. So even if you have a hard time with a puzzle, just try all the possible combinations until you win. Lyne is also often used by Steam users to decorate their profile with words using the alphabetical acheivements from beating each "world".\n\nI can easily recommend, especially due to it's low price. When it's on sale, it is often less than $1 which is arguably a steal for the quality and value of the game.","December 26, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gentle tones made when connecting the shapes are very soft and soothing and with the right color scheme makes for a really relaxing experience. Along with the A-Z puzzle sets which get more challenging, you also get random daily puzzles which is neat. Some of the harder puzzles will take you a while to complete but once you get them, that feeling of accomplishment feels amazing.\n\nIf you need a relaxing, casual experience (and at a great price I might add), I highly recommend LYNE.\n","January 25, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Infinitely complex." for once, a description that is actually accurate! Indeed, the style of game is incredibly simple and doesn't innovate too much (you draw lines between nodes, activating all of them the necessary number of times with a specific or non-specific colour), but it stretches the use of this mechanic to its full extent and doesn't leave you feeling like there's untapped potential. The style is charming and minimalist, and as you progress, you can change the colour palette to always keep the style familiar, but slightly more exciting - and changing the colour palette whenever a new one unlocks DOES make the game feel fresh.\n\nA unique part of this game is the addition of Daily puzzles, and while I first approached it with some skepticism, thinking it would simply repeat puzzles from the main sets, it truly does bring in new challenges each day that keeps the mind active and sharp.\n\nOverall, It's great for people interested in working their brains without taking them out onto the verandah and beating them with a cricket bat.","December 23, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunniepot/recommended/266010/","Hunniepot","Hunniepot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunniepot/","29 products in account","LYNE is a seemingly simple puzzle game with basic objectives, a multitude of levels, and an euphoric atmosphere.\n\nThe objectives are simple enough: connect the lines and fill up all of the spaces as you go. As the puzzles progress, different variations in the puzzles create new scenarios, and thus increase the complexity of each puzzle. By completing the puzzle, you progress onward to the next, and so on and so forth. There is no losing in LYNE. There is no time limit, either. You can take as long as you would like to solve each puzzle, and there is no penalty for simply coming back to that puzzle later.\n\nIn the game, there are 26 levels, ranging from letters A to Z. Each level has sub-levels of 25. This equivalates to 650 puzzles just in the regular game mode alone. However! After completing set A and B (I believe), the player is then allowed access to daily sets. These daily puzzles consist of a version A and B, both having 25 sublevels in them. That's another 50 new puzzles per day. These puzzles range in difficulty and are completely random. With a staggering number of 700+ puzzles in just a week, there is plenty to do on LYNE.\n\nNot only is there no pressure for you to whiz by the game, but there is also a very calming and entracing soundtrack that accompanies you as you play. With each movement of the puzzle pieces, there are tones that mix together and with the soundtrack to create some really beautiful, relaxing music. Not only is this music a nice stress-reliever, but there is an actual science behind it. The ambient noises actually promote brainwave activity, thus amplifying a better mood, problem-solving, cognition, and much more. But, hey, who doesn't like to just hear something nice playing in the background?\n\nAll in all, LYNE is a fantastic game that can be played by any one of any age. Not too mention it is affordable at only $2.99 (about $0.75 with a coupon). It's a great way to relax after a long day at work, decompress after some stressful online match, or just to simply pass the time. If you haven't played it already, I strongly recommend that you do. It is really a gem that will have you hooked!\n\n10/10","June 30, 2014","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not usually a fan of puzzle games but I absolutely love this game! It's simple to play and unexpectedly challenging, but it's still relaxing and very fun. I haven't finished the game yet, but it appears even when you finish all of the alphabetical sets there'll still be a daily set for you to come back and play. It's a pretty cheap game, so you'll be getting more than your money's worth for it. It's pretty cheap to begin with (and you can get the coupon from crafting a badge - I received both 75% and 90% off coupons for this game) so there's no reason not to buy!","July 27, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What I thought was going to be yet another average, indistinguishable piece of mediocrity turned out to be an incredibly lovely and enchantingly minimalist puzzle game.\n\nIn fact, LYNE is a rare and wonderful breed of puzzler: the one that isn't as interested in killing your mind as it is in trying to make you think calmly and cleverly.\n(I mean, I haven't beaten the later levels, which I assume are miles more challenging, but the game's calm atmosphere contributes a great deal to the smoothness of the entire expreience.)\n\nThe fluidity of the puzzle solving feels like a breath of fresh air. The game controls smoothly (although the game can sometimes confuse one line for another) and the puzzles are open-ended, allowing the player to branch at least a few different pathaways through the level, even if the puzzle requires you to go through a specific idea.\n\nThe game will last for quite a while: The base levels will keep you thinking for days, and the daily challenges will have you thinking for weeks. And the game is great for quickly calming down and relaxing for a few minutes (or an hour).\n\nOverall, LYNE is a nice, calm, lovely game that you can just keep coming back and relaxing too.\n\n9.0 / 10\n\n(One other thing: The game is 100% worth it as $3, but I have seen it go for a lot cheaper. It went for under a dollar during the last summer sale, and I have seen coupons that discount the game for really, really low prices. If you can, get it while it's on sale, but just know that the game is absolutely worth it either way.)","July 29, 2014","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is a puzzle game and despite the simple graphics it can be fun for a while. Another important note is that there is a daily puzzle set released so if you ever want to just play around it can be good for that. (Kind of like doing the daily crossword/sudoku)\n\nDue to the simple nature of the puzzle this game can be a bit repetitive so I would suggest counting on it for an hour of fun every once in a while. The puzzles themselves do not always have unique solutions so when playing I find myself attempting to guess in check on some basic heuristics. This is not necessarily bad, but I find that it means I find that I spend less time critically thinking and more time making a guess and making some basic corrections.\n\n","July 31, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

These were questions that kept popping into my head, and in the end, I always found the answer.\n\nSome puzzles you'll have one attempt and get it right, while others you'll have 30 attempts and say "this level has no answer, it's broken", but then you realize "nah, I'm dumb" when you figure it out. And then you'll play the next level and repeat this cycle.\n\nOverall, like the description of the game says, it is "deceptively simple" and "infinitely complex", but don't let that detour you, it is a challenging and quite fun game if you're into puzzle games.

During the summer sale, I wound up getting a hold of LYNE. And, it can be tough to pull myself away from it at times. What the game itself boils down to is a deceptively good puzzle version of "connect the dots".\n\nThere is large collection of puzzles in this game, with each level containing a set of twenty-five. And yes, these puzzle do get harder as you play on, so there's no shortage of challenge here. Even if you do manage to finish the A-Z levels, there are still daily challenges, so at least there's something of a replay value added.\n\nGraphically speaking, the game is minimalist, so don't expect any eye candy here.

As the puzzles progress, different variations in the puzzles create new scenarios, and thus increase the complexity of each puzzle. By completing the puzzle, you progress onward to the next, and so on and so forth. There is no losing in LYNE. There is no time limit, either. You can take as long as you would like to solve each puzzle, and there is no penalty for simply coming back to that puzzle later.\n\nIn the game, there are 26 levels, ranging from letters A to Z. Each level has sub-levels of 25. This equivalates to 650 puzzles just in the regular game mode alone. However! After completing set A and B (I believe), the player is then allowed access to daily sets. These daily puzzles consist of a version A and B, both having 25 sublevels in them. That's another 50 new puzzles per day. These puzzles range in difficulty and are completely random. With a staggering number of 700+ puzzles in just a week, there is plenty to do on LYNE.\n\nNot only is there no pressure for you to whiz by the game, but there is also a very calming and entracing soundtrack that accompanies you as you play. With each movement of the puzzle pieces, there are tones that mix together and with the soundtrack to create some really beautiful, relaxing music. Not only is this music a nice stress-reliever, but there is an actual science behind it. The ambient noises actually promote brainwave activity, thus amplifying a better mood, problem-solving, cognition, and much more. But, hey, who doesn't like to just hear something nice playing in the background?\n\nAll in all, LYNE is a fantastic game that can be played by any one of any age. Not too mention it is affordable at only $2.99 (about $0.75 with a coupon). It's a great way to relax after a long day at work, decompress after some stressful online match, or just to simply pass the time. If you haven't played it already, I strongly recommend that you do. It is really a gem that will have you hooked!\n\n10/10","June 30, 2014","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a nice little bit of brain training with both fixed levels to work through and daily levels.   The base levels unlock in sets as you complete them as well as do the first two days of daily puzzles.  There are 25 puzzles per set, with 650 puzzles total in the fixed puzzles.   That may sound like a lot, but some puzzles will take seconds to complete while others could take a minute or more so it won't take more than a couple days of regular play to get through them all.  But the daily puzzles tend to add up to another 350 puzzles per week if you play them all.   So even if you blow through the main puzzles in a couple days, there's plenty to come back to.  In addition to all of this there's a sort of meta game of collecting triangles as you play.  Each set is ranked by difficulty with 1 to 5 triangles and if you complete all the puzzles in the set you get those number of triangles added to a master score.   It's not a big thing, but I'm curious to find out what happens at 999 triangles earned out of 999.  I'm about a 120 away from there on the iOS version (so maybe a week and a half more worth of daily puzzles).  It'll take a lot longer on this version since I started it only recently.\n\nIn any event this game is excellent.  Not many puzzle games get me coming back to them... which makes this a pretty special game.  Plus I don't review games if I don't feel they are worth my time.  This one was more than worth making the effort to post a review.","June 27, 2014","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game, effectively, is to find a route through all the nodes on a grid, such that "router" nodes are used the stipulated number of times.   Colourful, relaxing, and very very satisfying.\n\nMost levels have multiple solutions, which grants a very rewarding gameplay.  Most of the levels can be solved with about 10 seconds of observation, and about 5 seconds of swiping.  There are some, however, which require far more consideration.  The longest I spent was about half an hour trying and re-trying paths through the level, until I ended up giving up and cheating, using a hint online.    Other than that one slip, the rest of the game was quite solvable with patience.\n\nPerfectly suited to casual gaming, I left the game minimized, until my tea breaks, when I'd do a level or two.    There are hundreds and hundreds of levels, and with daily levels offering a "quick fix", there's a lot of enjoyment packed into this little puzzler.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who likes things like Sudoku, or quick crosswords.. i.e. that short, quick puzzle fix.\n\n","September 3, 2014","true","99.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is very addictive, fun and enjoyable. The fact that the mechanics are very self-explanatory and easy to expand on make for great gameplay as you are constantly facing surprisingly difficult challeneges. For example, I was playing one of the daily challenges, which features 25 generated puzzles that are completely new, and for the first half, I thought "This is really easy". After that though, I was spending a good 15 - 20 minutes on each level. This game goes from real easy to really challenging very quickly, but for whatever reason, the way it is done doesn't make you feel stupid. You still feel like you are progressing.\n\nBasically, this game is worth the purchase. It has nice sounds and the game is easy to get into. I certainly recommend this game as a very good, if not fantastic puzzle game.\n\n(Plus, there's at least 650 puzzles, plus all the daily puzzles, so you will have more than enough gameplay)","September 10, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game starts off easy, only having one colour and an easy path to go over, but quickly develops in difficulty. By about set 'F', the game has multiple colours, all needing to go somewhere. The simplicity of the graphics and music is done excellently. The whole game is about connecting and drawing lines, but at the same time, covering the entire board and not hitting any other colour. When you finally see the answer, you will realise that it's been staring you in the face the entire time. On some levels, there are these overlapping type squares that allow you to put multiple colours through it at once, although, this is not always useful, seeing as you need to fill that completely as well before the level is finished.\n\nThis game is PERFECT for casual gamers and people who like to spend time on things. LYNE has no time limit so you can spend all day trying to figure out how to bring that red line to the other red area... By the time you finish one set, there's another one. Each set has 25 levels. There are 26 level sets, all have their own names. If you could call a single letter a name. So, 25 times (*) 26 = a whopping 650 words, all for a small price of $3 (to be more precise, $2.99) and during the sales, you can get this game for an even smaller price of $0.49, which is a massive bargain. I mean, 49 cents for a game that will leave you addicted for hours on end, and that's what LYNE is all about, a simple, yet almost perfect puzzle game.\n\nIf all of that hasn't persuaded you to buy this game yet, there's trading cards and steam achievements as well.\n\nPROS:\n- Addictive\n- Fun\n- Annoying\n- Cheap\n- Has trading cards\n- Over 649 levels\n- Made by an Australian\n- Has achievements\n\nCONS:\n- Annoying\n- Addictive\n- Not very many people know about it and they may ask questions about what you're playing","September 24, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not usually a fan of puzzle games but I absolutely love this game! It's simple to play and unexpectedly challenging, but it's still relaxing and very fun. I haven't finished the game yet, but it appears even when you finish all of the alphabetical sets there'll still be a daily set for you to come back and play. It's a pretty cheap game, so you'll be getting more than your money's worth for it. It's pretty cheap to begin with (and you can get the coupon from crafting a badge - I received both 75% and 90% off coupons for this game) so there's no reason not to buy!","July 27, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What I thought was going to be yet another average, indistinguishable piece of mediocrity turned out to be an incredibly lovely and enchantingly minimalist puzzle game.\n\nIn fact, LYNE is a rare and wonderful breed of puzzler: the one that isn't as interested in killing your mind as it is in trying to make you think calmly and cleverly.\n(I mean, I haven't beaten the later levels, which I assume are miles more challenging, but the game's calm atmosphere contributes a great deal to the smoothness of the entire expreience.)\n\nThe fluidity of the puzzle solving feels like a breath of fresh air. The game controls smoothly (although the game can sometimes confuse one line for another) and the puzzles are open-ended, allowing the player to branch at least a few different pathaways through the level, even if the puzzle requires you to go through a specific idea.\n\nThe game will last for quite a while: The base levels will keep you thinking for days, and the daily challenges will have you thinking for weeks. And the game is great for quickly calming down and relaxing for a few minutes (or an hour).\n\nOverall, LYNE is a nice, calm, lovely game that you can just keep coming back and relaxing too.\n\n9.0 / 10\n\n(One other thing: The game is 100% worth it as $3, but I have seen it go for a lot cheaper. It went for under a dollar during the last summer sale, and I have seen coupons that discount the game for really, really low prices. If you can, get it while it's on sale, but just know that the game is absolutely worth it either way.)","July 29, 2014","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's just the kind of person I am. Then, today, I saw the game had cards. "Yay", I thought, "I can get back a percentage of the money I wasted on this!". I fired it up, and the first thing I noticed was that the interface was quite polished. Easy on the eyes, ambient sounds in the background, minimalistic with clean, soft colours.\n\nThe game immediately starts you off with a tutorial, which flows naturally into the main game. The puzzles start off really easily, to let you get a feel for the mechanics. Then it introduces the hubs, as I've taken to calling them, and the game takes off. The main thing that makes the game so great is that almost every puzzle comes naturally, you're seldom stuck on something. That's not to say the puzzles are easy, no, but they're never frustrating. You try to solve one, you see it isn't working out, but you almost always have other methods to follow, there's never a point where you can't think of another way to solve a puzzle.\n\nAnd oh boy is it calming. It's got really soft, ambient sound effects on everything you do, and the levels just flow into eachother. The UI almost never interferes with anything, and is only there when you call for it.\n\nAfter you finish the second puzzle set, you unlock the possibility to play daily puzzles, which mean you'll never run out of content.\n\nIn conclusion, the reason I found out about this game was because it cost me less than 80 cents, but if I had known how good it was beforehand, I'd have gladly shelled out a fiver on it. It's just that good.","June 20, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The first time I played this, several hours passed somehow without notice. It's not overly cerebral, but it requires you to have some amount of spatial and pattern-detecting abilities. If you have none, just think of this as training.\n\nNew levels (and color palettes) are unlocked as you go, and get progressively harder to boot.\n\nAdditionally, there is also the option of daily puzzle challenges (with randomly generated difficulty levels). If you find yourself stuck on a particular puzzle/level, these are a great way to shift your focus and still feel like you accomplished something. But if you're reaaaaally stuck, at some point you unlock an area with content that looks like hints (or possibly solutions) to specific puzzles. I haven't really looked into it yet--but while I'm not quite mid-way through the LYNE, I can see where I might crack in the near future and start looking for assistance before I put a fist through my monitor. By the way, the individual puzzles within each level are independent of each other, making it easy to pick it back up for those times when you need a break.\n\nThe developer(s) are also pretty responsive--I had some issue with achievements acting funky and they responded to my forum post pretty quickly, so that was appreciated.\n\nDisclaimer: I love anything puzzle-y, so I'm biased. That said, this is a well-done game that will give you many, many (possibly too many) hours of enjoyment.","June 14, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's because after you get the hang of the basics, and especially if you play some of the harder daily levels, most of the "intermediate" ones don't pose any challenge and only the "five-wedge" levels are really demanding. Still, to collect all the achievements you have to swift through all the level sets, so at times you can become really disenchanted. But apart from that the game offers a lot of fun and with daily levelsets you always have something new to play.

This isn't Rubik's Cube, but some of the levels can be downright diabolically devious to overcome. There's never a time limit, you can work on each level as long as you'd like. It's also one of those games that you can pick up, play five minutes, and put away. Unfortunately, it has a very strong "Just one more level" factor to counterbalance. The graphics are simple and elegant, very smooth, and very very effective at teaching the game to players without resorting to any language. Seriously, this game's look and feel teaches players how to play so effeciently that you find yourself automatically doing what it's asking without thinking about it. The learning curve isn't very steep, but the complexity mounts tremendously, moving from easy trial and error solutions to thought requirements then some trial and error. There's no scoring, just how many levels you've beaten. It's simple, beautiful, and a joy to work with. It's also available for Android, and I've already snapped it up for my phone and tablet.

It's laid back and relaxed, and that's just what I need sometimes rather than a game that will make me anxious!\n\nAs you clear levels, you unlock new color palettes if you want to change up the look.  For a visual puzzle like this, I like that there's some variety.  Otherwise, it's graphically simple, but it's appropriate to this kind of game.\n\nI would personally recommend this if you like challenging-yet-solveable puzzles; there's enough here to keep you occupied for a long time with 25 levels per "Set" and over twenty sets to work on (not even counting two "daily" sets each day).  Sales are always nice but honestly, it's not expensive at full price and it's worth it.","February 10, 2015","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isn't Rubik's Cube, but some of the levels can be downright diabolically devious to overcome. There's never a time limit, you can work on each level as long as you'd like. It's also one of those games that you can pick up, play five minutes, and put away. Unfortunately, it has a very strong "Just one more level" factor to counterbalance. The graphics are simple and elegant, very smooth, and very very effective at teaching the game to players without resorting to any language. Seriously, this game's look and feel teaches players how to play so effeciently that you find yourself automatically doing what it's asking without thinking about it. The learning curve isn't very steep, but the complexity mounts tremendously, moving from easy trial and error solutions to thought requirements then some trial and error. There's no scoring, just how many levels you've beaten. It's simple, beautiful, and a joy to work with. It's also available for Android, and I've already snapped it up for my phone and tablet. My five-year-old picked it up pretty quickly, too. Try it out!","March 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But as you progress it becomes incresingly more dificult, but not to the point of contemplating whether or not chucking your mouse across the room is worth it. Each puzzle is easily beatable if you just think for a sec, and not once have I felt as if I was never meant to solve it at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightc1/recommended/266010/","nightc1","nightc1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nightc1/","554 products in account","This is a fantastic puzzle game about connecting all the same color dots together in lines as well as filling in the non-color specific blocks.  It's a nice little bit of brain training with both fixed levels to work through and daily levels.   The base levels unlock in sets as you complete them as well as do the first two days of daily puzzles.  There are 25 puzzles per set, with 650 puzzles total in the fixed puzzles.   That may sound like a lot, but some puzzles will take seconds to complete while others could take a minute or more so it won't take more than a couple days of regular play to get through them all.  But the daily puzzles tend to add up to another 350 puzzles per week if you play them all.   So even if you blow through the main puzzles in a couple days, there's plenty to come back to.  In addition to all of this there's a sort of meta game of collecting triangles as you play.  Each set is ranked by difficulty with 1 to 5 triangles and if you complete all the puzzles in the set you get those number of triangles added to a master score.   It's not a big thing, but I'm curious to find out what happens at 999 triangles earned out of 999.  I'm about a 120 away from there on the iOS version (so maybe a week and a half more worth of daily puzzles).  It'll take a lot longer on this version since I started it only recently.\n\nIn any event this game is excellent.  Not many puzzle games get me coming back to them... which makes this a pretty special game.  Plus I don't review games if I don't feel they are worth my time.  This one was more than worth making the effort to post a review.","June 27, 2014","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To begin you're giving one different colour and you're tasked to get it to connect to the other end piece while lighting up all of the same colours similtainiously, sounds easy right? Well it gets far more complicated, they begin to introduce blocks which need to be activated a certain amount of times and different colours which can't be crossed over, the puzzels get quite challenging later on.  It's somewhat addictive, I personally either found myself breezing through some levels or getting suck figuring out how to get that damn fith diamond lit up.  Either way, if you're plowing through levels like a bat out of hell or stuck figuring out how to finish a puzzel correctly the sense of satifaction you get from completeing a level, is quite thrilling.  The implimentation of daily levels for people who just can't get their fill of making lines is quite cute.  Not to mention the ambient music makes it all the more calming an experience. And the graphical makes it much easier to recognize what it is you should be focusing on. Reccomened for anyone who needs a few hours to just chill out, it's relatively inexpensive and it'll get the job done and then some, although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're some sort of action junkie I can't see you getting much of a thrill out of connecting lines.","November 27, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The initial set of puzzles have a nice, steady learning/difficulty curve to them, and once you're done with those (I went through sets A-C in about an hour, and I haven't started D-F yet but they're definitely getting trickier) there is a "daily" option in the menu which, when I selected it, generated 50 new puzzles (two sets of 25).

None of the puzzles are too long, and the puzzles can easily be paused to be finished later.

To begin you're giving one different colour and you're tasked to get it to connect to the other end piece while lighting up all of the same colours similtainiously, sounds easy right? Well it gets far more complicated, they begin to introduce blocks which need to be activated a certain amount of times and different colours which can't be crossed over, the puzzels get quite challenging later on.  It's somewhat addictive, I personally either found myself breezing through some levels or getting suck figuring out how to get that damn fith diamond lit up.  Either way, if you're plowing through levels like a bat out of hell or stuck figuring out how to finish a puzzel correctly the sense of satifaction you get from completeing a level, is quite thrilling.  The implimentation of daily levels for people who just can't get their fill of making lines is quite cute.  Not to mention the ambient music makes it all the more calming an experience. And the graphical makes it much easier to recognize what it is you should be focusing on. Reccomened for anyone who needs a few hours to just chill out, it's relatively inexpensive and it'll get the job done and then some, although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're some sort of action junkie I can't see you getting much of a thrill out of connecting lines.","November 27, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The UI is simple and easy to understand - there's no tutorial, just progressively more complex/difficult puzzles. The daily puzzles are a nice touch - makes this game, as it claims, infintely complex (or at least replayable). I personally don't care much about the palette changing*, since I think the original color palette is quite nicely done, but that's a bonus too if you prefer customization. The audio tones don't seem to be in any sort of order (i.e. they don't provide any hints/form chords or scales) but instead just kind of float there, a bit like a windchime actually.\n\nIf you're the type who plays solitaire or Bejeweled-type games to empty your mind/relax, this will be right up your alley.\n\n*except one seems to be Star Trek themed, which is awesome in my book, heh","April 23, 2014","true","38.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game, effectively, is to find a route through all the nodes on a grid, such that "router" nodes are used the stipulated number of times.   Colourful, relaxing, and very very satisfying.\n\nMost levels have multiple solutions, which grants a very rewarding gameplay.  Most of the levels can be solved with about 10 seconds of observation, and about 5 seconds of swiping.  There are some, however, which require far more consideration.  The longest I spent was about half an hour trying and re-trying paths through the level, until I ended up giving up and cheating, using a hint online.    Other than that one slip, the rest of the game was quite solvable with patience.\n\nPerfectly suited to casual gaming, I left the game minimized, until my tea breaks, when I'd do a level or two.    There are hundreds and hundreds of levels, and with daily levels offering a "quick fix", there's a lot of enjoyment packed into this little puzzler.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who likes things like Sudoku, or quick crosswords.. i.e. that short, quick puzzle fix.\n\n","September 3, 2014","true","99.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are very limited because not only do the hard ones make me feel incredibly dumb, but I also just am not easily sucked into puzzle games.\n\nThis one sucked me in.\n\nWithin 2 hours, I felt very happy with my purchase. This game is very addictive, fun and enjoyable. The fact that the mechanics are very self-explanatory and easy to expand on make for great gameplay as you are constantly facing surprisingly difficult challeneges. For example, I was playing one of the daily challenges, which features 25 generated puzzles that are completely new, and for the first half, I thought "This is really easy". After that though, I was spending a good 15 - 20 minutes on each level. This game goes from real easy to really challenging very quickly, but for whatever reason, the way it is done doesn't make you feel stupid. You still feel like you are progressing.\n\nBasically, this game is worth the purchase. It has nice sounds and the game is easy to get into. I certainly recommend this game as a very good, if not fantastic puzzle game.\n\n(Plus, there's at least 650 puzzles, plus all the daily puzzles, so you will have more than enough gameplay)","September 10, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raegiii/recommended/266010/","Raegiii","Regi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raegiii/","101 products in account","LYNE is a simple, yet challenging puzzle game, made by Aussie developer Thomas Bowker, this game very easily shows off the creativity of today.\n\nLYNE has you staring at your computer for hours on end, trying to figure out how to connect those final lines. The game starts off easy, only having one colour and an easy path to go over, but quickly develops in difficulty. By about set 'F', the game has multiple colours, all needing to go somewhere. The simplicity of the graphics and music is done excellently. The whole game is about connecting and drawing lines, but at the same time, covering the entire board and not hitting any other colour. When you finally see the answer, you will realise that it's been staring you in the face the entire time. On some levels, there are these overlapping type squares that allow you to put multiple colours through it at once, although, this is not always useful, seeing as you need to fill that completely as well before the level is finished.\n\nThis game is PERFECT for casual gamers and people who like to spend time on things. LYNE has no time limit so you can spend all day trying to figure out how to bring that red line to the other red area... By the time you finish one set, there's another one. Each set has 25 levels. There are 26 level sets, all have their own names. If you could call a single letter a name. So, 25 times (*) 26 = a whopping 650 words, all for a small price of $3 (to be more precise, $2.99) and during the sales, you can get this game for an even smaller price of $0.49, which is a massive bargain. I mean, 49 cents for a game that will leave you addicted for hours on end, and that's what LYNE is all about, a simple, yet almost perfect puzzle game.\n\nIf all of that hasn't persuaded you to buy this game yet, there's trading cards and steam achievements as well.\n\nPROS:\n- Addictive\n- Fun\n- Annoying\n- Cheap\n- Has trading cards\n- Over 649 levels\n- Made by an Australian\n- Has achievements\n\nCONS:\n- Annoying\n- Addictive\n- Not very many people know about it and they may ask questions about what you're playing","September 24, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

None of the puzzles are too long, and the puzzles can easily be paused to be finished later.

Can't wait to see how complex the figures get later on.\n\n\nSeriously: This game is amazing.\n\nI used to, er, make like puzzles for myself in school if I didn't want to doodle.\nI will say that, sometimes, the thinking goes out the window; you (at least I) just drag sh!t all over the place when a new puzzle is presented to you - to try and get that general feel for it - and whaddaya know, you solved it!... Do I feel accomplished from having done so? Naw. Do I get stumped on the very next puzzle? Answer: >.< (and then ^-^ when(/if...) I do solve it)\n\nMy only other complaint is that the aforementioned "cyphers" (the image of the completed puzzle) do not stay on the screen for long; I would have much preferred if it was like "Click to move to the next puzzle." But. No. You agonize over a puzzle for the longest time and then when you finally solve it, you get one second to marvel at the shape you assembled and then are hustled on to the next one.

I couldn't be happier that I gave it the chance and in hindsight, had I known, I would've been fine paying the full price for it.\n\nThe puzzles range from very simple to VERY challenging, and yet with enough thought even the hardest ones can be worked out.  I'm finding myself sitting down with this game far more than I expected and far more than similar games I've played.  Even better (for me) is that the levels aren't timed in any way.  It's laid back and relaxed, and that's just what I need sometimes rather than a game that will make me anxious!\n\nAs you clear levels, you unlock new color palettes if you want to change up the look.  For a visual puzzle like this, I like that there's some variety.  Otherwise, it's graphically simple, but it's appropriate to this kind of game.\n\nI would personally recommend this if you like challenging-yet-solveable puzzles; there's enough here to keep you occupied for a long time with 25 levels per "Set" and over twenty sets to work on (not even counting two "daily" sets each day).

I personally don't care much about the palette changing*, since I think the original color palette is quite nicely done, but that's a bonus too if you prefer customization. The audio tones don't seem to be in any sort of order (i.e. they don't provide any hints/form chords or scales) but instead just kind of float there, a bit like a windchime actually.\n\nIf you're the type who plays solitaire or Bejeweled-type games to empty your mind/relax, this will be right up your alley.\n\n*except one seems to be Star Trek themed, which is awesome in my book, heh","April 23, 2014","true","38.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's still a good mobile game, great for wasting time as well as a standalone game. There are hundreds of levels, with daily generated levels to continue indefinitely. Levels can become repetitive and mechanical after some time, so it gets tiresome at times. The difficulty curve is fair, slowly introducing new elements. The price is very fair, so if you get tired of waiting for people to make moves in Hearthstone, here's a cheap option to keep your brain active while waiting on other games.","June 28, 2015","true","48.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Uppercase suggests someone’s getting all shouty, but Lyne (as we’re calling the game) is as reserved as they come. Lyne’s all about forming pathways between like-colored shapes positioned on a grid — you’re essentially joining the dots, but are restricted to 90- and 45-degree angles. As you work on each puzzle, abstract noises pleasingly chirp away in the background, confirming every connection like a panpipe-playing robot.\n\nIt all feels very pleasant, and at first it’s disarmingly simple. Soon, though, the game bares its teeth. Shapes are positioned in a manner that makes successful pathways between them all far from immediately obvious, especially once you realize paths cannot cross. Junction boxes add to the task, demanding you enter them a specific number of times to illuminate all their lights. Failure merely results in a sadly pulsating red outline and the realization you must rethink, experiment, and iterate.","August 5, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/266010/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","LYNE is an interesting puzzle game, to me. It stands somewhere between Kami (a type of puzzles that I dislike -- not a game's fault, as the game is very well done!) and Hexcells ( a type of puzzles that I very much enjoy!).\n\nIt's an abstact puzzle game very tightly connected with Graph Theory. Or, to put it simply, connecting dots.\n\nA big problem, for me, is the sheer amount of puzzles it has. 650. That's... waaay too much. The interesting levels and details get dilluted in this sea of very similar puzzles with no distinct patterns. I'd rather have 50 levels that followed a certain flow and had my think in different ways, rather than just grinding through a lot of them.\n\nAll of the puzzles are computer-generated, although the 650 levels were hand-picked, mostly to fit the set's "theme" and difficulty.\nThere are also daily sets, each with 25 puzzles (2 or 3 sets a day) that are not "curated", so to speak.\n\nThe game has 26 sets. Each of these follows some rules of its own. There are no unique mechanics or anything of the sort. The rules consist mainly on "size" and "number of colors". That's fine, it is enough to make some interesting puzzles with some outside the box solutions.\n\nThe game doesn't really have anything wrong, inherently. It's just too much, for me.\nAnd the later difficulty wasn't fun, to me. The size of these puzzles went beyond what I could easily process. Like Kami.\n\nThe first levels set a pattern in your brain, easing you into it. (It was very weird that I started trying to connect everything, from words in books to coins on my desk haha!)\nThat's all good, since the levels have enough information to be challenging, but not as much as to overwhelm you.\n\nThe last few sets are a bit too crazy, with big boards and far ending points. There are too many entanglements for me to predict it in my head. And that leads to trial and error. And far longer time in each individual level.\nEvery time I reached a solution I was just relieved. There was no rewarding feeling about it, so I decided to stop playing after 550+ levels.\n\nThe daily sets are usually more enjoyable in this regard, although there are certainly some hard ones!\nThese sets are generated by the date. Early week levels are easy. Mid-week are medium. Late-week are hard. Week-end are random.\n\nIf you do enjoy casually solving puzzles, this game will certainly keep you busy for a while! I like shorter experiences. Something like 50-100 puzzles, but each with a very clear objective, and a certain progression between them.\n\nBut hey, this is mostly preference. If you think you'd enjoy from the videos, give it a go!\n\n\nPresentation-wise, it's okay. Not particularly good, in my opinion. Visually, it's cool. It's simple and displays information clearly. (there are also unlockable palettes.)\nThe music, however, I don't think was all that great. Maybe it's because I recently played Hexcells!\nI like the intention! The execution fell a bit short, though. It's a too "on the background". Each time you connect a dot, a sound is played, but things don't seem to flow very well.\n\n\nRegardless, this is a respectable puzzle game! It kept me playing for far longer than I expected, and it's certainly worth the money! :)","September 23, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I use black color to reduce the strain to my eyes. Nice feature !!\n\nThe achievements are easy to get. Basically just finish all 26 sets and do 10 daily sets to unlock all the achievements.\nGreat for puzzle lovers and achievement hunters.\nAnd you can use the achievements to make up to 7 letters word with achievement showcase.\nIt took me 22 hours of gameplay to finish 26 sets + 10 sets daily.\n\nThe trading cards worth much higher than any normal card.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/266010/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","LYNE is an interesting puzzle game, to me. It stands somewhere between Kami (a type of puzzles that I dislike -- not a game's fault, as the game is very well done!) and Hexcells ( a type of puzzles that I very much enjoy!).\n\nIt's an abstact puzzle game very tightly connected with Graph Theory. Or, to put it simply, connecting dots.\n\nA big problem, for me, is the sheer amount of puzzles it has. 650. That's... waaay too much. The interesting levels and details get dilluted in this sea of very similar puzzles with no distinct patterns. I'd rather have 50 levels that followed a certain flow and had my think in different ways, rather than just grinding through a lot of them.\n\nAll of the puzzles are computer-generated, although the 650 levels were hand-picked, mostly to fit the set's "theme" and difficulty.\nThere are also daily sets, each with 25 puzzles (2 or 3 sets a day) that are not "curated", so to speak.\n\nThe game has 26 sets. Each of these follows some rules of its own. There are no unique mechanics or anything of the sort. The rules consist mainly on "size" and "number of colors". That's fine, it is enough to make some interesting puzzles with some outside the box solutions.\n\nThe game doesn't really have anything wrong, inherently. It's just too much, for me.\nAnd the later difficulty wasn't fun, to me. The size of these puzzles went beyond what I could easily process. Like Kami.\n\nThe first levels set a pattern in your brain, easing you into it. (It was very weird that I started trying to connect everything, from words in books to coins on my desk haha!)\nThat's all good, since the levels have enough information to be challenging, but not as much as to overwhelm you.\n\nThe last few sets are a bit too crazy, with big boards and far ending points. There are too many entanglements for me to predict it in my head. And that leads to trial and error. And far longer time in each individual level.\nEvery time I reached a solution I was just relieved. There was no rewarding feeling about it, so I decided to stop playing after 550+ levels.\n\nThe daily sets are usually more enjoyable in this regard, although there are certainly some hard ones!\nThese sets are generated by the date. Early week levels are easy. Mid-week are medium. Late-week are hard. Week-end are random.\n\nIf you do enjoy casually solving puzzles, this game will certainly keep you busy for a while! I like shorter experiences. Something like 50-100 puzzles, but each with a very clear objective, and a certain progression between them.\n\nBut hey, this is mostly preference. If you think you'd enjoy from the videos, give it a go!\n\n\nPresentation-wise, it's okay. Not particularly good, in my opinion. Visually, it's cool. It's simple and displays information clearly. (there are also unlockable palettes.)\nThe music, however, I don't think was all that great. Maybe it's because I recently played Hexcells!\nI like the intention! The execution fell a bit short, though. It's a too "on the background". Each time you connect a dot, a sound is played, but things don't seem to flow very well.\n\n\nRegardless, this is a respectable puzzle game! It kept me playing for far longer than I expected, and it's certainly worth the money! :)","September 23, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then, it started to get a bit harder.  I wanted to write things out in my achievement showcase though, and I didn't want to just use Steam Achievement Manager or look up a guide.  That would more or less make the game a waste of money.\n\nAfter around six hours of this game over the course of two sessions, I started to get a severe case of the Tetris Effect.  Every time I closed my eyes, I would start connecting shapes together.  In the days that followed, my dreams consisted entirely of connecting shapes together and solving puzzles.\n\nI started to become frustrated with everyday life.  Why couldn't I connect shapes together in real life?  Why didn't connecting shapes together in my head solve my real world problems?\n\nThat was a month and a half ago.  I have since picked the game up again, but I'm using a guide this time.  It's a compromise between having no fun and the shape-infested hell I was living in when I first started playing.  There are also randomly generated puzzles that are just as good as the normal ones, so if I start seeing shapes again, I can always just cheat all of the achievements and play the random levels afterward.\n\nLet it be known that I beat sets A-F and got partway through G before losing my mind.  I urge that if you want to play this game legitimately...at least pace yourself.  Otherwise, you could end up like me.\n\nEdit:  Today, scared of returning to shape-infested hell, I cheated the achievements.","November 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is as simple as it comes, the aim of the game is simple; you must connect all of the corresponding shapes while using all of the necessary 'Lynes', such a concept could contain flaws, however with any game I'm sure it could be improved i.e. A hint mechanic (however subjective and debatable). The sound Fx and music is very fitting could perhaps be improved with more relevant variation, but what it does have is great consistency in that regard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/266010/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","LYNE is an interesting puzzle game, to me. It stands somewhere between Kami (a type of puzzles that I dislike -- not a game's fault, as the game is very well done!) and Hexcells ( a type of puzzles that I very much enjoy!).\n\nIt's an abstact puzzle game very tightly connected with Graph Theory. Or, to put it simply, connecting dots.\n\nA big problem, for me, is the sheer amount of puzzles it has. 650. That's... waaay too much. The interesting levels and details get dilluted in this sea of very similar puzzles with no distinct patterns. I'd rather have 50 levels that followed a certain flow and had my think in different ways, rather than just grinding through a lot of them.\n\nAll of the puzzles are computer-generated, although the 650 levels were hand-picked, mostly to fit the set's "theme" and difficulty.\nThere are also daily sets, each with 25 puzzles (2 or 3 sets a day) that are not "curated", so to speak.\n\nThe game has 26 sets. Each of these follows some rules of its own. There are no unique mechanics or anything of the sort. The rules consist mainly on "size" and "number of colors". That's fine, it is enough to make some interesting puzzles with some outside the box solutions.\n\nThe game doesn't really have anything wrong, inherently. It's just too much, for me.\nAnd the later difficulty wasn't fun, to me. The size of these puzzles went beyond what I could easily process. Like Kami.\n\nThe first levels set a pattern in your brain, easing you into it. (It was very weird that I started trying to connect everything, from words in books to coins on my desk haha!)\nThat's all good, since the levels have enough information to be challenging, but not as much as to overwhelm you.\n\nThe last few sets are a bit too crazy, with big boards and far ending points. There are too many entanglements for me to predict it in my head. And that leads to trial and error. And far longer time in each individual level.\nEvery time I reached a solution I was just relieved. There was no rewarding feeling about it, so I decided to stop playing after 550+ levels.\n\nThe daily sets are usually more enjoyable in this regard, although there are certainly some hard ones!\nThese sets are generated by the date. Early week levels are easy. Mid-week are medium. Late-week are hard. Week-end are random.\n\nIf you do enjoy casually solving puzzles, this game will certainly keep you busy for a while! I like shorter experiences. Something like 50-100 puzzles, but each with a very clear objective, and a certain progression between them.\n\nBut hey, this is mostly preference. If you think you'd enjoy from the videos, give it a go!\n\n\nPresentation-wise, it's okay. Not particularly good, in my opinion. Visually, it's cool. It's simple and displays information clearly. (there are also unlockable palettes.)\nThe music, however, I don't think was all that great. Maybe it's because I recently played Hexcells!\nI like the intention! The execution fell a bit short, though. It's a too "on the background". Each time you connect a dot, a sound is played, but things don't seem to flow very well.\n\n\nRegardless, this is a respectable puzzle game! It kept me playing for far longer than I expected, and it's certainly worth the money! :)","September 23, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When describing the game, by saying that you're trying to connect two end points and travel through nodes a particular amount of times, it sounds like it would be boring. The game is designed in such a way that it's so polished and plays so smooth, that it makes that simple idea fulfilling.\n\nIt's a great way to waste 15 minutes here and there, and there are 550 levels (25*26), and they can be completed in less than 10 seconds, or stump you for a while. You are fortunately able to work on any of the 25 levels at a time, based on what stage (letter of the alphabet) you've gotten to, so that you aren't necessarily going to be stuck on 1 level with nothing else to play. The downside is that you have to wait to beat stage A to get to B, B to get to C, and so forth.\n\nThe game did go a bit downhill after taking a little too long to boost the difficulty up, and it did feel like it went from medium to hard in a single jump from stage S to stage T (at least in my opinion). I'm now working on stage V and the puzzles tend to take >1 minutes each. I feel like stage T onwards are where this game shines, and it's a shame you have to beat a fair amount of easy puzzles to get there, but that wouldn't stop me from recommending the game.","June 23, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Uppercase suggests someone’s getting all shouty, but Lyne (as we’re calling the game) is as reserved as they come. Lyne’s all about forming pathways between like-colored shapes positioned on a grid — you’re essentially joining the dots, but are restricted to 90- and 45-degree angles. As you work on each puzzle, abstract noises pleasingly chirp away in the background, confirming every connection like a panpipe-playing robot.\n\nIt all feels very pleasant, and at first it’s disarmingly simple. Soon, though, the game bares its teeth. Shapes are positioned in a manner that makes successful pathways between them all far from immediately obvious, especially once you realize paths cannot cross. Junction boxes add to the task, demanding you enter them a specific number of times to illuminate all their lights. Failure merely results in a sadly pulsating red outline and the realization you must rethink, experiment, and iterate.","August 5, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then, it started to get a bit harder.  I wanted to write things out in my achievement showcase though, and I didn't want to just use Steam Achievement Manager or look up a guide.  That would more or less make the game a waste of money.\n\nAfter around six hours of this game over the course of two sessions, I started to get a severe case of the Tetris Effect.  Every time I closed my eyes, I would start connecting shapes together.  In the days that followed, my dreams consisted entirely of connecting shapes together and solving puzzles.\n\nI started to become frustrated with everyday life.  Why couldn't I connect shapes together in real life?  Why didn't connecting shapes together in my head solve my real world problems?\n\nThat was a month and a half ago.  I have since picked the game up again, but I'm using a guide this time.  It's a compromise between having no fun and the shape-infested hell I was living in when I first started playing.  There are also randomly generated puzzles that are just as good as the normal ones, so if I start seeing shapes again, I can always just cheat all of the achievements and play the random levels afterward.\n\nLet it be known that I beat sets A-F and got partway through G before losing my mind.  I urge that if you want to play this game legitimately...at least pace yourself.  Otherwise, you could end up like me.\n\nEdit:  Today, scared of returning to shape-infested hell, I cheated the achievements.","November 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sellyme/recommended/266010/","sellyme","Sellyme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sellyme/","776 products in account","A surprisingly intuitive and easy to pick up puzzle game that introduces devilish complexity and a frankly staggeringly large number of levels (I'm an hour and a half in and I've only completed 75 out of 650 puzzles), coupled with the fact that at the time of review LYNE is on sale for just $0.89 means that it's an unbeatable buy. I have purchased several hundred games and LYNE is hands down bar none the best value for money.\n\nWith a pleasant simplistic design that lets you get straight into the puzzle solving (which can take anywhere between half a second and half an hour per puzzle, depending on the difficulty), it's something that I wish we saw more of in modern video games. One of my largest gripes with puzzle games is when you're forced to sit through a several minute tutorial with mandatory wait times or - even worse! - having to watch the game do it for you at an antagonisingly slow pace. LYNE has no such tutorial. Instead, you learn the mechanics of the game through a series of a slowly ramping difficulty curve, and if the puzzles are too easy at the start (which they probably will be for anyone who's played similar games before), they take less than a second to complete and the next one loads rapidly, with no gimmicky "congratulations!' screen or long celebration animations. You complete it, it slides off screen, and the next one slides in.\n\nAll in all, LYNE is a solid 9.5/10 puzzle game. It's good for someone who just wants to fiddle around with a game for 10 minutes on a lunch break, or for someone who wants to spend hours if not days meticulously completing every single one of the 650 levels. I would highly recommend it, and at the current price, you'd be stupid not to buy it.","January 1","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
