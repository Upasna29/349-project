If you've ever played games like Final Fantasy 4-5-6, Breath of Fire 1-2-3, Chrono Trigger, Suikoden 1-2,...and didn't like those, this game isn't for you.\n\n- secondly, this game has been made with RPG-Maker, but do not judge it solely on this, because this is the prime exemple of how RPG-maker can be used to make a good professional game. There is a LOT of production value in this, and not some basic use of the default assets that come with RPG-Maker : original, animated sprites, original character portraits, original musics, original battle system...you get it.\n\n- thirdly, Dancing Dragon, the devs of this game, are also known for making some other good J-RPGs, the most well-known being Skyborn. While this game is superior in almost every way to its predecessor, it does re-use some of the assets of Skyborn, a music there, the sprites used for making the maps, etc, etc...That being said, it's not detrimental at all, and keep in mind that we're talking of an indie game made by a couple people, sold for a somewhat low cost (especially if you compare to the price of similar games in the "good old times")\n\nWith that being said, how is this game?\n\nOne word : solid. It takes the old formula of J-RPGs of the SNES era : an epic story revolving around a party of heroes, punctuated by some tactical combats.\n\nThe story is good, very solid (can't repeat that enough), and has a catching intro, a good amount of twists, and a quite satisfaying ending. While it's nothing ground breaking, the characters are likeable, do have some amount of depth, and the world is believable, which is, in my opinion, quite important. It's very close to reach the heights of some of the classics of the genre (the likes of Chrono Trigger or Breath of Fire 2), but I felt that some dialogues could have been a little more developped and that some cutscenes were a little too implicit, and let you rely on your imagination to fill the gaps. But just the fact that it can be compared to some of the most renowned J-RPGs should speak for itself about the quality of this part of the game.\n\nBut Echoes does not rely solely on the exemple of its elders, and offers very good and fresh ideas in the gameplay department : the battle system is not exactly turn-based, but closer to a Grandia, where you can interrupt/slow/anticipate the ennemies actions. There are lots of skills available for each character, with quite some amount of customization. The gear can also be customized for your needs, and the crafting system is well-thought and allows experimentations with a minimal amount of consequence (every consummable ressources can be bought/farmed at some point or another) Overall, you can't screw your party, and while some tactics may be more efficient than others (especially on Hard), a good amount of flexibility remain, even in the hardest challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a solid old-school J-RPG on Steam, Echoes of Aetheria is totally worth its price. It's a well-crafted work of passion that does its best to keep the old J-RPG vibe alive, and, in my opinion, succeed with flying colours.","January 28","true","97.9"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

If you want to play classic, old-school RPG's that don't feel like "knock-offs" but real, traditional, successors to the greats like Final Fantasy IV and Suikoden II, then I highly suggest you look into this developer, and more specifically, this game right here...

I have been following this developer for awhile and their releases have seen consistent improvement over the last few years. So if you were a fan of Skyborne and/or Deadly Sins you are defintely going to like what you find here.\n\nIf you are weary of the RPG Maker Label given the vast range in quality of game releases made from that software I will tell you this is one of the more polished releases under that moniker. The body of work and quality of their previous releases is a good point of reference if you prefer not to take my word on it.\n\nAt it's heart this game is a JRPG with a solid B movie (a compliment for a video game) plot and just enough character development and flavor to keep it interesting. The battle mechanics give a tactical spin and battle grid to those usual found in this genre and for the most part it works pretty well. One of the main selling points would be the massive number of active and passive skills at your disposal. This leads to a great deal of options in your strategy.\n\nThere are 3 difficutly settings which can be switched or chosen between each mission in the game. Thus far the easy and normal playthroughs have been a little disappointing on the challenge factor and the hard mode seems ramp up the challenge by requiring more stuborn heal spamming as opposed to a ramp up in strategy. I am only a few hours into the game so I may feel different by the end of it and will update my review if necessary.\n\nI like....\n\nDeveloper Responsivness on Forums\nSolid Video Game Plot\nCharacter Development (okay really a part of the above but it's so rare these days I wanted to mention it seperate)\nInteresting Crafting System\nLarge number of skill options for each character\nTactical map\nArt Style\n\nAC/DC\nLinear plot progression\nSomewhat Grindy (no more than any other JRPG)\nMusic/Sound\n\nI did not like...\n\nDifficulty of Easy/Normal is almost nothing\nDifficulty of Hard requires too much attrition\nUI navigation issues with keyboard were a bit confusing\n\n\nThis is one of the best takes on the classic genre you will find on Steam.

I'm a few hours into the game, and just getting into the thick of the story and I'm hooked. The story is unpredictable enough to keep you interested, and even though it follows some somewhat familiar tropes, the characters and presentation manage to keep it feeling fresh. The battle system and core game design are brilliant, and the art and music fit perfectly- it all meshes together seamlessly into a delightful RPG that's definitely worth your time if you're into classic RPGs, and light-hearted adventure stories.

The soundtrack is great on the standards of big production games, let alone independent titles. The gameplay does something unique for a JRPG, drawing inspiration from titles like Lunar and Suikoden where position of your units have real value. There are a lot of different ways to optimize each character with skills and customizable equipment, offering a great deal of potential variety and allowing you to create your own strategies and gameplay style. The story really caught me off guard, going in a direction that most media isn't willing to. It caught me off guard a couple times, a big point in its favor to me.\n\nIf you are a serious RPG player, make sure to play it on Hard difficulty. At this level, battles actually require strategy and thought. Later in the game, you may find yourself getting the swing of things and going on cruise control, but don't get too comfortable. Even well-leveled and with high-end crafted gear (which takes some work to get), the end game presents a reasonable challenge.\n\nOne other point worth mentioning: the amount of backstory presented in this game is huge. There is a lore catalog that you can choose to read if you so desire, and the amount of world building put into this game is impressive.\n\nThere are still some minor bugs, but judging by the frequency of updates thus far, the creator is addressing them as they are brought up (including things like balance issues, which is above and beyond as far as I am concerned).","February 2","true","57.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Moreover, characters' skills synergize very well with each other, and this coupled with the tactical grid/formation allows for deep customization of both the characters and the party as a whole.\nSpeaking of customization, there's a pretty straightforward but nicely done crafting system which really shines at the endgame, where rare resources can be used to either forge new, unique equipment or to greatly strengthen existing ones: flexibility and experimentation are the keywords here.\n\nLastly, but even more importantly, these mechanics are well implemented into the game: on hard difficulty battles are challenging, some endgame optional fights are tailored to specific characters and builds, requiring full understanding of each one, and all this preparation is not wasted at all because (finally, a game does this right!) the final bosses are just as hard as they should be.\nThis is the high note defining Echoes of Aetheria for me, a game not only having a deep enough system, but also encouraging the player to make full use of it, tailoring the challenges to what the player can realistically achieve and prepare for.\n\nIf you can go past the raw, generic interface and overall cheap-looking presentation of the game (sprites are actually cool, though), there's much to discover in Echoes of Aetheria. A seemingly traditional game with a nostalgic feeling to it, yet able to turn nostalgia into a new appeal for classic gameplay elements, thanks to a masterful mix of everything we loved about the genre.","February 2","true","45.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The story is engaging and the characters are interesting and well written. I particularly enjoyed the forging and augmenting feature for weapons and armor and find myself going back just to see if I can do some fine tuning. Some of the characters may seem cliche, but I find them comfortingly familiar; the damaged hero, the wise-cracking sidekick/love interest. There is very little not to like about this game. I found Skyborn which led me to Echoes of Aetheria which drew me into Deadly Sin 2. Dancing Dragon has a winning formula and keep tweaking and improving it with each new game.\n\nOne huge improvement that I really love is that when you augment weapons or armor and want to rejig things, you can un-augment (is that a word) without losing the base components. This makes is so much easier and less expensive to fine tune armor and weapons.\n\nAnother huge plus for Dancing Dragon.....I had a couple of questions posted on the discussion forum and the first person that answered  was one of the developers. It shows they really care about their games and their gamers. Hats off to Dancing Dragon.

There is so much to do and customize, from training quests to customized weapons and armor, to setting the skills and levels of said skills to make each character not only ideal in the team, but also great soloers. On top of that, there were three different levels of difficulty to choose from per level, so you don't need to restart the entire game if you find it too hard or too easy. Personally, I played it on normal, then backpedalled to some of my favorite levels to try on hard mode.\n\nThe storyline followed pretty closesly with other fantasy RPGs- save the world, insert a twist, save the world again. But it was the characters, especially their interaction with each other, that was wonderful. A good deal of the game is based on conversations that happen in the base. These are encouraged through little boosts of exp gained by conversing with these characters, and make even the support character that much more important to the characters and the player. It also made the game that much deeper when *spoiler spoilers IwarnyouIcriedthough* Banter between the main characters built a strong connection, which made the tensions when things weren't going smoothly really stand out. But what really got me was the end. Alternative endings. I'm not even sure I got all of them. The game over ending in particular caught me so off guard that I had to put the game down before trying again.\n\nOverall, an awesome game that allows you to play multiple different ways for hours of fun.

The story is great and at times I was actually having emotions for the characters.  For me this is great as, even though these are digital people, I am feeling emotion for them.  This is one way I know that a game is doing something right.\n\nThe combat style is a isometric Breath of Fire type system.  Works really well from a tactical perspective.  While you don't have to plan ahead for most battles bringing the right skills can make all the difference is making the battle super easy to extremely difficult.  With the ability to swap out skills you can make characters fill different abilities and roles.\n\nGame presentation is well done being done through a combination of missions, cutscenes, and towns / bases.  If you just want to focus on missions you can go from one to the next fairly seamlessly while if you want to really dive into the lore and character development you have that option also.  I found this to be a great break from the norm that we see in RPGs from indie to AAA titles.\n\nHere we are at the beginning of 2016 and we have a great indie game to start the New Year.

When it first begins you're pressented with a beautiful wedding being used to unite two waring nations to gain peace. Not unlike anything we've seen before. Then, the bride, who happens to be the Princess of one of the nations gets kidnapped. Oh no, not the concept this again. But that's okay; our young dashing hero Lucian is on the chase. Though when we meet Lucian, he has the look of a hero, but early on we see emotional depth. He's to some degree socially awakward, which is something you wouldn't expect from a guy like him. It's espeically funny when he tries to hide it behind his bravdo but the next unlikely companion see's right though it.\n\nThis would be Ingrid; built from the same mold as the main herione Claret from Skyborn. She has has the wit, street smarts and pragmatism to see her job though. What was great about her is that she can seem like she's presented in a light that would seem tomboyish but I didn't feel like she was a one note character. In the brief time that I've known her, she's shown a great gift for ingeunity and engineering. I don't know how rare it is for a character to build an airship from the ground up form scraps but she did.\n\nLastly Soha, who should be more aptly named as a "Warrior Princess". Turns out this girl needs no saving. While some might think she has questionable attire choices, she makes up for it by using a combination of sharp wit, mind control and swordplay to mow down her foes.\n\nAfter completing the first mission, I felt like I wanted to know these characters more. I wanted to see how they dealt with the hard times as well as the good times. Match that with a very enguaging battle system and a world where swords and guns still intersect in battle, I think this ride will be one to enjoy.\n\nCheck it out, you won't be sad you did.","January 18","true","2.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","2"

The battle system in this game is probably the best system I've seen of any RPG Maker games.)\n\nIf you enjoyed Skyborn, which I did, you will probably enjoy this game for the same reasons. What I find really great about this game is that, unlike Skyborn, this game uses a custom battle system that doesn't feel like it was taken from Dragon Quest. While the combat system is simple with elements borrowed from other games it is still very interesting and much more entertaining than most RPG Maker games.\n\nI'm a sucker for tropes in JRPGs because I like to see different people's spin on them. Kidnapped princess? Hell yes! Sassy protagonist that gives the figher character lip? Yes please! Framed for a crime you didn't commit? Of course! I'm excited to see what comes next :-)\n\nSome of my gripes with the game include gripes that I have with most RPG Maker games. The resolution isn't great and isn't meant to be played in widescreen (unless you like stretched graphics). Even at 4:3 the graphics look a bit off. Also, I don't know why Dancing Dragons does this but, like Skyborn, this game uses some of the default RTP tilesets. With the talent pool at their disposal you'd think they'd make their own.\n\nIf you'd like to see some gameplay video, feel free to check my Let's Play series of the game here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOEu9CRJArc","January 18","true","34.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

The battle system was the only thing that stood out, but that can't save a game that is otherwise lacking. So why did I play it anyway? Because someone sent me a key even though I didn't ask!\n\nAnd what can I say? The game is solid. Neither mediocre nor particularly memorable. Perhaps better than Skyborn, which I never finished, but still not as good as some of my favorite rpg-maker titles.\n\nThe encounters are where the game truly shines. It uses an active time battle system where some skills can be used instantaneously while others need to be prepared. Some consume no resources, others drain the user's blood, and then there are those that demand a certain amount of TP. Those can be gained throughout the battle or through equipping certain items. The higher the cost, the more powerful the skill. They also employ a cooldown system, so you can't just spam them.\n\nAnother thing you need to pay attention to are formations. They can protect your characters from harm (by someone in the front taking the brunt of all damage), but the same applies to enemies. So you need to take care of the front if you want to strike those at the back. Unless you use ranged attacks, magic, or skills with a certain are of effect.\n\nProblem is: the battles are too easy (especially since most skills are available before half the game is even over). Playing on normal provides absolutely no challenge until 10+ hours in, and that's after skipping hordes of enemies. So you might want to play on hard while ignoring easy from the get go. It can be changed every chapter, so you're never locked in. But there's one thing you may hate: the party is healed after every encounter and you can save whenever you want. Only two areas are different, but those aren't a problem if you make a beeline for the boss.\n\nI personally didn't mind, as something else was more annoying: the crafting system. It's nice in theory, as you can combine lots of different items to equip your party however you please. Thing is: you don't have a choice. Most equipment that can be bought is already out of date. So you have to craft every single piece, all while making sure not to go over capacity (if a character wears too much, their other stats drop). Kinda tedious, if you ask me. Would have preferred a more standard system with crafting being optional.\n\nAnd that's mostly it. The characters are well presented (especially if you talk to them after every chapter), the mouse controls are solid, the dungeons okay (except for the last, where most enemies can't be avoided), equipment can be improved with accessories, skills can constantly be changed to suit ones needs ... but the antagonists are boring (I remember three, two of which aren't even worth mentioning) and the story would have benefited from a more gripping presentation. Sure, it uses animations here and there, but I've seen far better games made in rpg-maker. For free no less!\n\nSo, would I recommend the game? Sure, if you dial down your expectations. It's nice enough for 13 - 14 hours (the rest of the time was spent outside the game), but it's nothing I'd remember for long.","January 15","true","18.3"," 23 of 50 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","23","50","0","5"

If you play with mouse and keyboard and love rpg then you should buy the game right now. But I  play only with a Xbox one pad and moving around characters who can only go up, down, left or right with an analog stick is way too uncomfortable. That's the only reason I stopped playing this game and will not play any more rpg maker games. Please consider moving to a more recent engine like unity or whatever, I'm not an expert in the field, but I'm certain that with your talent you could do wonders if not constrained by the rpg maker engine limitations.","January 19","true","6.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","1","6","2","0"

It was great to play a game that hearkened back to the snes era of RPGs, but still stands strong as its own new age title. Even though it was created in an rpg maker engine, it's battle system makes it unique and addicting with some impressive sprite work. Battles are active and by using your array of skills you can control the flow of battle and make sure your party comes out on top.\n\nThe difficulty level starts out easy, but then battles get tougher with more confusing dungeons near the end, but it's all appropriate as the game helps ease your way into learning how to play and you can also choose your difficulty before each dungeon so you can play at whatever level you're comfortable.\n\nI personally enjoyed the crafting system, using the materials I worked hard to find in dungeons to make "legendary" status equipment. You can choose a blueprint of a weapon or armor, but it can be customized and crafted into a large array of options that fits to your playstyle. Higher magic damage, defense, or physical attack? It's up to you to decide which of your characters needs what.\n\nI loved getting to play this title. Echoes of Aetheria is a solid entry in the rpg genre.","January 16","true","25.1"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the brand new RPG Echoes of Aetheria. Echoes of Aetheria was released today, January 15th, 2016 by Developer Dancing Dragon Games and Publisher Degica.\n\n(NOTE: This game was reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CoXrvzNvrBg\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nWow! Fantastic little RPG. Great feel & story! 4/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nWell, now. Heh. There are TONS of little RPG Maker games that populate the Steam store these days, and no, that is NOT a bad thing. Granted, they aren't all the best, but having options is good. I'll cover that some other time. For now, Echoes of Aetheria. Wow is this a fun game! Upon being asked to review it, I admit I was a little hesitant. It looks like some "blah" RPG Maker game, but I gave it a spin anyways. WOW. I am SO glad I did! This game has a GREAT story that hooks you in right from the beginning AND gets moving and twisting early and it does so very well. It does not feel forced or cheesy at all, it is solid writing. The gameplay mechanics are very familiar RPG-style mechanics. Nothing special. For me, it's the characters (there are several good ones!) and the story in this one that really engaged me from the get-go. Particularly Ingrid, she's a fantastic character! AI sincerely haven't been this engaged in an RPG since I used to play FFVI back on SNES. And yes, I am serious. This game and it's story are sincerely hooking me like that one did. Not as deep or as rich with supporting cast, but super-solid storytelling is here and you do not want to miss out. It's the kind of game you're thinking about while you aren't even playing, the story is that good. If you dig RPG's, make sure to give this one a try.\n\nHappy Gaming!\n\n(EDITED TO ADD - Some comments have been deleted, only by the request of the person making the comments. The discussion was held in private and resolved peacefully. Please enjoy this game!)","January 15","true","2.8"," 24 of 61 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","24","61","3","4"

I really wanted to enjoy this game, but the crafting system ruined it for me.  There is no explination, a huge lack of resources, no clue what impact spending a resource will have.

I get DIY is the current flavor of the month, but purchasing equipment shouldn't be the most complicated and time consuming part of a game.  Just a simple item store would have allowed me to enjoy and recommend this game.","January 25","false","4.9"," 2 of 16 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","16","0","2"
