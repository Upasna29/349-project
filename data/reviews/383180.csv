If you have the old version of DI:Riptide in your steam libary you can pick this up for $3. If you have played DI:Riptide and feel like you have experienced it to its fullest, there is not really a need to get this as its exactly the same in terms of everything, but graphics. If you feel like playing DI:Riptide again, for this price, why not buy it?\n\nThe game runs wonderfully too. On my PC (Look at specs below) I get upwards of 90-100fps in most scenarios and only see dips when there are a lot of zombies or NPCs on screen. I have not run into any bugs yet either, which is a plus.\nI have an FOV fix below if you need help with tweaking your FOV.\n\n(SPECS):\nCPU: Intel Core i5-3470 3.2ghz\nGPU: EVGA GTX 970 4gb OC'd to 1530mhz\nSTORAGE: WD Blue 1tb\n\n(FOV FIX):\n**REQUIRES 7-Zip**\n-Go into your DI:Riptide directory. This can be found by right clicking DI:Riptide in Libary, select Properties>Local Files>Browse Local Files.\n-Look for the folder DIR then search for Data0.pak. Right click this, hover your mouse over 7-Zip, then click "Open Archive."\n-This will bring up a window that says "data". Select the data folder then look for a folder called skills.

It runs on the all-new Dying Light engine, Chroma 6, which is a large upgrade from the original Chroma 5 engine, and it brings with it a lot of new post-processing effects, making the island look more beatiful than ever. A lot of the models have been replaced, all of the textures have been completely re-done at a higher resolution, bringing more detail to all the characters. The introduction of the new physically based shading teqhnique and photorealistic lighting system brings new life to the island. It's a great game if you loved the original, or even if you didn't.

This Remaster came as a massive surprise and didnt hesitate to pick it up immediately, and i have to say, you can tell its a remaster.\nThis isn't just Techland's way of scamming you for money. For once, you can actually tell that a AAA developer has recognised what people seem to enjoy and have worked around it.\nI would definately recommend to anyone , however the experience is SO much more fun if you have a friend or two to play with.\n\nJust one bug i have found though, and that is; With Logan, whenever a Zombie latches onto me and i punch them away or even just kick them, it's like i am the ♥♥♥♥ing Dragonborn from Skyrim or some ♥♥♥♥ cause EVERY zombie just goes flying and their limbs just explode. It was hilarious at first, but it's kinda annoying now.

A very pretty overhaul can't change what you didn't like about the game in the first place. The characters still make idiotic comments. In fact, the humans are the worst part of the game, just like they were in the original. No wonder why the zombies wanted to kill them!\n\nBut, if you liked the game, you'll like this even more. Why? Well, in my case, it was a nice opportunity to play the game again, and having the textures polished really was a nice touch. The zombies are just as awesome, and maybe moreso because of the clarity makes them feel like that much more of a menace.

Polite warning: I can't help but compare this to Dying Light, so bear with me (no, we're not going to eat raw salmon, not right now).\n\nIt's still pretty clumsy in terms of gameplay. I mean, they haven't even touched the fighting system; compared to DL, it feels stale and very repetitive.\n\nPretty much all  the characters  featured are forgettable. In DL, every person had a ♥♥♥♥ing personality. Dead Island is full of dull people with horrible voice-acting.\n\nBUTT ( YES, a wild butt appears)!!!\n\nIt is still pretty enjoyable. There is something very relaxing about this game, and I think I'm going to give it a chance,\n\ntl;dr - You played  Dead Island games and liked them, but want better graphics? Buy Definitive Edition.\nYou played DI and found it bad? Forget this game.\nYou didn'y play DI games but want to give them a whirl? That's the moment, don't be shy.\n","May 31","true","0.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

If someone ever asks you about next-gen graphics, show them this- it\'s the most gorgeous game I\'ve ever bloody seen.\nIgnore my low hour-count, I\'m writing this review as I\'m playing through the game with my buddy, there will be many more hours spent on this game!","May 31","true","2.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
