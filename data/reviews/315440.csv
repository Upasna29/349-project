"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HellPlus/recommended/315440/","HellPlus","Hellius Plusius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HellPlus/","587 products in account","In terms of a port I must admit then Tron:Evolution is a bit of a nightmare, if you wanna get 1920x1080 resolution you're going to start using .ini files with mixed success and, while it works for me on windows 7 I'm hearing a lot of mixed things in terms of what works for who, so while one can hope the modding community will work on all this it is by definition a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nThe thing is (having completed the x360 version) what hide behinds that nightmare is a fun game. Clearly inspired by the 3d Prince of Persia games it's a fun romp through the early world of Tron:Legacy with more information on Tron's corruption, the birth and death of the ISOs, Clu's purge, and how Quorra made it out in 1 piece. Even referenced in the film itself this game actually feels relevent to the universe and canon of Tron in a way few license games ever do.\n\nThe campaign itself is pretty basic and standard fare for this kind of game, lots of free-running, lots of combat (that is basic but nice and flashy and with a few interesting mechanics like disc varients and damage multiplayers depending on if you are free-running while attacking encouraging moving while fighting), and some scripted light-bike sequences; it's functioning if uninteresting with some stand-out levels and some amazing visual nd sound design that keeps you going through an average experience as Daft Punk music tends to do (and yes there's a lot of Daft Punk).\n\nHowever this game has one big trick up its sleeve....The multiplayer (once you can find people) is absolutely beast! Now while you can do a single bot match in the standard arena mode before it transfers to an online lobby (there's a few odd decisions regarding bot availability) the main multiplayer only maps that allow people, light-cycles, and tanks can create some truly unique experiences with people jumping out of bikes to parkour into health pickups while throwing disks at oncoming traffic. It is truly amazing if there are people on, and thus is the biggest problem...\n\nTron: Evolution is a dead community with noone playing, the games best component's rely solely on people and they are genuinely worthwhile experiences that essentially define why I do recommend this game as opposed to saying that one should be indeifferent to it unless a tron fan in which case you should already want this! With that in mind I have created a steam group that I plan to add weekly play-sessions so that we can all bring back some of that light together. The multiplayer is something that makes this game so unique so one can hope that this gives life back to it even if only once in a while. If you're okay for an okay to good game with the risk of boosting it up to a great one again together then buy it and join me, because this game is great together, we just got to bring that together bit back!\n\nJoin us on http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TronEvo       (also cheers for reading :D)","October 7, 2014","true","1.7"," 139 of 164 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","139","164","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinfinitedoom/recommended/315440/","theinfinitedoom","Gunmetal Buffalo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinfinitedoom/","559 products in account","A great example of a movie tie-in done right. It's a bit like God of War meets Prince of Persia.\n\nTwo things if you're thinking of buying this game: Be prepared to play with settings and .ini files in order to get this game to run the way you want. Second, do NOT play the game on Hard mode to start with. Enemies will kill you in ~3 hits, they have much higher damage and health intended for a subsequent playthrough. When you first start the game you won't have any upgrades, so expect to be destroyed in Hard mode or multiplayer. It's not that the multiplayer is unbalanced or anything, it's that upgrades are shared. The single player upgrades give you more health/energy and unlock more of your disk modes. Without those, you're at a disadvantage against any human player who is further along in the game. Once you get a handle on the single player unlocks/upgrades, everyone's on the same level bar their loadout.\n\nBear in mind that the multiplayer is mostly dead at the time of this writing. I hosted a bot match, one player joined and completely obliterated me because he had already unlocked everything. It's definitely *worth* bringing back to life by joining a community group and organizing games, but there's no guarantee that this game will ever get popular enough to jump into an open game at any given time.\n\nThe single player is very fun, though it may not sound exciting on paper. Half the time you'll be performing simple parkour through the level, then when you arrive at the next combat arena you spend the other half of your time fighting groups of enemies. New mechanics are introduced gradually, as are new "modes" for your identity disk.\n\nThe controls and targeting work well; it takes a little bit of practice to get a feel for the movement animations, but once you get an idea of what you can do the game really flows between acrobatic moves and attacks. In order to regain health and energy (used to perform heavy and special attacks), you must break off from your relentless assault to parkour across special surfaces and objects. With your health or energy refilled, you can then launch yourself into the air and fling your disk at the enemies, hitting hard and bringing yourself back into the fray. The heavy emphasis on making use of the environment and objects keeps the gameplay fresh, even though the levels are all variants of "blue city populated by orange bad guys". Each new combat arena is set up with a new challenge and a different set of moves to regain health or energy. You'll be too busy diving in and out of combat and frantically parkouring to get your health back to notice much else.\n\nThe multiplayer is extremely cool, allowing players to do all the things they've always wanted to do in the Tron universe. Parkour and disk-based combat make the transition, challenging players to deflect, dodge and parkour around each other while disks fly in every direction. In the large maps, pressing a certain button will make your character leap into the air and generate your own light-cycle. It's possible to drive normally or make use of 90 degree turns, as you have seen in both movies. You can even throw your disk from the light-cycle to take out enemies as you drive by or to attack other light-cycles directly. There are even multiple models of light-cycle that you can choose between, each with different stats. Tanks can be brought into the battle by capturing certain points on the map, turning the multiplayer matches into beautiful spectacles where players are leaping on and off of light-cycles, flinging disks at one another. Where single player upgrades give straight stat increases, multiplayer unlocks provide a wide range of buffs usable in custom loadouts.\n\nI'm loving this game, it was well worth the price and may find new life via multiplayer on Steam. It's worth buying for the single player and bot matches, even if the (awesome) multiplayer never really catches on.","December 6, 2014","true","4.7"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","37","40","2","0"

Claims it only has partial controller support, I've had no issues using just a controller. It has a perfect mix of Parkour/Platforming & Action/Fighting & doesn't take too long getting used to the controls.

Games for Windows Live has not been a problem for me anymore, and multiplayer works fine like it did before. I should note i'm running Windows 10 and it works perfectly. The game itself has quite some flaws such as audio inconsistency, support for up to only 1600x900, and actors not working properly (rarely), but overall it's a fun game to play through and manages to create that TRON atmosphere while playing.\n\nThe real gem hides in the multiplayer feature of this game. There are arenas where you can have disc wars, light cycle battles, or even both at the same time against other players. There is also different gamemodes such as capture the flag, bit runner, and control points. Unfortunately, there are not many daily players for this game right now, however if you manage to get a group of friends or host an event, I can assure you it will be a very fun experience.\n\nI would rate this game a 8/10 and recommend others to play, as well as the multiplayer as it's one of the most fun things to do in TRON: Evolution.","December 24, 2015","true","24.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

If you can get past its myriad of flaws, the game itself is at best an “ok” experience.  4/10\n\nPROS-	You are a tough as nails rogue program on the Grid with cool parkour abilities and a disc that probably says “Bad Mother*%&@)^” on it in Hexadecimal.\n-	The world is recreated quite well, which is a treat for Tron fans.\n-	Light Cycle levels while being shot at  – WOOOoooOO!\n\nCONS-	The platforming is one of the best examples I’ve ever seen on how *NOT* to make parkour controls in a video game.\n-	Tank controls are excruciatingly awkward.\n-	Combat gets repetitive after a few levels.\n-	Meh storyline that is easily forgettable.\n-	A good chance you may never be able to run the game, and even then you will need to edit the .ini file.\n\n\nTHE FRENCH PRESSED FULL CUP LONG REVIEWGet your Daft Punk helmet ready.  You know the one that looks ultra amazeballs with LED’s flashing twitter memes across the front.  You’ve been eyeing this game for a bit, and feel like it’s time to strap a disc to your back, fire up a  lightcycle, and headbob to that awesome Tron soundtrack.\n\nOh, but wait.  I forgot to mention – the game may not run at all.  Oopsies.  That’s right.\nThe first thing you need to do is get Game for Windows Live to work.  Good luck with that.  I managed to get it to work, but a good chunk of folks could not. So, be prepared to ask for a steam refund because it could be unplayable.  There is a guide in the Community Discussions that is quite helpful for what it’s worth.\n\nIf you manage to get the game to run, then you also have to edit the .ini file in WordPad to get a resolution that works on your screen.  I typed in 1920X1080 on mine, turned off the intro screens, and disabled that annoying intro cinematic from starting each time.  Good to go, right??  Um…sort of.  It didn’t recognize my Xbox controller at the beginning; you have to turn that on in the settings.  NOW, I can play.  Really, man, after all that hassle this game better be good.\n\nIt’s not.  The beginning is quite nice and you’ll be wowed by the slick looking monochromatic world of Tron in all it’s 60 FPS glory.  But early on you realize a major issue. The platforming is a little off.  Run up to an edge to jump and – nope.  For some odd reason you did not jump off correctly, but plummeted to your de-rezzed death.  Try again…okay.  Now I am speed running on wall when I didn’t want to.  Try again, and YES got it.  But once I landed the character ran along the wall again without wanting to and jumped off the edge.  REDO.    This happens pretty much all game long, from the first chapter to the last.  There were a few nice areas in Levels 4-5 where I didn’t jump to my death 50 times in a row, but overall the controls are absolutely bonkers.  It astounds me.  Can you imagine if Shadow of Mordor had controls this bad?  It would be the fail of the year.  Yet, somehow the mediocrity of Tron Evolution lets it slide.   You can get better after time, but even then there are bad spots where you spend more time trying to get the parkour controls to work than fighting bad guys, including the bosses.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe game is linear without any real missions, just level chapter to level chapter. You fight with your disc weapon and a variety of good combos such as electro-poofing someone away or slamming the floor really hard to make them fall down.  Rarely did I get stuck on a boss or swarm fight.  I could disc slam or explode the floor with relative ease. The gameplay itself wasn’t bad, albeit repetitive.  But wait, some rather good games are repetitive, correct?  So, why complain?  The rhythm of the fighting is basically the same over and over.  There are few bosses and the ones you do encounter are not a giant sweatfest of stress to get past.  Not that it’s a bad thing, but expect bosses to be slightly different variations of the standard tough bad guy you’ve been attacking the whole time or dozens of swarms attacking at the same time.  On top of that, you can just spam the special moves over and over.  It’s *fun*, but just so-so.\n\nThere are tank fights. And this is where you cue some derpy circus music because it’s sort of like a grown man driving a little monkey sized tricycle.  Just play the controller with your nose, it’s about as accurate.  Wiggle-move that tank across some bridges and blow up other tanks, etc, etc.  Let’s get ready for a snails paced bit of action and excruciating maneuvers through a few tight corners.  I could have made a gag reel of that.  Somehow, I didn’t die: go figure.\n\nNext up, we have light cycle action sequences!  Right here, is the best part of the game.  You on a light cycle, zipping around and driving through mines, tanks, exploded data bits, and gunfire hailing from the sky.  AWW, YEA. Yet, it’s not what you’d expect.  What I wanted – what I think we ALL would want – is to be able to kill baddies with my light cycle in a maze like mission level.  Instead, you get an almost rails-on sequence where you just avoid pitfalls.  Not the best, BUT, you are on a light cycle.  How cool is that?  A light cycle!\n\nLastly, we have online battle arenas.  Except no one is there, ever.  But the nice thing is that there are bots who are surprisingly fun to play with.  In no time I was leveling up and getting all sorts of unlocks.  I think I may have more fun here than in the entire game.  It’s a total battle royale of tron inspired multi-player havoc.  I put in several hours with the bots and enjoyed myself immensely.\n\n\nSTORY I can’t really say much about it.  You are a random program just minding your own business when Tron and Flynn get their butts in trouble. You have to find Flynn while the evil Clu decides to kill all the Iso programs and take over with his new color coded minions.  Quorra is there ( her face looks weird ) and she guides you for a bit until you have to rescue her.  That’s about it.  Add some baddies and cut scenes  - viola.  Voices are well done, I’ll give them that.\n\nGRAPHICSI found the look of the game to be gorgeous.  Frankly, it’s the eye candy that keeps the player from just quitting.  If it was janky looking or didn’t have that Tron vibe, I doubt I would have bothered to keep going.\n\nSUMMARYIt could have been so much better!  Just slap on some better controls from another game and get rid of Games for Windows Live.  Then, it’s more like a 6/10.  As it is, this game is a hassle to set up and a so-so game experience.  I just shake my head at what could have been.","April 4","false","22.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","10"

The negative reviews are because of the second part of that sentence.   Games For Windows Live is required, but what installs with the game is the version as of this game's release date in 2010.   Both it and any nVidia PhysX drivers you have will need an update to work, and you'll have to uninstall the G4WL that installs and install a fresh newer install.\n\nOnce I had that done, the game was a blast.   First two chapters and already driving down a crashing building on a lightcycle and doing battle using tanks.  The Parkour is so-so; it would be great, except you can tell it's a port; that tell-tale "why is my badass computer lagging" sensation appears now and again.\n\nI play this game in 3D and I will say it's great as far as visually.  Many games don't properly support that, but seeing as Tron Legacy was a smash 3D hit, they couldn't have not.   You'll need 3dVision from nVidia to do it.\n\nThe actors are all there, but don't get too excited.   Olivia Wilde clearly did not do her own motion capture; that woman walks like silk across velvet, but her character here looks like a nerd at a school dance doing the running man.   If there was an actor that needed proper capture in this game, it was her.\n\nNow to the danger.   Real danger.   As the game continued, it got more laggy.  And more laggy, It was in weird places too, where you'd be mid-motion and the screen would freeze because it was having trouble loading its resources properly (bad in combat).   After I quit, my computer behaved, but when I restarted, she wouldnt' come back online.   CLU must have escaped the grid and had his way with my Master Boot Record because I just spent 2 hours with the UBCD's data recovery suite and a Win7 install disk fixing it.\n\nThe crazy thing is, I think G4WL's install caused two new partitions to appear (FAT32) that were reporting as 2.5 Petabytes in size.   That, or CLU really did copy the whole damn grid and brought it with him.   Maybe it was the Isos?  All I know is for a brief moment I had petabyte drives showing on my little 120GB SSD and it was fun to pretend that was reality.\n\nRecommend, but back up your crap first.","December 8, 2014","true","8.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Certain levels requires you to get your timing right before disaster happens. Like falling buildings, floor disappearing and activating a couple of switches in a time limit. Is very challenging.\n\nIf you end up struggling with progression. Due to stronger enemies. You can replay your previous chapters to build up exp to level up your version level. Or to find or search for remaining Tron Files and the Shard disc pieces. You can even level up by entering the Grid Tournament or Multiplayer mode. Which you can gain exp for faster level up. To make you stronger.\n\nI would recommend this game if you're up for the challenge. So far I've being playing on casual difficulty. And it's still awkward defeating the enemies. So I would assume expert difficulty would make the enemies much more difficult to defeat.","January 17","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artibyrd/recommended/315440/","artibyrd","Artorius Maximus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artibyrd/","333 products in account","First the positive: The game looks pretty and sounds cool, the atmosphere really puts you into the Tron universe.  The story ties in with the new movie with recognizable characters and scenes, although I didn't get far enough into the game to really give a valid opinion on the story itself.  As a big fan of the Tron fanchise, I was growing somewhat skeptical of where the story was headed before I quit playing.\n\nNow the negative:  The game is an obvious console port.  It's definitely more difficult to play with a mouse and keyboard, there is a distinct advantage to using a controller.  This in itself is not a problem, but it detracts from the experience a little for me to think about how this is a game about living inside a computer that wasn't actually originally designed to run on one.  The gameplay itself is visually appealing and basically alternates between levels of psychedelic parkor and flashy combat, with the occasional crazy vehicle level thrown in.  None of the gameplay is particularly difficult or challenging however and it becomes a little rote after awhile - except for when it becomes ridiculously hard in random spots but for the wrong reasons.  A spot of particularly bad level design that led me to get frustrated and put this game down was a 'disc station' you visit for upgrades placed right next to a cliff.  You have to perform a jump combo off this cliff to get to the other side by first pressing A to jump, but you also press A to access the disc station.  The end result is I repeatedly ran up to the cliff edge, accessed the disc station instead of jumping, then fell off the edge.\n\nOther thoughts:  If you're looking for a good Tron game, play Tron 2.0 instead.  It's older than this game and pre-dates the new movie but is a MUCH better game than Tron: Evolution.  I think Tron 2.0 had more thought put into an original and engaging story because it wasn't just capitalizing off the success of a new film, and the gameplay was both more challenging and rewarding.  Sure, it's not as pretty as this game, but is still an attractive game and still looks way better than the original Tron movie!","December 25, 2015","false","2.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","3"

While I am enjoying the storyline and the graphics of this game, the gameplay (i.e., what matters) is sucky. This is the worst game I have played in a long time. I don't have a gamepad or console controller, and the game is so broken you can't use any combos without one. (Without combos, ordinary enemies basically become bosses). I'm not fond of platforming either, but at least that part of the gameplay works. The game is glitchy (Tron 2.0 may have had an apparent villainous camera as part of its plot, but Monolith could not have known how prophetic that would be) and badly ported.

Google it.  It's a life skill.  That said, if you already own an Xbox, or use any MS services, or own Win 8.x, then you probably have a MS account, which you can use with GFWL without creating anything new.  It's simple.  Once you get that out of the way....\n\nThe actual game is decent... good, but not great.  There's some oddball resolution choices (720p if using a TV is max you're getting through the game menus without attempting tweaks, which I did not)... but that's not a huge debbie downer to me, since most "last gen" console games only rendered at 720p (sometimes less!) anyway.  The visuals are good... a decent rendering of "the Grid", but nothing extremely flashy... it's appropriately sterile looking.  The CG cutscenes are just okay, with not enough budget thrown at them for the characters to look very realistic.  You do get Bruce Boxleitner, Olivia Wilde and even The Dude's actual voices.  The game's story ties into and basically serves as a prequel to Tron Legacy.  Gameplay is similar to recent Prince of Persia titles but lacks that level of polish.  It's not bad, though.  Music is very good, cribbing some of the Daft Punk tracks from the film, as well as some original tunes (some of which are lame, but several are updated versions of music from the original 80's film!  Awesome.)  Vehicle controls are wonky but usable, and checkpoints are mercifully frequent so that if something (i.e., the controls or a surprise hole opening up in front of you) kills you, you can get back to where you were very quickly.  Blowing stuff up in a light tank is difficult to control fun.  If you're a Tron fan and don't mind (or like) PoP mechanics, then this game is more fun that it really deserves to be.\n\nScore:\n\nGraphics: 3/5\nSound: 4/5\nGameplay: 3/5\n\nOverall: 3/5\nRecommended, if you're a PoP or Tron fan, otherwise skip it.","February 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I won't recommend it in this state, though. Only get in on sale and do not support Disney being lazy!\n\nMore detailed:\n\nI had a lot of problems before I could even get to the main menu. I tried to get this game running on Win7 x64 and it installs an older version of Games for Windows Live, which would always crash when entering a password to sign in. Yes, you need a Microsoft account to get achievements and save progress.\nI got rid of the crash after updating GFWL to the latest version that is mentioned in this guide:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=471762880\n\nIt should be Disneys job to bundle this version with their game, but they don't care.\n\nAfterwards, I still couldn't sign in to this program, because I got a cryptic error message and spent 2 hours typing commands into a terminal. While that was fun for me and I consider it being part of my own personal TRON experience, this is unacceptable for a non-geek.\n\nIf you get around the GFWL obstacle and you don't have a controller I recommend you to get one. It's a lazy console port and playing it with a keyboard isn't fun at all. You can put a program called "x360ce" into the game folder and use any controller you want, but only an older version from 2011 will work with the game.\n\nThe game itself is fine, but finding multiplayer opponents to connect to is very hard. Probably because you need to be Crash Override from the movie "Hackers" to sign in to GFWL :P\n\nI already played through this game before and the Singleplayer campaign can be beat after 5-6 hours, if you're slow.\n\nToo much of a hassle for this price. I can't recommend this in good faith.

I wasn't able to run this game at all on Win 8.1 until I uninstalled GFWL Marketplace and reinstalled the latest version. Additionally, I had to go into the .ini files to change the game to 1080p.\n\nWith that aside, this game is not bad. It's very similar to Prince of Persia. Wall running controls almost the same. The level design starts off really well, but then half way through the game the platforming isn't as exciting. Combat is not fun. It comes down to figuring out which move does the most damage on which enemies, and then you spam that move. The game tries to add variety to the gameplay with light cycles and tanks, and both of those are not great either. Tank segments are really bad. Though I have a lot of complaints, I think the game is worth checking out for people who like Prince of Persia or Tron. The graphics, music, and style of the game is great. The story takes place before Tron Legacy and all the main actors are there to play their roles. It's not a great game, but I think it's worth checking out.","March 16, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like Tron. I also like Tron Evolution, the movie. I would love to recommend this game to any Tron fans. But there's one reason why I can't. I just can't.\nIt's the controls.\n\nThe controls are some of the most horrendous, hideous and insidious controls I've ever encountered. Never before have I had a game where the controls are actually actively working against me.\n\nFirst of all, battle. You basically have to aim the character at an enemy and hope he throws the disc at the enemy and not somewhere else. Bad enough, but it can be worked out.\nHowever, in the platforming passages, some stuff is virtually impossible. When you want to make a vault off a rail, you have to hit that rail perfectly. However, with a camera that never knows wether it should react to mouse movement by a slight shift or by a huge swing, that's hard. Then there's the wall-running. I've seen some well controlled wall-running and jumping, like in PoP 2008. However, here it's virtually impossible. The character seems to jump on and off the wall at random, more often than not it doesn't react to the buttons pressed, and at times even jumps off when NO button is pressed.\n\nMy conclusion: the character is actually a suicidal ISO that only does as it's told when it feels like it. Most of the time it doesn't feel like it and prefers jumping into the void to be derezzed.\n\nNow, that wouldn't be THAT bad, if I could just continue where I left off. Like, quicksaving before a difficult passage. But NO! The game starts me at some checkpoint earlier. And it doesn't save the progress. It actually forces me through all the tutorial messages AGAIN, all the while I can't move or do anything. But I can't just close the messages, can I? No, I have to actually WAIT for the game to courteously allow me to close the messages when it sees fit!\n\nWhy the hell does the game actively prevent me from playing?

It probably won't work the first time you run the game, I highly recommend checking out the troubleshooting threads. (I got it to work by changing my computer's locale to English, but that solution might not work for other people.)\n\nThe story serves as a prequel for Tron: Legacy, helping set up the events of the movie and giving you new insight into the plot of the series. Gameplay-wise, Tron: Evolution is decent. It's not the best game I've ever played, but it's not the worst either. It's a third person action game that has a high emphasis on combat and parkour. I personally found the controls to be a bit awkward, but I was using a keyboard and mouse. I recommend playing with a controller if you have one.\n\nBottom line, this is a decent movie tie-in game that I can easily recommend to fans of the Tron series. However if you're not a fan, I don't think you'll get a lot out of this game because it doesn't really innovate or bring anything new to the table that you haven't seen before in other games. If you're a Tron fan and want to learn about and experience The Grid for yourself, consider giving this game a try. If you're not a fan, maybe don't bother. Or go watch the movies first.\n","February 1","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

About an hour and half of that was spent trying out the multiplayer arena which, if you've been playing through the story mode is like turning the game down to super easy.\n\nStory: 6/10 Entertaining but playabilty-wise is basically just: Fight handful of bad guys with one disc, run and jump on a few things, fight another handful of guys with a different disc.

The bad guys in story are much harder than the groups of people in the gaming grid and that's not saying much.

If that's worth $20 to you then this game isn't a bad choice.\n\nAs a side note, I had no problem playing this game with an xbox controller. And installation works as long as you follow the guide which is basically just going to the Games For Windows Live website and downloading/installing the latest version.","February 25","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It probably won't work the first time you run the game, I highly recommend checking out the troubleshooting threads. (I got it to work by changing my computer's locale to English, but that solution might not work for other people.)\n\nThe story serves as a prequel for Tron: Legacy, helping set up the events of the movie and giving you new insight into the plot of the series. Gameplay-wise, Tron: Evolution is decent. It's not the best game I've ever played, but it's not the worst either. It's a third person action game that has a high emphasis on combat and parkour. I personally found the controls to be a bit awkward, but I was using a keyboard and mouse. I recommend playing with a controller if you have one.\n\nBottom line, this is a decent movie tie-in game that I can easily recommend to fans of the Tron series. However if you're not a fan, I don't think you'll get a lot out of this game because it doesn't really innovate or bring anything new to the table that you haven't seen before in other games. If you're a Tron fan and want to learn about and experience The Grid for yourself, consider giving this game a try. If you're not a fan, maybe don't bother. Or go watch the movies first.\n","February 1","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nothing remarkable, and in fact has many, many annoying moments, but the opportunity to be in the Legacy-era world is enough for me to enjoy it. Multiplayer is the best part about it in my opinion (especially since the single-player campaign has some hardest-to-judge, infuriating platforming I have ever come across).","February 7","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I unstalled it and i hope they might give me a refund for the game not working on windows 8.1 but i doubt it.","January 21","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise, skip.\n\nThe good:\nNails the aesthetic\nTies together pieces of the story prior to Tron: Legacy\nparkour and combat make you feel pretty awesome\nbasic combat is true to the movies\n\nThe bad:\nHard to get runnning on modern systems. Had to uninstall the Games for Windows live it installed, install from the Microsoft website manually, log out of the Microsoft website and back in to accept new licensing terms AND had to reboot the computer to get the THIRD LAYER DRM to allow the game to start. Just ridiculous. I spent more than an hour getting the game to do anything, even get to a splash screen.\nControls fight you, particularly trying to wall jump away to specifc points\nAbilities are fairly repative and require you to memorize very simplistic rock-paper-scissors match ups\nEffectively no progression system\nPlatforming puzzles and combat both overstay their welcome, and it becomes a grind fest about half way through\nNo multiplayer community left\nFairly short (7.5 hours on normal)","January 12","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, TRON is one of my favorite titles and the controls and very comfortable, it's a bit of a hard game, but you don't forget the cotrols and combos once you learn them. It says partial controller support, but it's pretty much full, unless you're using a PS4 controller solely because it doesn't have the 'select' button.\n\nThere are a couple things you have to download for it to work and that's Microsoft Live Games and the most recent PhysX, after that it works great and also uses your Microsoft account for their achievements and such. Weird but whatever. LoL","January 28","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mixed reviews kept me away from it for a long time, but I finaly got it and loved it. If you want more TRON, this game will satify you. The visuals, the music, the characters, its all there. My only complaint is that it could've been a little longer. Get this game and fight for the User!","February 21","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By challenging I mean like running from buildings falling apart,  avoiding/ trumping the impact of explosion,  managing your health while in the middle of fighting a mob of sentry programs, etc it's very challenging.  The story in this game takes place before the Legacy of Tron, Pritty much like the TV Series Tron Uprising but, before both Tron Uprising and Tron Legacy.  So yes the story great you wont be dissapointed, the graphics are tramendous, the game play is very enjoyable/ challenging, and the music is so good, I want a soundtrack of it.\n\nTheres also a multiplayer in this game however it is not active.  You're not likely to find anyone else in the world to play this with you.  If you manage to get your friends or me to battle with you in the Game Grid, you can still enjoy the fun with multiplayer experience of this game.  I highly recommend you and your friends to play this game.  Your gonna have lots of fun.  See you on the Game Grid User -End of Line-","April 28","true","16.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
