There are no, I repeat no video options whatsoever. The graphics are a step down from Crazy Machines Elements and Crazy Machines 2. Also I don't really understand the sense of the rating system. The less parts you use multiple times the better. While this could lead do creative solutions it doesn't make anything really effective. Instead of aiming for the simples solution you just do an overly complicated one to score more points. Again this is a disappointing game for me. Crazy Machines 2 is a lot better!","April 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

Clearly designed for a touch screen. Would not recommend if you dislike touch screen interfaces. Have completed the XBLA edition which had a much better (but still fiddly) interface. Played this for 40 minutes of which 39 were spent getting frustrated at the controls.

Figuring out how to solve problems in unique ways was entertaining. As others have mentioned, it is annoying that the game penalizes for using a single item multiple times when it's the most logical way to solve the puzzle. This results in some really crazy machines (see what I did there?) that aren't practicalat all. This is fun at times, but sometimes I felt ridiculous going through all that trouble just to get more points.\n\nI reccommend the game, but I also wouldn't blame people if they wanted to wait for it to go on sale.","April 11, 2014","true","15.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The 3 stars system isn't clear and it's boring to try different solutions without knowing which one will give more points.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oscarsimpson/recommended/265240/","oscarsimpson","A_Spoopy_Oscar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oscarsimpson/","155 products in account","As a fan of the original game, I saw this when it was on sale and I thought for Â£1.74 it should be worth it. Even after reading the reviews, I thought I couldn't be as bad as people said it was. It's awful.\n\nThe star rating system seems okay at first, until you design a really cool system (for example on the button+lever light level near the beginning, I had a pinball drop and be moved a bit with a magnet after it fell off, then punched upwards, all carefully designed so it would fall on the button: 1 star). The star enocurages you to come up with a boring method that uses different compontents, and as few pieces as possible. This does not push you towards an interesting method, but trial and error to try and find the only way of getting 3 stars. The gears are a complete mystery to me. You start with enough to get all the hints and all the levels. What's the point? If it's there for a score then it is a measure of how much time you had to repeatedly fail and try to guess what it wants you to use.\n\nGameplay wise, I would disagree with the other reviews: I find the positioning of objects quite simple, however I do miss the sections as there was in the original game. The controls do seem okay, but it would be nice to be able to know what things do without placing them in, clicking a different button, then clicking on the item again. Surely a tool tip would be much more sensible.\n\nI have not tried the user made levels, nor the level editor, as I did not wish to waste any more of my time. If it is any good then it may be a redeeming feature, however I believe that the overall system of rating would be even worse on user levels.\n\nI would rate the game 1/10. The game is awful, there are no options for graphics, or sound (other than enable/disable), and the replayability appears to be nil. I have not played past the first 10 levels as I became overwhelmingly bored. Even for fans of the original game, or first time players, this game is not worth the bandwidth to download it. Do not get it even if it's free.\n\nTl;dr: Do not download this game under any circumstances. Everything about it is awful.","June 18, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/265240/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Crazy Machines: Golden Gears is the latest addition to Crazy Machine franchise, released sometime in 2013 on smartphones and in 2014 came onto Steam. Crazy Machines franchise is Incredible Machine-like genre of building contraption to solve the goal.\n\nAnd yes, it's qute a direct port of game from smartphone. User Interface didn't change much, so you will have to drag and click with left mouse button around a lot and seeign all the huge icons with no descriptions. Nothing too badly. Lacks options though, just lets you disable or enable audio and such.\nYou will notice game showing amount of Golden Gears you have, which is currency of a game and you earn it by completing puzzles with more stars, something about sharing levels too, and then you spend it by unlocking 42 official puzzles and by using special hint that creates one-star contraption for you. I think that for smartphone version you would have had to spend some real money to get enough of golden gears.\nBut don't worry, Steam version gives you gives you enough Golden Gears that they don't matter. Like game says itself, it's enough to unlock all puzzles and to use all hint solutions. So you can just ignore this thing.\n\nGame reuses most of assets from Elements. Well, or at least it has similiar style. Don't mind the backwalls that you see in screenshots, they are just decorations this time around, you can place elements anywhere you want. Graphics are simpler, they use models with less polygons than those in elements, makes sense. Background isn't that terribly interesting. There are short bits of music that playes occasionally, but most often it's just silence and some sounds.\n\nGameplay is quite different this time around. They are more on level of Challenges from Crazy Machines Elements than classic Puzzles. Instead of having to fill the already built machine with missing elements and firguring out a single solution out, you will have to build whole machine from scratch. Goals are quite simple, there aren't many pre-placed elements. As far as selection of elements you have, there is a bit of everything. Aside from more complex systems. It does have logic system from Elements there too, which was used mostly for editor in Elements, while here you can use it in regular puzzles. So, there is more than one single solution and you can do it in any way you want. Or any way that works at least.\n\nBut then, it's not about just beating the game, even though there are puzzles that make you think how to do it. As you know, Crazy Machines had bonus completion implented in it. This time, it's your oh-so-favourite smartphoneish three-star system. And here where the game tries different approach. It tries to make you build the more Rube-like machines. You have to use less of same elements, thus making you use some elements in less direct way. I think it rewards variety too. You also should use as least amount of elements as possible too, I guess. Game tells you to use more of "dynamic" elements than "static". With examples like: use conveyer belt instead of metal board or use explosive bottle to turn on the switch.\nBut the thing, when you already have to build the machine from scratch and requirements for top-scoring is vague, you can't really figure out what is the best way aside from just trying whatever idea. Game would have been more fun if it told you more than just "you used some elements too much". Some more direction would have been helpful.\nIt also uses hints system too, yes. You can either reveal hints or you can make game build a one-star machine for you.\n\nIt also allows you to share and download others levels. They are completed in same way as normal puzzles, but without three-star system.\n\nIn all honesty, it's the one Crazy Machine game where I didn't bother to perfect each puzzle. Blaming lack of direction, I grew bored of it after a while. I don't know and don't want to bother with getting higher stars. I just used hint-solving on last few puzzles to see how it goes. The fact that I have to open menu and drag each elements again even if I want to use same elements is annoying. Even though I am not supposed to use same elements all time. But then again, this gameplay where you build everything from scratch is not. I prefer more of classic Crazy Machines puzzles, where I have to think really hard to figure out the placement of missing elements to make chain-reaction work.\n\nPhysics are also a bit glitchy as usual. You know. Placement of unrelated to chain-reaction elements may impact the movement of other unrelated objects.\n\nBut I can see that some may like CM: Golden Gears. If you loved Challenges mode from Crazy Machines Elements then try this one.","June 9, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
