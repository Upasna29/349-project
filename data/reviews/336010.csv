This is only a "compact" version of the full game. There is no career mode, no 250f, no custom riders, and all of the bugs present in the full game are in this one, as well.","December 5, 2014","false","0.3"," 56 of 73 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","56","73","3","1"

Not an absolute sim but controlling the racer needs attention, turning, leaning, breaking really have an influence on how you progress. I like how you can slide into corners and how your bike's tires get the grip when you accelerate in the right moment. No doubt this is one of Milestone's better products!\n\nJust finished a championship on medium difficulity; one 3-lap race on each track. Took 1hrs and 48 minutes. I guess my next championship will be 2-race, 4-5 laps each, hard difficulity. Than that's it for me - a good but simple game, great deal for the money.\n\nTo be honest I was not interested on the other version's career mode, I just wanted some quick races, that's all. I you are really into motocross, get that one. (same title, without 'compact' in it)","January 2","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dabei muss ich aber betonen, dass diese Compactversion von der Technik und vom Gameplay her deutlich über der von MotoGP liegt. Hier kann der Preis von 10€ eher noch hingenommen werden. Dennoch würde ich jedem empfehlen, frisch den vollen Titel zu holen. Sollte dieser euch nämlich nicht gefallen, dann könnt ihr immer einen Refund anfordern. Seit es Steamrefund gibt, sind diese Compact-Titel teilweise sinnlos geworden, aber wer nur mehr wenige Rubel in den Taschen hat und ein Cross-Spiel für zwischendurch benötigt, kann es gerne im Sale ergattern.","April 26","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's only $10 for the compact game, not a terrible price it could be worse folks. People said bugs were present in this version but were patched in the full version of MXGP but personally I had no problems with the game. The compact version doesn't offer a custom rider ability :( which that does kind of suck but sheesh it doesn't take away too much from gameplay and what not. And sadly the biggest con of this version is no career mode (getting factory offers for race team, etc) but for $10 you can't expect TOO much from it. For someone who wants to try it out or someone who doesn't like motocross too much I recommend this version but for anyone else I recommend the full version but all in all the compact game is still really fun and personally I enjoy this one and think its a good buy.","February 21, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

It's a compact version of the game and looks great. Don't let the "madbrah" reviews   keep you from having fun with this game. Not only am I enjoying it, i'm recommending it to my friends and may in fact buy it for them. There was a download issue the "first" night, but they fixed it in a matter of hours. They were on top of the issue, and it works wonderfully. Again, great game for $10. No, it's not the full game, that's why is says COMPACT...come on guys. Give this a fair shake and leave your butt hurt at the door.","December 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

I think that every racing game needs one.\nThe price is right.\nCons:\nAfter falling of his bike, the rider clips through the dirt.\nSometimes the audio stops working after a race, and you have to restart the game.\n\nThis compact version doesn't include a career mode. I usually skip that mode in racing games anyway because I prefer setting up races exactly the way I want them to be.\nIf you only wish to jump into a dirt bike race on the track of your choosing once in a while, this is the version of MXGP you should pick up. In case you would rather race in a career mode with your own customised rider, I recommend checking out the full version.","December 9, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the bike physx on the ground with the leaning function make riding more realistic then say reflex. The jumps are two small or the bikes are too fast i cant decide which but scaling is a problem as i find myself over jumping everything and nose diving into the ground. The next game needs a serious overhall in the controls department but graphicall its solid with bike models being rendered very well.\nOverall the game is worth getting especially on sale , but be warned the multiplayer is a little broken .\n\n6.5/10","February 11","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
