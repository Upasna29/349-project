There is actually a decent sci-fi narrative in there; albeit one that is a bit cliché. And the characters actually have personalities that manage to be mildly interesting. Mix that in with classic Unreal FPS gameplay and you get a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\nThe narrative will escort you from mission to mission (level to level), as you explore various worlds in the vastness of space to accomplish your goals.  In between each mission you return to your spaceship where you can interact (mildly) with your crew and arrange your armament for the next mission.  Having conversations with your crew allows you to gather background information and expands on some of the lore aspects.  In this way, there are some parallels with the early Mass Effect games.\n\nThe different missions will take you to diverse environments with various objectives, but the core gameplay doesn’t evolve much throughout the game. However you will be able to unlock new weapons and armaments as you progress, which allows you to keep things fresh as you finish up the campaign.\n\nOne main complaint with Unreal II: The Awakening is that the movement speed is much slower than in other Unreal games. To be honest, it didn’t bother me that much. Luckily, if it does bother you, there is a way to increase the speed of the game using the console.\n\nSo it is true that Unreal II: The Awakening isn’t perfect, but I still really liked the overall experience quite a bit.  I think if you enjoy sci-fi FPS games with decent narratives, and need something new to play: this is a good game for you to consider.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","10.4"," 43 of 53 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","43","53","0","0"

The dialogue is fun and the graphics holp up very well but the gameplay is slow and the loading times ridiculous (maybe it has something to do with my system but playing on 'hard' means you will see more of the loading screen than the actual game even when returning to a quickload). LOADING-STANDBY-INITIALISING...The psychodelic intro is nothing like the game. It was probably hard to top the creepiness and sense of alienation you had in the original, as well as it's speed and agility.  Still, the game has enough variety in the settings (very different planets and climates) and the weapons (very cool stuff including a flamethrower, turrets, and even a spiderthrower) to make it worthwhile.","February 26, 2015","true","20.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

Like many shooters from 2002-04 (such as Doom 3), its perceived flaws were more a question of originality as we headed toward more complex games like Half-Life 2, something that console shooters of the day like 'Halo' were never tarnished with. This is all of course, nowadays irrelevant. Imaginatively pretty graphics, atmospherically slower pacing, and a story with characterisation ahead of its time blesses this game with somewhat alternative priorities. It's a lot of nostalgic fun, and a great purchase for especially those who aren't extraordinarily familiar with FPSs.","February 19, 2011","true","0.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Still, after the first Unreal we had to wait 5 years for this and 2003 was just a year before 2004, the year when a lot of big names appeared; each offering something new in terms of technology (Far Cry, Doom 3 and Half Life 2, just to name a few).\n\nInterestingly, the developer was Legend Entertainment, the guys behind the expansion pack of the first Unreal game (the company has since gone defunct) and it is a shame they could only come out with a generic shooter. While graphically the game was amazing it had little to do with Skaarj, the main antagonist species we fought so hard in the first episode. The story now is very different (but then again Quake 2 had nothing to do with Quake 1, right?); it revolves around an artifact our marine hero is set out to retrieve.\n\nGameplay-wise Unreal 2 is quite exciting: with John we regularly return to his ship to converse with his companions who can prepare us for the next mission. This hub area has free roaming characteristics until the moment you commence your next mission which is very linear. We visit several planets; all with its own visual theme (we have deserts, snowy areas and even an alien spaceship here) just to  make the gameplay more interesting.\n\nToo bad that there are too many cutscenes (the generic dialogues make them boring after a while) and for some unknown reason the game only has very generic weapons. Where is the Flak Cannon we have grown to like? Here you have rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers - all too generic even with their alternative fire mode.\n\nThe game offers a decent, 9-10 hour long campaign but not multiplayer. I understand Legend came out with an expansion just to add the missing feature to the game. Still, Unreal 2 is a mixed bag. Its unique weapons disappeared from the sequel and while the story was interesting there was not much to go on with the Skaarj. The voice actor for the main protagonist was a definite miscast.\n\nIt runs well, though. There are some error messages upon launching the game but using Windows XP compatibility mode can solve all the problems. I am upvoting it mainly for sentimental reasons (after all, it was a good pastime before the new generation of FPS games were released in 2004) but perhaps you are better off with the Gold edition of the first game.","May 29","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The running speed is unacceptably slow. Another reviewer, Resi, provided the following advice in their review:\n\nAccess console using ~\nType BeMyMonkey\nType setspeed 2\n\nWhether this helps the game, I don't know.\n\nYour weapons are very weak and extremely difficult to aim. The reticle often seems to have a very loose association with how your bullets wil actually fly and this cupled with the accuracy problems and slow movement makes this a VERY frustrating game to play through. START ON EASY! I learned the hard way.\n\nYour efforts are rewarded with a story that is predictable from start to finish with no subtlety or spice to make the journy worth it. You fight through generic sci-fi facilities and planets, killing generic shooter enemies (aliens with guns, humans with guns, bugs) with the Skaarj enemies that made the original so memorable rare and watered down. For comparison, the original Unreal barely had a story, but it explained what was going on on Na Pali with such subtlety that you didn't care. It could be the story of a man trying to survive, or a freedom fighter, or something in the middle based only on your interpretation. Instead, we have a muguffin hunt in space.\n\nIf you have it, try the cheats above. I will. If you don't, remember, DON'T PAY EXTRA FOR THIS GAME!

This, however, is a gamebreaker, as the Unreal franchise depends on fluid movement and combat. With this setting off, it's tortorous to play, but is the only way to prevent the game from crashing. I was really dissapointed, because I had so much fun with the other Unreal games. If you are an absolute, die hard Unreal fan, you might be forgiving of this. I will die hard for this series, but I will not die this hard.\nEven from the few minutes I played, it is clear that this game borrowed heavily from Halo: Combat Evolved. Unless you can get this game to work as it is designed to, I recommend you play Halo: CE for the PC instead. However, because it isn't on steam, you will have to find a disc copy (GASP!) like me. If that's too much trouble, play UT2004 instead.\nTo all those that remember a time when PC games actually came in cardboard boxes and not DVD cases.","June 1","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you loved the original Unreal this is not the game for you. The environments are linear to the point of being boring.

The story is boring and muddled, only the immediate ending is remotely interesting but then its over. Having a ship and a crew should have been cool, but the developers never fully realized it.

It does not feel like Unreal, does not sound like Unreal, does not even look like Unreal. There is just one alien race and three names of corporations reminding you of the other games of the series.\n\n\nNot everything in this game is bad. Graphics are really nice for a 2003 game, and you fight in a wide variety of different environments, from a standard desert military base to the internal organs of a huge planet-covering alien creature. The TCA Atlantis, your own spaceship, has many nice details in its rooms.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it lacks all the best aspects of the first Unreal. Maps and missions are very linear and predictable. Your movement in the bulky mech suit is clumsy and slow. The way of combat is quite different, not necessarily bad but not appealing to the fans of fast FPS. Background music isn't as impressive as in the first U. Storyline is OK but also quite short and flat. You won't feel the same mysterious atmosphere that made the first Unreal so great.\n\n\nWant something like Unreal? A fast-paced survival FPS? Do not buy this.\n\nWant a generic sci-fi tactical shooter? You might like this, although I'm pretty sure there are better alternatives.\n\nOverall grade: 4/10","January 29","false","10.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

I could overlook the annoying voice acting, the unoriginal/uninteresting story, the boring characters, and the generic level design, if it wasnt for these two simple things:\n\n1. The movement speed of your character is the slowest I have ever encountered in any video game. Ever. This defats the whole purpose of the unreal franchise, since its trademark is dodging and jumping your way through hordes of enemies, evading their oncoming fire. Instead, I'm backpedaling frantically, desperately spewing bullets into my enemies' faces as they outrun and swarm me.\n\n2. The gun loadout in this game is incredibly boring and lackluster compared to the other unreal games. instead of ten unique and highly creative weapons, you simply get a standard military loadout and whatever guns that your enemies drop. Probably the most interesting weapon I've encountered is the grenade launcher, simply because its gets 6 kinds of ammo and the ability to switch between them at will.\n\nSo yeah, those are the gamebreakers for me, and adding all the stuff I mentioned before just makes this game not very enjoyable. The ONLY reason you should get this game is if you're a big fan of the Unreal franchise and want to brag that you've played all of the games.","April 7","false","5.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The guns are kind of cool, and there are a few challenging and fun to fight enemies. Really, it's just hard to say anything is majorly wrong with the game, but there isn't much they did super well. The guns are kind of cool, and if you played Oblivion, the main character's voice should sound VERY familiar. The biggest flaw with the game is probably the story, it starts off so slow I don't have any urge to play for it. The characters are neat, but I wish I could interact with them more. If you want a good old shooter to waste some time, this game won't dissapoint. If you want the next big hit arena shooter, you're going to want to pass.

Anyways, I remember playing it, liking it, but then again, I was 9 when I played it.\n\nNow years later went by and I'm an adult now, is Unreal 2 as good as I remember it?\n\nHELL NO.\n\nLet's get the positives out of the way first, the graphics of Unreal 2 are good and weapons are unique just like the environments, from a gun that shoots spiders to a grenade launcher with multiple ammo types, the guns are good.\n\nBut that's about it.\n\nUnreal 2's story has nothing in correlation with it's predecessor, Unreal 1 and RTNP.  In fact, the only thing that Unreal 1 and 2 have in common is the fact there's Skarrj, and that's about it. U2 does try to add Liandri, Izanagi and Unreal Tournament references in there, but it goes over the head like the comedy.\n\nCharacters are nice, but bland.\n\nAnd then there's the gameplay.\n\nU2 is single-player only (unless you get the XMP pack of the net), and while the environments are nice looking and unique, it doesn't help that each mission is about the same; go in, kill a bunch of dudes and aliens, solve a puzzle and get the artifact.\n\nIn between missions, you can talk to your crew aboard the USS Enter... I mean Atlantis, to get briefed about your next mission, learn about your weapons and learn about the backstory of the crew, that's it. It serves it's purpose.\n\nBut sometimes when normal missions aren't enough, U2 likes to throw a curve ball in the form of defense missions.. and these can BURN. IN. HELL.\n\nDefense missions asks you to defend an area or a person for a certain amount of time, using force fields and turrets and Marines with Derpy AI to guard the objective from waves of enemies. The problem is that not only do they break the boring flow, but some of them are a pain, be it the derpy AI marines, the derpy targeting system of the Turrets, the fact that it takes little time for the enemy to plow through your defense with ease or all three.\n\nAnd let's not forget that one DICKWAD on Janus named Meyer... The biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in U2 who constantly ♥♥♥♥♥es about everything. EVERYTHING.\n\nWith all these things combined, I cannot recommend Unreal 2: The Awakening to anyone, from veterans on Unreal to new players.","December 20, 2014","false","4.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","0"

The major difference between the two is that while Halo sucks, Unreal 2 doesn't. The graphics are better, the combat is better and there are no tedious driving segments or pitiful attempts at an epic story with Disney enemies. The story is simple, involving chasing artefacts throughout the galaxy, which serves as an excuse to showcase some epic and varied environments that still impress. Despite the low-key story, there are some good character interactions and a very gutsy ending. The only downsides I can think of are the rather slow walking speed (a sprint function would have helped a lot) and a soundtrack that doesn't live up to its predecessor's reputation. Also note that the game's human enemies are annoyingly difficult on the hardest skill setting so take that as a word of caution if you're planning on yanking up the difficulty level.","February 15, 2015","true","8.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Unreal II is not an Unreal game.\n\nIt's controls feel nothing like Unreal, it's weapons are nothing like Unreal and in general the atmosphere and design is a departure from anything previously made by either Epic Games or Digital Extremes. The sad thing about this sequel, besides soiling on the legacy of the franchise, is that even as a benchmark for the then new Unreal engine 2.0 it fails big time.\n\nThis wreteched entry deserves to put out of it's misery and forgotten for good, until it reappeared on Steam I was making a decent job of it too...","February 4, 2012","false","9.5"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameChap/recommended/13200/","GameChap","Game Chap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameChap/","148 products in account","Awful. A true insult to the Unreal series.\n\nUnreal and Unreal Tournament are my two favourite FPS's of all time, Unreal offers a beautiful fast paced single player adventure with Awesome Multiplayer and Unreal Tournament IS Awesome Multiplayer. Unreal 2 is Neither.\n\nThis game has no reason bearing the name 'Unreal'. The ONLY connections to the previous games are a few similar weapons and the incredibly forced appearance of the Skaarj. That's it. The only other reason it has the name is because it uses the Unreal Engine, which is absolutely stupid, it would make as much sense calling XIII Unreal 3 or Dishonored Unreal 4!\n\nStorywise the game offers nothing, you play as a generic Space Marine whose role is to fly around the universe with his Stripper/Captain, an engineer who was probably homeless before this job and the Unreal universes version of Jar Jar Binks. None of whom have much in the way of personality, general likability or interest.\n\nWeapons in a Nutshell: The Dispersion Pistol from the first game, Except it can't be upgraded and is never used. A pistol which delivers a lot of damage but has low ammo, rarely used. A generic Assault Rifle (how creative). A shotgun that fires both regular rounds and fire rounds (kinda cool). A Flamethrower that can also fire flammable liquid and then be ignited (or you could just set the target of fire initially showoff). A Rocket launcher. A Sniper Rifle. A Gun that has interchangable rounds, yet you rarely find a use for each individual round, ultimately creating a mess of a weapon, 2 alien laser guns. A gun that shoots spiders (less coll than you would think). And a Black Hole Launcher that is only used in the last level.\n\nThere is an Escort mission in this game, and the guy you have to escort makes Natalya from Goldeneye seem like Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite. He is such an annoying whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ and you just want to kill him, but killing the guy results in a game over. To rub it in your face, when you beat that level there is a cutscene where Blandy McSpace-Awesome is told to kill him, and he refuses, you don't even get a choice, you just watch as the game gives you the finger.\n\nLevels are slow and empty, they usually contain few enemies, the game appears to be playing like Half-Life yet the enemies are all laid out like Splinter Cell, this is a Bad Thing. There is no exploration either, one of the things that made the first game so good was that you had to explore to survive, you found something new each time you played, this game does not, and as such has no replay value.\n\nThe Biggest sin of the game is that IT IS SOOOOOO SSLLLOOOOOWWWW. Your character moves like he is wearing Lead Armour and there are sections of the game that make you roam your ship just to talk initiate random chatter with people you don't care about, This coming from a series famous for it's fast action gameplay. Oh and the game is 6 HOURS LONG! The fact you move to slow feels like a cheap way to artificially lengthen the game.\n\nTo Spoil the ending (Because this is one of the worst games I have ever played); Your Crew gets killed (I think you are supposed to care) and you are then sent to see some alien mutate into an uncontrollable beast, This is the Final boss btw. When you kill it you get the aforementioned BFG Black Hole gun and you kill a bunch of identical and now inferior mutants, against an artificial timer as the ship heads to a sun. Oh and turns out some random guy you forgot about betrayed you and you kill him in a cutscene. Offscreen. You don't even get to see the impact. And you escape.\n\nHonestly one of the Worst FPS games ever, and it's a shame because the developers clearly put more effort into the art design than the actual game. Yes, despite everything I've said the sole positive feature is that the game looks REALLY good. But other than that there is NOTHING. Oh and there is no Multiplayer either, yes, the series that managed to redefine multiplayer experience has a game with none at all. Perhaps if it an alternate name then perhaps it could jsut be forgotten about as a Generic FPS, but the fact it shares the name with two of my favourite games is insulting.\n\nDon't buy this. Play Unreal or Unreal Tournament instead.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Garbage.","November 27, 2013","false","16.0"," 10 of 38 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","10","38","0","1"

In the regard that the developers stated this was a sequel to the first game, this game was sub-par and hardly lived up to the role of the previous installment. If taken as a separate game, I think it was good and still be considered a classic. I like the environments being large and consist of a variety of different themes to them. Although, the choice of how you want to approach the situation in the environments is usually limited beside the choice of what weapon to use in the approach. Also, this game, in comparison to Unreal: Gold, the levels seem to break up the game into levels. I think in the first installment, the game flowed like it was a sold experience that easily felt like one long campaign. Also, I can't go without mentioning that the levels seem short in general and for some reason, the load times are insane unless it is a short cutscene. The soundtrack is not a masterpiece but still fitting and good. The AI is still somewhat intelligent and can be funny at times. So, overall, I thought the game had some problems but it was still very enjoyable, I would play this game again and definitely would recommend this to fans of the series or first person shooter fans.","March 31, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now find and change to suit your system?\n\n[WinDrv.WindowsClient]\nWindowedViewportX=1024\nWindowedViewportY=768\nWindowedOffsetX=-1\nWindowedOffsetY=-1\nFullscreenViewportX=1920 Change to res you want here?\nFullscreenViewportY=1080 Change to res you want here?\n\nNext at 1920-1080 res on my tv the refreshrate within the game is set to min 60Hz, so i need to find it within the config file and change that.\n\nNow scroll down and find it.\n\n[D3DDrv.D3DRenderDevice]\nUseHardwareTL=True\nUseHardwareVS=True\nUsePrecaching=True\nUseTrilinear=True\nUseVSync=True\nUseTripleBuffering=False\nUseCubemaps=True\nReduceMouseLag=True\nAdapterNumber=-1\nMaxTextures=0\nMaxBlendStages=0\nDesiredRefreshRate=30 Default is 60Hz min in the game menu but i need it to be 30Hz. change this to your DesiredRefreshRate?\nUseStencil=False\nDetailTextures=True\nUse16bit=False\nUse16bitTextures=False\nUseCompressedLightmaps=False\nLevelOfAnisotropy=16          Default here is set to 1 but i will change this to be 16 for best? check your GFX card for this.\nDetailTexMipBias=0.800000\nDefaultTexMipBias=-0.500000\nAvoidHitches=False\nDescFlags=0\nDescription=\nHighDetailActors=True  This is set to default at false? change this to say True? i will check this one out again to see!!\n\nSo excellent all done for now hope this helps.\nWould recommend this game to all FPS players its old but worth a score of 8/10 easy :)","February 10","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had the same issue. Even the very first level feels unbeatable at such slow speeds! It was frustrating! Fortunately, this game was created during a certain age in gaming that respected cheats instead of selling more powerful weapons and ammo or resources as PAID DLC. So here's how you fix the movement speed problem *spoiler alert: cheat codes ahead*\n\nin the console (press ~ key to open) type "bemymonkey" hit Enter-this enables cheats. Then type in "setspeed 1.5" and hit Enter again. You may want to set it to 2 or slightly higher if you want a more old-school, traditional dodge bullets instead of use cover FPS gameplay.\n\nThere you go, movespeed fixed and you can enjoy this game that actually has a lengthy campaign across several different interior and exterior settings/planets, a decent variety of weapons (with alt fire modes), varied enemies, both human and lots of different aliens, and passable graphics. Story is whatever, but if you want a good single player FPS with lots of different locations/planets that isn't Destiny's collection of horde modes in bite sited chunks everywhere in the galaxy, this is a good game to play.\n\nThe only cons for me were, no ADS, and it ended - no more sci fi adventure after you beat the game :(","May 18","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
