Another 50+ hour visual novel by the same guy with the same style is finally here on Steam first to boot! Before we get started here's the obligatory THE ORIGINAL GAME HAD NO 18+ SCENES IN IT SO THERE'S NOTHING CENSORED IN THIS VERSION that horny steam goers need to be reminded of.\n\nThere's two protagonists in this game with the main being a rescue worker with amnesia. Basically, there's been a disaster and the choices you make throughout the story helps unravel what happened in some quasi-time travel mechanics.\n\nGiven the hype it's recieved due to it's relation to Ever17, it's inevitable that there will be numerous comparisons. So here's my take on it:\n\n1) Ever17 gave you much more of an emotional impact once everything's revealed.\n\n2) The twists in this game aren't as elaborate/interesting as E17\n\n3) Root has WAAAAAAAAY more palpable suspense in it, starting from Chapter 1 (It's thick enough to cut you : O)\n\n4)  Ending was WAAAAAAY less rewarding and honestly kind of a let-down for a 50 hour experience.\n\nYou can probably finish this game in 40-45 hours if you speed-read through it with 50+ hours for those completionists. As with Ever17, the art-style is top-notch. While the seiyuu and sound-design are nothing to write home about, they aren't mediocre either as with some of the other Steam nukige VN's *cough cough Sakura*.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend you read this in addition to Ever17 and I/O if you haven't played those yet.","April 27","true","27.4"," 98 of 111 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","98","111","4","13"

Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition is not your typical moege filled with moe where it’s all about romance. Instead it has the touch of mystery, SCI FI and many more in this visual novel. It’s story is very rich and its filled with heart stopping moments and twists throughout.\n\nThe StoryThe city sends in “Sirius,” an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside in the meantime filling LABO with the ashes of its dead. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lock down lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset. There are still 9 hours before the system recovers. The rescuers have only enough drugs to prevent radiation exposure for 6 people, but what about the other 3…? Strange, phenomena keeps happening… There is also suspicion of a murdering going around as they find some researchers and rescue team members dead from bullet wounds, and three high school students who are also trapped in the lab but are nowhere to be found.\n\nThere are 6 mysteries surrounding this incident:\n1. During the incident, the captain of the rescue team lost his memory. What happened?\n2. Why were these normal high school students locked up in a place like this?\n3. A murdered body was found in the research facility they’ve been locked down in. Why?\n4. Why did this incident happen? Why can’t they get out?\n5. Why is the one that cannot exist — “that guy” — here?\n\nThe mystery gets deeper and deeper. Gradually, the constant conflicts get more and more on these people’s nerves…\nThe key to surviving is hidden 6 days ago. In the sealed memories of the young man…\n\nThe story is definitely one of the most interesting and intense story I have read. It has many plot twists and it is very confusing at first. I got a little frustrated at the front parts and at the “decision making” parts that uses the sense system as it is very vague unless you used a guide to help yourself through the story and the time frames of √A and √B these two different perspectives don’t overlap, you can’t get the full picture of the cause and details of this incident from one route alone. Only by clearing all the routes will you be able to grasp the full story. The ending chapter is very satisfying as it starts to connect all the plots together while revealing the true nature of the story. Overall an extremely enjoyable read from the start to finish.\n\nSenses Sympathy System (SSS)It does not use a traditional system when you are presented with a straight choice instead it uses an original system where you are given the opportunity to adjust certain characters’ “senses” at specific points. Each character’s senses can be anywhere from 0-8, according to what value you input into the “senses sympathy system” it may or may not change the route/plot of the story thus giving the game an unpredictable progression. A character’s senses represents their impression to others at that moment. For example, in the face of danger, raising Watase’s senses can make him more courageous, on the contrary it may make him react recklessly. The senses system is kind of vague at times, but it does a good job of distancing the player from the narrator, and it makes a whole lot of sense later on as the story unfolds.\n\n√A√A does an extremely good job of suspending the player and it is provably gripping part of the story, with dangerous events happening most of the time and a large number of bad endings the player may encounter. Desperate to survive and unravel the secret behind the incident at the lab and Watase’s lost his memories. It makes the player [me] want to keep advancing into the story without break. [That’s what I did for 12 hours straight] Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before.\n\n√B√B is provably the most boring section for me as there is quite a huge amount of info dumping from Ena about BC when she is teaching the class in the school. But then √B is very important to the story because it does not only shows what happened 6 days before the “incident” through Natsuhiko point of view, and it perfectly sets you into the direction that the game wants you to go into. It tricks the players into believing something is there. [Not mentioning because it is a major spoiler]\n\nAudio and Visual ElementsVisual Elements – Many things to note here is that the backgrounds, CGs and character sprites used in Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition are very consistent with each other in turn made the whole visual novel as whole looks “smoother”. This is really a huge thing for me overall I absolutely adore the artstyle used in Root Double -Before Crime * After Days- Xtend Edition despite it being a moege art style being used in a “serious” VN. Though personally I wish they used a different approach for the art style since it a more “serious” type of VN but overall the moege VN art style managed to fit in nicely. I got to agree with Mashiro that Salyu is super cute I almost got killed by moe too.\n\nAudio Elements – Music is a very important factor to consider in a visual novel because music has a great ability to set the mood or depicting one character personality. I absolutely loved the music tracks in Root Double. When I was playing Root Double the moment I heard Jun Moribe voice I instantly recognize it and my suspicion was right she was voiced by Tomonaga Akane 友永 朱音 the same voice actor that voiced  Kazami Kazuki from Grisaia no Kajitsu. Well I personally like her voice and I always actively seek out seiyus so knowing that Tomonaga Akane 友永 朱音 voiced Jun Moribe, I liked Jun the most of course this was not the only deciding factor. The soundtracks itself are obviously good as it fits into the game perfectly and each of their character theme songs depicts them their personalities perfectly too.\n\nTo sum upWill I recommend this ? Simple answer is yes. I would definitely recommend this visual novel if you are the type of person who likes SCI-FI and want something serious for a change. Though do note that this has some form of “difficulty” because it uses a different system that branches the player out and without a guide it will take you an extremely long time to complete the whole visual novel. I am not a fan of having “blind choices” in my visual novel I am more of the type of person that prefers to just click on my mouse all day long basically a kinetic novel is my thing.\n\nClick here for the full review!

I really wish the game had just given the option to select the choices from the get go. The sense system does tie into the story but they sacrifice wayyyy to much in playablity for what it adds on that front.\n\nThe Xtend content (which full disclosure I've not finished) doesn't feel like it adds much to the story and is eminently skippable.\n\nThe game is worth a purchase, and is good overall (especially the first quarter where the setup, suspense and writing quality was better than almost any other VN I'd read) but only grab it if you are willing to accept a deeply flawed VN whose heart is in the right place.\n\nFor fans of Never, Ever and Remember this is MOSTLY better than those entries, the exception being that I think those games handle their twists and pacing better. I feel sad because if Takumi Nakazawa and Kotaro Uchikoshi had worked on this together instead of it just being Nakazawa I can't help but feel that with the setup it had this would have been a VN of almost unrivaled quality.\n\nEDIT: Just want to clarify and say that this game has so many negatives in my review because it fails to live up to its own potential, its still better than 70% of Visual Novels I've read.","April 30","true","20.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

Root Double may be a sci-fi story, but they did so much research to write this visual novel that it actually feels realistic and compelling. They really did their homework.\n\nWhile there's no 1080p, what they've accomplished with 720p is a thing of beauty. Out of all visual novels I've ever read, when it comes to special effects and overall production, Root Double wins easily hands down.\n\nI've found all characters are believable thus far and I like it how they stand out in their own ways.

I loved the 999/Zero Escape series so I decided to give this game a shot and help crowdfund. Starting Root A is highly recommended since that dives you straight in the game as an amnesiac main character, Watase Kasasagi. You're trapped in a nuclear facility with very little resources to survive. What happened and who's behind all of this? Why do you have amnesia? Immediately, the game throws you into a survival drama and in my opinion, it was done wonderfully. Tension rises as time passes by and who would you trust? Using the Sympathy Senses System, you make decisions based on how you 'feel' towards certain characters. Be careful, you could make the wrong choice and just die without even knowing.\n\nThe game is one big ride through Root A. Root B however, is world building that leads to the events of Root A. Some twists in Root A are casually explained in Root B so I would recommend you not to play Root B first. Root B was slow in my opinion, but I understand why it had to be. By the end of Root B, you'd be thrown into a world of twists and turns and things start to come together.\n\nI loved the ride in this game and the amount of detail they put into it. There are subtle hints that lead you to the twists, extra scenes depending on your SSS, and more content than I initially thought. The ending ties everything up nicely with all the character's motives and backgrounds explained as you go along. Near the ending suffers from pacing issues since there's a ton of explaining. There are heroine epilogues based on your decisions also. There's also a neat skip feature ('R' key) that skips to the next decision or unread text so you can quickly unlock different endings.\n\nThe ending didn't give me an explosive feeling like I did with S;G/999 but it was tied up nicely and well worth the ride. There's tons of content in this game that can easily extend to 60-70 hours+(I still need to unlock everything). Overall, I would rate this an 8/10; it gave me a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of mystery and drama VNs.\n\nPros:\n-the ride was great\n-in-depth characters\n-twists were shocking\n-multiple endings\n-jun best girl\n\nMid:\n-ending didn't stick out to me but that's subjective. still good overall.\n\nCons:\n-end pacing was long\n-a certain twist was kinda disappointing to me. ('N')\n-the romance of a certain character was sub-par","May 12","true","53.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

I've spent a lot of time getting a bunch of bad endings - there are many of those in Root Double. You might find gathering them to be enjoyable, just like in Fate/stay night.\n\nNow, something that could be seen as a negative or even a positive depending on what you're looking for: It's kind of... "straightforward". The dialogue and narrative. It doesn't seem like the kind of story where you end up thinking hard about something deep that a character just said/implied. And yea that'll be a negative for some (like me). But that may or may not change with the later routes. Technically I've only seen one part of the VN. Already proven false and I'm still far from done with the VN. So yea this is very promising.\n\nThe biggest surprise for me though is how intensely mysterious AND creepy it gets at times. Really did not expect that. Scene transitions, music (some of the unnerving tracks are extremely effective), text effects, graphical effects, etc. All used very well, better than most translated VNs. I mean, to me at least, Root Double might as well have 'Horror' added as a minor tag to it. I'm impressed. Presentation-wise, the mysteries in this are really, really good. There's a sense of dread this VN gives you with its mysteries and I just love that stuff.\n\nAs it is, I'd highly recommend Root Double to people who enjoy mystery stories, such as the Infinity series and Zero Escape. I don't know how the story will pan out in the rest of the routes, but at the very least Root A is great.\n\nI'll probably make an update later after I'm done with the whole thing","May 1","true","74.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sirlion/recommended/438130/","Sirlion","Sirlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sirlion/","91 products in account","I'm a fan of the Infinity series. I've played them all, Never7, Ever17, Remember11, and also some other titles from the director of this novel that I wont mention because I dont know which is the copyright status of their translations at the moment (unofficial so probably not approved). Prior to this review, I have finished the game (all endings) and unlocked most of the epilogues. Needless to say, I'm also a big fan of Mr. Uchikoshi - and therefore his best friend maker of this game Mr. Nakazawa. So what to say....\n\nSpoiler warning\n\n\nBlick Winkel changed his pantaloons and was given a smaller role in this novel, but it's still there. Mr. Nakazawa loves to play with the 4th wall. Wether is Self, Mr. Spirit, Blick Winkel, or Santa Claus, it is always the same thing. So... if you have played another novel made by KID or Regista, you will know what to expect. This is a good point for those that didnt play any other novel from the same author, but for "us" avid readers it feels old quite fast.\nThe twists were all expected, so much so that I often had to shake my head in response to the hints in routes B and D while muttering "Really? Is this it?". Everything feels so simple, so... easy to figure out. It is clearly a more bland, easy going experience if compared to Remember11 or Ever17, it is closer to an anime than a proper visual novel of this genre. I was always expecting a new twist or a final revelation that never came. It feels a bit dull in the end.\nSome moments were a little cheesy, others were totally out of place. Route A is the best because its something that fans of the genre and the author know and expect\respect, and its great for setting the mood. B feels a bit boring, has its unnecessary moments, classic anime reactions and characters with one note only, to be fair my least favorite despite the good twist, again easy to figure out. D was a bit of a mess. Deus ex machina, plot devices out of nowhere, characters once important then forgotten in the background with 2-3 lines every hour or even less. The True Ending didnt satisfy me in the least. The Good Endings were fine, but still not really worth the effort because the outcome could be spotted from a mile away.\n\nOverall, I consider this one of the lesser titles that Mr. Nakazawa has created, if we speak about the storyline and characters. The bad endings werent so appealing too, R11 bad endings were terrifying and shocking in comparison, something that Root Double lacks. The "main vilain" is a joke, but it serves its purpose. I just wished that the info dumping part would end in route B instead of being dragged on till the very end of D, where any normal person would have noted what was important and could have figured out on his own the remaining answers.\n\nEven after the complaints, i recommend this title because its visually stunning, has great voice acting, good sound design, and it embodies a genre that absolutely needs to be ported on to Steam en masse. If you dont mind a very light hearted journey through the lives of nine people trapped in a laboratory dealing with all sorts of dangers and philosophical speeches, and you can get over some really stupid lines, you may enjoy this product. I hope many people get to love this genre so we'll all play new extreme escape adventures of great quality.\n\n\n\n\n","May 8","true","68.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The thematic similarities -especially the focus on the role of the "observer" - are there, but it also puts its own unique twist on that theme. It would go completely against the whole point of what is to a large part a mystery novel to go into too much detail here, but what I can say is that the writing is solid, the setting is interesting, the characters are well realized, and the high quality music and art both serve to flesh them all out. If I had to point to anything negative, then - again like the "Infinity" series - the pace could have stood to be somewhat more brisk at some points in the story.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this is easily one of the best VNs currently available (in complete form) on Steam, and well worth a purchase.","June 5","true","36.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

While it may not be the most exciting visual novel for large portions of the story the overall package is worth the time investment put into it.\n\nThere are 2 Routes presented to you when you press start:\n\nAfter: Which takes place from the point of view of a rescue worker caught in the middle of a terrorist attack on a Nuclear Reactor/Research facility.\n\nBefore: The events that lead up to the terrorist attack in the week before it happened from the viewpoint of a young student. Yes, it does start out as boring as it sounds.\n\nWhich route should you read first? A, without a doubt. While I would actually recommend switching between the routes every chapter I don't think anyone would do that, so I recommend you start with A.\n\nAlso I'm not sure if it was just me but one of the earlier issues I had (is 20hrs still early?) was the lack of any real emotional investment in any character. I couldn't find myself caring about anyone by that point, but somehow in the last few acts the VN finally sinked its teeth in and the feels do indeed get real. Not sure why the first 20+ hours of character development didn't do anything for me, but if you feel the same don't worry the meat doesn't even begin until the second half.\n\nPros:\nA fantastic story\nIncredibly well done foreshadowing at certain points. It's the small things.\nVery fleshed out characters\nGreat voice actors\nA well done term glossary\nAn explanation for what you did wrong if you ever get a bad endCons:\nWay too much over-explanation on repeated concepts\nLots of repeated events (Not a huge con for me personally since you can skip through them)\nHuge sections of slow pace (there's a section that takes place at a school and it really feels like you went to school) that add very little at times (only argument for it is rounding out characters and unnecessary extra-foreshadowing)\nWay too much easy to notice foreshadowing for certain events.\nEveryone is related to everyone trope (I was basically shouting at the VN warning that it better not do this. It did.)Overall:\nWould I recommend this? If this is your very first Visual Novel? Probably not. I would definitely recommend some lighter reads or some mixed Genre VN's instead, but if you've read enough to know you enjoy the medium and can handle the slower pacing then I could not recommend this enough. My personal favorite on Steam at the moment and it ranks up there with my favorite VN's in general. I wish they subverted the reader's expectations based on the foreshadowing a little more, or used less foreshadowing in general but excessive foreshadowing isn't exactly a bad thing especially if you miss a few hints.\n\nFinal warning though just to be clear: When this gets slow it gets VERY slow. Stick it out. It will be worth it.","May 28","true","65.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, you cannot simply read my mind and probably won't understand what it is that I felt playing this game, so I'll start and end this review with only two statements:\n\nFirst, this was a good visual novel. In fact, I'd say it ranks up there with some of the great ones. In essence, there was laughing, there was crying, and there were many feels in between. There was also some difficulty to get it 100%'d due to some difficult endings. Speaking of endings, the final ending wrapped things up nicely. The most common complaint I hear from people who played the Ever17, Remember11, and Never7 (The Infinity Series) games or games like Steins;gate, 999, Virtue's Last Reward, or Dangonronpa (all games I've beaten) is that these people may not find the game having quite as much "mind melting" in terms of plot twists. All I have to say about that is... if you like these games, stick through to the end. After all, it's about the journey, not the result. Besides, it isn't true... there are enough of those if you actually pay close attention.\n\nSecondly, I do want to stress that you WILL be sad if you beat this game, which is by design. Or, at least I was, and perhaps the game did leave a lasting impression on me, like the other games I listed above. However, I feel that I'll especially remember this game for a long time to come and I think I'll remember the characters above all else, as the game really nailed characterization and making some believable, likable characters.

Later this month we'll be getting the closing chapter "Zero Time Dillema".\n\nAnyway, Root Double is a sci-fi visual novel about 9 people being trapped inside a nuclear research facility called LABO. After an explosion occurs and a "Case N" is announced, the facility enters a timed lockdown and those 9 souls must survive until it's lifted. However, too many things seem strange about the incident, and the answer lies within the memories of each one, both after and before the accident.\n\nFirst of all, PLAY ROOT A FIRST! I cannot stress this enough. Otherwise your enjoyment of the story will be severely damaged.\n\nSecond, even though it often gets compared to the Zero Escape series, know that Root Double is not so much about the survival as it is about it's characters and the worldbuilding around the novel concept of Beyond Communication (think Telapathy, but way more detailed and explained in well researched scientific terms). It has its fair share of tense moments, and Root A in particular is more focused on the increasingly dire situation, but after that things slow down a bit to focus on characterization, which I didn't mind at all: it still had tons of suspenseful foreshadowing and it was absolutely entertaining throught.\n\nIt has some problems, however: some of the biggest twists are rather predictable and I felt it lost some opportunities of creating really awesome scenes using it's core storytelling premise, which is absolutely BRILLIANT by the way. Not to mention how it's choice system, despite a bit confusing at first, is a breath of fresh air on VNs.\n\nEven so, do not let this dissuade you from trying this out: it's hands down one of the best, most meaty and all-around great Visual Novels on Steam, trully showing that the medium can be much more than porn or dating-sims. Hell, it clocks around 50 to 60 hours to complete all the content, it's price is more than worth it.\n\nPS: also, for those of you who enjoy it, there's plenty of bad ends. I love how bad ends makes you think through your choices.","June 1","true","50.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But even if you're not, if you're a fan of games with a lot of story and sci-fi, you'll enjoy it.\n\nPersonally I found the story kind of dragged a lot of the time, but it was still good. A lot of the plot points are infuriatingly obvious, but you have to bear in mind that the characters don't see everything that you do.\n\nThe Xtend episode felt like a complete waste of time to me, it was 90% repeated content that isn't flagged as read so you can't skip it without changing the settings. The rest of it was really centred around romantic subplots, which I can understand people enjoying but personally I wasn't interested.","May 11","true","70.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a nice ...\nslice of life story I suppose, which leads to what will eventually happen in 'After'.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I played through route 'Before' first.
