"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977461113/recommended/244630/","76561197977461113","The Spartan<TWM>","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977461113/","345 products in account","It's difficult to figure out where to start on NEOTOKYO, so I'll say this right up front: NEOTOKYO is--in my humble opinion--one of the single greatest achievements in videogames, and a true masterpiece right up there with the likes of Catacomb 3-D, Wasteland, Pathologic, etc. Now, I've been playing videogames 40 hours a week for the past decade and a half, so at the risk of hubris I'd say I'm well qualified to make such a claim. The hard part is substantiating it.\n\nSo why is that? In short, NEOTOKYO is a wonderful marriage of art and craft: it combines the disparate elements of Japanese cyberpunk with high-impact tactical shooters and does so with such flair and polish that I've never once seen before. Consequentially, it maintains a duality between its inspirations and must be judged on both the quality of the gameplay, and the world that it inhabits. You'll often hear the term "Ghost in the Shell meets Counter-Strike" bandied about, and while such a phrase is no doubt accurate I think it sells the game short.\n\nAs a game, NEOTOKYO has many superficial similarities to Counter-Strike: it's a round-based, objective-oriented FPS without respawns and a heavy emphasis on teamwork wherein the player picks their loadout at the beginning of each round. That may sound like derivative-going-on-copyright-infringement, but just as there's more than one way to skin a cat there's more than one way to make a high-lethality team game. Unlike Counter-Strike and its clones where terrorists must plant and defend a bomb, the goal in NEOTOKYO is to recover a neutral item 'ghost' from the center of the map and escort it to the enemy spawn. This is further complicated by the fact that the 'ghost' will provide what's effectively wallhack to whoever has it equipped, at the cost of being unable to defend themselves and lit up on the enemy HUD. The effect is profound. Where Counter-Strike is strategic zone control in a very simple, small scale environment; NEOTOKYO is about successfully navigating a very large labyrinth and either escaping with the ghost or eradicating the enemy team before they can. The maps are suitably large and full of various nooks and crannies, which makes the CS style of covering all approaches and knowing exactly where the enemy is coming from impossible. Instead, it's about keeping close to your teammates, keeping alert and either outmaneuvering or ambushing your foes prey. Situational awareness is the name of the game, and you must at all times be aware of every angle while being careful not to expose yourself to enemy fire. It's tense and immersive in a way that is difficult to put into words, but suffice to say I have no doubt that the games' best players are the sort that can catch flies with chopsticks.\n\nBut that's not all; there's also a class system. I won't get into the specifics, but here's the broad strokes: there are 3 classes, a light ('recon'), medium ('assault'), and heavy ('support'). Light classes move faster but have less HP/armor, and vice versa. Each class also has a vision mode (NVGs, motion-tracking, thermal), and the ability to cloak or otherwise conceal themselves. Lighter classes cloak for longer, vice versa. Each vision-mode makes tracking your foe easier when they're cloaked, uncloaked, moving, hiding, etc. but weak against the inverse. Thermal can't see cloaked people, night-vision can't see anyone in bright light, and motion-tracking should be self-explanatory. It's all very simple in the abstract, but when you put it into practice in real nuanced environments everything becomes infinitely more complex. It's a lot to take in, and that's only vision! Movement affects timings and map access, and max health (of course) tempers your aggression. Can't go in guns blazing when a stiff breeze is enough to put you in the ground, right? And this all works within the context of your team, necessitating you change your class and loadout whenever possible to maximize your and your team's effectiveness. There's an old tagline from the original Counter-Strike which I think fits better for this game than any other: "Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role."\n\nSo I've talked a lot about to everything leading up to the gunfights, but what about the gunfights themselves? Since I've used Counter-Strike as a reference so far, I'll continue the trend here. The shooting is suitably visceral, the guns have real punch, and you can see some pretty high octane ultra-violence on occasion. The single greatest change is the precision. Weapon accuracy has been uniformly reduced from the genre standard laser beam precision, and recoil is a simple random spread that increases with fire. There's no 1-AKs from across the map or recoil patterns to memorize here, there's so much focus on everything leading up the shot that shooting is almost an afterthought. It however, is by no means simplistic and you'll find it easily up to par with the various Call of Battlefield fare that's the current norm. The spray does introduce an element of randomness into firefights, and while death is never cheap, the imprecision will no doubt be frustrating to the sort of people with <100ms reflexes that railgun in Quake Pro duels. Everyone else won't notice after the first 10 min. Finally, instead of the complex economy and money system, loadouts are based on a simple ranking system. After scoring a certain number of points, the next tier is unlocked. It's not earth-shattering, but the choice of primary weapon is a significant consideration. So that's the gameplay, what of the art?\n\nAs for the world the gameplay inhabits...it's like nothing else. Not since Mirror's Edge have I seen such a pretty game. The world is fully-realized, the art style is powerful and unique, and I've yet to find a single asset that hasn't been made from scratch. The dev team says that the game was in production for 4 years, and it absolutely shows. This is the kind of quality that can only be seen from a team with the passion to work a second job for free, just for the love of creation. The world is so believable, so incredibly atmospheric just because of this dedication! It's abundantly clear the devs took the time to sit down and think through everything about the world: the logistics, function, architecture, style. It's not just convincing, it feels truly real! The devs say that the game was heavily inspired by the likes of Ghost in the Shell and Akira, and it certainly shows! But more than that, the world isn't just a tribute to the works of their inspirations, but different and its own. It's a world that can exist in tandem with Shirou's and Otomo's, but is neither a pale shadow of nor dependent on theirs.\n\nIf you want to see the love put into this product, this absolutely free retail-quality product, just listen to the OST[edharrison.bandcamp.com]. Only once before have I heard a soundtrack that complements the game so well (Morrowind). In the end, I can count on two hands the number of truly great tactical shooters I've played. I can count on one hand the number of truly beautiful games I've played. I cannot think of another truly great game in such a picturesque setting. And that's why NEOTOKYO isn't just "Ghost in the Shell meets Counter-Strike". From there most games would stop, but that's only where NEOTOKYO starts.","February 22, 2015","true","84.7"," 301 of 356 people (85%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","85","301","356","29","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxy_Opa/recommended/244630/","Foxy_Opa","Producer-san","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxy_Opa/","730 products in account","I can't believe that I forgot to write a review about NTÂ° up until now.\nThat said... Changing this now! This game stuck to me for pretty much 4-5 years, so I might aswell add my few cents to this.\n\nFirst things first. We're looking at a Source-mod based on the SDK from 2006, so I warn you in advance that it's of course not free from any flaws. Those flaws, so we say, are called the "Authentic NEOTOKYOÂ° Experience" - Last through those, and you are battle-hardened to enjoy this game.\n\nNow, going down to the core. The game itself offers a pretty straight-forward style of gameplay, you boot it up, join a server and play, just like it was with HL 2 Deathmatch back in the day. You join a team, either NSF or Jinrai, which both function the same way, no different weapons or skills, just different skins.\nThe objective of the game is either to eliminate the enemy team or capture an item called the "Ghost", which functions as a kind of flag to deliver to the enemy's spawn which is also known as your cap-zone. The Ghost allows the holder to see enemies on a range of 45 meters, which means that he can give his team a great advantage by calling out location and range.\n\nBoth teams have three classes: Recon, Assault and Support, which obviously have different attributes to them.\n\nRecon - Unlimited sprint, longest cloaking duration, fastest moving speed, Nightvision mode, a remote detpack at 4 points, a low-dmg silenced pistol, a super-jump (Uses "Aux-Power", makes you leap a greater distance), low HP as a trade-off, comes with mostly SMGs early on. Usually recommended to more experienced players.\n\nAssault - Limited sprint, medium cloaking duration, medium moving speed, Motionvision mode, a grenade by default, a semi- or full-auto pistol (can alternate), medium HP, comes with SMGs and ARs early on. It basically is the all-rounder to start with.\n\nSupport - No sprint, no cloak, slow moving speed, Thermalvision mode, two smokegrenades by default, a heavy-cal. revolver, high HP + no headshot dmg modifier when hit, comes with medium to heavy weaponary early on. It's beginner-friendly, yet sometimes impractical when you try to retreat.\n\nHaving that explained, there's one or two dozen of maps to try out these classes on. Some are community made, some are not - that said, we always encourage mappers to create some of their own battlefields to spice things up, every admin would be open to give it a test run.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it feels a little slower than other games, yet is quite fast-paced. There's no iron sights, bunnyhopping is encouraged, you can use E and Q to lean around corners to gain an advantage and like mentioned in the class descriptions, there's also cloaking to gain an advantage over the enemy. To top this off a bit more: When a team is also willing to actively communicate, you can get very good coordinated and tactical play going aswell. This can be enforced by locking down areas, defending the ghost, or using it to gain valuable intel that can win the round.\n... That said, don't expect much on a Friday, because that's where the bizzarre side of the game comes out... I speak of experience here, I am part of the problem.\n\nWith all the good out of the way, there obviously are flaws, which I hinted at as the first thing in my review. Time to get to those aswell!\n\nThe engine: Yes, it's dated. Knowing this, the game won't perform in a way it should at times, also making the game crash on map-change or when joining a server. My advice would be to set the textures to medium, that fixed crashing for me. Besides that, it may also make maps run a bit less fluid than they should. My rig for example should run source-games just fine, but there's two maps that still cause my FPS to slide down by a fair amount. It's overseeable, but not optimal of course.\n\nThe gameplay: The game is a rough diamond, so the gameplay is far from perfect. There's things such as the "sprint-bug/no-shooting bug". It's a bug that appears when you reload and then follow up with sprinting right after, causing the weapon to still remain empty until the sprinting has been ended. It doesn't happen often, but it is there. Then there's other bugs like your camera spazzing sometimes when throwing a nade, or your vision tweaking out when scoping in with a sniper. Tabbing out can also be a murderous thing for the game, so beware. And the last bit is that the movement and certain other aspects just are not fully-optimized, so I advise you to go into the game with that mindset.\n\nTeam-attacking: It's on. Permanently. There's anti-TK measures in form of plugins, but people yet always try to abuse the idea of being able to kill mates. Though, to cure that warning a little, we have a lot of admins that spread across all current servers, making it an easy problem to deal with. Just.... keep in mind that it might happen, even when it's not unintentional.\n\nThat said, I think that sums up the general idea, I personally can say that I love the game to bits ever since I picked it up. Not only that, I also do think that it's the only community that I ever dedicated so much time to. It's a great community to be in, wonderful people and memories to be had. If you want more info on what shenanigans can be discovered behind this game, check out this video, which also comes with a stat-rundown with a few things!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB-9Ge3X4Ps\n\nThat said... Enjoy the game if you decide to pick it up, I am also open for any sort of questions related to it! Thanks RADI-8 for this rough, yet wonderful gem.","November 5, 2015","true","467.4"," 133 of 148 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","133","148","15","4"

With pushBAK's[www.pushbak.org] distinct cyberpunk style and accompanied by a two album OST by Ed Harrison[edharrison.bandcamp.com]\n\nWhile often compared with Counter-Strike, the only things these two games share is an engine and round format for its primary game mode (Capture the Ghost). NEOTOKYO's complexity and depth derives from its in-game features (invisibility, vision modes, etc...) and engine functionality, and less from its weapon handling (which is basic at best). Old Source rules here, 6 years past its initial release players have adopted playstyles that make the most of how Source engine used to deal with movement; bunnyhopping, wall-strafing, air-strafing, wiggle-walking are commonly deployed situationally alongside the game's core features. Positioning and movement is key and a heightened situational awareness is required (which can be greatly helped by a little teamwork). The game can be played at a blistering pace between as little as 6 players on many of its deeply dynamic maps.\n\nUnfortunately to some, the majority of NEOTOKYO's depth and learning curve comes from the aforementioned points. While it may have never been the original developers intention for these "exploits" to manifest themselves in common meta, the game would have very little depth without it. The gun mechanics are next to non-existant, working simply as a random cone of dispersion effective immediately after a first shot. Pace would be dictated solely by the limitations put upon each class in terms of sprint speed, duration and map accessibility. Essentially leaving the skill cieling to peak as far as map knowledge and basic situational awareness, with little room for individual player ability to flourish without these "exploits".\n\nHowever, if what you're looking for is a fast-paced, cerebral game where raw-input finesse is as important as it would be within an Arena Shooter, but with added scenarios for team work. Neotokyo just about manages that, even amongst its many flaws.","August 4, 2015","true","780.9"," 142 of 161 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","142","161","8","22"

Let me start off and say that it used to be "Very Positive" for very constructive reasons, and it needs to hit that mark again, because this game doesn't deserve it's brief negativity.\n\nThe reason people seem to be thumbing this game down is not because of the gameplay or anything. Almost every aspect of this game is amazing, and as I said, this game used to be "Very Positive". The reason why people are thumbing this game down is because of a moment where the community sort of died. There were hardly any players at all, maybe a couple of players in a single server, but that was it. The negative reviewers seemed to have installed this game at a low time for this community. If you want further proof, just check the front page reviews, and you'll see they're all positive and reasons why.\nHowever, this was a brief moment and the community is alive again. Now I'm seeing two full servers at once, and maybe a couple of others player alone in another server. It's not particularly a Call Of Duty-level playerbase, but it's certainly just enough to get a game going any time. I started playing Neotokyo again and It has sucked a lot of hours out of my life.\nJust remember: The community isn't the most living, but don't say a game sucks because of it. It's an excellent free game, without any microtransactions, so downloading it wouldn't hurt your wallet if you happened to find a day where the servers are empty. Thumbing it down because of small playerbase is just silly, because I don't see many people saying Team Fortress Classic or Battlefield 1942 sucks for the same reason. Considering those games are also something you pay for.\nOh, and people say it's Counter-Strike with Ghost In The Shell influences, but I prefer to say it's Japanese Cyberpunk Rainbow Six.","February 21, 2015","true","43.2"," 102 of 120 people (85%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","85","102","120","10","1"

This game isn't for people who just want to pick up and play.\n\nHowever, if you git gud, this game is fun as hell. Plus, it's a free stand-alone mod. So hell, there's really no downside to downloading it.\n\nThe comparison to CS is made a lot, but really only because it's the only thing close to it. Games of Neotokyo are extremely dynamic, and each round can go in any direction. The first round, you could spend the whole 2 minutes slowly picking off stragglers. The second, you could get your whole team wiped out by a recon det-rush. The maps were designed for easy flanking. Because of this, teams need to adapt to their enemy strategies, block off route (A) because their recons bunny hop through there. They know they're blocking off route (A) and coming around through route (G). etc.\n\nWhat makes the game the most fun though is the ranking and class system. You gain experience for killing, capturing the flag (ghost), surviving the round. Unlike CS, you unlock weapons through what your rank is. This doesn't necesarrily give any player a distinct advantage. There are Assault players who swear by the ZR Silenced, a rank 1 gun, and for myself, whenever I play recon, I won't play by anything other than the SRM, another rank 1 gun.\n\nUnless you're playing recon, and you're really confident in your bunnyhopping skills, you literally need to stay by your team mates. It's way too easy to die in this game, and believe me, sitting out for 15 minutes a game is not fun. If you want to stay alive, get a mic, and start talking. If the ghost is close to you, pick it up, and call out positions.\n\nIf you're a beginner and you want to learn the ropes of how to play neotokyo, then I suggest going to Agiel's Deathmatch Server. It's usually dead, but it lets you learn the ins and outs of how brutal combat can be, and how to move faster.\n\nOverall: 8/10. It's not for everybody, but it definitely should have more players than it does now.","March 17, 2015","true","109.7"," 63 of 77 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","63","77","9","0"

First that you will encounter is the classes that are shared among many games and can be basically described as light, medium and heavy. Apart from most obvious differences - selection of weapons, armor and speed, thing that makes it original is their visions. Each of those visions doesnât give you a boost like some games like to call âspecial abilitiesâ because it depends about how well you will learn to use them. Recon has a night vision, and in a world of gamma and brightness adjustments itâs most obsolete function, but so it had to be for a class than compensate it in other areas. Medium or as they call it assault have a motion vision. While itâs most useful of all visions, its grayed out colors are disadvantage for every non-moving enemy that could be lurking near you. Heavy class named support had a thermal vision which would be most useful if there wasnât for one thing â the cloak which makes other 2 classes predator-like invisible (with a disadvantage of making big noise when turning cloak off/on), and even more often harder to spot with this vision turned on.\n\nThe maps are more into simulating real architecture angles then making battle more fluid. You will find a lot of corners, dark places, hard-to-reach-but-can-be-done areas and especially choke points which will encourage more camping and demand more twitch reflexes a la counter strike then target leading. It might even turn the game into more team deathmatching then capture the flag, which is a bit shameful since that part is centered a lot more on better movement and tactical decisions among teammates. It has to be mentioned that with capturing flag players in whole team are awarded for more points for unlocking weapons then by simple wiping out the other team, as it can award you for as much as 10 points (1p=1kill).\n\nThis game plays and feels like a mod. It has a lot of originality and personality that comes from smaller tighter developing teams, especially in its design of dystopian Ghost in Shell world, but it also shows areas for improvement (or to better put it â area for balancing) which could easily turn it from good game into great one which would be worth a few bucks, pounds or euros. As it is free, there is no need to complain about that, but free to play games are turning into more and more of a âthingâ this days and it may get harder to draw new players on tight budget.\n\nNow the subjective part:\nThe community has been amazing, you will meet most wonderful people here, from child molesters, serial killers to rapists, I really felt at home here and they kept this game alive all this years.","July 5, 2014","true","13.1"," 48 of 63 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","48","63","0","1"

Being made in the source engine used for Half-Life 2, it does show it's age. But for it's limitations, it is not a bad looking game. The gameplay is solid, using elements from Counter Strike as well as incorporating a lean feature.  The mechanics that add a dynamic element to the gameplay is the classes, and their individual features.  Besides the obvious "scout is quick with low health, assault is balanced, support is slow and armored", vision is key.  The scout class has night vision, assault has motion sensitive vision, and support has thermal vision.  Why are these here, you might ask. Well, it has a dark atmosphere, support has smoke grenades paired with thermal vision and two of the three classes can activate camoflage, hence the motion sensitive vision.\nCombine all of this with maps designed with realism in mind, original firearms that don't break physics laws, this is easily on of my top games.","October 29, 2014","true","8.7"," 48 of 67 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","48","67","4","2"

I understand why this has occurred as they just want to support a classic favourite of theirs, but I can't help but feel that whilst it will work in regards to download rates and new player averages, it's slightly misleading.\n\nThe game is Source and frankly, it's quite out-dated and should have been on Steam many, many years ago. It's an okay 'game', but it's not fantastic. The soundtrack sure is, but as a game? It's just a CSS mod in reality. Sure it does quite a few things well, but it needs more features and better UI design to really make it worthwhile.\n\nIt does feel amateurish, but that's part of the charm. I like how they really pushed the neo-elements, such as the 'hostage' being a 'ghost' (Android mainframe). It's got a lot of cool stuff, and for the right person this mod will kick â¥â¥â¥.

Its community (a rather small one, I admit) consists largely of people willing to engage in teamplay, which does players' experiences a lot of good. I'd say the best thing about the mod is its setting, however. A cybernetics-focused and futuristic look at Tokyo and its surroundings, with a war raging between two groups: extremist nationalists by the name of JINRAI, who's aim is to perform a coup and establish a military dictatorship; and the Interior Ministry's National Security Forces (NSF), who attempt to maintain the political status quo and thus fight off the extremist forces. The mod's art (modeling, maps, sounds, etc) complements its setting extremely well, and succeeds in immersing you within the set universe, even if its story is minimal at best. Even if the game's content does not succeed in convincing you of its ambience, it is hard to deny the large amounts of work that the developers put into the creation of said assets.\n\nNEOTOKYO is by no means revolutionary, however, and one should not enter its universe with high hopes or broad expectations. It's a simple shooter with some fun and fresh mechanics (particularly its recurring objective and the classes players can choose from) with well-done art direction. That said, its potential is great, but is held back by the mod's age and lack of significant updates. Let's hope its steam release proves to be a communitary catalyst for things to get clicking once more. And even if it doesn't, it's still bloody free-- so give it a shot, people.\n\n-K\n\n","July 6, 2014","true","16.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","2"

There's only one game mode though, capture the flag, in this case it's capture the ghost. If you die during the round you remain dead till the rounds end. You and your team need to pick up the ghost which is randomly placed somewhere on the map and bring it to your cap zone to win the round. The twist here being when you pick up the ghost you can see enemy movement from up to 40 meters, so calling out to your team here is the key. 3 classes, assault, support and recon, each with unique capabilites and their own styles.

Back before the Steam release, when there were only two servers with damn near no one on them 'scept at the right times. It's got bugs, there's some questionable design decisions, but all in all there's nothing REALLY like it on the market. Blacklight: Retribution and the new GitS game get the aesthetic right, but not really the gameplay. This feels like a game where you use your supersoldiery to its maximum capacity. Jumping around, cloaking, using your class's special vision all work wonderfully. The guns are cool designs too, very future but very grounded in current weapons development. These are believable firearms, and they all pack a good punch and feel good to use.\n\nThat being said, this game has a pretty high difficulty curve. Not a lot of bones are thrown to new players, and the scoring system really encourages good gameplay and punishes babes in the woods too much, not giving them the tools they need to do well, and giving people who don't really need them all the fun stuff. That being said, you can EASILY kill the entire team with the weakest gun in the game if you just do it properly, and there's nothing stopping you from killing a foe wielding a more powerful weapon and taking it. Most of the difficulty comes down to knowing the maps, knowing where the ambush spots are, knowing where to look, and knowing where to go. This comes with time, but it can be frustrating to learn. The community of crazies who stick with this game too are a pretty helpful and chill bunch for the most part; you have to be to stick with a dead project this long. But it can still be intimidating to start. I'd say give it a try, and if it's not your thing, it's not your fault!","April 25","true","21.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I have been playing it off and on since its initial release in 2009.\n\nYou can choose from three different classes which all have different strenghs and weaknesses.\n\nRounds play out similar to Counter Strike where when you die, you are dead until the next round begins. There are a variety of guns that can be unlocked during each individual match. The more points you earn from kills or doing objectives you will be able to access the higher tier weapons. There is no xp or leveling and your points do not carry over each map.\n\nGun play can be comparable to Counter Strike. Firing from the hip you will not have a crosshair and you will be slightly less accurate, but you can right click to bring up your crosshair and increase your accuracy.\n\nTwo out of the three classes have an active camo which will make them invisible(more invisible while standing still, and more visible while moving). Two of the three classes have a vision(motionvision and thermalvision) to combat the active camo. All classes start with different grenades/explosives and a different set of weapons unlocked at the beginning.\n\nIf you are looking for a highly skill based, tactical shooter, NEOTOKYO will satisfy your every craving.\n\nI can firmly place this game next to CS 1.6 as being a masterpiece in the multiplayer FPS genre.

The game has similarities to Blacklight: Retribution, and Counter-Strike.\n\n~The gameplay~\n\nThe game features three classes. Recon, Assault, and Support. These three classes are pretty well balanced. Recon offers endless sprint, longer cloaking, various SMGs and Assault Rifles with silenced variants, two sniper rifles, a knife, and light armor, with the addition of a cloak, and night vision. Assault provides you with assault rifles, SMGs, shotguns, and one sniper rifle, as well as a frag grenade, knife, and medium armor, with limited sprint, night vision, and cloak. Support provides you with Assault Rifles, Shotguns, an LMG, smoke grenades, and heavy armor, but you cannot sprint, and night vision/cloak are traded out for a thermal visor.\n\nBut then we get to the weapons. The game offers a fair number of weapons, but the problem is that very few of them feel like they're actually worth using. None of the three SMGs feel particularly useful, the M41 (semi-auto combat rifle) is actually fairly bad, shotguns aren't really worth using either, making the majority of your battles be done with Assault Rifles. The problem, is that the default assault rifle is essentially the best weapon in the entire game, unless you get the Support's LMG, or the bolt-action sniper rifle, both of which are exceptionally more powerful if used correctly.\n\nThe combat, on the other hand, ranges from interesting and thrilling, to boring and dull. In some matches, you'll find yourself with a fun, and cooperative team that really makes you feel like you're working with allies. Then there's other matches where some child squealing into his mic rushes behind you the moment you spawn and teamkills you with his knife, leaving you to sit there, and watch the entire match, wishing you could actually do something, since, like Counter-Strike, there are no respawns.\n\nThere's also only one mode, which is CTF. So keep in mind that every match you play will be CTF. However, this game does put a twist on it!\n\nInstead of going back and forth between bases, the "flag" is a robot, or "ghost" that is placed in a random location on the map. The idea is to go to the Ghost (the position of which, is made obvious by pulsing circles that are seen through walls), grab it, and bring it to one of your drop off points, which are in the enemy's spawn area. However, when you pick up the flag, you cannot sprint, and can only use your pistol, enemies will also be alerted to the fact that you have the Ghost, and will know where you are. This demands for a good team to defend you, or, if an enemy has the Ghost, you'll need good teamwork to retrieve it.\n\nCloaking is a major part of this game. The effectiveness of cloaking, is based entirely on how good you are at using it. When you cloak, you release a bright flash of light, so cloaking right in the open is generally not a good idea. If you're wounded, your wounds will be visible while you're cloaked, meaning you'll be killed anyway, by people who pay attention. On top of that, you have an outline, which becomes increasingly visible if you fire an unsilenced weapon, or move quickly. It's also made extra visible if you're not near something that you can blend in with. However, a skilled person with a cloak can easily dominate you. Keep this in mind when playing.\n\nThe game also, sadly, does not feature a single-player mode against bots, meaning that all of your practice will need to be against real players.\n\n~The community~\n\nThe game has a very small playerbase, which seems to be divided between hardcore players that have been around for awhile, and complete newbies who have no idea how this game works whatsoever, with seemingly no "in-between", you either do terrible, or you do excellent.\n\nThis doesn't really matter, however, as it doesn't affect anything if you lose. Victory or defeat, the game will end just the same. The whole point of the game is to have fun, which is something that seems to be lost on the tryhard players.\n\nDespite the fact that there is no reward for winning, and not even so much as saved player stats, there are still players that get verbally hostile over their team losing, or a teammate not doing what they were "supposed to do".\n\nThen we have the new players, which will panic on a moment's notice and spray you down, even if they knew you were behind them the entire time. There's also the occasional "troller" which will teamkill you as soon as you spawn. This wouldn't be as problematic, if it weren't for the fact that if you die, you're dead for the entire round.\n\nAlso, surprisingly, the game doesn't seem to have many hackers. I see lots of servers that offer the ability to vote-ban if you see a hacker, but I've never once seen one. This is very good for a free to play on Steam.\n\n~Overall~\n\nI'd say the game is fun, and definitely worth a try. But bear in mind that you will be facing a very small community, and will need to practice a lot against that small community in order to be able to compete. Also, if you're only interested in games where you are rewarded with items, achievements, and/or in-game currency, then this game is not for you, as it is much like Counter-Strike, in the sense that every battle is solely for the fun of it.\n\nWhen a newbie teammate doesn't just run right up and teamkill you, the game is very fun, and very well thought out, aside from a few weapons not being very well balanced.\n\nThat said, I give this game a 7/10, if it had a couple of more modes, a bigger community, and a balance fix, it would easily earn a 9/10. Sadly, these improvements are unlikely to ever come, as the game was released as a mod for Half-Life 2 back in 2009, and now most of the original devs are no longer part of the team. On top of that, it's unlikely the community's size will grow anytime soon.","July 14, 2014","true","18.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","6"

I am overjoyed that the release of the Steam version has revived the playerbase, and I hope to see this many servers active for a long time.\n\nNeotokyo is a beautifully designed, clever, cyberpunk FPS that takes a lot of inspiration from the series Ghost in the Shell, and makes use of Counterstrike-esque gameplay improved in several distinct ways. The first is the addition of 3 different classes, Recon, Assualt, and Support. Recon is a quick moving glass cannon, whereas support is a slow moving tank who boasts utility such as smoke grenades and infared vision, and Assualt is a mixture of the two. The second is how these classes play. Both Assualt and Recon can go nearly invisible to rush across pathways, and Recon can "Super Hop" to either quickly gain hieght to meanuver around the splendidly designed maps, or to quickly gain forward momentum for an escape or rush down. These simple changes to how one moves combined with the map design makes for a game that demands robust tactics from its players. A silent team of lone gunmen will surely be destroyed by a team that works together to flank and flush out their opponents. Make no mistake, this is a thinking man's FPS. Bullet penetration also exists and is frequently a tactic made us of in many maps.\n\nTo end this review, I have to say that it's impressive the sheer amount of unique assets, textures, models, animations, and sound clips that were put into this game considering it's something a small team did in their spare time for free. I also have to give a shoutout to Ed Herrison's Neotokyo Original Sound Track, which is also amazing, though not much of it is present in the game.","July 6, 2014","true","14.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

What's not to love?\n\nOkay bad jokes aside, this is a good game. If you are playing this, make sure to hit the forums for info on getting to servers.\n\nAnyway, Neo Tokyo takes place in an Anime-style Cyberpunk future, where two teams of Japanese special forces fight each other over the Ghost which is (as mentioned before) a female robot torso. This isn't a weird sex toy though, this torso allows you to see enemies nearby, at the cost of a primary weapon, and displaying your postion to everyone on the map. The objective is to either capture this robot, or kill the enemy team (this game has permadeath like Counter Strike).\n\nThis game plays like a more tactical Counter Strike. There is no crosshair unless you zoom in, you can die quickly, and team work is the key to success. Every kill or capture will allow you to rank up, allowing the player to aquire more weapons.\n\nThe community is really friendly too. I've even seen people give turtorials to new players. Of course this is only my personal experience, but it has been a good one.\n\nThere are three classes, Recon (light), Assault (medium) and Support (heavy). Each class gets their own weapon roster, vision modes, cloaking abilities, and movement speed.\n\nA bunch of reviewers (who have IMO probably haven't played the game for very long) will state the classes are imbalanced. This is not true. Sure, Recon can reach places that others can't, but he is pretty weak in direct combat, and his arsenal is restricted. They also get the worst (IMO) vision mode, so they require a lot of skill to use.\n\nMap varierty is great. From open fields, to confied market places and even a bullet train. All the maps feel good, and the developers have put a lot of effort into making each map feel interesting.\n\nThe graphics for today look kinda 'meh' but the artstyle compensates. It looks vibrate, and interesting. It's like you've stepped into a Sci-Fi Anime/Manga.\n\nMy complaints of this game would be that most of the development team does not seem to be around anymore, so updates are unlikely. I would also say the guns sound pretty weak, and some of the weapons unlocked by the last rank are a little overpowered. I mean the Auto shotgun can tear enemies apart at short range, the bolt action sniper rifle can kill recons in one shot and the LMG can easily tear enemies apart. It's certainly not a deal breaker and the game is still about skill but it does make it harder to join mid-match.\n\nConsidering it's a mod, I'd give this a 10/10. I've had more fun with this than most other 'F2P' games. It's got good balance, an awesome art style, a small, but active community, and there is a lot of fun to be had.","July 7, 2014","true","32.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

There are undeniably some similarities, but let me highlight some of the major features built into NEOTOKYO's design.\n\n1. Class dynamic - class differences are subtle but significant enough to matter. Supports can sponge enough extra bullets and will often prevail in brute force firefights, but this trades off against a lack of mobility. Conversely, Recons have the speed to gain initiative but must rely on that to set up favourable encounters. On the strategic level, differing class access to weapons means that rounds see an evolution in applicable tactics as teams unlock higher tier weapons. The class system also caters to different playstyles as well.\n\n2. Pacing and Ghost Control - Different class speeds mean that map chokepoints are reached at different times (whereas in games where all players have fixed speeds, initial encounters have a definable range). In addition, the semi-random nature of ghost spawns make each match dynamic, with some matches featuring a more natural attacking or defending team.\n\n3. Map Design - the art direction and map design is much more interesting. Maps are labryinthe and multi-leveled, and generally require a team approach; it's often very difficult for an individual to find a spot immune to flanking\n\n4. Lack of respawns - I may be in the minority here, but I think this actually helps out new players. A strong, dominating player can be taken out by a lucky shot or by being swarmed and will be a non-factor in the rest of the match. This sort of scenario isn't possible in a respawn environment, where weak players are ultimately a drag on the team.\n\n\nWhile a lot of tactical shooter skills may transfer over, these are the elements that NEOTOKYO features and it will likely provoke a love-it or hate-it reaction. The pacing and map design overall have a lot of subtlety and there's just something very Zen or even wabi-sabi about the minimalistic game design that just makes it feel right given the cyberpunk Japan setting. It's undeniably rough around the edges, but it's generally a really unique experience as FPS games go.","July 5, 2014","true","406.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

The models are crisp and loyal to their theme's origin, the weapons are deadly and fun, and the team battles are just mind blowing. The heavy reliance on team work brings a refreshing twist from the endless singleplayer own-u-all gameplay that has been plaguing HL2 multiplayer mods. The major downsides are the small community and the abandonment the mod faced from its own devs. Not a lot of servers to choose from and if you have a recurring problem with this game, it's not going to get fixed. Also no competive scene Overall it's a must play, I recommend everyone to download this game and give it some love.","July 20, 2014","true","6.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Not only does it provide slow tactical gameplay it also boosts your sense due to no radar or callout areas so your pretty much relieing on your team give you the enemies compass location and how many so meters away from them.\nSince there are 3 classes you have alot of weapon variety to choose from, class go Recon, Assualt, and Support.\nRecon are fast moving using manly SMGs to get the job done in close quarters engagements they also have a cloak ability to stay undected for a short amount of time, also they have NVG and Thermal\nAssualt are the typlical play style as the name suggest they have Rifles and SMGs and the same as Recon\nSupport are the slower moving tanks designed for medium to shorter ranges while using all types of weapons to kill targets, since they cant run or cloak they have thermal that can use.\n\nMy only gripe is that the server list in-game is always full so you have to use the Steam App to find servers (If you want to find one go to 'View' then click servers, Filter to 'Neotokyo'  and you have servers to choose from.) but there is a way around that, but thats the only thing that is wrong with this game in terms of getting started\n\nWould I say pick this game up and add to your Steam list just to give it a try?\nIf you like slow tactical shooters this is game is right for you.\n\nOverall rating: 8/10","July 6, 2014","true","1.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Instead of a clunky ironsight you have access to a simple zoom function. Recons can use a nightvision, Assaults the motion vision (aka color blind), and Supports the thermal vision (new: can see through smoke grenades !). But that's not all, while Supports wear extra plating slowing them down both Recons and Assaults have access to a thermo-optic cloak and since Recons forget their sweaty try-hard vest at home they can hop like bunnies at an unrivaled speed.\nBeing a machine has never been so great !\n\nBuy TGR Fuel here ! Only $29.99 !\n\n[Citizens, teamwork is mandatory]\n\nYou gain points for assists (if the plugin is there), kills and surviving a round but most important all team members alive gain points for a ghost capture and it's the safest way to victory.\n\nGreat feat can be achieved through great skill. Be like wind spreading fire and you will disrupt the rank of your enemies.\nTrue victory can only be achieved in teamwork. The better the players the more important teamwork gets, assume that the enemy team WILL use teamwork.\n\nKnow your enemy and know yourself and you will never know defeat.\nWhen you become one with Neotokyo, Neotokyo becomes one with you.\n\nCrush your enemies.

Why!? Why not have it in there as BGM while playing?! It would make this game simply come alive!!!\n\nWithout it, at it's core, this game is the love child of Ghost in the Shell and Counter-Strike. Their sweet lovin created the atmosphere and music of Ghost in the Shell (music aspect is all but ignored however) and the gameplay of Counter-Strike before it went all garbage arcade style in CS:GO.\n\nIt also runs on a VERY old version of the source engine. I believe 2006. This means it does not have multi-core rendering or a lot of the optimization that many are used to with TF2, etc. If your computer lacks strong benchmarks for individual cores (I love AMD, but I'm looking at you!), then you may be shocked to see your computer could struggle with this game at settings you are used to.\n\nUltimately, I suppose I recommend it, but why they haven't graced our ears with the OST during rounds is beyond me!","July 8, 2014","true","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

The aim down sights feature:\nThe ADS system is a little flawed as its togge and just ooms slightly also there is no accurate way of firing from the hip as there is no crosshair.\n\n2. Weapon variation: While there is a good choice of weapons they just don't differ from each other that much leaving a feeling that the dev din't focus enough attention to that.\n\nGood points:\n1. The cover system: a good way of using the mechanic and works well\n2. Gadgets: a night vison and active camo type items which are "stock" with your player work well and dont ruin the game play.\n\n\nTalking about gameplay the gameplay is mediocre at best while i can see there has been a lot of effort put ito the game it just doesn't differ much from any other FPS'.\n\n\nWhile it doesn't have many unique aspects they work well but  i wouldn't recomend this to someone who wants something a bit different it will please most FPS lovers.\n\nScore 7/10","July 25, 2014","true","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eljorgeloco/recommended/244630/","eljorgeloco","El Jorge Loco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eljorgeloco/","181 products in account","Alright, I'm gonna start with the negatives (actual ones, not just release date ones) on this one:\n(1) Dated game. This game was developed 3-5 years ago (fact check for me if you want), and so the graphics reflect that. The game mechanics are mired in Source SDK 2006 (8 years old). I stopped playing at least 4 years ago because the community for it started dying after it became apparent that it was going nowhere.\n(2) Slow paced. Yes, recons (one class the player may choose) can speed hop across the map with the right timing, but for the most part, this game is meant to be slower paced than your typical game of CS: Source or Global Offensive. The slower pace can throw you off if you are used to faster paced 2 minute games.\n(3) Maps are confusing as hell. If this is your first time playing this game, I will agree that the maps are confusing as all hell. You can never tell what are the entry points because there is no map you can pull out over your HUD like most other FPS games.\n(4) Present lack of support. There is one dev coding for this right now as the rest of the team have left the building and moved onto other projects (i.e., Contagion). But kudos to Pushbak for staying the course.\n\nAddressing some of the other reviews:\n(1) Not enough servers. A lot of the negative reviews you will see are that there are not enough servers. That was true on release date, because they had not done their marketing for this game to the big server hosters. This problem was resolved promptly. There are now quite a few servers.\n(2) Lack of tactics. This problem tends to be more due to the people who come into this game in the first place. On the HUD, there are indicators asking you to join a squad, which helps to aid in the "tactical" feeling. Secondly, use of the mic is extremely helpful since the ghost mechanic (sort of a like a flag), allows you to see where all your enemies are within range. That being said, a good ghost capturer will use their mic to identify roughly where the opposition are.\n(3) Damage and Physics. I don't know what one of the reviewers was playing, but C4 definitely does more damage than a knife. Distance of an explosion affects how much damage you take (like a nade in any other game). Grenade physics work the way they do because you are a cyborg. It thus stands to reason you can throw grenades better than a pro quarterback.\n(4) Lack of Education. This is a half truth. This game does educate you at every spawn time if you load up early. They provide little cards that educate you on how a game works. That being said, you can always visit their website www.neotokyohq.com for a quick how-to.\n\nSo NOW the positives:\n(1) The Price. I'm going to start with the easy one on the get go. It's a free mod. At the end of the day, you download it, try it out for a few days. If it doesn't work, you can put it away.\n(2) Most Maps Support Large Scale Play. Granted, there are also maps that are tiny and shouldn't host more than 20 people on it at a time. Most maps, support slow paced movement up field to achieve an objective. Do recons spoil the slow pace, a bit. But with their low health, they are easily killed or dealt with by supports or assaults.\n(3) Class selection. There are three classes that each fulfill different roles in a game. Without writing a whole guide about it, they can be classified as such: (A) Recons - Fast, low health; (B) Support - Slow, armored plus big guns; (C) Assault - somewhere in between.\n(4) Thermoptic Cloaking. This particular ability granted to Recon and Assault classes allows for temporary partial invisibility. While you can still be seen somewhat or detected by the vision abilities of the Assault or Support classes, it is a crucial ability that may count in a head-to-head firefight or getting around the field undetected.\n(5) Ranking System. On each game (or each map round), players rank up based on whether their team wins, kills, and achieveing the objective. This rank up system grants players with access to new guns. At the end of a map, all of this resets and players start again. I find this to be fairer than money, because eventually all players can get access, at the very least, to the second class of weapons for each class. Ranks count across the board, so you can rank up as a recon, and take advantage of a support's high ranks later.\n(6) Positional swapping per round. You don't always spawn in the same place, so no one side can get an advantage except that based on the skill of the teammates (or the teamwork).\n(7) Dated, but still good looking textures. Even though it is an older game in terms of visual design, many of the maps still look pretty good. The characters could do with an HD makeover.\n(8) Variety! As I discussed above, there are three classes. Each fulfills their own roles in any particular team. Do people pick recon a lot? Yes, absolutely! People pick them because they are easiest to learn and work with for folks who play fast paced FPS games.\n\nI'm not saying this is the perfect game, but it is a good one to break the monotony of a lot of cookie cutter FPS games out there. The learning curve is steep because of the game design and mechanics, but it is not impossible to learn. This game mostly rewards skill, cunning or patience. A good server that is well regulated by admins keeps the game fun. 7/10.\n","July 14, 2014","true","43.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","6"

There are some minor issues that ive found with the game like for instance ive noticed a lot of times when I by accident drop my weapon that when I run back over it it doesnt pick it up but, other times the weapon gets picked up when i walk over it. Also sometimes when I go to lean it wont lean but, then ill change weapons and try n lean again and it will lean. So ya theres minor issues like that and some other small problems like some maps have a bad level design to where it feels more like a maze than a actual map with multiple floors. There are a lot of awesome weapons that are spread out between 3 different class type: RECON-ASSAULT-SUPPORTER. For this brand new standalone version of the classic HL2 mod there is suprisingly a really good ammount of servers. Community is alive and talkative; everyone is chatting and also i was suprised to see there was a lot of actual teamwork talk going on. Graphics arent anything special at all; the devs could def go and do some major graphical updates. Also there def def needs to be a update that adds more game modes atleast one that adds atleast 1 or 2 new modes like a TDM/Deathmatch and something else like demolition. It plays a lot and looks a lot like CS: SOURCE & has some of the gadget stuff that you find in BLACKLIGHT so its a nice mixture where you have thermal and can also go invisible camo for a short time period and the CS: SOURCE gameplay.\n\nOverall I give it a 8/10 where theres a lot of room for improvments.","July 8, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eljorgeloco/recommended/244630/","eljorgeloco","El Jorge Loco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eljorgeloco/","181 products in account","Alright, I'm gonna start with the negatives (actual ones, not just release date ones) on this one:\n(1) Dated game. This game was developed 3-5 years ago (fact check for me if you want), and so the graphics reflect that. The game mechanics are mired in Source SDK 2006 (8 years old). I stopped playing at least 4 years ago because the community for it started dying after it became apparent that it was going nowhere.\n(2) Slow paced. Yes, recons (one class the player may choose) can speed hop across the map with the right timing, but for the most part, this game is meant to be slower paced than your typical game of CS: Source or Global Offensive. The slower pace can throw you off if you are used to faster paced 2 minute games.\n(3) Maps are confusing as hell. If this is your first time playing this game, I will agree that the maps are confusing as all hell. You can never tell what are the entry points because there is no map you can pull out over your HUD like most other FPS games.\n(4) Present lack of support. There is one dev coding for this right now as the rest of the team have left the building and moved onto other projects (i.e., Contagion). But kudos to Pushbak for staying the course.\n\nAddressing some of the other reviews:\n(1) Not enough servers. A lot of the negative reviews you will see are that there are not enough servers. That was true on release date, because they had not done their marketing for this game to the big server hosters. This problem was resolved promptly. There are now quite a few servers.\n(2) Lack of tactics. This problem tends to be more due to the people who come into this game in the first place. On the HUD, there are indicators asking you to join a squad, which helps to aid in the "tactical" feeling. Secondly, use of the mic is extremely helpful since the ghost mechanic (sort of a like a flag), allows you to see where all your enemies are within range. That being said, a good ghost capturer will use their mic to identify roughly where the opposition are.\n(3) Damage and Physics. I don't know what one of the reviewers was playing, but C4 definitely does more damage than a knife. Distance of an explosion affects how much damage you take (like a nade in any other game). Grenade physics work the way they do because you are a cyborg. It thus stands to reason you can throw grenades better than a pro quarterback.\n(4) Lack of Education. This is a half truth. This game does educate you at every spawn time if you load up early. They provide little cards that educate you on how a game works. That being said, you can always visit their website www.neotokyohq.com for a quick how-to.\n\nSo NOW the positives:\n(1) The Price. I'm going to start with the easy one on the get go. It's a free mod. At the end of the day, you download it, try it out for a few days. If it doesn't work, you can put it away.\n(2) Most Maps Support Large Scale Play. Granted, there are also maps that are tiny and shouldn't host more than 20 people on it at a time. Most maps, support slow paced movement up field to achieve an objective. Do recons spoil the slow pace, a bit. But with their low health, they are easily killed or dealt with by supports or assaults.\n(3) Class selection. There are three classes that each fulfill different roles in a game. Without writing a whole guide about it, they can be classified as such: (A) Recons - Fast, low health; (B) Support - Slow, armored plus big guns; (C) Assault - somewhere in between.\n(4) Thermoptic Cloaking. This particular ability granted to Recon and Assault classes allows for temporary partial invisibility. While you can still be seen somewhat or detected by the vision abilities of the Assault or Support classes, it is a crucial ability that may count in a head-to-head firefight or getting around the field undetected.\n(5) Ranking System. On each game (or each map round), players rank up based on whether their team wins, kills, and achieveing the objective. This rank up system grants players with access to new guns. At the end of a map, all of this resets and players start again. I find this to be fairer than money, because eventually all players can get access, at the very least, to the second class of weapons for each class. Ranks count across the board, so you can rank up as a recon, and take advantage of a support's high ranks later.\n(6) Positional swapping per round. You don't always spawn in the same place, so no one side can get an advantage except that based on the skill of the teammates (or the teamwork).\n(7) Dated, but still good looking textures. Even though it is an older game in terms of visual design, many of the maps still look pretty good. The characters could do with an HD makeover.\n(8) Variety! As I discussed above, there are three classes. Each fulfills their own roles in any particular team. Do people pick recon a lot? Yes, absolutely! People pick them because they are easiest to learn and work with for folks who play fast paced FPS games.\n\nI'm not saying this is the perfect game, but it is a good one to break the monotony of a lot of cookie cutter FPS games out there. The learning curve is steep because of the game design and mechanics, but it is not impossible to learn. This game mostly rewards skill, cunning or patience. A good server that is well regulated by admins keeps the game fun. 7/10.\n","July 14, 2014","true","43.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","6"

The soundtrack is brilliantly composed by  Ed Harrison and makes the futuristic atmosphere even more immersive. The game features three very standard classes: Recon, Assault and Support. All 3 serve different purposes in the battlefield, nothing new. The gameplay is slow paced and tactical, leaning is your best friend in this game. There is no aim down the sights but there is the good old zoom on every weapon and the ability to cloak yourself in the environment, rendering you almost completely invisible to the enemies.\n\nIt's a n old Source mod, using the SOURCE SDK 2006 module but a very good mod.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fartcommander/recommended/244630/","fartcommander","Fart Commander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fartcommander/","181 products in account","A very fun, tactical shooter reminicent of Counter Strike when you first start playing. When you get into it though, you find out its a much different game with a bigger emphasis on teamwork and player roles.\n\nPart of what makes this game different is its game mode, Capture The Ghost, and the different playstyles of the three classes. In Counter Strike, you do not pick a class for your character, you can only buy weapons and gear to create your own role. In this game, there is no money (so no eco rounds! Rejoice!) but there is a rank-up system that unlocks more weapons as you score higher.\n\nNow, you are probably thinking that an unlock system would break the game and allow for huge landslide victories, and it would if the starting weapons for each class weren't so damn good. With the exception of the MPN (the first SMG) and Recon's sidearm every weapon is viable in some way. There are a few imbalances, namely with the auto shotgun, but most weapons feel very balanced as well. Don't get me wrong, the weapons you unlock are technically better in some ways, but there is nothing wrong with some of the low-rank weapons. And trust me when I say that this game will feel janky at first because the damage of weapons goes beyond your typical understanding of FPS balance. For instance, sometimes silencers hinder the gun (SRM-S) and sometimes they buff it directly (ZR-S). Its really convoluted.\n\nSince this game is also in a cyberpunk setting, you get a few augmentations at your disposal, but nothing game-breaking. You have a optic camo that you can use at any time with every class but 1, and every class also has augmented vision, such as heat vision and motion vision. Heat vision can allow you to see through smoke grenades, and motion vision helps you find cloaked people very easily. The game becomes very stealth-and-surprise oriented as a result of these gameplay elements. Finding great places to cloak, hiding and confusing your enemies is the key to victory. Oh yeah, you can also lean around corners like in Rainbow Six.\n\nThe game mode, Capture The Ghost, ties into this as well. The Ghost is the robot torso and is the grey blip on your screen. If you drop a weapon and grab it, you will be able to see where enemies are through walls. Seems awesome, right? Well its not too awesome for you. First, only you can actually see the enemies positions on-screen as blips. You must call out where the enemies are to your teammates using the compass and general directions, which is arguably the hardest part about effectively using the ghost. Finally, you are marked as a red blip for every enemy on the other team, so you can become a sitting duck very fast if you pick the Ghost up without knowing what you are doing. In short, it is 1 flag CTF with a very big twist that helps teamplay immensely. Without the Ghost this game would be just a random TDM game without as much cooperation.\n\nCapturing the Ghost helps your team by ranking them all up. Low-ranking teams, usually the losing team, can keep getting Ghost captures to rank up to the same levels as the winning team and, in turn, unlock better weapons to use against the enemies. This helps prevent the landslide victories or steamrolling that is present in many multiplayer games. It is also really awesome to pull off a Ghost cap against all odds, since it is even more helpful to your team than clutching.\n\nThere are 3 different classes, each being roles on the battlefield. There is the agile Recon that can leap very far (and even b-hop), the jack-of-all-trades Assault, and the powerhouse Support. Each have special weapons and abilities, but again to even the playing field none of these are that OP. Recon can cloak for a lot longer than assault and has a C4 that he/she can detonate along with night-vision. Assault has frags, starts with rifles unlocked, and has motion vision. Support has no cloak but makes up for this in loads of defense, high-caliber weaponry and smoke grenades. Using the heat vision while in the smoke will let you see through the smoke.\n\nNot to mention this game has a simply beautiful art direction and a great soundtrack (by Ed Harrison) that sadly doesn't play ingame. Many of the maps are very well designed, though some are a little too gimmicky (Bullet, anyone?) they all look fantastic. Some might initally think the maps are too cluttered with LOADS of props, and they are, but this is to obscure you when you are cloaking. I love the japanese bug fight vending machine btw.\n\nSo yeah, play this game, its â¥â¥â¥â¥in' awesome.","July 6, 2014","true","338.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a standalone mod of Half Life 2.\n\nThe aesthetics are very impressive for a conversion mod of HL2. The game is very remniscent of Ghost in the Shell, even down to the "ghost" that you have to secure (if you wish) in capture the flag/ghost mode. The details put into the maps is very good, and the music. . .\n\n. . .oh gods the soundtrack is phenomenal, especially considering that this is a free to play game. Here's a link so you can sample yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4fGJep748 It really makes the gameplay feel so much more intense and grandiose.\n\nThe controls are not too complicated, especially if you are familiar with shooters. The learning curve is moderate, primarily because the gameplay can be very, very fast paced. Most of the servers I have used have numerous helpful people willing to share advice on how to improve in the game.\n\nThere are three available classes to play, each with 3 different character models. The recon is your agile scout with infinite sprint, night vision, and stealth capability. You can also super jump by jumping while sprinting, which will propel you forward. Three gauges on the bottom left of the screen provide feedback on your current health, stealth energy, and nightvision/motion sensor/thermal vision (unless you are the support, who cannot stealth). The recon's nimbleness is balanced by light armor, meaning that you will drop much easier than the other 2 classes.\n\nThe assault class has the most weapons available to choose from at the start of the match, stealth capability, motion sensor vision, and medium armor.\n\nThe support class has heavy armor, but cannot sprint or use camoflauge. Support also provides very useful smoke grenades and thermal vision to see through it. This class can eat a few non-headshot sniper hits before dying.\n\nDuring the match, you are awarded experience points for surviving til the end of the match, completing objectives, killing the enemy, and getting assists. As you gain xp, you unlock higher tier weapons you can select from in between matches at the preloadout screen.\n\nWhen you die, the free floating camera is extremely useful because you can familiarize yourself with the layout of the map (highly recommended).\n\nTo my surprise and amazement, if you continue firing when your clip is empty, it will continue firing nothing (no auto-reload in the heat of battle). You also waste any bullets left in your clip when you reload (like in real life lol). You still run faster with the knife, however, I am fairly certain that stabbing people is NOT a one-hit kill.\n\nGameplay is both challenging and extremely fun, and, as a F2P game, I strongly encourage everyone with the tiniest amount of interest to give NEOTOKYO a try. Or at least sample the soundtrack.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\n\n\n","July 13, 2014","true","4.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuzzyNumNum/recommended/244630/","FuzzyNumNum","Kanyay West","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuzzyNumNum/","194 products in account","Before I do up a review I have a couple of disclaimers I should point out. Although my hours shown are non existant I used to play this back when it was first released a number of years ago. Also right now it's unplayable for me as there is only one Oceanic server and it's been dead the past couple of nights. Because of this I'll be basing my review on my time spent on this mod before it hit steam.\n\nTo begin, this game oozes style. Personally I'm a massive Cyberpunk junkie. Bladerunner, Neuromancer, Johnny Mnemonic, Deus Ex, Ghost in the Shell, Bubblegum Crisis, etc. You name it I've seen/played/read it, so it comes to no suprise I instantly fell in love with the theme of the game. It's more then apparent NEOTOKYO, even in name alone draws everything from Japanese cyberpunk, and that alone is why I fell in love with this game. From the decor, to the weapons, right down to the cyborg torso 'flag', it screams Masamune Shirow. Even the soundtrack, which is something I usually don't bother with, especially with FPS, is beautiful. I still listen to it even though I haven't touched the game for quite a while.\n\nNow gameplay? I'm a bit on the fence with gameplay. I'm not sure how much it's been tweaked the past couple of years, and unfortunately it looks like I might have to wait a bit longer until it's more popular in this region. It's very team orientated, and lonewolfing is next to impossible, however this also meant a harsher community, who would be more then willing to callvote a kick if you were having a bad run. In saying so though, from the few reviews I skimmed through it seems this has improved from last time I played.\n\nUntil I can start playing on an oceanic server, I'll probably have to leave this for now, which is a damn shame. As mentioned above the aesthetics, style and soundtrack are the reason I love this game. It looks, and feels like it came straight out of a Masamune Shirow graphic novel, and I recommended it for that reason alone.","July 5, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a server based rank up. Every new game you play you start at lvl 1 and start going up. You get xp for kills, staying alive, and play the objective.

The shooting mechanics are solid, though I haven't experimented enough with the different weapon loadouts to say what difference they make. It seems positioning and timing is far more critical to your success than actual accuracy and weapon response. Teamwork is vital to have any kind of confidence in advancing, and awareness of teammates' positions and their respective blind spots is crucial. Since all players have stealth-camo, movement is more important than player silhouettes, so you have to keep your eyes and ears open for movement from all directions.\n\nIf you're interested in a tactical shooter that is faster-paced than CS:GO or Socom then you should give this game a try. The trailers don't do it justice.","July 13, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Z177/recommended/244630/","Z177","^9Koi Boy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Z177/","68 products in account","A difficult game for beginners of the shooter genre, but if you transfer from games such as Counter Strike or even (subjectively) Call of Duty, this game will be pretty easy once you learn the mechanics. Rifles have almost no recoil on most guns and the firing mechanism requires no skill in comparison to CS. Once you learn the ropes to the game though, it is VERY fun. There are two factions which you can choose just like in CS; they are the Jinrai, and the NSF. Jinrai imo have the best character models compared to the NSF models. After you choose your faction, you can choose from 3 different specialist classes. They are the basic and cliche Assault, Recon, and Support classes. Support is the tank, Assault is the basic infantry class, and Recon is the speed and stealth class. There are about 9 different guns (that I know of) but you only unlock the first 3 during the start of every map. Once you start getting more points or kills then you rank up and unlock more guns. I forgot to mention, there are two modes. Classic TDM and Capture The Ghost(basically capture the flag).","July 12, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In accordance with the class system, levelling system, and map layouts coinciding with one objective; capturing the ghost, teams are forced to adapt to these variables.\n\nWhether you're rushing with the sniper rifle as the recon on Vtol, or tanking through smoke grenades on Bullet as support, covering someone carrying the ghost as assault only to be flanked from a recon's drop spot, there are endless ways a shootout can play out. I can only really compare this with my experience with DOTA 2, where each 10 different heroes are chosen, each with their own skillset, there are billions of combinations of scenarios that can happen because of this. With just the 3 classes in NT, as well as the distinctive weapons that can do better or worse in certain situations, I've finally realized that's the reason why I think so highly of this beautifully realized game I've known for so long, Neobears.","July 11, 2014","true","24.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Very happy to see it here now.\n\nGameplay is team centered and very tactical. It's risky to move without cover or someone watching your back. Yet, I also think most maps are complex enough that camping can be difficult too, since enemies can choose so many routes and flank. Every match is tense because of how deadly the weapons are and because of special abilities like cloaking, special vision modes, and the fact that the "flag" in the capture the flag mode can reveal enemies in close proximity to the carrier only. These abilities have disadvantages too, and they really add a layer of strategy to the game and give you options on how to attack the enemy or detect/counter their advances. You really need to think about your actions; blindly entering a room assuming your quick reflexes will deal with whatever is in there is very dangerous.\n\nThe art direction is also supercool. The Japan in this game is presented as an ancient culture infused with new technology. Maps range from dirty neon streets to tranquil Japanese gardens to cold and sanitary futuristic military bases. Watching cybernetic soldiers battle in traditional Japanese houses while old suits of Samurai armor stand and watch from the sidelines is a very cool juxtaposition. As many have already said, it's very Ghost in the Shell and it's amazing. The soundtrack is the same mix of traditional and techno. It's very good, and listening to it in game (type !radio in chat) is very atmospheric. It is sometimes loud enough to distract you from in game sounds, which hurts your situational awareness, but you can turn it on or off anytime.\n\nEverything about this game says effort and creativity, and it's free. More importantly, it's fun and challenging. Try it out, and please play with a mic if you can. It can really help your team.","July 10, 2014","true","30.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Initially busted out on July 3, 2009 n' later Re-released fo' Steam up in July, 4 2014, dat shiznit was voted ta be busted out all up in Steam Greenlight on 16 October 2012.Inspired by such titlez as Pimp up in tha Shell n' Akira, NEOTOKYO is set up in a near-future Tokyo, Japan fo' realz. After tha failure of a proposal ta alter tha Japanese constipation ta allow foreign deployment of Japanese soldiers, a military coup d'Ã©tat be attempted by off tha hook nationalist factions up in tha JSDF. In response, tha Prime Minista of Japan pools forma military intelligence operatives n' five-o fools tha â¥â¥â¥â¥ into a sub-group of tha Interior Ministry's Nationizzle Securitizzle Force (NSF), called Group Six, ta seek up subsequent coup plottas n' uphold tha law up in both domestic n' internationistic soil. Immediately, rumours surface dat a unknown faction up in tha JGSDFz special forces unit "Jinrai" is preparin fo' another coup attempt against tha posse fo' realz. Accordin ta tha shiznit, tha holla'd thugz of dis crew is from Special Operations Group 43, fierce ultranationalists determined ta succeed wit tha coup once more. Da ensuin strife between these two factions sets tha backdrop fo' tha game. NEOTOKYO uses a round-based structure similar ta Counter-Strike, up in which gameplay takes place up in a seriez of nuff muthaâ¥â¥â¥â¥in rounds. Da game is class-based, wit three classes available, each wit slightly different characteristics, abilities, n' available weaponry. NEOTOKYO has two gametypes: crew-based deathmatch, up in which tha team dat manages ta bust a cap up in all thugz of tha opposin crew wins, n' "Capture Da Ghost", though tha majoritizzle of maps is designed fo' tha latter mode. This gametype has tha two crews competin ta capture a randomly spawned objectizzle item, tha "Ghost", by pickin it up n' carryin it ta a thugged-out designated location on tha other side of tha map. Well shiiiit, it is generally similar ta capture tha flag, except dat either crew can win by eliminatin tha enemy, as well as dat tha Pimp allows tha playa holdin it ta peep tha locationz of opposin crew thugz all up in walls, all up in tha expense of wieldin a weapon. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Da Pimp n' any playa holdin it can be peeped as a funky-â¥â¥â¥ blip from any location on tha map.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekture/recommended/244630/","nekture","nektuur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekture/","213 products in account","First things first: Bare in mind, this was an older mod originally for Source 2006, made primarily in the developer's free time. It was originally released around 2009 iirc, after many years of development (and a newer version of the Source Engine releasing meanwhile). This game looks pretty great, keeping in mind it's running on such an old version of the Source Engine.\n\nNeoTokyo is a multiplayer only first person shooter set in a cyberpunk setting, heavily inspired by anime such as Ghost in the Shell and (to a lesser extent) Akira. The game is more focused around positioning, tactics and communication with your teammates rather than only clutch skill compared to most typical shooters. Additionally, the game features temporary invisibility, different vision modes (night vision, motion detection & heat vision) and 3 classes with different abilities which you have to take into account tactically. During a game, when you get kills or complete the objective, you increase in rank, which provides you with more weapon options and extra equipment.\n\nThe main gamemode, capture the ghost, has the very neat mechanic of providing you with "wallhack" for a limited range when you're holding the ghost (flag) and you have to relay this information to your teammates whilst carrying the ghost to the dropoff point, because holding the ghost takes away your primary weapon.\n\nThis game heavily rewards teamwork and feels very satisfying when succesful, though it can be hard to get into. There's very little feedback telling you what you did wrong or where the enemy was that killed you, which can be frustrating and it can take a while to fully grasp the different ways you can apply the mechanics. But when you do start to get it, it becomes very amusing to abuse these against your enemies.\n\nAlso the soundtrack, which is barely featured in the game, is straight up awesome. http://edharrison.bandcamp.com/","July 15, 2014","true","33.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

However on this side of things for the matter of server, there is some lag with joining in we all know we can't all handle or control. However is enjoyable for those who don't mind shooting games and an interesting environment. The game revolves around an old system similiar to other titles but as one who played this previously, I found this game amusing. However there are times where people will rage and etc. However note that if you want to play this game, learn the controls to save you the trouble and the game mode objectives. With that said, you'll then know the difference in how it plays out especially online in servers with other people. Not everyone is willing to help. There are command keys hinted when you enter one for commands like vote but remember the !. As for other matters I do believe this game has it's moments which give it to me a 3.8-4.2 but that's only without the so called lag experience. As ever it does freeze up at times when connecting but those issues still remain in multiple online games thanks to client. Still if you get on this game, have some friends, or join in but seriously learn the controls first do a create a game to helpo sort yourselves out. It's a familiar field to counterstrike for some of you to relate on. Still take it easy and yes there is game chat which can be annoying also a built in game radio with a nice soundtrack.","July 6, 2014","true","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have never had any experience running a server or any other kind of role in the community besides playing.\n\nOverall I really enjoy the experience of playing Neotokyo. The setting is refreshing, the maps are interesting, the weapons and equipment are fun to use, the soundtrack is hypnotizing, etc. However there are a few things that are lacking in this mod--which is expected, as it is a Free-To-Play game made by a small group of developers.\n\nNeotokyo is a cyper-punk tactical shooter set in Japan of the future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AceMimic/recommended/244630/","AceMimic","Mimic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AceMimic/","84 products in account","I find myself coming back to re-write this review. Neotokyo is very similar to Counter Strike. In fact, it's pretty much "Counter-Strike: Ghost in the Shell mod". It's a pretty old game, and it definitely shows, thanks to somewhat delayed actions, and occasionally clunky-feeling gameplay. There aren't many servers up for the game, and you only see maybe one or two servers kind of filled at a time. However, if more people started playing the game, this can turn around pretty easily. If you decide to get this game, it's best to join the "Active Neotokyo Players" group, as they organize events on the regular to draw in a more concentrated group of players at specific times to help with the mostly empty servers.\n\nDespite it's dated graphics and gameplay, it can be a pretty tense game at times, especially when you first find out that gibbing is in the game after your buddy's head gets taken off by a sniper. There are three classes with their own special abilties, loadouts, and armor to speed ratio. As you progress through a match and rank up, you get access to new weapons that reset after each match, rewarding you based on your contribution to the team. The soundtrack for this game is phenomenal, but unfortunately only plays in the main menu. Like most games of this nature, there are two main factions: The Jinrai and the NSF. The NSF are very similar to Section 9 from Ghost in the Shell, whereas the Jinrai are a rouge branch that seeks to make Japan great again. (Or something, it's been a while.) The backstory itself is pretty interesting, and it makes me wish that the game was remade and given it's own singleplayer story. There isn't a whole lot of Cyberpunk games like this out there, and it makes me sad to see that this game is on the fringes of the Steam community.\n\nPros\n-Ads to the narrow list of games in the Cyberpunk genre.\n-Pretty tense moments at times.\n-Pretty nice community.\n-Fantastic soundtrack and lore.\n\nCons\n-Dated graphics and gameplay.\n-Not many players.\n-Pretty much forgotten about by the devs due to it's age.\n\nWould I suggest this game? If your steam library is small, your wallet is tight, and you like Cyberpunk games, and a fantastic soundtrack, yes. There isn't much to lose except time by getting this game. But it has so much untapped potential and it really needs to be remade and expanded upon.","August 13, 2014","true","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The graphics are really cool I ilked them alot they are Jet Set Radio esque which is a really sweet art style. The gameplay was challenging (multiplayer only) I couldnt quite figure out how much it actually took to kill an enemy player. It's very slow paced and strategic which is really cool but I personally never really got into it. It was really tough to find an empty server at first since there were only about 4 and they were always full. Overall theres so many cool things about this game even though I never really got into it but i would still recommend it for people to give it a try for sure.","October 14, 2014","true","1.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

There is one main gamemode in NeoTokyo (Capture the Ghost) which is very similar to Capture the flag in which opposing teams must either eliminate the enemy team entirely, or return the "Ghost" to the allied team's score base. The weapons in the game unlock as you play the game and "rank up" over time from your performance. The game also has a slew of maps to choose from which is quite impressive for a mod with relatively humble beginnings. It has a meager but dedicated community of players from all over the world, and it's quite refreshing to play with people speaking multiple languages and cooperating together. If you can handle the occasional lag that is.\n\nPROS\n+ Is completely free\n+ Plays very similarly to Counter-Strike\n+ Promotes teamwork and skill to win\n+ Most maps are very detailed and interesting\n+ Dedicated servers\n\nCONS\n- Some weapons feel unbalanced\n- Some maps are very confusing to navigate\n- Relatively small but dedicated community\n- As far as i know, updates are very rare\n- Only has one serious game mode\n\nBottom Line\nNeoTokyo is a really fun experience that's free to play with a melting pot of players all working together. The gameplay feels solid and despite only having one mode, can be a lot of fun in small bursts at a time, especially on weekends.\n\nHighly Recommended 8/10","January 17, 2015","true","13.9"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","10","18","3","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ranmaj/recommended/244630/","Ranmaj","Ranmaj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ranmaj/","187 products in account","Worth downloading for the soundtrack alone.\n\nIt's also an amazing round based FPS with an emphasis on tactical play over gunplay and reflexes. There's 3 distinct classes (Recon, Assault, Support) each with their own strengths and purposes. Recon is fast and agile with access to thermo-optic camouflage and night vision, while support is a slow juggernaut that sacrifices sprinting for a smoke grenade, thermal cam and stronger armor. Assault is a balance between the two and uses both thermo-optic camouflage and a motion detector.\n\nThere's an XP system that allows you to unlock more weapons as the round goes on, but it resets every game. You get XP through kills, assists, surviving the round and completing objectives.\n\nThere's two different gamemodes: Team Deathmatch and Capture The Ghost, a sort of Capture The Flag variant where you pursue the upper half of your very own android waifu.\n\nMost maps are centered around CTG and the maps themselves are pretty damn good. Expect lots of sneaky flanking and prolonged, exciting firefights at chokepoints.\n\nWhile the gameplay is great, Neotokyo's best aspect is the atmosphere. It nails the cyberpunk vibe with its tight urban environments filled with flashy neon lights, various electronic clutter, thoughtful graffiti and references to Japanese pop culture. When you're not fighting in â¥â¥â¥â¥ riddled streets, you'll be shooting it out on top of skyscrapers, in military facilities or even in and out a traditional shrine. The two factions, the NSF and Jinrai are as badass as you'd expect. While the NSF is a civilian special-ops group fighting for the government and Japan's constitution, the Jinrai are a nationalistic, militarist terrorist organisation with a clear Samourai vibe in their attitude and looks. There's heavy influences from Ghost in the Shell and it definitely feels like a 2035 Japan. So if you dig the whole cyberpunk subgenre like I do, or if you're just a big weeb, you'll absolutely love it.\n\nSince it runs on the 2006 version of the Source Engine, the game is very outdated graphics and technology wise. Though, that doesn't stop it from looking good aesthetically and that fantastic vibe is still there (in the same way that Half-Life 2 and Deus Ex manage to have that special cyberpunk vibe to them despite looking old). Unfortunately, it does mean that crashes are kinda frequent.\n\nThe community is pretty small but there's usually 2-3 servers with lots of activity on them. It's also super friendly and helpful, but due to its nature as a tight, niche game you can expect a vocal minority of elitists.\n\nDid I mention the soundtrack is superb? 'Cos it is. Ed Harrison is a musical genius. You can listen to it in game by typing !radio in the chat. The Ghost in the Shell soundtrack, Industrial, Noise, Drone, Hip-Hop and Jazz all fit the game nicely if you're looking to listen to something else while playing.\n\nIt's free to play so be sure to try the game out. You might just find yourself hooked and even if it's not to your appeal, you don't lose much!","September 20, 2014","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now that its relaunched I have played it and can say thereâs nothing else like it. The gameplay is fast and unrelenting with a few moments of uneasy calm where you are watching your back constantly. It's a class based and the classes are very distinct, each with a purpose and unique weapons, speeds, and vision modes. The visuals are a little dated but it does not take away from the experience at all. The maps are unique and filled with some awesome details and other great nods to the game's  inspirations (Gost in the shell) and others. It can have a little bit of a learning curb but its worth the time invested, and with time the developers can update the game and servers to accommodate a larger fan base that this game well deserves. I'm ecstatic to play this again and with some new blood in the community.\n\nThanks for reading =)","July 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, friendly fire is ALWAYS on, so be aware of who/what you shoot at.

The game type is a variant of CTF, where your team can either capture the flag OR kill off the entire opposing team. You also only have one life per round, so use it wisely. Lack of customization speaks for itself, and the graphical portrayal, utilizing the hl2 engine, is a bit outdated, so don't expect spectacular aesthetics.\n\nLike I said earlier, this game has a lot of potential; but it's still a bit early to criticize the game and hopefully, there will be many improvements to the game in the near future.","July 6, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is very much strategy oriented because you have to use teamwork to set up the proper attack strategy for the current situation (much like Counter strike at times). It is very intense at most points in the round/game. The very sad thing is this game isnt that great because the servers that are usually there dont usually have that many people making the game not that an enjoyable experience. That being said though what little playerbase it has left usually gets spiked up around every time to time. This game has a bit of clunky controls and it is hard to get into since every time you join a new match or the map changes you need to rank back up in the match. Veteran players are far and few between but when you finally meet one they will either kick your *** or help you like a team carrying, AWP using, scrub calling, pro. This game gets a 10/10 for gameplay 8/10 for graphics 13525/4 for soundtrack. But the sad truth is there isnt a big player bas so all around it gets a 6/10 now if the player base was bigger it would get a 10/10 all around so yeah.","December 9, 2014","true","12.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The leaning system is faulty, like when you press E it sometimes wont actaully lean but works like i said when it wants to. There are some guns that are really OP but you unlock them later on in the round when you kill more people but can be like one shot one kill. Sniper rifles are under powered like the slug round of a shot gun if they are tweaked then i will use them more but for now i wont touch them as they are to underpowered. The cloaking system is to weak but works really well in dark corners when you are not moving, it kinda works like the cloaking system in titanfall. overall this game has a lot of potential and i would like to see it published into a full game. One thing to mention is that once you die THAT IS IT. You have to wait for the next round before you can respwan and the ghost (which is the objective) can spawn almost next to the oposing team which can ruin the game because they can rush to the retrieval location. I do recommend this game to the battlefield/call of duty player as it is a mix of realism and CQC (Close Quarter Combat.)

The gameplay feels very tactical, as well as balanced. The main game mode is capture the ghost, where you can win the game by either capturing a ghost, or eliminating the enemy team. This is a bare bones description of the game, because there are so many more intricate mechanics that keep the game interesting, like how each of the 3 classes (light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor) play, including movement speed, their type of sight, weapon selection, amount of cloak, and many more differences. And somehow, the game still feels very balanced, in how all of the classes just synergize together. The maps are very diverse and large as well, taking on a futuristic city vibe for the most part, and it works wonderously. Lastly, the soundtrack, by far, is one of my favorite soundtracks of all time, no question. it's a perfect mix of orchestrated and electronic, and a little bit of rock, and it melds so well with the game. You should definitely give this game a shot if you want a very nice tactical shooter, and bring some friends, this game definitely needs more of a community.\nIGN: Jackchopin.\nSee you there~","June 25, 2015","true","121.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game originated as a SOURCE SDK 2006 MOD and is now officially available through Steam. I have followed this game for ages. Being an FPS fanatic and having played almost every FPS on the market, I have never encountered a game that surpassed NEOTOKYO in terms of concept, visual aesthetics, sountracks, and >GAMEPLAY<. As said by  Xunie  in his/her review, NEOTOKYO indeed has been tweaked and balanced for years before reaching Steam. The game very easy to pick up, but as all things - experience will come. One of my favorite things about gameplay is that there is no crosshair with your gun at your HIP - you must use MB2 to bring it up!\n\nTL;DR - There is much to say about NEOTOKYO, but none of it is negative (and not a soul will ever be able to put it all in a review). Period.  (\infty)/10\n\n\n\n*Now that the game is on Steam:\n-One will find it hard to join a public server as slots are almost always filled. Need more public servers\n-I hope Devs will port to newest SDK and almost make multi-platformed (Mac, etc).\n\n**Above things require:\n-Support from players\n\n***Stop reading review and download the game already!\n|  SUPPORT NEOTOKYO & DEVS - ALWAYS  |","July 5, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Instead, you rely heavily on the camo and detection methods, as a dynamic between the 3 classes. The main game mode revolves around obtaining the ghost - a limbless android and transporting it to a safe zone. The carrier of the said android has a limited ability to fight, but on the other hand, sees the enemy locations and can instruct their teammates. A mic is a must for this game.\n\nAdditionally, the setting is great.

It's amazing and free.. I mean, really.. what reason would you have for NOT trying it?\n\nI suggest checking the key binding before you hop in and either note or rebind what the optic camo and vision toggle keys are, you are going to want to use those.\n\nBasically, you are playing capture the flag, but the flag is called a "ghost." The player who picks up the ghost can choose to actively hold it and it will give them the ability to see how far away and in what direction the enemies are.. but while holding the ghost, the player is left defensless. This adds a strategy to the game, and promotes team play and use of the mic. Simple data can be said quickly over the mic (Bogie 20 meters north).\n\nIt is also worth mentioning there are 3 different class types. Recon has thermo optic camo and can jump about 15 meters while running. Assault class has better armor than recon, but can't long jump while running. Support is slow, can't run, but has tons of armor and has heat vision instead of the movement based vision toggle like the other 2 classes. Also, more guns are unlocked as you gain points during a map. More kills means more weapons to choose from.\n\nDon't forget to join a squad so that you can see where your team is!","August 30, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay and style is great, though the former is subject to how well I and my team are doing in a round.\n\nWhat I'm not a huge fan of, and honestly kind of keeps me from really enjoying the game to its fullest, are all of the awkward, random girly pictures scattered across some of the maps. They're easy enough to ignore, but the simple fact that they're their kind of irks me and is a bit jarring as I soak in the great aesthetics and atmosphere and stumble upon a nearly-nude image. I secretly keep hoping someone with the knowledge and same ideas will come along and mod the mod to alter or clear those images.\n\nBut, truthfully, most people don't think in that same course.\n\nIn any case, I recommend giving it a try if you want something quite different in your FPS library.\n\nEDIT: By deleting the files from the game's folder, the images are gone.

Hopefully now that it's here, it'll rise again.\n\nIt's obviously inspired by Ghost in the Shell, so if you're a fan, definitely check it out. Also I must make a note, please remember this game was RELEASED back in 2009, and even in development WAY before that. Don't let the graphics put you off. But if you're on Steam reading this review, that SHOULD be a given. I mean... look at the recommendations.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't much I can say about gameplay because I forgot a lot of key aspects (it's been half a decade, sry) aside from the fact there are 3 types of bodies to choose from; light (recon?), medium (assault?), heavy (support?).

It has a counter-strike like feeling. Tactical, sometimes slow, and when in battle it can be hectic. But there are some actions you can do in NEOTOKYO (NT) that you cant do in Counter-Strike (CS) for one thing, you can sprint. second you can go invisible for a limited time but don't always depend on it to hide yourself from the enemy, and it recharges after a few minutes.\n\n#2- the design. There's no doubt that NT has a much better atmosphere and character design then CS (well thats my opinion at least). Each level has a great amount of detail and when you die you dont always respawn, but thats not always a bad thing you can just float around like a ghost and observe the level (Even see some pictures of beautiful Japanese women) But the level design really is kind of a work of art in its own way.\n\nThe character designs are pretty good, each class, Recon, Assult, & Support. All have there own unique look and is easily recognizable from a distance. The support using only shotguns, can not sprint or go invisible. The recon and assult really have no difference in terms of movement speed.\n\nI did forget to mention that the setting of this game is a sweet â¥â¥â¥ futuristic tokyo with fancy ships that you can notice, in the air. And some maps do seem to have that high adrenalin night life atmosphere.\n\n#3- The sad part. This game is kind of dead. BUT at the time of this review. There is one server that is always pretty packed and always have new and unique players. Playing very tactical, and some having the oddest conversations with each other and some just blurt the randomest crap. For example ("How drunk do all you guys think I am?.............. Well let me stand up and find out") Some people even talked about there favorite beer brands, if its imported or domestic. There favorite games of all time and even have debates (And yes I got involved in one). I even heard some people yell "LEEEEEROYYYYY JEEEEEENKINS" (Some of you may not know who Leroy Jenkins is and if you don't. Well your still very young to the internet world)\n\nBut all in all. NEOTOKYO is a very fun game with tactical like gameplay. The game is kind of dead like I mentioned. So if you reading this from beyond 2015, I can't promise you its still played or it may make a comeback. But still get some friends together and have a great time with this game. I give NEOTOKYO 7/10","April 27, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But I feel like this is a pretty fair game. I've killed people many levels above me with more experience than me. Also, if you like the run-n-gun, spray-n-prey style of Call of Duty, do not play this. This takes real skill, but with that, more fun. So, there are two teams, Jinrai and NSF, (I like to call it Need Speed For,) the game will start you on opposite sides of the map, as most FPS games do. But it's weird, I've never seen an enemy on my way to the middle of the map, like the idiot I am. One of the things I LOOOOOOVED about this game is the Q and E lean mechanic. There are about two games on Steam with that mechanic: America's Army: Proving Ground, and NEOTOKYO. AA:PG is laggy as â¥â¥â¥ on my computer. I have a Lenovo H30. You can imagine the amount of lag that a $250 PC gets when playing a game like that. But one of the reasons why I like Source Engine games is because of how smooth it is. And the game is BEAUTIFUL. Once again, I'm not the first one to say that. But it is really stunning.\n\nHowever, the video settings were somewhat disappointing. I use an Element 105 TV as my monitor, and the game's graphics significantly decrease due to the fact that it lacks a 1360x768 resolution setting. So, as you can guess, this is the beginning of the cons list. It is not a big game. It would be more fun with more people as the 32-player limit suggests, however, most of the servers have absolutely zero people playing. I found one server with 8 people. The Valve Anti-Cheat is a good thing, but it took me 5 minutes to get into the server. 5 minutes. That's about all I can think of, but please don't get it twisted.\n\nThis is an amazing game. And furthermore, it's free. The developers did an amazing job on NEOTOKYO.\n\n8.5/10- Great game.","April 30, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"Mixed" usually means the game in question is kinda hit or miss, but NEOTOKYO is simply another fantastic game that hardly anyone plays anymore. It isn't as dead as TF2 Classic (nor did it "die" nearly as quickly), and it isn't as alive with players as TRIBES Ascend is now, but there are players and if you play it at just the right time you can find a full server that stays full for a good while. If you do end up disliking the game for whatever reason beyond not being able to play it, please for the love of all that is good check out the soundtrack. It's nearly 3 hours long, and much like the game the worst aspect about it is the lack of people who know about.

This game has no campaign or singleplayer. Only Mutiplayer, you basically join a server and complete objectives. There are two sides who fight one another, one of the sides are called the Jinrai and the other is the NSF both sides offer only cosmetical and external features differences. However if you would like to know the lore of the game, I suggest finding it yourself. The gameplay is very similar to CounterStrike or the Classic Halflife. In Neotokyo however the two teams try to recover a device called "Ghost" (a robotic dummy torso of a female humanoid) which each team tries to retrieve and bring back to either one of the two recovery sites whilst both teams try to fight it out until the last man and prevent the other team from capturing and bringing the device back to their own recovery site. A combination of Deathmatch and Capture the flag.\n\nThere are three classes;\n\nRecon: The recon is the lightest and fastest of all the classes, ability to jump very far (those who can bunny hop can exploit this classes speciality), comes with a Remote bomb and detonator, has also a cloaking device.\n\nAssualt; This Assualt class comes with a fragmentation grenade and cloaking device also wears a medium armour but has relatively normal human walking speed.\n\nSupport; The support class is the slowest of all the classes but wears heavy armour and has a thermal vision.\n\nThe Maps are themed basically of mix of Traditional and Modern/Futuristic style that blends together to create neotokyo.\n\nThis mod is for free, and no cost at all, I recommend anybody who enjoy First Person Shooters!\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/244630\n\nConclusion; is it worth your time to play Neotokyo? I would say yes it was fun and exciting especially with the theme and people you meet in the internet, the game is free and its does display the futurisitc theme even tho its a mod, I am actually very suprised that the game managed to catch my interest in which I continued to play for 1.6 hours on the first run!.","January 15, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The three playable classes offer well rounded playstyles giving players the ability to augment the squad in different ways and with different weapons. This  as well as various types of  class abilities such as active camoflauge, thermal vision, night vision, and motion detection, all add to the overall tactical gameplay experience.\n\nThis is a great addition for people who are looking for a well-paced tactical shooter that provides fairly realistic CQB scenarios, all while putting a very subtle but refreshing sci-fi spin on things.","April 3, 2015","true","44.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Tactical shooter with three classes which are well balanced. If you have a microphone, donÂ´t be shy to use it.\nEven if you have a strong accent, nobody will laugh at you. WeÂ´re connecting from all over the world to play together.\n\nThe community is full of nice people with the occasional trolls who downoad the game just to troll a couple of times and disappear just as fast because the community ignores them and if they misbehave too much, by mic-spamming or teamkilling we simply votemute or voteban them or a server mod / admin does it. It does work very well because the community is working together and not ignoring such issues.\n\nFriendly fire is on, but you will rarely experience TKs done on purpose. If that happens the ban hammer will strike swiftly.\n\nBe nice to others and they will be nice to you. If you ask questions like "How do I cloak?" etc. you wonÂ´t be shunned for that and told to check the options. People will gladly help you.\n\nThe community is very small, so far, but only mature people even the obvious young ones. We do fool around every once in a while or make jokes but weÂ´re always focusing on the objective.\n\nAlso, thereÂ´s a group called Neotokyo: Revamp. A team is working to release this mod on the latest version of the Source SDK and while doing that they will also crush all known bugs.\n\nThe only cons I can think of is the very small community, but thatÂ´s because the mod is still pretty much unknown, then there is the occasional crash and last but not least the leaning option with "Q" and "E" doesnÂ´t work properly at all times, so expect to die because of that as you canÂ´t lean at the corner properly at times and shoot to kill. ThatÂ´ll cost you time and might get you killed.","August 16, 2015","true","204.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To add insult to injury the few servers also appear to feature "reserved slots" meaning that even if you do sit on auto join and eventually make it in chances are that you will be auto kicked to leave room for somebody who is apparently more important than you.\n\nThis game might have been good back when it was new but it is currently only serving as a deterrant to any new players wanting to try it out.","July 5, 2014","false","0.7"," 134 of 270 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","134","270","6","10"

Now you're gonna say "How could it be popular? It's sucks potatoes because of the grenades spazzing out and I am too stupid to play a game without 100000 reminders about the objective!". At that point, this game has it's tiny flaws, just like E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy, but they don't affect the in-game experience too much. After all, this is a free â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, how can you complain about something being a bit wrong in it if it's free, without Pay2Win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t?\n\nFrom what I noticed, most of the newcomers quit the game because they didn't want to bother understanding the objective in "Capture The Ghost" because they simply ignored the drop-off and Ghost markers. Pretty silly, right? It's true though. Most of them just said "wtf is this game about it sucks and it has no point >:C" and quit.\nThe basic point of the game is to win, just like in any Counter-Strike game you're all used to(or any PvP game at all :I), and for winning/killing/suriviving/doing the objective you get points(experience). Those points have no use aside from ranking up, which unlocks higher tiers of weapons, and the highest tiers are unique for each class. For example, Support would have a machinegun, while Assault would have an automatic shotgun or heavy sniper rifle.\nTo win the round you need to do one of the options. To kill or to complete the objective successfully. Wasn't that hard now, was it?\n\nAnd honestly, if there really was something to whine about, then it's the NSF playermodels, they're ugly. Very. Like... "Did your character â¥â¥â¥â¥ your pants or something?" ugly. But then again, it doesn't affect the experience. Then you'll tell me "BUT DIS GAME HAS NO RECOIL AND SUCH â¥â¥â¥â¥ EUEAEGH". Just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing try playing it, even without the recoil it can be hard to hit the enemy at times.\nAnd if you're gonna complain about the graphics, you can just go back to Call of Duty and isolate yourself from proper games and communities. It's a bloody 2009 game, a free 2009 game that you can enjoy playing.\n\nAlso, the OST in Neotokyo is amazing, it's very enjoyable to listen to, especially while playing the game itself, and in total it lasts about 2 hours and 23 minutes.\n\nOh yea, and this game has lots of boobs. It even has a map with censored japanese porn all over it.","August 14, 2015","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/244630/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","I really want to like this game. I really do. But I just can't bring myself to.\n\nNEOTOKYO is a free Source-based mod of the FPS genre. It takes place in futuristic Japan, where people have been infused with technology and where two groups - government-funded army and a group of terrorists - fight against each other to collect and hold the "Ghost".\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the graphics. While the graphics themselves look somewhat aged by today's standards, they still look okay, which is boosted quite significantly by the good map design, reminiscing either old Japanese shrines or futuristic technologically-advanced undergrounds. If someone likes this kind of stuff then he/she can appreciate it.\n\nAaand then we come to the gameplay. You can expect only a few servers to run this game, with maybe one or two decently populated, which means you're going to be playing among the regulars most of the time. The game lacks any kind of tutorial or bot practice, so you are forced to figure out everything on your own.\n\nNEOTOKYO very closely resembles Counter-Strike, unfortunately mostly in the bad ways. It has round perma-death, meaning that if you die to the aforementioned regular players, you're forced to wait until the next round for another chance at actual combat. Which means that you'll get maybe a minute total of combat time out of a half-hour game unless you're good (which you aren't due to being brand new). The fact that you unlock more weapon options if you do well in the previous rounds only widens the gap. This is not a great place to learn, the only way I can imagine you getting somewhat better is if you train in Counter-Strike before since it's somewhat similar in execution.\n\nThe whole gameplay revolves around the mode called "Capture the Ghost". In the middle of the map there is a robotic torso called the Ghost, which you are supposed to capture before the other team does. Having the ghost on slows you down a lot and also disables your primary weapon, making you rely on your teammates for protection. Holding the Ghost out however allows you to see the enemy positions, so you can inform your teammates where they're going to strike from. It's a somewhat unique and pretty interesting idea, and the execution of the gamemode itself is very good.\n\nThere are three classes: highly mobile but weak Recon, balanced Assault, and powerful but slow Support. Each one has a different selection of unique weapons and abilities - for example, Recon has infinite sprint and dark visor, Support has smoke grenades and thermal visor, and both Recon and Assault can use a camo module which makes them harder to see for a limited amount of time.\n...and then everything breaks due to glitches. Bunny-hopping, as well as other speed-increasing techniques completely destroy any sort of realism in this game. People will hug walls and wobble back and forth to move faster than intended by the developers, thanks to the buggy physics engine. It also puts yet another wall to overcome for newbies, since regulars will be moving through the map at insane speeds, killing them before they can get anywhere or position themselves well.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend you don't play this game. Making a sightseeing tour of the maps is an option, but it's absurdly imbalanced when it comes to the actual gameplay. It's a newbie-unfriendly territory with physics glitches that could be very easily fixed but aren't. This game is a brilliant concept, a good execution, but it's all ruined due to the buggy physics engine. It's sad to see something like this.","February 8, 2015","false","0.8"," 48 of 99 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","48","99","4","43"

It seems to have had a cult following a few years ago, but it's player count is now only about 10 players average with a peak count in April of about 40.\n\nIt's clear someone put a lot of love into this mod back in the day, but I think the numerous free-to-play or reasonably priced Counter-Strike games, Source engine FPS games, and Ghost in the Shell games (this is inspired by that universe) have pulled it's audience away in various directions.\n\nI made a goal to try all of the free-to-play FPS's on Steam during Summer 2016 looking for hidden gems. NeoTokyo would probably fit my definition of such if it had a healthy player population, but I think it's on its last breathes. Nonetheless, I plan to check back in Fall or Winter to see if anything changes.","May 8","false","1.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I really, really wanted to enjoy this game. Everything about it is just so nice and smooth. Everything runs perfectly. Everything, that is, except that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ recon speed glitch. Not only are you able to bhop across the map in less than 10 seconds, but your hitbox lags behind so unbelieveably far that you're nigh invincible. Combine that with the mostly-dark maps, and recon easily ruins most matches. Especially since the playerbase is small enough that the same few full-time bhoppers are amost always on the only server with any amount of peope on it, which ends up simply being a bhop race to see who can get a lucky laggy-hitbox shot before the other one.\n\nI really, really wanted to like it. But until the recon speed glitch is removed from the game, it will always be unplayable.","January 2, 2015","false","4.4"," 52 of 111 people (47%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","47","52","111","11","0"

Which means invisible campers with honed reflexes.\n- No way to practice offline, and at the time of this review only a handful servers, all of which are full.  So there's no way to learn the maps since as soon as you round a corner, you're killed by an invisible camper.\n- No hints on what guns are effective and which are terrible; you can unload a 50 round magazine into someone, but he could have a better gun and kill you in a couple hits.  This is *very* common.\n\nI only put in a couple hours, but I don't recommend it.
