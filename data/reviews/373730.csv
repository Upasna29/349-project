I bought it on sale, and now 3.5 hours in I think I'm done, unless there's a serious update. The reviewer who really sold the game to me was the one that said this game wasn't about conquest, but exploration. Unfortunately, I spent more of my playtime trying to "explore" how to do anything. Others had mentioned it was a bit clunky, but it was more frustrating than I expected.\n\nYou start out on an island, procedurally generated like most roguelikes. You get a tent of workers and need to get them building. Your first option is to build a lumberjack's hut. Go grab yourself a snack, it's gonna take a bit. Once that's done, several new options will open up, but none of them matter except the forester, cause you've already chopped down half the trees on your island. Next you need a shipyard, because you're running out of gold, and it'll take a gold mine AND a mint to start producing your own coins to pay your men, and the last game your guys wouldn't even build the mint (why? good question, and I don't have an answer, cause every time I've used the building placement checker thing, it showed placing options for every building but it.)\n\nYou get a free ship with the shipyard, but you'll need a 2nd if you want to colonize another island AND don't want to abandon everyone and everything you've worked for on your first.\n\nI experienced all of that through several restarts in the 3.5 hours I played. I never went into the underground dungeon, and never got any iron or anything that can be built with it, therefore I never got awesome armor/weapons to take on bigger/more enemies, I could definitely reach that point in another 3.5 hours, but I really don't know if I will. There's a real gem of a game in here somewhere, but it needs just a little more of both clarity and complexity.","December 16, 2015","false","3.5"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","38","44","2","2"

If you're the type to try different things, explore the world - the game is the one you were waiting for a long time.\n\nUltimately Way of Gold and Steel is an amazing game if you like don't give up after your first death and keep restarting the game and don’t mind observing the game world and thinking a bit\n\nEssentially, what you're likely to not realize (I certainly didn't) when buying Way of Gold and Steel is that this is more a roguelike than a strategy, at least when you get yourself underground. Knowing that is probably more key to whether you like it or not.\n\nFirst I saw a huge crocodile and, thanks to the other review, I didn’t wait for it to eat my men and killed the beast with my bare hands. That was a bloody battle!\nThen I built a couple of huts and discovered that my men were stealing my gold. That’s not how I like it, so I collected all the gold and made my men build me a shipyard… but at some point they just stood there and did nothing. They demanded the gold! It was really hard to get it since they just stood there and didn’t say anything, the only thing that led me to this conclusion was that when I put 2 coins near the builder, he took the coins and went to work at once! And then came some local savages and started to steal my wood and stone! I tried to catch them for a while and succeeded. Oh, that was a glorious battle and I got my wood and stone back! Noone steals from the pirate captain! After building a shipyard, sailing around the map I had discovered the caves and wandered around for an hour or so, killing some huge bears and collecting treasures from the lower levels of the dungeon, but a poisonous snake got at me there.\n\n11/10","August 17, 2015","true","1.1"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","31","39","2","1"

How can I know, what key is key 47? Some functions doesn't work, for example closing inventory, which is funny, because there is no function for opening it. How can I use abilities, when I can't find them anywhere?\n\nWhile combat there is blood everywhere, like half of my island covered with blood from two guys, you can't aim them through that, you can't even see yourself. When some enemies come on your island you have to wait until they get mad, because you cant attack them before that.\n\nBuilding of structures is strange... When you tell your workers to build something, they will start reading newspaper and after a minute they'll tell you they can't build it. You can't know what to build, because there is no information about those structures, only the name and how much does it cost, which is useless, so you have to try sometimes what to build until you can make your camp functional. You can't build two buildings of the group at the same time, even if you have enough workers.You can't build two same buildings, so you will run out of resourses quite soon\n\n\nYour peasants come of nowhere, when you build something there appear someone in the tent and start working.

It's not "early access" game - there were long period of testing before Greenlight, most of strange features where dicussed and author heared testers or at least given the making sense explanation why it is done so.\nFirst unique feature of the game is IMHO an indirect control in a living world. It's like a Dungeon Keeper, but with more open and friendly world. The pirates who steal coins to hide them or place wooden logs from place to place to satisfy their perfectionism feeling. Forester that likes trees so much that carry them in the hat and dreaming to completely fill island with forest (and he will do it given enough time). Aborigines that bravely explore isles on their handmade boats and their wondered looks at our strange stone houses on their land. Colonists... Well, you will better see about colonists yourself, they are funny guys too.\nSecond feature I liked is a slow pace of the game. In most RTS you must hurry up from the start and put every worker and every resource in use, otherwise you can lose the game before meeting an enemy. Here this is not needed. In fact, I even lose couple of times because tried to build more building at once and ending with not having enough resorces to complete any of them. The rate of game increases after department from first island, but there is still enough time to explore the world, hunt a crocs, or just aimlessly sail seeking a possibility to steal something. But it's not like a sandboxes or RPGs - there is a serious enemy and he is gathering forces, so you can't grind infinitely.\nI don't want to spoil the pleasure of discovering all game mechanics, for me it was very funny part of the game, but I think I must warn about most common mistake - trying to stay on first island and build everything there. The purpose of starting resources and starting island is to build a shipyard. Everything else - mines, mint etc. can wait, shipyard is vital. After building your first ship don't forget to save a game and you are free to go - explore, colonize new island to make a complex production chains, hunt aborigines, bite and claw colonists to take their excesses for your fast growing economics. There are also caves, they are completely different world with different rules, very dangerous (and that's not joke) but very rewarding.\nBy the way, the game have good support of windows-based tablets, just don't forget to enable correspondnig option in a settings menu.\nTo be honest, there are also some words of critique: settings menu is terrifiyng at sight. And a more serious problem - there is not much things to do after you managed to win a game. You can play the game with some self-imposed challenges, but other then that you have to get out of this wonderful universe. So i hope that author will make an extended release with increased difficulty mode, even though it is unlikely.","August 18, 2015","true","3.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","1"

I rate them on a scale of:\nAm I enjoying this game? Yes\nWas it worth the money: Yes (bought during a sale)\n\nI am already enjoying this game after the first hour. The first thing the game tells you is, that there are no hints and no tutorial, you will have to carefully watch, try stuff and explore for yourself. Just like the games back in the 80s and 90s! I love that!  Modern games are made too easy. I already saw negative reviews that point out exactly that! Come on guys, explore a bit yourself, turn on your brain!\n\nIt's quite an interesting genre, it's not your typical strategy game where you can scroll through out the map and select all units. You only control one character, the captain, and you can tell your fellow pirate men what you want them to build for you. Make sure you are close to them when giving the order, sometimes they won’t hear you if you’re too far away.\n\nThat being said, it's definitely a niche game that will only attract a certain group of players.

But the main question is...is it fun and worth the money (for me $3.14)?  Yes.\n\nYou start out on a small island and must manage whatever resources you start with in order to expand onto other islands.  Your starting island never has all the resources you need.  After a couple hours, you could have a pretty big civilization going, but there's a big difficulty curve after your second island.  It's pretty hard to manage resources between two islands and if you don't do things perfectly, you might as well start a new game...again and again.  I got to a point where I actually managed to build a fortress, but I didn't have an iron mine going because my second island was too close to a big colonist island.  The colonists would constantly try to settle on my island and destroy buildings and people.  Make sure to explore the whole map after you get your first ship and choose wisely where you place your second settlement.\n\nPros:\n- Good fun if you're into city/base building games\n- Great, simple game mechanics that evolve as your base improves\n\nCons:\n- No music or audio at all...it's bizarrely quiet\n- A lot of trial and error learning and game restarting\n- Very odd controls and game settings ('Enter' speeds up time, 'i' loots stuff, 'e' enters caves, just odd...)\n- It feels and looks pretty unfinished.\n\nWishlist:\n- I really wish there was a way to customize your own world or modify how worlds are generated.  Instead of easy or hard difficulties, by modifying your starting island, you can make it much easier or more difficult for yourself","December 17, 2015","true","3.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Gather resources, build, trade, and train soldiers.\n\nEverything is done indirectly by issuing orders to followers who might just not listen to the order. Followers need to be paid with gold too, otherwise they refuse to do anything. Other gameplay elements include fighting off natives as well as a growing imperial force. The Captain can fight and is stronger than normal units, and can be further enhanced with equipment obtainable through dungeon runs.\n\nAll this sounds nice however it's also extremely frustrating. Particularly with regards to orders on being followed.\n\nThere is no central storage of resources, everything is just kept in piles on the ground. As such, keeping track of stock is done by the pirates counting items and 'remembering' stock levels. What this means is that pirates are not always aware of just what is available, items can be stolen or procured without updating the totals. This in particular I found very frustrating as multiple times I ran into a situation where I had piles of stone but my workers claimed there wasn't enough stone and would not continue building. Or worse, they think there are no coins left and stop doing anything even though there are coin piles around.\n\nAs the world is randomly generated it may happen that only small islands are created and a colony has to be set up across many islands. Even then building space is limited and follows a sytem similar to that of the old Settlers games whereby each point on the map can only suport a building of up to a certain size depending on several factors. This limits what can be build on each island even more. Travel between islands is done by ship and only the captain (and his guard) can set sail. To establish a colony on a new island the ship is sacrificed to provide workers and raw materials. Setting up production lines across multiple islands requires a lot of micro management and effort to ensure pirates actually do what they're supposed to (see paragraph above).\n\nOther reviewers seem to heap praise on this game, it may very well be that it's not be a game for me. I did not enjoy the few hours that I played and cannot recommend the game. IMO games like Gnomoria, Kingdom, or Dwarf Fortress[www.bay12games.com] are much more entertaining.","November 14, 2015","false","5.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This usually consists only of randomly appearing boars or natives which mostly seem to appear out of thin air.\n\nThe start of the game is almost literally the same every time and just consists of waiting, mostly. Combine this with the problem above, and the lack of substance just becomes a real problem.\n\nUI is even more clunky and amateurish than in an average indie game and that's sadly saying quite a lot. The settings screen blows my mind, but in a wrong way; you'd need to see it to believe it. The game also hides almost everything from the player which is unacceptable.\n\nIt has almost non-existent audio and the few little bumps and bleeps it has would take me under an hour to whip up.

But, the game has great potential and I hope these issues will be fixed. When they have been, I know this game will be great.\n\nI currently have given the game a bad review but also given it a positive-mark. That is because I don't want people to think this is a bad game like those "Early-Access, will fix it after ppl buy" cashgrab-like games. This game is GOOD. When other people write reviews for this game aswell, i will be changing the review mark to negative again, until the developer fixes some of these issues and makes the game more playable, which, then I will be giving this game a positive review and I will be removing this negative review.\n\nThe game is nice, it is really a change from them FPS shooters, and the 8-bit graphics is awesome. It plays out nice, and some basic features are added, like zooming, increasing play speed, pausing etc. It's thought out well, but even these features have some parts missing. Increasing speed only has one setting, and that is 3 times faster than usual. This feature bugs out sometimes and no difference in speed occurs.\nThe movement in the game is nice. That is, you play as the captain of your crew and you move around engaging with certain stuff. But, that feature bugs out aswell. Sometimes while moving, your character will just stop moving and glitch out in a certain building. When you try to move him to another direction, he will only move 1 STEP AT A TIME. This needs to be fixed too.\nBuilding stuff is really hard. When you want to build a building, you only get the name of your building, and the cost. There is no information about what it does, and how much resource it will cost (like workers who need gold). Your only chance is the name it has, and that isn't that helpful either. When you can't build on a certain spot, your builder guy will find the best spot for this build. If there is nowhere available for it, the build will be cancelled. Rather than cancelling, I suggest that your builder guy would scope out the entire island you are in, and look if certain structures are built on the grounds that have the requirements of your wanted build. This would be much more helpful than cancelling the build right away, at least he should ask.\nCombat. Combat is really difficult to accomplish. When somebody is engaged, the game creates blood sprites on the ground. This would be much trouble normally, but these blood sprites cover EVERYWHERE. While fighting, I couldn't see my character, or the enemy. This needs to be removed, or the blood should be reduced, or defense in this game would be so difficult. I haven't done much combat, but I can assure you that it is too difficult right now.\nOverall, the cost of building structures, and the working cost of pirates are way too high for starting off. It isn't impossible, but while grinding those resources, I got constantly attacked and I had to destroy some structures to build the new one I wanted. I kept losing my men. This can be balanced by reducing the overall cost of buildings, or giving players more resources when they start. Or being able to dismantle and loot ships of people who attacked you might also be a good idea.\nAlso, there is no tutorial. None. You get a random text popup at the start of the game, and nothing else. Nothing is explained. You're expected to know everything off the start. I saw the game and immediately wanted to play, so I bought  it, installed it, and booted it up. When I got into a game, I wasn't asked If I wanted a tutorial.\nThe settings menu also needs a lot of explanation. A LOT.\n\nTo sum up, this game requires you to be experienced with this type of game. It is incomplete, and needs to be fixed. The fighting mechanic is bad, the building system requires much more than point and build. There is very limited resources, considering you spawn randomly on some islands which are so small, you can only fit like 3-4 buildings before you run out of space, which you need a LOT MORE. Nothing is explained in the game, which is essential in a game like this.\n\nIf you need a tl;dr, this is it here.\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT THIS STATE. IT IS INCOMPLETE, AND NEEDS MUCH FIXING.\nNOTHING IS EXPLAINED IN THIS GAME. NOTHING.\nTHIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER LOOK AT THE GAME AGAIN. IT IS NICE, JUST NEEDS A BIT TWEAKING. I SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT IT AGAIN IN A FEW MONTHS.","August 17, 2015","false","2.2"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","16"

Like the game enough so far to write a review.\n\nIt's simple. The UI is a bit unforgiving at first (it took me a bit to realize that buildings spawn workers which also spawn resources; many games make you work for each of those things individually, so I was slow to catch on). But once it "clicks" for you, which doesn't take too long, you'll be hard at work. And the "violently running headlong into crocodiles" to kill them before they eat your workers" thing doesn't get old. Especially when you can sell their skins for iron ore. Which you need for weapons because CRAP HERE COME THE ANGRY NATIVES. Like I said, it's simple, but it doesn't feel totally banal either. Losing a logger to a crocodile's maw hurts, especially when you need them to chop enough wood to build a way off the island.\n\nThe whole "pour a cup of coffee and watch your minions carry out your orders" shtick makes for a great angle. It's the perfect game to play in the morning as you wake up: just mentally taxing enough. The pastel color scheme is easy on the eyes too (though, on the flip side, I've heard some say they're not crazy about the graphics - to each his own, I guess).\n\nHonestly, I paid a dollar for this thing. If it hadn't been so cheap, I might not have tried it. But now I have, I would definitely pay more. So long as it stays under $10, and updates come regularly, this can grow into a fun little hobby. It's no Dwarf Fortress, Gnormoria, etc etc etc. But as a relaxing management sim, it scratches just enough of the right itch.","April 21","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to fight colonists for many reasons, wild animals to get gold and access to islands and natives to win the game. The only problem is that combat is impossible. Colonists, who you have to raid else they attack you later on, will pull you into a fight with a single man, one guy! And then their entire colony comes to kill you with spears, swords, armor. Want to run away? NO RUNNING AWAY COWARD!! As you are forced to click, click, click which is the only impact you have on combat: clicking determing how fast you attack capped by your weapon, you cannot run away, you fists cannot stand up to their weapomns annnnndddddd...... there are about 15 of them for you to fight with your fists. This is incredibly fustrating as a large part of the game's mechanic and your survival is based upon raiding these colonists. While it may be fun to dance with death as you try to do what you can to steal there resources and destroy, maybe one hut.\n\nDungeons. Dungeons in this game are horribly designed. There are chests with very little loot: the basic resources are all you can expect from the chests you can get to. Other chests are either guarded by wild animals who deal 3x your damage, have 4x your hp and lock you in combat as per the stupid mechanic until the rest of the cave is drawn to your fight.\n\nOh yeah natives. The one enemy you can actually click on and not die to. They have a really strange time where they do not attack you and then out of the blue they start fighting you. Do not go anywhere near one of their archer towers, of which you can expect 1-3 of on every island that has any resource you want/need. These archer towers will draw you into combat which again YOU CANNOT RUN AWAY. Only this time it is A STATIONARY OBJECT. They also deal either more or less damage than you, its hard to say but what i can say is that they have maybe 5x your hp so good luck fighting one on your own.\nEnough about combat.\n\nEarly game all you can do is play another game. You can literally press 3 keys, wait maybe 40 secs then press another 3 keys then you need do nothing for the next 5 mins waiting for the 6 keys you pressed to get you resources.\nOnce you get to exploration you can go off frolicking through the world to find the 1 island that isnt dominated by animals, native archer towers or colonists, you then get stuck on that island for another 5 mins repeating the process all over again. Then once you return home you find that either you men have all destroyed their own houses because they dont have gold or your men are dead and the buildings occupied by colonists.\n\nSo if you have read to the end thank you for having the patience to read my rant about another good idea turned into a money grab.\nIf you are the creator of the game to you I say please put in the great amount of effort I know it must take to fix your game. It would be great if even the little it has at the moment just worked.\n","May 11","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
