Your goal is to collect a certain number of junk food items til the end of each level. Basically Lemurzin is just a simple sidescroller with unique and cute graphics. So far so good.  But the game mechanics are horrible and partly quite unfair and gamebreaking. You will be chased in 20 levels by a shooting turtle cop. Unfortunately you can just dodge up and down, no left or right, and don't shoot back at all. That must be only deadly. For example when there are obstacles like bombs in front of you and the turtle throwing 3 bullets in the same lane. Or caves drop stalagtites hitting you every damn time (that's where I'm stuck atm). Sloppy hitboxes and clunky controls as hell. Sometimes it seems you can just go up, middle or down but nothing in between. What a pity. If there weren't those issues it could be a nice little fun game with some easy achievements.","February 16","false","3.7"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","33","42","2","0"

Overall feeling - "Let's port it quickly and make some cash, doesn't matter how much because it's still better than nothing".\n\nP.S. Be careful about positive reviews - most of them were made by users who either spent in game hardly 10 minutes or have about 10 games on their accounts without any other reviews besides one for this particular "game". At least one of them was written by the developer himself - but even developer didn't play it's own game: playtime is about 3 hours and no achievements unlocked. That's nonsense because in 30 minutes it's easy to unlock 9 of 15 achievements.","February 15","false","3.0"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","26","34","0","3"

I tried to play the game by estimating the invisible edges of the game items, which seemed to work relatively well, but should not have to be how the game is played.\n\nIt appears that Lemurzin has been brought over to PCs from a mobile phone platform, without being fully adapted.\nHence, at the beginning, it tells you to "tap screen to start".\nThe exit button won't let you exit the game, which possibly comes from the same issue.\n\nI found the game more annoying than fun; however- if I am in the mood for it and have nothing better to do - I may return to it to finish off the achievements. But, then again, I might not.\n\nThere are far better games out there than Lemurzin. I would recommend that people give this one a miss.","April 21","false","2.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
