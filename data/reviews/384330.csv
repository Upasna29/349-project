It has this awesome PSX/N64 type low-polygonal graphics. Because of that this is a great game for computers that have low-specs AKA toaster computers and just looks super nice and clean. Of course, the thing that attracted me the most is that this game has procedural generated race tracks. Of course this means infinite replay value. The sense of speed that I personally experienced was a mixture of various racing games.. The ones that come to mind would be the Wipeout series, Ridge Racer and surprisingly enough Star Wars Pod Racing. 8/10 I recommend this game for a racing fix and the developers did justice.","March 24","true","3.1"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

The vehicle autoaccelerates and you can turn, brake, and boost. There's no airbrakes like in Wipeout/F-Zero but braking obviously makes you turn better. 4 vehicles, with different speeds/handling/collision tolerance and delay.\n\nVery basic graphics with a tad of cell shading.\n\nCan be very hard if you want the best times.\n\nThis thing can run on a toaster.\n","March 26","true","7.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ghegs/recommended/384330/","Ghegs","Ghegs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ghegs/","451 products in account","Procedural generation often brings practically endless replayability to a game while focusing on quantity over the quality of immaculate, tight design. That is somewhat the case with PolyRace, that rather than having a handful of tracks to choose from, opts to generate tracks procedurally giving the player some 45 million tracks to choose from. That is not to say that there isn't quality to be found, the game can be really entertaining for a certain type of gamer.\n\nDespite the amount of tracks technically available, the game is slightly barren on content. There's the Training mode, where the player can generate tracks using a short string of letters and numbers, choose a hovercraft and race until their heart's content. There's the Mission mode, where there are 20 pre-chosen tracks available, ranging from Easy to Extreme in difficulty. From each Mission a maximum of five stars can be earned with a good enough result. Stars unlock new Missions, new hovercraft and colors to use with them. The two hardest difficulties can be quite challenging and take a relatively lot of time to clear with five stars. As far as strictly single-player content goes, that's it.\n\nThen there's the Challenge mode, where after generating a track, the player is given 10 minutes to race on it and put up their best time. After that the Challenge is published and other players can take a crack at it, also for 10 minutes. Finally, there's the Race of the Day. As can be surmised, it's a generated track that's available for 24 hours for anybody to race on. The multiplayer is asynchronous, so the player never races against someone else directly. Instead, races take place against ghosts, either another player's, the developer's, or the player's own previous best run.\n\nThese four game modes are all the game has to offer. It's a bit spartan, but considering the game is so focused on improving one's results in short courses, it's appropiate. Combined with the amount of tracks, it's all that's needed.\n\nThe tracks themselves are short, only around 20-40 seconds. And they aren't tracks in the traditional racing game sense, rather, they are open areas filled with destructible and non-destructible hazards. There are two main race types, Time Attack and Distance. In the former the goal is simply to reach the finish line in the shortest time possibly, in the latter the aim is to simply get as far as possible until the time runs out, while collecting orbs that add to the timer. In Training mode there's also Endless, where the player can race in a randomly generated world until they crash or get bored. The player is guided by a string of lights that leads towards the finish line or the next time-extending orb. But the guiding lights are not strict instructions, they are more like suggestions. If there's a faster path towards the destination, it's up to the player to find it and be good enough to dodge the hazards that may be there. This makes shortcuts feel incredibly dynamic and fresh and not just something the developer came up with.\n\nOverall, the game is fairly simple. There's very little to unlock, there's no improving your craft's stats, no story. And the game's all the better for it. This is strictly a game meant for the type of gamer who can race on a short ~30-second course again and again and again and again until they get it just right, and actually enjoy the experience. If the gamer has likeminded individuals to share their times and favorite courses with, all the better.","April 8","true","4.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The price point may be a bit high for what the game offers (there aren't a ton of modes to play with and only 20 "missions"), but it's not too expensive. The only real complaints I have at this time are the time it takes to restart between rounds gets a bit annoying, the post-game screen is a little hard to understand, and the poor grammar in the menu text. Small imperfections on an otherwise great game though.\n\nEdit: Binary Dream made a nice update to reduce the time it takes to restart between tries. Good stuff.","March 28","true","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HGB/recommended/384330/","HGB","Heavy Viper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HGB/","398 products in account","Disclosure: Download code received from developer.\n\nPolyRace is a straight-forward, time trial-oriented racer with a low-poly art style and '80s synthpop soundtrack. Core gameplay is based around navigating open terrain at high speed, avoiding obstacles and sticking to a recommended path. Areas are all wilderness-based, featuring arid, forest and snowy settings. Players can play through missions with different objectives to unlock more vehicles and courses, or try their hand at a "Race of the Day" challenge based around a competitive leaderboard. Custom events are also available, but only one ship and course are available upon first starting the game.\n\nSYSTEMS:\nTight, responsive, and simple controls that don't get in the way.\nOpen courses; the basic path is laid out through the courses, but it's up to you to decide what the fastest route is.\nShort race times; easy to get a handful of races in when you're pressed for time.\nDifficulty is moderate from the start and increases quickly. Challenges have reasonable base targets, and five-star scores encourage retries to perfect course runs. Players with dull reflexes will have a hard time.\nAESTHETICS:\nLow-poly graphical style is simple and easy on the eyes. Helps keep things clear at high speeds, but players used to flashier games may be left wanting.\nVariety in environments is nice, though one or two more variations would be welcome.\nSound is spartan, balanced more towards the music. A good thing, as the soundtrack fits the action well.\nMenus and HUD are functional, the latter position just well enough to keep out of the way. Menus could use a bit of sprucing up. Making the course markers visible through blind crests and obstacles is also a good choice.\nOverall, decent little game! If you're used to flashier packages, you might be disappointed, but if a super-fast, bite-sized racer sounds up your alley, it's worth a look.","April 24","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

If you'd like to read our full review, you can find it here: https://www.universalgamingreviews.com/polyrace-overview-and-review/\n\nPolyRace is a fairly simple polygon based high speed racing game where you race on various generated courses. The game is very much like the F-Zero series but mainly focuses on time trials and distance races. There are some challenges you can create and send to other players and a race of the day feature where you can compete for the fastest time.\n\nI'll be honest and say that I'm a big mixed on the game personally but that doesn't mean it's a bad game, it's just not my style haha. I find that it gets boring pretty quickly, especially if you're not that into time trial based racing games but the level design, graphics and gameplay is quite good. I'm going to give it a recommended tag since I don't dislike it, it's just not my thing.\n\nThanks for reading our summary and review folks, happy gaming!\n\nOur gameplay video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVgRoerRIUs","March 28","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The controls are very basic, someone that's not good at games will be able to learn how to play within a minute or two using the arrow keys and spacebar.  It's great because if you want to sink sometime into this game and play the missions, you can do that, or you can just try and set the record on the leaderboards for the race of the day.  Most race's only take 3-5 minutes to complete.  I give this game praise for its versatility and a high replay value IMHO, it will never get old since they add new levels every day, this game was very well implemented.  Its a great game if you need a quick game fix also.  Polyrace has a look that is both futuristic and retro at the sametime.  Hit the boost button to haul ♥♥♥, just try not to smash into anywalls.  This game is like Pod racer/F-Zero on steroids.  I highly recommend it to people of all ages and I think the more people on the leaderboards the better.  Are you the fastest racer in the world?  With these very basic controls, you might be the fastest, all you have to do is try. 10/10","May 1","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Try it with a gamepad if you can, I think it's more fun that way and you'll most likely be faster. Also, don't forget to use the booster. The hovercraft is accelerating automatically but it's not going fast. (That might not be obvious if you just start playing without checking the controls.)\n\nBe aware that there's (currently) no circuit tracks and no synchronous multiplayer. It's all done in the form of time/distance trials against the ghosts of other players or your own. It would probably be almost impossible to race directly against another player on the short rally-like tracks with their really tight sections, shortcuts and obstacles at this speed anyway. But don't get me wrong, the track design is one of the best things about the game and really makes it unique in my opinion.\n\nMISSIONS\nFixed tracks that ramp up in difficulty, with a mix of time and distance races. Getting 5 stars on all of them is not that easy, even for more experienced racers. A recent patch also added player leaderboards for every mission!\n\nCHALLENGES\nEvery player can create challenges, which means that the game creates a random track (with selectable region/difficulty/hovercraft/race type) and you have 10 minutes to do your best. You can then choose to share it so every other player can try (once) to win the challenge by beating your best within 10 minutes.\n\nRACE OF THE DAY\nA new random track with a leaderboard every day. This is amazing! I think it just needs more players to really shine.\n\nGenerally the only problem I see with the game is a lack of players at the moment. So give it a try and spread the word if you like it!","May 3","true","123.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a random track every day resets around 8pm EST.\n\nI've reached #1 nine times in there and for 30 second tracks it sure does take a long time.\n\nAnd I wouldn't have it any other way. Learning shortcuts, finding a better racing line and learning from ghosts.\n\nThe controls are tight brakes are barely needed so slam on that boost you earn every second so watch that stick wiggle gamepadders.\n\nIf you want an engaging racing game, that offers a daily dose of competitive gameplay look no further.\n\n","April 21","true","22.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
