I'm old.  Over 50.  When I purchased a new computer recently, wanting to take it for a spin, I asked my son what to do and he told me about Steam.  As an ancient history buff (I'm also a writer and have written a novel about the ancient Spartans), I did searches on Greece and Rome and eventurally found Rome 2.\n\nI read all the negative reviews about the launch.  Things haven't changed much in the gaming industry.  Companies have always rushed their product to market.  I imagine after spending years developing a game they end up deep in the hole and pressured by corporations like Sega to push it out - no matter how many problems exist.  That's been going on for years.  The wise thing to do is to wait.  You know there is going to be a patch.  Why not let someone else trip over all the bugs?  From what I gather, a lot of gamers just can't wait today.\n\nAnyway, I love Rome 2.  When I read about the Emperor's Edition having worked out most of the problems, I dove in.  It's been a delight.  What a great game.  It's more addicting that crack.  Being able to play so many different factions gives it limitless re-playability.  Thus far I've played as the Romans, Spartans, Athenians and Epirus, and have had a blast with each.  There is a huge amount of strategy and tactics available on both the campaign map and the battle maps.  Placing your armies at choke points in the mountains or at river crossings... putting them in ambush mode... slaughtering 2x or 3x your number of units without getting your hands dirty... it's all so gratifying.\n\nOne of the things I've noticed is that I usually end up winning by gaining a technological edge over the computer AI factions.  If I can survive the early stages of play, eventually I'll start kicking out armies composed of better units than my opponents.  When the autoresolve gives me results I don't like, saying I'm going to lose, or take unexceptable losses, it's fun to take control of your army and lead them on to victory when the oddsmakers are betting against you.  Of course, often times you're leading superior units against hordes of untrained spearmen or levies, but occasionally the computer gives you a run for your money and there's nothing like destroyng your opponents Praetorian guard or Oathsworn unit that fights to last man.\n\nBig kudos to the modding community.  After playing vanilla R2, I found the Workshop and have been in pure amazement at the products the community has added to the game.  The 4x moves per year mod, agent color coding, the new unit mods, and many others deserve effusive praise.  I feel like a kid on Christmas morning every time I look in the Workshop, wondering what new toy I'll find under the tree today.\n\nThe Bad.  I have none.  Okay, okay, there are some, but I'm like a newlywed on his honeymoon right now.  I don't care if she leaves her panties on the bathroom floor or that the 4x calendar year mod makes agents overpowered.  For right now, I'm enjoying the game far too much to complain about a thing.","November 16, 2014","true","117.1"," 5,507 of 5,790 people (95%) found this review helpful 565 people found this review funny","95","507","5","565","92"

Please read the review before making critical comments, as I'm bored of having to repeat myself for people who couldn't be bothered.\n\nPros:\n- campaign map environments are varied and atmospheric\n- graphics especially in battles are beautiful\n- small details such as rocks hitting walls then falling to the ground, & remaining lethal while in motion adds to the immersion\n- army/navy military traditions and generals/agents traits create a satisfying long-term progression over the campaign\n- The conversations and comments among soldiers during battles are amusing and add immersion\n\nCons:\n- Naval combat and boat physics is abysmal, the worst yet by far.\n- Naval AI is feeble.\n- Autoresolve calculations are extremely bad, making small and uninteresting battles often compulsory to play to prevent ridiculously unrealistic outcomes.\n- When autoresolving, siege equipment is invariably the heaviest casualty, even on a 98% victory I have had entire units of Heavy Onagers wiped out entirely. Cavalry often suffers disproportionaly high casualties as well.\n- Diplomacy is still terrible, despite what they say about improving it: nations with 1 village demanding tens of thousands of gold for a non aggression pact when you control half the game world...\n- Unable to specify amounts of money in diplomatic negotiations, instead having to select a percentage of your total treasury.\n- Pikemen were the one unit which actually behaved realistically upon release, moving forward relentlessly into the enemy lines and encircling cornered enemies. That has since been "fixed" and they now stand gormlessly in a dead straight line, even when "formation attack" is unticked.\n- Roman legionary units fight in the same style as barbarians, with single men constantly breaking formation to have a 1v1...\n- "Growth" becomes worthless after about 50 turns, whereas in all previous games it continues to be beneficial.\n- Desyncs in multiplayer campaigns are not uncommon, and often void the save.\n- Barbarian units are far too disciplined and tightly regimented. Essentially just reskins of helenistic or roman unit columns.\n- Barbarians have access to the same siege equipment as the Romans and Greeks (with the exception of the Polybolos, which barely counts as it is the most useless of all the siege units)\n- Many available buildings, such as the slave trader or wine markets, are completely redundant and offer nothing that isn't easily bested by other buildings.\n\n\nOverall this game has been a major let down, and I wasn't even one of the ones who was super hyped about a Rome 2! Add to all this the constant releasing of new DLC which - even if you do not buy it - downloads automatically, rendering all mods incompatible! (but remains unavailable until you pay for the handful of half-baked reskins of pre-existing units & new menu screen that it contains)\n\n\nIts not all terrible. With enough modding it does become relatively enjoyable and worth investing some hours in. So as long as you are prepared to spend the time finding the right mods to address the multitudes of issues, and are willing to endure the frustration of having them periodically disabled by some new piece of unrequested DLC inviting itself into your install, then it is worth a look. Otherwise, its not a good call.\n\n\nI would love to love this game, it has so much potential, but unfortunately I cannot recommend it to anyone, especially not fans of the series such as myself, as it has seriously damaged my faith in Total War.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Update 31/01/15):\nFew more cons that I didn't mention first time around (the list is so long its hard to remember them all!)\n\n- Campaign AI is idiotic regarding threats. An enemy army garrisons a town. I move an army into the region in preparation for attack. Next turn, the enemy army has gone and the town is completely undefended. Bad AI and an opportunity for a fun siege battle ruined.\n\n- I have never seen campaign AI recruit the top tier units for Roman or Hellenistic factions. Even 250+ turns into the game I'm fighting against armies of militia hoplites + slingers.\n\n- Amphibious battles: AI frequently leaves one or two ships out at sea, so after killing their land forces the only way to "win" is to sit there on fast forward for the next 20 minutes while the clock ticks down.\n(NB: If you have selected "Unlimited" battle time, this situation can not be won, you must quit battle and be given a defeat, or reload and autoresolve. Yup, one ship containing 10 levy freemen can defeat your force of 1000+ elite troops just by sitting at sea, doing nothing!)\n\n- "Fast forward" in battles increases game speed by about 3%....\n\n- Pathing for siege engines and siege-equipped ships is terrible. Instructions to shoot at targets within range often just results in the engine walking/sailing slowly towards the target, not shooting at it.\n\n- "Fire at will" often results in many friendly casualties, as they will simply attack the nearest target regardless of its proximity to friendly units. Shogun 2 was intelligent about this and did not have this problem. Rome 2 seems to have gone backwards here...\n\n- Cavalry frequently ignore orders to disengage from melee. Often the same order needs to be given 3-5 times before they actually attempt to escape the melee.\n\n- Cavalry frequently ignore orders to attack. If the enemy unit begins to run from the fight, your units will make no attempt to pursue or re-engage them. This means MASSIVE micro-management of cavalry units when fighting against skirmisher or archer cavalry, as each individual unit needs to be re-instructed to attack several times throughout the battle. Failure to notice this results in your unit standing still whilst the enemy cavalry sit 20 feet away murdering them with javelins and arrows.\n\n- Ship ramming animations look like something from a cartoon. They are truly terrible. Again, Shogun 2 did this MUCH better. Heck, even Empire had better collision effects, and that game didn't even have a ramming mechanic!\n\n- Campaign map resources are.... a nice idea. However, one region of North Africa containing little more than sand and scrub supposedly supplies timber. Playing as Macedon, I found myself importing my timber from this North African region in order to build siege engines, despite occupying around a dozen heavily forested regions in Europe, none of which apparently had any access to timber... Nice idea, but ludicrously implemented.\n\n\nKeep in mind, ALL of these issues are reported from the Emperor edition. This is all after the game has supposedly been "fixed"..! Personally, Empire TW still beats this game, even now.","December 31, 2014","false","507.6"," 676 of 820 people (82%) found this review helpful 54 people found this review funny","82","676","820","54","65"

This game is really good, insofar as the DLC policy makes you want to gouge your eyes out with a rusty flensing knife. Don't you love it when you go into the classical era and you can't play as the classical Greeks because you have to pay seven fiddy for the culture pack? Oh boy, check out the all new and amazing unit packeroni for the Mouthbreathii out in the middle of nowhere, only ten thousand of your hard earned doubloons. You have to pay for blood. Blood. In a war game. I get that the Germanians never gave up their backwards censorship culture, but just do what valve did and replace the blood with gears or something. How would you feel if nintendo took out the ability to play as luigi in mario kart? You can still race against him, just if you want to play as him you have to buy the "We-a takin' your-a money" culture pack.\n\nWhen you pay 60 bucks for a game, you expect to get the full game, am I right? I'm wrong, they did the same thing in attila and most people are just accepting that they are being taken advantage of. No one knows what is going on anymore, no one buys a game and expects anything more than a piecemeal half-baked omelet that requires the "salt and pepper" DLC for 10 million dollars. Hey guys, when was the last time you bought a game and you got the whole game, no strings attached? Almost a decade ago for me, unless you count indies. We dont need a socratic dialogue to see that the AAA sphere is an abhorrence to anything good and pure in this world.\n\nI'll now list the pros and cons of this game:\n\n+ Nice grafix\n+ Nice gameplay\n- AI is total garbage, hey CA, maybe A* was ok in the days of yore but there should not be an AI this terrible in a modern game. Make some better algorithms! Pikmin 1 on the gamecube has a much, much better "army style" AI and it was released in 2001! ! !\n- Hey, if you want to see the rest of this review you have to give me 20 billion dollars as part of the "GOD I JUST WANT TO END MY MISERABLE LIFE" review pack DLC.\n\nAll in all I'd like to bestow upon this game a rating of "To see this rating, buy the "End Reviews" Review pack DLC for only 300 trillion dollars", and if you think that joke is getting stale, well, for you it's a joke, for me and the people who own this game its a harsh, painful reality they have to deal with everyday.\n\n"Oh boy, scary face guy, they dun diddly did it again with Warhammer" Thanks for telling me that, me. Now I'll just bestow upon you fellows my incomprehensible rage. Chaos is DLC, my friends. Chaos. For those not in the know, putting Chaos as DLC is like putting Carthage as DLC. Basically, we are now getting the shafterino againerino. Hey, this probably won't be the end of it. Make sure to buy the game 2 years after its out to get the whole actual entire game that they should have released from the beginning at a much, much cheaper price. Why on earth is SEGA doing this? Why? Why? ? ? ? ? ? ? What did we do to deserve this? I want to give you my money, but y'all are acting so incomprehensibly asinine that I don't think I can, at least not without having parts of the game locked out from me. ITS "DOWNLOADABLE" CONTENT, NOT "HEY WE TOOK IT OUT OF THE GAME LADS PLAY4ONLY 4000 QUADRILLION $" CONTENT.\n\nNo, we're not done, lads. I want to play as my ancestors, the scythians, but thats a unit pack. We steppefolk don't like getting scammed out of our hard earned mnai by some uppity publisher that thinks it's disgusting DLC policy is "smart". There's less money in the industry than there should be because consumers are untrusting of scummy companies (ya think?). Well, that ends my magnificent opus odimini. Seriously though, buy the "Complete Edition" (read: the actual whole game) in a few years and save yourself the hundred dollars buying the DLC.","October 24, 2015","false","175.2"," 385 of 456 people (84%) found this review helpful 180 people found this review funny","84","385","456","180","9"

We have to pay to unlock an excisting file).\n\nSega and Creative Assembly, show some respect to Total War fans.\n\nWe have paid for a complete game. Could you do us the honor of delivering one?\n\n\n\n\nAbout the game:\nAll I wanted was a new Rome 1 with better grafics but I got a Rome 2 which lost its soul of Rome Total War. I am missing the micormanagement of evolving my cities, getting in conflict with my neighbours and inventing new technologies to improve my armies. Rome II is much more easier than Rome I because some features are missing, e.g. to get in contact with other civilizations I just have to "see" their borders or an unit of them (in Rome I you had to send diplomats).\nThe grafics are okay without impressing me very much. I am able to play Rome II with extrem settings but the battles are not very immersive. The new feature, the unit camera in battles, is nice to have but absolutly unneccessary.\nLike in any other Total War the AI is not the best. CA improved it but all in all the AI is not a tactical genious. In battles they try to flank you with riders but if you handle them you win. Without mods the AI spams tons of agents that is just annoying.\n\nI enjoyed the game. Really. I like the ancient setting very much, that's the reason I played this game. But I do not recommend to buy this game (especially outside any sale) because without the expensive DLC it's unfinished.

The Emperor Edition is a massive improvement, but still falls way short of what was promised. Even with all the patches, the game is a big step back from Shogun 2.\n\nFirstly, the game is lifeless and boring. I've yet to even get close to year 0 in a save and I've probably started about 20 of them. Just look at the hours I've spent playing this game. I've tried so hard since the day it was released to get into a save in this game, and it's never happened. All of the screenshots and promotional media for this game looked amazing and captivating, but that feeling never materalizes in the actual game. I never have the urge to expand my empire, or make my enemies pay for crossing me. It just feels like I'm engaging in a strategy (if you want to call it that) exercise against AI, nothing more.  CA have sucked the life out of this series by dumbing down things like politics and diplomacy, and removing things like family trees for no aparent reason. The best feeling I got from this game was when I finally accepted that I wasted my money on it and uninstalled it from my system.\n\nThe AI is still horrendously bad. It's a million times better than it was at release, but it's still terrible. It's so easy to learn AI tendencies, and it takes a huge amount of restraint to stop myself from exploiting them. Battle AI is really bad, but luckily there are a lot of mods that can fix this and actually make it enjoyable. At the same time, there's only so much modders can do to cover up CA's mistakes, and it's really sad that CA needs other people to fix their game for them to make it playable.\n\nCampaign AI is atrocious and not even challenging. There's hardly any logic in the strategy of AI factions. They don't seem to care about defending their cities and they never create any type of organized, strategic attack. The only way to make the game challenging is to put the difficulty on very hard, so the AI can just churn out full stacks at will and send them at you one by one. Even then, it just turns into a game of fending off the armies, one or two at a time, until the AI does something inexplicably stupid to give you the advantage. It's extremely frustrating to have a back and forth war with an AI faction over one of its settlements, only to have that faction just randomly move all of its armies away from that settlement, basically allowing you to walk right in and take it. This type of thing happens ALL OF THE TIME and takes all of the intensity and excitment out of wars.\n\nSome parts of the game are still broken, even in the Emperor Edition. Sieges are somehow even worse than Shogun 2. City gates are broken. Any unit can just burn down a gate by throwing flaming sticks at it, but then they are unable to walk through it. I'm not even sure if battering rams work at all. Ladders and siege towers kind of work though (at least with the overhaul mod that I've used), so there's that.\n\nObviously the game is still addicting in some way, as it's managed to get me to pour 200+ hours into it, but it feels more like I've wasted a massive part of my life trying to get this game to entertain me than anything else. People who have never played a Total War game before may find this game neat because of the setting and the battles (which are absolutely a standout feature for this series when compared to other strategy games), but those of us who have played TW games before know how much of a disappointment this was. For those who disagree with me: go back and look at the promotional videos that CA released prior to the game's launch and compare that to what we paid for. I've not experienced anything close to what was advertised, and I've yet to see anyone who has been able to make this game look anywhere near the way it did in the videos of the ♥♥♥♥in alpha (that CA said was still going to be further optimized). It still looks cool at times--some of the cities having unique features on the battle map is a really cool feature, and the campaign map looks by far the best it has in any game of the series.\n\nOverall, Rome 2 was a huge failure and a waste of time for everyone involved. It actually compares really unfavorably to Rome 1 and Medeival 2 from 10 years ago. CA has already rushed into making another game, Atilla, which is really just a remake of one of Rome 1's expansions released as a full game. I will not even be touching that game unless it gets great reviews and goes on sale for <$20. You'd have to be a fool to preorder that game after the trainwreck that was Rome 2's launch. CA has used up all the good faith it built from its early games and deserves to be under heavy scrutiny going forward.\n\nAs for anyone thinking about buying this game, I would strongly recommend not to. Even if its heavily discounted, it's really not worth the time that you will pour into it before finally accepting that it's just not a good game. I would suggest waiting for Atilla's release and seeing what the community consensus is (let's not forget how many gaming websites gave Rome 2 highly favorable reviews at launch). Hopefully CA will get its act together and release what Rome 2 should have been.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros\n+Campaign map looks really good compared to other games in the series\n+Modding community is amazing and did CA a huge favor by saving this game before CA could make it playable on its own\n\nCons\n-The AI is so bad that it's really hard to actually use strategy in a meaningful way\n-No immersion due to features from previous games being streamlined or removed\n-Game was released with numerous broken features and many of these features still remain broken despite all the patches\n-Really disappoints graphically in a lot of areas (poorly optimized)","February 13, 2015","false","337.6"," 307 of 388 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","307","388","8","11"

Yesterday I finally decided, after crushing another army at shogun 2, to give Rome 2 a whirl.\nI'll mostly compare it to Shogun 2, seeing as CA&SEGA tried to surpass it's success.\nNow, I know about how hyped it was, and how much flak it's been getting since release, but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nGameplay-wise, combat.\nGood points:\nAll factions have different units, with slightly different statistics to boot, which makes for more varied combat situations.\nStatistics are now broken down in even more sections that can be improved upon.\nUnits are thankfully still in 100+ range, so your 20 unit army is still large enough.\nHiding has been slightly improved upon shogun 2, and LoS hiding is detailed a bit better.\nGarrisons are now meaningful enough that one unit of bowmen can no longer snipe down an entire city.\n\nBad points.\nMorale. I don't know what they're thinking down there, but early units' morale is so ridiculously low that getting twenty casualties can send units into a shattered state.\nDifferences in unit strength. Your basic units are so weak when people start fielding their mainstays that, coupled with that horrendous morale issue, they hold for a literal ten seconds before routing.\nYour land army can spontaneously and instantly turn into a fullstack navy on a whim, making real navies pretty much pointless.\nDefensive battles are made even easier by making any and all defenders able to rout, and having 0 morale bonus for being the last line of defense, which makes sieges a cakewalk.\n\n\nDiplomacy\nGood points:\nNew requests: Non-aggression pacts, defensive alliances, military alliances, yes! Give diplomacy a function besides extorting money and asking for trade agreements.\nThe AI actively pursues diplomacy now, very rewarding.\n\nBad points:\nThe AI actively pursues diplomacy, like a toddler. Geography, war/peace status and relationships matter not to the AI, additionally they ask for the most ridiculous prices for mundane things at time, or ask senseless requests every single turn.\nDiplomatic relations are confusing and often nonsensical, even though there are way more actions that affect relations now.\n\nGameplay-wise AI\n\nGood:\nAI now partakes in many more activities than before, and combines their land and naval armies in assaults now.\n\nBad:\nPretty much everything.\nAI in field battles goes in a near-straight line for your units, tries to send cavalry to a flank and then forgets about it, and battles devolve into a slugfest until they're out of units.\nAI on an offensive siege battles rushes your control points(REALLY NOW?) instantly, and that's it.\nAI on defensive siege battles...Stand their ground, even if they have no missile units and you're standing there slinging projectiles on their poor militia until the last arrow has been spent.\nAI sometimes inexplicably moves their army to who-knows-where when you're standing five feet from their capital, and leaves it wide-open for a quick siege.\nAI occasionally does seemingly senseless attacks with one or two units against a city or fullstack, and then obviously loses.\n\n\nOther things of note:\nYou cannot, I repeat, CANNOT recruit any units anywhere, anywhen, except for straight into a general's army. So don't bother trying.\nGenerals are near-pointless except for getting an easy elite unit.\nExpect graphical glitches and FPS drops, even on super-tier computers.\nAlthough there are several different factions, you are still very limited in your choices, which is a disappointment personally.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nIs this the TW game to rule all TW games? No.\nIs this game worth buying?

Unfortunately it not only drops many of the most interesting, enjoyable and atmosphere enhancing features that were in the original Rome, but also implements many features in ways that destroy game-play, believability and historical accuracy. It also seems unfinished\n\nThe province system in which cities are grouped into provinces in which buildings in one city affect every city in the province held by the same faction is interesting, but the way buildings work is pretty annoying.\n\nYou can research technology, but the starting tech isn't even bronze age - you need a tech advance for battering rams and ladders.\n\nThe level of detail you can see in your settlements population, happiness/unhappiness, squalor etc is massively reduced as is info on where income and trade income comes from.\n\nThe political system and 1 year turns result in generals being recalled or dying as soon as they get any significant experience or skills. Agents don't last much longer.\n\nThe stylised icon interface is annoying and not intuitive.\n\nThe AI and pathfinding bugs in assaults on walled cities are pretty terrible even after 6 patches and one beta patch. The AI still can't pick up, put down and use ladders, rams or siege towers effectively the way it could in the original Rome Total War ten years ago or Medieval 2 Total War 7 years ago.\n\nThere are over 100 factions, but many are out of period or just made up, including client states like Carthage's two ; and they slow the AI turn down more and more as the game progresses.\n\nWorst of all are the instant super transports. Any army can create transports to carry it by stepping off a beach, for free. They're capable of fighting in sea battles and beating any starting fleet whether in auto-calc or not by weight of numbers.\n\nEvery faction from Scythian nomad horse archers to Spanish and African tribes goes for a sail in the Mediterranean, with nothing much to fear from enemy navies. Factions which lose all their cities also take to the sea. They then either float there till they slowly die, or hover off the coast forcing you to place armies in all your coastal cities for dozens of turns until they slowly die of attrition, or else they take cities by avoiding your land armies and acting as vikings. What? Build fleets to hunt them down you say? But you can't afford to - ships for fleets take time and money to build and require pay. Instant transports don't - and your own field armies are tied down on land preventing them from coming back by sea.\n\nBizarrely the game designers have decided that transports should be just a slightly inferior version of a large oared warship with the same hundreds of oarsmen and ram and sleek design as a warship. In reality in the Roman and Hellenistic period transports were usually commandeered merchant sailing ships, because they could carry enough troops, horses and food and water for them. Oared warships were good for ramming, boarding and raking the oars off of enemy ships - but all those oarsmen and the narrow hulls to make them maneuverable left them with no room to carry more than a few marines. They usually followed coastlines so they could land to get food and water for the oarsmen each day - and so they could land if there was bad weather as oared galleys were not very seaworthy. Yet  insta-super-transports somehow  fit hundreds of soldiers, horses and elephants.\n\nUnlike in the original Rome you can fight out sea battles rather than just autocalc them. The ships and marines in sea battles look great, but the way sea battles work is pretty lamentable. Boarding is made very easy. No need to use grapples (iron hooks on ropes) to get close to an enemy ship to board it, let alone use a corvus (rotatable boarding ramp with a spike on the end to go through the enemy deck) - bumping into them is good enough. Even more ridiculously, once one ship is boarding another no other ship or marines can touch either of them.\n\nHistorically smaller galleys could outmanouvre and defeat larger ships - as at the battle of Actium. In Rome II small ships are incapable of doing much damage to larger ones, even where the large ship is a transport or some lightly built viking style ship. Historically a small oared galley with a metal plated ram could turn faster than larger ships and immobilise them by oar raking (shearing off enemy ship's oars using ram). Or they could sink them by ramming broadside and holing it below the waterline.\n\nMany major ancient cities such as Syracuse and Jerusalem, which the Romans had great difficulty taking by siege and assault due to their massive fortifications and inner and outer walls and citadels are in the game as unwalled villages and hamlets. This makes the game even more ridiculous and annoying for anyone who knows even the basics of the history – and makes no sense.\nTotal War games can’t include every settlement, so they usually include the most important, largest or most strategically significant ones. By conquering a settlement you conquered the province it was in in Rome Total War. In Rome II this is called the ‘region’ with two or more regions grouped into a province. How could the most important settlement in an entire region be a hamlet or a village? Even ignoring the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over history, this makes no sense.\n\nGiving three quarters of settlements no walls seems like it was another cheap, rush option to minimise costs and so maximise profits. Have working siege AI? Nah - just re-use the engine from Empire, Napoleon and Shogun Total War but take the walls off most cities.\n\nSome attempt to justify this as reducing the number of "boring" sieges / assaults. In fact it reduces the frequency and size of field battles compared to Rome 1 or Medieval 2 Total War because in those games the player or AI required at least 1 turn and usually more to build enough siege equipment to take a town - and in that time the player or AI usually sent an army to try to break the siege - resulting in a battle with the relieving army on one side and the besieging army and garrison on the other.\n\nIn Rome II you get lots of incredibly dull and annoying assaults on the unwalled town square against some garrison militia units instead. Field battles or assaults on an actual walled town using siege equipment would be preferable.\n\nThe myriad bugs a requiring endless patching and missing features suggest it was rushed out incomplete and without even beta testing.\n\nRome II runs poorly and with poor graphics on many PCs and laptops unless the Graphical Enhancement Mod is used. Mistakes made in the ongoing patching process make the game currently not run with mods. Anyone thinking of buying should hold off for at least 6 months and maybe a year or two till patching is over and better mods finished","November 26, 2013","false","59.2"," 1,296 of 1,749 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","296","1","0","29"

But my main issue with the game is the lack of immersion... the hurrendous dlc, the game engine itself.. the games horrid, its 3 step backwards from shogun etc, boring and streamlined, theres no depth.. . many features are still broken and irreparable, like the function of generals, or the use of siege equipment.... the fact that this game is available on Ipad is a joke in itself.\n\nBuy it if you're looking to see a few battles from the classical time period.. but dont expect any challenge from it, the games boring, unimmersive, broken, offensive and creative assembly are having a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laugh if they think making 40 quid worth of dlc for one of the most dissapointing games of all time.. is at all acceptable. They have moked not only the fans, but history itself.\n\n\nI have been waiting for this game since I ever layed eyes on the first installment, back in 2004. A younger me would lay at night and dream about Rome 2 in all its glory... after my dream games announcment I quite literally jumped with joy! No words can express how excited and stimulated I was on the day of release.. I hadnt been this excited for a game since Skyrim.. unfortunatley I clicked play and instead, had an enormous peverted vanular fallas strike me between the eyes soo hard I thought not only my life had been extinguished, but the very reality we exist in, THIS GAME IS A BLOODY DISGRACE! AND THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TWO FACED MONEY GRABBING LIARS AT CA SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!\n\nRegardless of the initial bugs (CURRENTLY ON PATCH 7!!!), the game itself is a broken, shambolic, overpriced piece of rushed nonsense. The AI is awful, the worst its ever been, the ui has been destroyed and there is no immersion whatsoever... the campaign is dull and lifeless, with many broken features, such as pointless generals and a diplomacy system which leaves you in fits of frustration.. im not even going to start on the sea battles, lets just say I broke down and cried during one, at the fact that CA had the sheer ♥♥♥♥ing ordasity to reveal this to anyone other than children.... not to mention the ♥♥♥♥ing unbalanced and historically inaccurate depictions of just about every faction in the game.. I will for the first time ever seriously consider whether or not to buy the next installment in the series.\n\nSure they added a couple of nice features such as regional management and larger navies etc... But EVERYTHING ELSE is worse off...and the two things i've mentioned are buggy and in my opinion irreperable, they stripped hundreds of features from the previous games! WHY!??? where are the cutscenes? the immersion? the family trees? the music? the voice actors? the siege eqipment? AND ♥♥♥♥ OF TORCHES FOR EVERY UNIT!!?? RIDICULOUS! Pike units only reveal their pikes when in phalanx, units are unbalanced, slingers are too common and overpowered... the list is endless...\n\nAs for Multiplayer.... christ.. It might aswell not have it, barebones and immpossible to play coop due to loading times! In addition tactical vantage points such as hills and forested areas offer no benefit, removing almost all form of strategy from the game..\n\nIve patche it, ive modded and invested 100 hours and still havent been able to change my mind, IF YOUR READING THIS DONT BUY THE DLC !!! be content with what you have, ROME 1 is a far superior game!\n\nFInally I HAVE HAD IT WITH THIS ENGINE! There is no unit collision! they all just awkwardly slide against one another, ♥♥♥♥ing mosh pit and then execute singular kill moves with added athletisism.. it just looks ridiculous and is totally unrealistic! Empire got away with it as it was mainly musket warfare! CREATIVE ASSEMBLY NEEDS TO START OVER!!! fighting in this period was all about fromations!! how do you think Alexander defeated Darius at Galgumea or The Romans againtss Budicca when they where outnumbered 10-1, ♥♥♥♥ING FORMATIONS!!!! NOT MOSH PITS!@@#@\n\nIt is blatantly clear that the folks up at CA just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ anymore, and would much prefer screwing us all over for a quick buck, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.. :(\n\nfrom a depressed and infuriated fan of total war since 2004... have a nice day :) DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!","January 6, 2014","false","440.9"," 1,895 of 2,607 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","895","2","0","90"

Often the most effective technique is to just gather all your units together into a man-blob and throw it at the enemy. Even the most well-drilled and disciplined unit will break formation upon entering combat, forming an amorphous shape surrounded by confused diaspora who seem to have lost their grasp of where the unit is supposed to be.\n\nNaval battles are farcical; the ships are far too clumsy to perform even the simplest tasks with any level of consistency, and they never seem to do what you tell them to. Siege equipment is often similarly useless - men gather in heaps stranded on top of ladders, unable to get themselves over the wall, and palm trees prove to be the best defence for a city as rams and towers find any vegetation utterly impassable, often getting stuck as they pass by.\n\nThe family tree system is gone, replaced by an obtuse, but ultimately inconsequential politics mechanic which serves primarily as a money-sink to dispose of unwanted funds, which you will inevitably possess due to the arbitrary limits placed on the number of units you can field.\n\nGenerals and other ancillaries no longer have traits, which means they are all virtually identical. While the upgrade paths do make some effort to force you into specializing agents (spies, etc) into certain ability sets, there is only a very limited selection of improvements you will make to the generals, as the majority of bonus effects they can receive are quite niched, outclassed by a small range of far superior all-purpose skills. Not that the trait system is of any great importance however, since the absurd choice of time scale at 1-turn-per-year means that all characters will die before ever achieving a high rank.\n\nThese changes from previous titles coupled with a 'streamlined' economic system which gives the player rather little capacity for input lead to shallow, underwhelming campaign map play. It will not seem quite so shallow at first however, because the byzantine UI certainly tries its best to have you go through as many menus as possible to perform a particular action.  The developers opting to keep the lovely campaign map in view as much as possible means only very limited information is displayed in a small panel at the bottom of the screen. Not very helpful if you're trying to track down something specific.\n\nThe only saving grace of the game is that mods can resolve many, though not all of, the aforementioned issues.\n\nI love the Total War franchise, but Rome 2 deals a great amount of harm to the reputation of CA, and I was wrong to place my trust in them by buying it at launch.

Having loyally followed the franchise since Shogun 1, the expectations for this game were huge.

Please scroll to bottom for the fast review.\n***\n\nI'll start this by saying I really like the TW series, I own all TW games and DLCs, plus some CA games that I bought mainly to support the studio. Generally I don't play many other games on Steam.\n\nRome 2 was the first TW I was hyped for and wanted to get on release. It is just too diverse, too big not to be entertaining.\nSeeing the buggy mess it was on release I decided to wait a bit and give CA the chance to fix the game.\nWhich *spoilers* they never did.\n\nNow, as someone who enjoys playing even the original Shogun I am not one for graphics. I really liked how they went with all games since Empire and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Medieval 2 still looks great in field battles. But I couldn't care less about the looks. I fell in love with the game mechanics, they clicked right in place with me and I spent numerous hours trying to get to understand them, both ingame and in real life. That's how you know a great video game - you get to constantly think of it when you are not playing it.\n\nLearning Shogun 2 took me quite some time and I won't win a competition for knowing the game. There are still new things I discover every now and then. They all fall right into spot, close the cycle and it just feels great to come up to the next revelation.\n\nThis is, unfortunately, not the case with Rome II.\n\nRome II introduced some new things which are great. Like the army stances.\nSo why on Earth does the Fortify stance say "boosts reinforcement range by +50%" and does not do it?\nThis is the case with so many faction bonuses, personal traits and retainers, skills, etc, that it's mindblowing.\n\nWhen playing games I like to be on fair terms. Get helthpack -> health goes up. Critical strike on enemy -> 50% more damage. Things like this. Things we're used to take for granted.\n\nRome II does a really poor job of explaining its mechanics. There are tutorial videos, but they are somehow obsolete as the game received 17 patches, the last one with major core changes. I had to play Attila to understand the whole party politics thing.\n\nRome II is big and diverse. And this is a curse more than a blessing. There are so many little things missing, not working or just straight-forward overlooked by the developers, that I won't bother listing them all. Just go to the official support forum and check the Single Player Campaign support page.\n\nFairly said, I think Rome II did not ever make it out of beta.\nThe reason for this review is that CA stopped supporting the game. A game I paid and bought all dlcs for. A game I really wanted to like. The last patch fixed (arguably) some things, but not merely enough. And that is not even considering all the technical and graphical bugs, which are not a subject of this review. For a moment there I thought they are on the right way, but they just abandoned the game. The game with my favorite time period, that was supposed to revolutionize the TW franchise as the core mechanics weren't changed since Empire. Well, I'm sorry for being mad, but I am. As a user, as a customer. False data, false advertisment and false promises. Thanks CA, I'll gladly pirate your ♥♥♥♥ from now on and not buy a single title. Unless Rome II is fixed that is.\n\n***\nPROS:\n+ Looks great. Some folks may argue here, but for me the game running on Ultra is gorgeous.\n+ One of the biggest maps in TW games. Meaning a lot of factions, traits, bonuses, variety in general.\n+ There are some great historical campaigns in addition to the main game that make the title's worth.\n+ New mechanics and even controls to make the TW experience more up-to-date.\n\nCONS:\n- A bit buggy even after all the patches. Soldier groups will shout different units' lines. No anti-aliasing; water reflection is broken. Some really ugly textures. There's a lot more to that list.\n- Unfinished mechanics that clearly can be fun but are not even a factor to work with.\n- Some clearly broken gameplay elements. Bonuses not given though they should be. Traits acting on the opposite. Sometimes your generals will get bad (or good) traits with no apparent reason.\n- Too much DLCs, some arguably not worth their money.\n- Continious lack of support for some of the major elements and problems this game has.\n- Looks like some of the best ideas for Rome II didn't make it in the game and we were sold Attila instead. Which is fine, but everyone can see that Rome II needs some Attila in it.\n\n","December 4, 2015","false","487.2"," 218 of 288 people (76%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","76","218","288","12","12"

The original one was pretty negative, and the reason for that were the infite bugs, glitches and unbalances of this game. After so many patches, even tho we may find a considerable quantity of bugs and glitches, it's not game-killing as it was in the days, weeks and months following the launch.\n\nSo, finally, here's my review of the game Total War: Rome II.\nThis game is adicting, because of the simple fact it's good. It has many mechanics that are great!\nThe graphics, if you're playing on high or ultra quality are AMAZING. Both on SP and MP (by MP I mean battles, they can be campaign vs. AI battles). The camera they have is pretty nice to see charges, not that good on seeing infantry or ranged units, but you still get the emotion.\nIt has a few nice historical battles, tho more should be added, FOR FREE.\nThe technology part of it is pretty well made, and the development of your cities if pretty cool. The levelling up system on your general, troops, and agents is really cool, but it doesn't change the game too much. The diplomacy is nice, and one should pay attention to it, as it can save your life. Other positive aspect, the politics. Some factions are cooler to play when talking about politics. Some factions just don't have active politics, tho for all of them politics can change where your empire is turned to. If your family is too strong, the weak will rebel and create a civil war. Too weak? The strong will rebel and create a civil war. But, distributing the power well is not the only thing that changes. When your empire gets big, there'll be a civil war. Be counting on that. And be prepared. You may have to stop all frontier military actions to save your capital and near settlements from the separatists.\n\nNegative: These DLCs they create, they're too expensive just to add/change a few things... At the date near the game release, those who bought the game were forsaken by the producer of the game, making us live in the constant bugs. So, don't expect nice treatment.\n\nOverall I'd say the game is good, not perfect, AI still gets dumb sometimes, but, if you put on a difficulty high enough, it becomes quite a challenge. If you get tired of the game, I recommend you check the workshop out, maybe it has what you need to fire up that urge to play the game again.\n\nRight now, I'd say you think well if you want this game, if you're not sure, wait for a discount, tho, it might never come. Even a 25% discount would be enough to make this game worth your money.\n\nTalking about popularity of the game. Even tho it has been on the 'Most Sold' Steam tab many times, it hasn't got a big community, I'd say mostly because of the game-killing bugs it used to have, and the fact that Single Player Campaign (I don't mean the story campaign) is probably what attracts people most.\n\nMy veredict: 8,5/10\nIf using mods in the game: 9/10\n\nPlease comment with your opinion (do not hesitate on using strong language if you hate me) and give me a like.\nHave a nice strategic day!","November 25, 2013","true","201.4"," 2,580 of 3,773 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","580","3","0","54"

Newer releases are getting more and more sloppy in contrast to the work being done on graphics.

I have not played and title newer than this one, but I would like to hope that they would be more "fully developed" than this title.  I am extremely dissapointed with this game series and I will not be purchasing any more future Total War games unless I hear good reviews from fellow die-hard TW fans.\n\nI bought this game on a black friday sale for 15 bucks; I would have kicked myself if I'd spent 50 bucks on it.

That being said...\n\nPROS:\n\n-Great graphics\n+colors are not so vivid, giving a realistic appearance\n\n-Battle cries are emtional and excellently done\n+although random soldiers' mutters are repetitive, they are usually context-relevant and humanize the soldiers\n+Roman Auxilary Cavalry voice is AWESOME\n\n-Naval and land battle combination is cool, especially in siege battles\n\n-Can command 40 units at a time\n\n-Armies' unit cards are sorted intelligently (although this could be done manually in RTW 1)\n\n-Grouping settlements into provinces allows for more fluid management, especially once you've expanded to an empire\n\n-SPQR replaced by optional missions delineates gameplay allowing for a more sandbox campaign\n\n-Imperium levels and corruption, although extremely annoying, reflect the instability and brutality of the politics of ancient societies (and modern, for that matter)\n\n-Agents' passive actions (oxymoron?), such as Military Administration, Military Training, Spy Networks, etc., are cool.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Cannot play as Sparta without DLC (who pays 50 bucks and doesn't want to play as Sparta?)\n\n-Most historic battles are DLC\n\n-Units glitch on walls\n+many times when you tell them to move left, they first move right, vice versa\n+in a Rome city defense battle I commanded, units on walls wouldn't obey commands or act at all\n\n-Naval battles are bugged\n+ships sometimes will get locked into moving the direction they are facing; never stopping until they slide into a corner of the map\n+naval artillery/missiles will lock onto a land target's last location within their firing range, continuing to fire after they've left that spot until you command the ship to turn around or move out of range (commanding the unit to stop does not stop their firing orders)\n\n-Cinematic kill sequences disrupt the combat simulation\n+Soldiers attempting to pull back from combat will stop and turn around to engage in a fight sequence instead of simply being chopped from behind\n+There are no backstap kill sequences\n+cavalry kill rate while chasing routing troops is frustratingly slow since cavalry MUST kill with cinematic kill sequence when not charging\n+one sequence, in particular, may involve a soldier striking over and over again for more than 15 seconds, digging him deep behind enemy lines without being stopped by surrounding enemy soldiers\n\n-AI has not been improved since I last played Rome: Total War Barbarian Invasion v 1.6\n\n-Blood and Gore pack acted as an "on" switch for delimbing of soldiers; no new fight sequences were added.\n\n-General's/agent's abilities do not reflect their actions\n+you may now craft an agent to accomplish any sort of task; regardless of what actual experience they have\n+generals essentially cannot remain idle without developing negative traits, unless they have already aquired their maximum of three traits\n\n-Agents are not as specialized and can be more powerful than armies\n+it's easy enough to develop a powerful agent; powerful agents can cripple armies into not being able to move for countless turns.\n+all agents can perform all tasks with some differences in outcome (reminiscent of Dragon Age 2 and Diablo 3's overbalancing of classes, removing stark contrasts in capabilities)\n\n-Extremely limited diversity of buildings in settlements\n+settlements, even capitals, are not unique from each other; essentially only a few dozen mix/match possibilities with hum-drum differences\n+no point in preserving old buildings from another faction since they get in the way of your 3-5 building slot limit\n+cities' appearance in battle mode do not reflect your personal development of that city\n\n-Encyclopedia is poorly organized and disruptive of the game\n+Previous titles simply required a right-click to open a single unit/building information card","July 5, 2015","false","825.2"," 467 of 669 people (70%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","70","467","669","30","15"

This is caused by the fact that the campaign map is simply to big. It takes conquering 3 or 4 nations to become the largest faction on the map and once that happens, the rest is simply a matter of time. If you get past that, the only potential problem might be the infamous civil war.\nCivil war was a bad mechanic at the time of release, and Emperor Edition has somehow managed to make it even more annoying. It simply punishes the players for making progress by randomly turning parts of their territory and armies against them, unless they bother doing lots of micromanagement within the faction politics system, which is boring and requires putting some aspects of character development (political traits) outside players control. I recommend using a mod that disables it altogether and hoping that Creative Assembly will finally stop adding punishing mechanics that try to emulate an actual challenge to their games - realm divide in Shogun II and civil war in Rome II have set up a bad trend, and I don't want it to be continued in Attila.\nIn my opinion, too many buildings give happiness penalty from squalor when upgraded. It's neither a good gameplay concept nor a realistic situation, unless people living back then had nothing better to do than riot because someone in their province was farming cattle with clearly nefarious intent.\nThe battle AI got better since release, but it can still be exploited, for example some barbarian coastal settlement maps have areas that AI never enters unless you lure its units there by coming close and then retreating inside them slowly, allowing to safely murder it with ranged troops. Siege battles haven't really gotten much harder in my opinion. Previously all you needed to do in order to win them was place a single unit of pikemen in pike phalanx behind the gate. Now you just block the stairways and towers on the wall section the AI is attacking, which will force a fight on the wall. This has the advantage of making your units pretty much immune to slingers and javelinmen - throwing stones and javelins up the walls doesn't really work, whereas a unit waiting behind the gate could still be hit - while also allowing your towers to score a lot of kills. The AI still mostly attempts to attack instantly instead of waiting for a few turns, except in certain settlements, such as Pulpedeva, where it will usually try to besiege.\nThe factions are diverse when it comes to troop rosters, but they're still lacking balance. Armored elephants can easily destroy several units and depending on troop composition sometimes entire armies by themselves. This is offset by the fact that they require completing one of the military research lines to recruit, so normally you can't get them early on. Except if your faction can use them as general bodyguards, in which case you can get them at turn one. Sword infantry in general is also pretty underwhelming, which makes Rome itself a not-so-good faction. Basic barbarian units have morale horrible enough to make them route from being sneezed at and barbarian cities have pretty much zero defensive capabilities when compared to 'civilised' factions. The wooden towers at barbarian city gates also tend to burn one another with their own arrows if the attackers come from certain directions.\nWhen it comes to diplomacy, AI has some major issues when it comes to anything client state or satrapy related. Your allies will often declare wars against them, forcing you to either break the allience or lose the client state/satrapy. This happens because your allies will hate your vassals for having past wars with you, trespassing on your territories and agent actions against you. It also seems that other faction don't acknowledge resources produced in settlements that are being upgraded. Even if you have several settlements that produce a single type of resource, if you're upgrading just one of them then the chance to get the AI to trade with you will go down. This tends to only be noticeable at the beginning of campaigns though.\nThe agents in general are far too strong. An experienced spy is especially broken, as he can can reliably kill over half of an army with a single poisoning.\nThere are several major issues with the battle system.\nFirstly, AI troops (not whole units) will always turn to face the player cavalry charge. This is especially annoying when you try to charge at spearmen who are currently engaging your own infantry in the rear. You will notice that before your cavalry hits them, the last row of the spearmen will turn towards it, causing some extra casualties. This can be avoided by ordering the cavalry to run in the direction of the unit and only make them attack at the very last moment, and this only occurs when player does this to the AI, never the other way around.\nSecondly, flanking penalties are applied too often. Sometimes a single soldier will awkwardly move too far to the left or right, giving the opposing unit a morale penalty for being flanked.\nThirdly, all the AI does in battles is ram your battle line with 2-3 large blobs of units, while also attacking your flanks with cavalry - even if the flanks consist of spearmen turned to face them or horse archers/skirmishers.\nFourthly, giving active abilities to pretty much every single unit is annoying and is nothing more than a micromanagement nightmare that doesn't really increase the complexity of the game, since most of them have no drawbacks and should simply be used as soon as possible.\nLastly, the points where reinforcements enter the battle are somewhat random. It's perfectly possible to have enemy reinforcements pop up behind you and vice versa, regardless of campaign map placement.\nMy last concern lies with the DLC. There's more of it than it was in previous total war games, and most of it also costs more than before. In the main campaign, only 14 of the 32 playable factions are available without the DLC, which to me feels downright insulting.","December 26, 2014","false","706.4"," 139 of 185 people (75%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","75","139","185","13","1"

Yes it is. Is it as good as its predecessors? Sadly, no. And while I can recommend it to you, if you're looking for a good casual strategy game, its still a huge step backwards for the franchise, And like after playing Mass Effect 3, I am afraid of what the developers are doing to my beloved franchises next.\nSo while it has its good aspects, I will focus mainly on the flaws of this game in this review.\n\nThe Total War series is my favorite strategy franchise, and maybe my favorite game series in general. You've got a turn based campaign map where you capture and hold cities, build up diplomatic relationships with other nations, recruit armies and so on and so forth. When it comes to battle, the game changes from the campaign to a randomly created battlefield map, where you command your troops in real time. Total War connects the "just-one-more-turn" mentality from games like Civilization with intense real time battles like in World in Conflict for instance. This formula works every time, regardless of the given time period or setting. Creative Assembly added features until 2009s Empire Total War, and with Shogun 2 they've streamlined it back to bare bones to get rid of the problematic AI, which was all over the place in Empire and Napoleon.\n\nRome 2 promised us an overhaul of the traditional Total War concept while bringing back the diversity of factions (Shoguns Clans all had the same units due to the Japan setting) and adding new features. They have lied to us. I still remember the moment when my legions first encountered the Scythians and their mounted archers in Rome 1. What I'm trying to say is that you had to adapt your tactics to the foe you were fighting back in the day. Now, although the skins and names are different, every nation still seems to have nearly the same roster. Barbarian swordmasters really play like a legionary cohort, they even throw javelins like them.\n\nThe biggest two problems I have with Rome 2 is that its a) even more streamlined than Shogun 2 (they've even cut out building and upgrading streets. What the ♥♥♥♥, so you're telling me that some barbarians could march as fast through their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ woods as the mighty legions of rome on their high-tech streets?) And b), the features they've added don't work.\n\nThe best example for this problem is how they've "improved" armies and recruitment. Previously you've recruited your troops in your cities and gathered them to army stacks. Now you have a limited amount of stacks, which gets increased by your "empire level" (so even if I have the economic capability to recruit more troops, I can't do that, because my "empire level" isn't high enough? What the flying ♥♥♥♥). Those serve under a general, who materializes the troops out of thin air apparently, as  long as he is marching through friendly territory. And while the RPG elements they've added to the stacks are interesting, not being able to move single or small amounts of units independent from a general breaks your strategy big time. If you want to capture a small city, you used to be able to dispatch a small force to get the job done. Here you have to use one of your huge, bigass Armies to conquer a tiny village. Or imagine a rebellion at the heart of you empire, while all your armies are fighting thousands of miles away. Normally you would recruit some units near the troublespot and eradicate the filthy rebel scum, but now you have to remove one of your armies from the front, leaving your cities near the enemy undefended cause once again, you can't recruit units in your cities, just to march all the way back and crush the rebellion. And if you want to exchange the units beetween your stacks, you have to move your entire stack to the other just to exchange one unit. I don't have to explain why this can be infuriating at times.\n\nNow lets get to the building and campaign map. Cities are now organized in provinces with 2 to 4 of them. This really helps to overwatch and upgrade entire regions but also comes with some problems. Those are the culture spread (Syracuse for instance has a cultural impact on southern Italy because they're in a province together) that creates public discontent, and the public discontent after capturing a city in a province. For instance the people of rome get angry at you when you take a city in northern italy, because they're in the same province. Why does this happen? Why does local discontent have to have an impact on your already captured and secured cities and lead them to rebel? What the ♥♥♥♥ CA.\n\nI could ramble on about the hundreds of minor issues and odd design decisions of Rome 2, like the train wreck politic system, the faceless randomly generated Generals that are just weak compared to the family tree system of Medieval 2 for instance, which created interesting characters that you really cared about. I could talk about how you can't even see the fight animations because battles are huge moshpits with no order or discipline whatsoever (although CA managed to patch the worst parts of these) or how it just fails to get you immersed in the time period. Or that the repeated one-line general "speeches" are a shameful display compared to the long, randomly created ones of the previous games.\n\nBut what breaks the game at the end of the day is the bare bones A.I. Total War is a single player game, period. And when you ♥♥♥♥ up the A.I. in a game that is designed for daylong sessions in front of your computer, you're doing something wrong. The A.I. was never CAs strenght, I admit that, but compared to the budget RTW2 had, the A.I. was never this incompetent. And while they fixed the worst insults displayed in the real time battles, it still seems you're playing against a brain dead infant on the campaign map. Giant enemy forces ignoring defenseless cities (garrisons are a joke), the A.I. randomly trying to form contracts with you even if they are completely useless, almost never declaring war on you (except you're playing the Seleucids, where its you against every eastern faction) and army stacks made half out of peasant slingers. And when you want to auto resolve those battles because 2000 slingers aren't worth your time, guess what. the auto resolve system is completely ♥♥♥♥ed, so you either lose or get unacceptable losses with your heavily armored legionaries accompanied by elite cavalry.\n\nBut you've gotta give it to Creative Assembly. They know they've ♥♥♥♥ed up and they've patched big times. And while everything I've mentioned is still an issue (bad design decisions can't get patched), this is pure gold compared to the release state of Rome 2. With the release of the emperor edition, this game became something worth your money.\nBut at the end of the day, looking at all the flaws this game has, you're better off with Medieval 2 or Rome 1.\n\nSpeaking of money, my biggest concern about Creative Assembly isn't Rome Total War 2 anymore, its their DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. We're getting stoned to death by unit packs, faction DLC and additional mini campaigns, which are all right to ask money for, but please dont display a ♥♥♥♥ing button in the main menu that tells me to pay 15 ♥♥♥♥ING BUCKS for three uninteresting factions from the black sea. Again, the units are all reskins of the same 10 or so unit types, so why even bother when there are mods that make ALL FACTIONS AVAILABLE. I understand you don't have to buy these DLCs, but they lack quality and are way way overpriced. If they released a single, huge faction pack with 40 or 50 completely new units for 30 bugs, I would buy it. But the bombardment with lazy ♥♥♥ pay 15-bucks-for-three-more-dull-factions "expansions" is unacceptable and infuriating.","December 14, 2014","false","173.6"," 219 of 306 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","219","306","7","6"

Campaign: As always, Rome 2's campaign is a mix of turn based strategical management on the campaign map, and real time battles. For the most part, the AI does a good job managing their cities and armies. They don't make foolish mistakes, they defend their cities, and they attack any vulnerabilities left by the player. The UI is fine, but the lack of branching skill trees for generals can be annoying. The removal of family trees is another annoyance as you feel no attachment to your faction's characters. One place where Rome 2 shines, however, is its variety. There are dozens of faction to chose from, exact numbers based on DLC, all of which have interesting units, traits, and challenge levels.\n\n2. Battles: Once again, we see the return of CA's battle AI. While it is not totally imcopetent, it consistently makes moronic mistakes. It will engage your pikemen head on, charge cavalry into the front of heavy infantry, and often attack with no real tact. However, the battles are still fun. Troops are easy to control and the battle UI is slick and customizable. Sure, when a cav unit inexplicably gets stuck on one lonely spearman it can ♥♥♥♥ you the hell off, but it never detracts from the overall expirience.\n\n3. Multiplayer: Due to the variety of factions, Rome 2's multiplayer shines. Each faction is fun to play as and offers different stregnths and weaknesses. The added bonus of phasing out the battle AI is just the icing on the cake. However, technical issues still at times hinder the multiplayer, as you will often expirience severe lag and will occasionally be dropped from the game.\n\n4. Graphics: As one of the best optimized PC games out there in its current state, Rome 2 has no issue delivering both stellar graphics (in-battles and on the campaign map) and smooth framerates.\n\n5. DLC offerings: While the 'Wrath of Sparta' DLC fell short, and I still have yet to see the point of 'Blood and Gore,' Rome 2 still has some fine offerings for DLC. Some packs will add fun new factions, and others will offer new, full legnth historical camapign scenarios to be played out on customized maps. Without a doubt, 'Hannibal at the Gates' and Caesar in Gaul' stand out from the pack as superd additions to the game and engrosing windows into some of the most fascinating wars in antique history.\n\nWithout a doubt, Rome 2 stands out as one of the most extensive and deep offerings in the RTS genre. It is a stellar game and in its current condition, and it is the best Total War game to date.","August 14, 2015","true","396.8"," 365 of 537 people (68%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","68","365","537","35","11"

Some mechanics have changed, lacking real innovations and its hard to objectively say any single new mechanic is "better" then its previous iteration.\n\nWaiting times ingame are very long, loading is frequent and time-consuming. Even on a healthy quadcore with plenty of RAM, the game is very slow overall. An SSD would adress the loading times, but would do nothing for the slow decission-making process the AI seems to suffer from.\n\nI remember having similar issues with Rome: Total War.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShermanZA/recommended/214950/","ShermanZA","SHERMAN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShermanZA/","61 products in account","While this game is definately playable (Though ideally when heavily modded), this is not the successor to the orginal Rome which Total War veterens wanted. It's more akin to Empire: Total War in its structure and yet more simplified. Its controversial released combined with the dumbed down approach to campaign management (the province system, general system and recruitment system) means that I would recommend any other Total War title (with the exception of possibly Empire) over this one. However the game has been patched to a level where a new player to the Total War franchise should at least consider it , however I would suggest you wait for a sale ($60 is not worth it for this game in my opinion).\n\nOn top of this, the game seems to have shed some of the aesthetic features which made the first Rome so immersive. The lack of a family (while not required) means that you feel little to no immersion to your generals. They're just "spawn general and give him a random name", a tool to be used worn out and thrown away. Emperor edition has not changed this other than the presence of a few historical generals in the Imperator Augustus campaign and the limited use of them as political tools to gain gravitas.\n\nThe same can be said for the politics system. While the concept is great, the exectuion leaves a player feeling likes its strapped on to the side, since there was no actual politcal positioning involved other than gathering Gravitas (The resource the game uses to increase politcal support percentage). [Edit] The Emperor edition patch has fixed this somewhat by adding a politics tab which you can use to determine your overall politcal standing in the same way the senate slider functioned in Rome 1 as well as guage the risk of a civil war. While there still isn't an organised map of senate positions (where you would be able to determine how high up your general is in the senate), it still places faction politics into a position where the player can see its benefits to the faction as well as its relevence to the game over all. In the original Rome, having a high ranking general in the senate (Consul or other high ranking positions) felt like it was of immense importance in terms of your standing with the senate. But you don't feel that connection to your generals. Its like theres supposed to be a connection to the senate but there is none to be seen apart from a rank which isn't really displayed.\n\nThe armies and recruitment system is also a step backwards. The number of armies you can field at one time has been hardcoded with a limit based on your faction's Imperium level. This severely restricts your capability to spread your forces, as they limited to working only within an army. You cannot detach a small force to bolster a garrison and you find your self forced to move an entire army in order to swap a few units between them. The recruiment is linked to these armies aswell, so you cannot have an army on the move and produce reserves at the same time. This all has a severely negative effective effect on your ability to field armies in a dynamic manner. The arguement for this change has been to stop random small ai forces jsut roaming your lands for no reason, however in my experience, the only difference is that these warbands now have a general at their head and a raiding stance icon above them.\n\nNavies in this game are virtually useless due to uncanny strength of transport vessels. This is due to the fact that armies now automatically form a fleet of transports the moment they are ordered into the sea. Considering that a considerable portion of Roman conflict occurred around the Mediterean, this ability to magically make a transport navy appear out of thin air is a major oversight, as it renders navies pointless, as transports make equally effective fighting vessels. The ramming mechanic is messed up to the point that a light skirmisher bireme can sink a heavily loaded quintareme filled with marines in a few hits, rendering most expensive naval vessels useless.\n\nThe province system restricts your ability to build your cities by hard coding them into two presets, provincial villages and provincial capitals. Capitals can build practically any structure and have pre-built walls which cannot be improved in any manner. Villages by contrast can only build certain building types and cannot be fortified in any manner. This greatly diminshes the ability to customise your empire as it existed in the original Rome. In other Total War games, every settlement was the same preset, it could be built up, fortified and garrisioned as needed. You could created industrial or military cities where you wanted and when you wanted. This is something you simply cannot do in Rome 2. On top of this, the limited number of build slots which has haunted the last few Total War games also makes a return, limiting what you can do with the city's space.\n\n\n[Edit] After 15 patches the vanilla balance of units atleast feels good enough to credit the combat in this game. Graphically stunning with only a few things to nit pick such as the inccorrect modeling of the hoplite phalanx.(use the argive grip please)[/edit]\n\nRome 2 has finally become a playable experience similar in many aspects to Empire. For a new comer to the Total War series, this game would be worth a look though not at $60, however from the point of a veteren of the Total War series, this entry seems far more restrictive than previous titles and I cannot recommend this game over other Total War titles. Instead you should consider other Total War titles like Shogun 2 or the original Rome.\n\n[Edit] After 15 patches the base game has reached a state somewhat similar to Empire. It is now a decent game and newcomers to the Total War series should have no problems with this game. Regardless because of the cost of the game (60$) combined with the misgivings I've provided above, I still will not recommend this game when the other Total War titles provide a better experience at a better price at the cost of only graphical quality.\n\nTo address the questions regarding my over 300 hours of game time, yes I've continued to play Rome 2 despite my concerns (And with several mods to boot) , however I feel that my concerns mentioned above are still legitimate.[/edit]","June 5, 2014","false","413.9"," 997 of 1,527 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","997","1","0","55"

But alas, the time has come where I can confidently state that I will not buy another Total War title, for Rome II was the last straw. The Franchise has been devolving since Medieval II.\n\nTL;DR at bottom.\n\nI was originally hooked back in 2007 on the first incarnation of Rome: Total War, and I was completely STRICKEN with it until I was exposed to the "hotseat" variant for Medieval II: Kingdoms. To this day, many of my friends and I continue these hotseat campaigns through the Retrofit mod, and it has become somewhat of a ritual for us. Since, we have hoped for a Total War experience that would capitalize on this feature and maximize the idea of a "multiplayer campaign." Since, we have been disappointed time and time again.\n\nEmpire came promising a new multiplayer campaign that could be played on a massive scale that included three entirely separate theaters! Unfortunately, unlike the hotseat function, only two players could be present, and this alone was enough to shy my friends from buying it (not to mention a very limited selection of factions, and no ability to edit the descr_strat.txt to unlock all factions. . . but no matter! A simple mod fix, I thought!) but I had to try it. After having my all-time favorite campaign as Prussia, Empire had my praise. I persuaded a friend to play this "Beta" campaign. We did, and indeed we found it to be exceptional. We could even play as the enemy faction during battles to surmount the jagged AI which for YEARS was found to be lacking. Then, after 10 turns of greatness, the dreaded DESYNC. We trouble-shot for hours on end, digging through the internet to find answers- to no avail. Plenty of others had the same issue, but there were no answers? How curious. Even following "a one-month delay for the release of Empire" (Quote Wikipedia) they couldn't fashion a working version of the Multiplayer campaign? No matter, I thought; a failed project. Perhaps they will fix it in the near future. Unfortunately, despite taking my money and making a promise, to this day no fix has been issued. A "Beta" they called it- not worthy of a fix, despite having delayed the game launch. Buy Napoleon, they said. Quote the Creative Assembly; "This beta programme was designed to offer a taste of the exciting multiplayer gameplay we were integrating into recent titles, such as Total War: Shogun 2 and Napoleon: Total War,"\n\nI ignored Napoleon entirely (although I was foolish enough to buy it) because of the puny map size and the pathetic faction diversity. These facts did not convince any of 'my party' to buy it, either. Despite a supposed "working" multiplayer campaign, where was the fun if you could not be Venice, Spain, or Greece? What about an African or Anatolian or, for that matter, any "small" faction whatsoever? I supposed it was because there was no audience for such things. I supposed that all of my desires were a niche and that only my group of friends were the audience.\n\nThen came Shogun offering another attempt at a multiplayer campaign; still no hotseat, mind you. Again I felt hope that it could be everything I had wished, and again I gave the Creative Assembly my money. PLENTY of "small" factions, but little unit diversity! You could play with Samurai, or with Samurai; Japan is a very small place, after all. By the way, where were the nearby Eastern Korean or Chinese shores? Once more, Shogun did not interest the majority of my friends (for there was no hotseat function! No separate theaters of war! How difficult could it be to BRING BACK an old, yet fantastic idea? It could even be modernized and perfected!) but one other decided to take the plunge with me. I wasn't impressed by the lack of unit diversity, but I found myself well at home with the culture and the new agent system. The campaign AI was still clanky and had an absurd handicap budget, but at least the multiplayer campaign didn't desync! Or, thus I thought, until ALAS! The dreaded DYSYNC AGAIN! We were halted until we discovered the problem; each turn that passed seemed to bring the .sav file to a bigger size (just like in Medieval) and these new "packets" of data would build upon each other until finally, after enough turns had passed, our (I and my campaign partner's) .sav files were no longer identical. The fix? exchange .sav files via E-mail and replace. Thus, the desync was defeated- but only temporarily. It would come back to haunt us every twenty or thirty turns and we would have to repeat the process.\n\nNBD, I played Shogun with this friend of mine for many hours. We completed several multiplayer campaigns on Legendary (cooperating and surviving) and tried a multitude of factions to mix up our geographical positioning. I wanted more so I reluctantly bought the Fall of the Samurai campaign for both myself and my friend, whom is an adamant boycotter of DLC- fearing that each sale to The Creative Assembly is another encouragement for MORE DLC. I foolishly purchased and gifted him a copy. We went on to play two more Legendary Coop campaigns both for and against the Imperials. Even with the presence of the Westerners, there STILL was no Korea and no China.\n\nI must admit over the years my desire to play SP campaigns has died down, and I've been looking for something to do with friends more than to do with myself. That said, I've played ample SP campaigns for each title, with the exception of Napoleon. I've played ample MP campaigns on Shogun and Rome II, and I've invested hours of effort into attempting the Empire Beta, both LAN and online. As I said earlier I still do Hotseat campaigns with my mates to this day, and we have one rotating right now.\n\nTL;DR\n\nROME II REVIEW:\n\nMy rating: 5/10 MP campaign, 3/10 SP campaign\n\nPROS\n- Decent/good battle AI\n- Armies/Navies more personal/customizable\n- Decent campaign AI\n- IF YOU PAY FOR IT, reasonable unit diversity,\nCONS\n- OVER HALF AVAILABLE FACTIONS ARE DLC. TERRIBLE FACTION DIVERSITY.\n- MORE THAN HALF CAMPAIGNS ARE DLC. INCOMPLETE GAME THROUGH and THROUGH.\n- Non tradable tech tree. Uninteresting tech.\n- No multiple theaters\n- Army units are glued to their generals, unlike previously\n- Battle AI still somewhat reliant on stat handicaps\n- *nonfrequent* Desyncing multiplayer campaign, limited 2 players\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSo, what's my point? Each game had its admirable traits, but the Creative Assembly continues to swing and miss. Gradually they have lost their innovation and they are trying to get away with selling more DLC. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE and honestly quite INSULTING to me that the GREEK STATES are DLC. (Or preorder contents in my case.)\n\nTo be honest, I DO have fun playing Rome II, but I think it is an UNFINISHED product. There are tears in the graphics, many unit animations look mechanical, the load times are substantial, and half the game is DLC. IF none of the game were DLC, I would rate it 9/10 and call it a fantastic game, even if it was at the expense of my ideal Rome II.\n\nSO what would be my ideal Rome II? A blend of traits from each total war.\n\nMedieval II: Hotseat campaign / Unit and faction roster diversity\nEmpire: 3 theater world map / political, systems / gamechanging, tradable tech\nShogun: Good agent system\nRome II: Customizable armies / Dynamic naval application / Good AI / cultural differences\n\nNO FACTIONS DLC. NO CAMPAIGNS DLC. DESYNC FREE MULTIPLAYER CAMPAIGN. HOTSEAT WITH REALTIME PLAYABLE BATTLES.\n\nI have NO reason to believe ATTILA will be anything but a graphical UI revamp, and thus NO REASON to believe the Creative Assembly deserves another dollar of mine. They are selling content that is in every respect UNFINISHED.","March 1, 2015","false","465.7"," 109 of 150 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","109","150","5","2"

A longtime total war fan, I had high hopes for Rome 2.  Unfortunately it was bogged down by poor gameplay and poor optimization.  Even three months later after launch, it's still plagued by poor AI.  The modding community has come together to fix what they can, but even they can only do so much.  It's really sad.  What's more troubling is how much the game developers promised and promoted, leaving content out and selling it as DLC.\n\nI cannot recommend this game at all.  It has its moments where it shines, but just as you're getting in to it, you are let down by performance issues, bugs, or bad AI.\n\nEdit:  Rome 2 Emperor Edtition review\n\nCA updated the game all year, releasing 15 different patches.  Finally, with the Emperor Edition, it's in a playable state instead of a beta.  It's not perfect; there are still some optimization issues and even if you have a high end PC you are going to experience Framerate issues as well as stuttering in certain occasions- like during sieges when units are climing up and down walls/fighting on walls.\n\nThe EE update improved a lot of things, including campaign AI and battle AI, and a slight visual update.  It's worth playing now, but I still wouldn't pay 60 bucks for it.

I spent more hours testing and fine tuning than playing throughout the year.   There were a lot of immersion breaking issues, and there still are a few even now.

I was a huge fan of Rome 1, and I feel this game is inferior to it in almost every way.\n\n1. Graphics: Rome 2 looks very good at high settings. The units on the battle map are fairly detailed, the terrain looks decent and the effects are nice. The campaign map also looks gorgeous.\n\n2. The AI does a fairly good job on the battle maps. They attack in unison, send in their infantry to charge while their light/missile infantry support from behind, they actively send their cavalry around your main force and try to flank you. Overall, well done.\n\nThat's about all the good I have to say about Rome 2 though.\n\n3. The UI during battles. It is completely useless. The game needs a simple, organized UI that lets you easily distinguish between units. The pictures on the unit cards are such that it makes it farily difficult to tell apart different units when clicking on their cards. Also, the current status(es) of the unit flash at the centre of each card in 1-2 second intervals. This means I need to wait up to 5-6 seconds just looking at a specific unit's card to see if they are under enemy missile fire, routing, or whatever. This is competely useless and unacceptable when previous TW games dealt with this much more efficiently.\n\nAlso, the lack of walls and siege equipment. WTF happenned there? One of the most fun battles you could have in Rome 1 was assaulting a huge city with a full army of light/heavy infantry, archers, cavalry, and most importantly, trebuchets. The onagers available in Rome 2 are fairly weak and just not as satisfying to use to wreak havoc in an enemy's city.\n\nAnother big issue is the campaign map province system, which makes it so that only the provincial capitals have large walls. All other settlements are minor, with to walls defending them. This makes it very easy to steamroll the majority of enemy settlements you encounter, and makes the overall campaign much too easy.\n\nSpeaking of the campaign map.... although it does look gorgeous now, much of its openness from previous TW games is gone. Italy especially feels just like a highway connecting 1 settlement to another. This is a problem because the game forces you on a linear path between settlements, rather than letting you do whatever you want.\n\nDiplomacy is still an issue. The AI will propose stupid deals on a regular basis. For example, I would propose a mutually beneficial trade agreement and have it rejected. 5 turns later, I get an offer from that faction for a trade agreement, but they also want 4000 gold. Or I will almost destroy an enemy, and when they have 1 city left they request peace, but also want me to pay 10 000 gold to them for that peace... when I have a full army beside their last city and they have 5 units defending it.\n\nThe AI has some issues on the campaign map as well. There have been numerous times on the campaign map when I am holding a city wih a garrison of 20 units, and I am attacked by armies of 4-8 units, which are of course massacred by my forces. Thankfully, the AI works well on the battle maps.\n\nNaval battles are an exercise in frustration and poorly implemented. You have little incentive to build actual navies, since when you order an army on water, they magically transform into transports. This is very frustrating when you have several enemy ports blockaded, only for them to send a random small force to attack one of your settlement behind the front lines... ♥♥♥♥ing seriously? Those transports will usually be a match for actual navy ships... making navies completely useless in the game.\n\nUnit collision was a big problem in Empire/Napoleon, although I did not find it to be a big issue in Rome 2, despite it using the same engine. The formations are nowhere near as clear/fluid as in Rome 1, but unit-on-unit combat works fairly well. A unit of 60 cavalry charging into a unit of 80-120 light/missile infantry will make short work of them in a few seconds. However, combat between heavy infantry units is a bit of an issue. The units tend to lose formation and congregate into a blob, which kills the immersion and makes it frustrating to try to command units.\n\nLastly, the price. The game is a complete rip-off for $66.50 CAD, especially given the almost $100 of DLCs. The greek states should have been included in the base game, as should have blood/gore. Charging additional money for blood and gore is completely ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (yes, it was for the rating. Well, ♥♥♥♥ your rating). Some DLCs are cool and worth it on their own, but it feels like there was basic content cut from the game just to be sold as DLC, which is unacceptable.\n\nI held off buying Rome 2 for a long time, and after spending a weekend playing it, I refuse to pay CA for this game. Yes, it is quite a fun game, but it could have been so much more, and as a sequel, it ultimately just makes me want to go back and play Rome 1.\n\nWell.... maybe I will buy it, but once it gets to under $15 CAD with all the DLCs. Otherwise, the game is simply not worth it, even at $16.50 + $20 for DLCs.\n\nEdit: I purchased Rome: Total War Gold Edition and started a campaign in the original and in the Barbarian Invasion expansion. Comparing vanilla to vanilla, Rome 1 feels a lot more polished/better done and a lot more immersive. Very happy with the RTW Gold purchase.","February 15, 2015","false","9.7"," 126 of 182 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","126","182","4","6"

For my credentials as a critic, I currently have over 100 hours in game, have beaten a campaign, and im pretty good at it.. Rome 2 feels entirely dumbed down when compared to the previous title, Shogun 2.\n\nThe terrible campaign&battle AI, the lack of unit customization, the lack of general customization, banners, etc and so on.. I would have been more than happy to volunteer my time and test this game for free so that the game could be passable on release, but CA and SEGA didn't feel like quality took a priority to advertising. Lastly, the moderating on their online forums are terrible. They cherrypick what threads do or do not stay, they keep horrendous and troll praisers yet they delete and ban valid criticisms.\n\nThe sporadic moments of greatness, when you’re storming enemy walls or have finally brokered a peace agreement, are swallowed by tedium. With patience, your inner imperialist is satisfied as you skillfully cultivate a sprawling empire. It’s too bad you have to put up with so much to get there. but If you’re a hardcore strategy fan specially TW it’s definitely worth a look, and if you’re new to the genre and have the patience to learn, it’s not a bad place to start, Rome II is a testament to all that is great about PC gaming and should be a must buy for all its followers.\n\nMaybe its not better than first one but definitely its worth to play.. ofcourse worth to play cuz its one of the TW series game.. many people said ROME wasn't  built in a  day so be patience and give another chance to CA to build it again with it new updates. at last i should say Total War: Rome 2 is pure enjoyment. The strengths of the first installments are still there, mostly in the form of the diversity between different factions and armies. The limited amount of armies, freedom in missions and handy execution of 'auto resolve' only add on to this.\n\nIt might not look as great as the images might have you suspect, but it's still an easy recommendation. so prepare yourself for a long and endless road cuz all roads lead to ROME.....\n\n\nWorth to buy...                       8/10","August 29, 2014","true","387.5"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","16"

What this means is ROME II no longer has fatal bugs, crashes, humorously rendered faces, poorly designed building trees, poorly designed tech trees, or painful wait times between turns.  The bugs are gone, the polish is there, it is safe to say this is a completed game.\n\nThis might be too long for people, so I'll put my final thoughts here and then if you wish you can read the justification for them below:\n\nRome 2 is more of a management game than a strategy game.  There are very few strategic descisions to be made in this game after 30 turns into a campaign.  You simply build buildings, train troops, give movement orders, and upgrade generals because if you don't the game gives you a pop up telling you what you forgot to do.  There's a shameful lack of interesting battles to be fought, and it hardly matters what buildings you choose to upgrade or build, and it certainly doesn't matter what general traits you choose.  So you click the buttons to get the pop ups to go away, and eventually you start wondering why you started the game up in the first place, because there's no game to be had here.\n\nI'll start with the Campaign.\n\nThe map is pretty, but a pain to navigate when your empire is large, as the camera does not zoom out enough on the main screen, forcing you to go into 'strategic mode' and double click and have the game zip the camera over there.  Despite there being several views of the map: the normal camera, the strategic map, and the diplomatic map (the latter of the two having options to change different overlays) there is still no good way to get a picture of what is going on in your empire.  The Strategic map will show you the position of your armies and enemy armies, but it doesn't tell you how big the armies are, or how much movement they have left.  So when you see an enemy flag in your territory, you still have to zoom your camera over there to see if its a full army or one of the small, threatless stacks the AI likes to create.\n\nOn the campaign you will develope your cities and move your armies.  The UI for these functions is minimalistic with lots of tool tips that pop up.  This allows you to get a good look at the graphics, and a poor look at what the buildings do and what affects are on your armies and generals.  To compare two different buildings you have to hover over one, wait for the tool tip, memorize the stats then hover over another, wait for the tool tip and mentaly compare the stats of the first option.  There is no side by side view, or a list of effects or anything.  This leaves you mousing back and forth frequently trying to pick which building you want.  The buildings themselves often offer small percentage bonuses to one type of income (cultural for example) and cost food.  Thus one must balance their food and food-demanding buildings appropriately.  This is an ok mechanic.  It's not great, but it's something to break up the monotony or the linear upgrades of other Total War titles.  However once you have a large empire, it is very easy to lose interest in min-maxing your buildings, because you end up conquering so many cities so quickly that you always have food and you always have money, so balancing the economy and food tends to go away at a certain size.  The technology tree feels rather pointless and linear.  It provides either a flat bonus to troops (like upkeep, movement speed, or combat effectiveness) and access to buildings which allow higher teir troops to be trained.  This mechanic is hollow.  It primarily serves to gateway what troops are available at what times of the game, because the flat bonuses are small and inconsequential.  Some of the religious buildings will increase your research rate by a small amount, but the technology tree still fees shallow and arbitrary.  In Rome 1 units were gated by buildings, and occasionally (in the case of Roman legionaries) the date.  This functioned better, and was more transparent, which allowed for better planning.\n\nI like the feature of generals and armies leveling up, but they get too many bonuses and they seem so small and unnoticeable.  This leaves me clicking one at random and not really caring, similar to buildings.\n\nOther aspects of the campaign map are simmilar enough to the other Total Wars that I can't expect anything more or less from them.\n\n\nOn to the battles.\n\nBattles are pretty.  There's plenty of nice effects that let you see your army of antiquity on the battlefield in high fidelity.  However, due to the nature of Total War AI (which is SLIGHTLY improved in Rome 2) the battles are boring.  As long as you line your men up to face the enemy properly and prevent any sad attempts the AI makes at flanking you, you'll probably win.  This is a problem because the battles are supposed to be the best part.  That's where they spent all the money, right?  Right?\n\nThe unit variety is nice, and I could complain about the way pikemen don't really feel like pikemen, and that the difference between heavy cav and light cav is very minimal, but there's no point, because it takes a special kind of idiot to lose to a Total War AI.  I haven't played much multiplayer, I presume the battles are decently interesting when they're both controlled by a human.\n\n\nOver-all.\n\nThere's a mysterious and unfortunate paradox to the Total War series.  If you are playing correctly on the strategy map, you would make sure you have the highest chance to win a battle as you possibly could.  This means that most of the battles you fight you will have overwhelming odds and you can auto resolve them with 95% of your army remaining.  Fighting it out would be boring, and you probably wouldn't save that many casualties commanding yourself so what's the point?  This means that there's a small 20-30 turn window at the start of a game where you actually fight the battles because you only have one or two armies and you need to put them in 'risky' situations.  And since in a fair fight you will always defeat the AI you win those risky situations.  But once you're large enough you tend not to fight battles, and just auto resolve as you blob over the entire map.  Which leads me to the short sampler from the top of the page.","October 13, 2014","false","252.7"," 201 of 306 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","201","306","5","12"

Been streamlined to hell to cater to a larger audiance, which destroyed the essence on which the title thrived in it's previous games.\n\nNext too that, the game only becomes decent IF next to having spent 60 bucks on basically a broken game on release, you pay an other 100 bucks to gain all DLC.\n\nI somewhat like the improvements on the campaign map, but hate it at the same time. You can't even build wooden walls for your smaller settlements. On the other hand, your forced to specialize towns, which gives them all their own stratigic value, something that was missing in previous Total War games.\n\nAI is horrible, and I mean a step backwards from Shogun's AI, as in, will walk into 3 units of phalanx head on never attempt to flank bad....\n\nO did I mention Phalanxes where broke on release and could be slaughtered by peasants ? Yes heavily armored troops, some of the heaviest in the world and amongst the most discplined, could be slaughtered by peasants....\n\nBattles feel rushed and because units break like crazy, grand tactics are out of the window, it's all about bring heavier units then your enemy.\n\nIn fact, it's become more of a economy simulator (and before they patched the building tree's a horrible on at that).\n\nAnd after 2 years, all they done is stream line the game some more and add back functions we had in every total war game, like fire at will and hold ground (yes you are reading this right, that was NOT added in release).\n\nI've only gotten around to write my review now because i'm so utterly sickend by the game for which I was waiting forever.\n\nIf they updated the orginal Romes graphics and released that for 60 bucks I would have been more satisfied.\n\nEven the basic path finding on the campaign map is broke. If you move a army that would be faster embarking into ships and then sailing over and landing, prepare for the path finding to screw up and take your army 4 additional turns over land.\n\nAnd then there is unit collision, which wasn't there in Release, which basically lead to major mosh pits, when battle where at the time won by formations and discpline. It was just a laugh. Now they have fixed it by forcing units to stay in formation and everything, but it's obvious it's not something the actual engine itself does. So basically the game is running on a engine that is not suited for the game at all. Yet ever since Empire they stubornly hold onto this engine, and with Shogun they got away with it because they polished it so well you didn't notice it. But F me Creative, get the hint already! Either update your engine to support it or pick a better suited engine!\n\nWe want our realistic like combat, Total War is picked because of that, if we want Arcade combat, we have a 100 games that do a better job then Total War will, stop trying to cater to people who shouldn't be touching this game to begin with, all you do is drive away the people who do love these types of games.\n\n3/10 I do not recommand you buy this unless it's on a sale and you have to pay less then 10 bucks. It's not worth more and you better get some free DLC's with it.\n\nAlso, don't try and criticize them on their own official forums, all honest criticism is basically disregarded and removed within a heartbeat.","April 19, 2015","false","485.0"," 141 of 212 people (67%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","67","141","212","8","6"

Instead of being able to view the core pieces of information on the campaign map, I have to painstakingly click myself through too many menues to unveal the correct information.\n- The Politics system is annoying, boring and therefore dispensable. It has no purpose. It is not connected to other important game mechanics.\n- One of the most annoying things are revolts. If you expand too fast, 60% of your battles are fighting revolts of your own citizens, instead of fighting other interesting cultures.\n- The armies do not need any supplies other than gold\n\nAltogether I prefer Empire Total War or the old Rome Total War much more than Rome 2. It feels like there were five different departments who had to create one part of the game (i. e. politics, city management, battles) and it got assembled afterwards. The result is a game that does not fit together in its parts. Some game mechanics are unbearingly and overproportionally time consuming compared to their importance as a main fun generator. Some mechanics are not legitimately connected to others, or do not have a connection at all.\n\n1/10 I am done with fighting revolts, Alexandria shall stay Egyptian","November 28, 2015","false","52.3"," 57 of 76 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","57","76","5","1"

To start, while previous iterations of the game occasionally grew stale without mods, the vanilla games were still engrossing enough to be worth playing on their own; sadly, this is no longer the case here, and in fact vanilla seems broken, requiring mods to even function properly. Second, while the game is indisputably gorgeous, it seems like something of an unwieldy beast, bringing my computer to a crawl even on the campaign map, and lasting an eternity between turns. But perhaps one aspect I found deeply underwhelming was the household management: the new system is pared down even from Shogun 2's rather barebones set-up, and it's a far cry from the original Rome or Medieval 2.\n\nAdmittedly, this has never been the core part of the game, but it was a seemingly small aspect that could do wonders for immersion and replayability, not to mention the inherent fun in roleplaying. But in an age of Crusader Kings 2, this even more rudimentary roleplaying aspect is just striking, and just sapped what little interest I could muster in the game. In fact, this is perhaps the first time I really regret purchasing a game on Steam. Hopefully, the game will improve, but it's disappointing that in this day and age we should have to settle for "eventually playable" even when paying upwards of $60 for AAA games, when other companies are putting out quality products out of the gate for 2/3 the price. At this point, I would not recommend the game at all, maybe not even on sale.","November 25, 2013","false","38.9"," 103 of 152 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","103","152","0","0"

Game was complete and very very very stable and almost bug free. Now like the person above said, WE ARE THE TESTERS and we PAY THEM TO TEST THEIR game. I wish this CRAP can stop. But its the users fault because they (me included) starting to pay for all these DLC's and take the crap.\n\nIn my defence if i bought a DLC or expansion i expected whole new content like new races or new weapons or stuff but on major scale change so that you can really say this is a change and this DLC worth it.\n\nThese days we get DLC's with content i expected in my opinion to have been part of the game in the FIRST PLACE.\n\nFor example, Star Craft 2, now we have to buy the DLC's or so called expansions just so that we can play the 2nd race in game (Zerg) and the third expansion coming to play the 3rd race. In the past you got games where you could play all races in single player, each having their own story, cutscenes etc. BUT NO!!!! We have to now buy it as DLC and everyone just throw money at them and now its become the trend, the norm. This is BSHT. Unless people stop throwing money at all these developers and start demanding full games again, then this will never change.\n\nAt least CD Project Red tried by taking a step in the right direction, we got a huge game (The Witcher 3) and they giving us 16 Free DLC's for the game, not PAYING but FREE. This is stuff that should have been in game in first place and they are adding it and giving for free BUT.... we are still trapped in this huge DLC or Expansion (whatever you want to call this) nightware where we are paying for stuff that should have been in the game in the first place to make the game COMPLETE.\n\nNever had this 10-20 years ago.\n\nIts a pity how we let them do this to us and gaming just a money making scheme and they always thinking what else can we do to SQUEEZE more money out of the SUCKERS.\n\nTotal War sadly went the same route and they are doing it even more to us now, 4 DLC's with stuff that should have been in the game. I am a BIG Total War fan, no, no, no...let me say... I WAS a big fan. I am also fed up with all these DLC's and trying to milk us for everything we have and then get content that should have been in the game in the first place.\n\nIts time WE put DOWN our FOOT and say NO MORE!!!!\n\nIf we do not start a REVOLUTION regarding this then it will get WORSE and WORSE. Its time we take the power back and say NO MORE!!! Its time we get FULL games again!!!\n\nThis is SERIOUS people (gamers), we allowed this and now we need to STOP this!!! Hurt them where it hurts the most.

I have spend many hours on Rome II and yet I still keep coming back for more. Whether it be to try a new faction, a different early game strategy, change up my research priorities, focus more on naval prowess rather than raw manpower, empower trade over combat as a continent-spanning empire or mix up my tactics in the battles themselves.\nThe Total War games are packed with content, like the unique scenario battles that represent a key conflict in history, narrative campaigns and tutorial campaigns that each require a few hours or more of your time at the very least while presenting a mostly distinct experience, many entirely separate factions each with their own various traits at both a regional and cultural level, and the grand campaigns.\n\nEach of these is a massive undertaking and has almost endless permutations for the path to total victory, dependent on any number of the factors mentioned above. You can even use the skirmish battle system to try out all different tactics and unit combinations from any of the numerous factions present in the game against a battle AI that you can freely adapt to your tastes in terms of difficulty. Lastly, Rome II offers an expansive suite of multiplayer options to back up its gargantuan single-player offerings, allowing you to play challenging battles against your friends or compete for global domination through the usual turn-based campaign system, even if the multiplayer isn't as functional as I would like! I have put many hours in every single Total War game and each new entry is both fresh enough and packed with quality to easily justify that kind of investment time and again - truly, this is a franchise that knows how to eat up the small hours of the day. If ever you needed a game to kill time in while trying out multiple different approaches to victory, allowing you to succeed either through making friends or destroying enemies in equal measure, then Rome II has been tailor made to match your desires.","April 13","true","215.8"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","40","49","0","0"

My dissapointment is great but ultimately my review comes down to this:\n\nIt's boring and lifeless and that's the worst thing I could possibly say about any game. The 100+ hours I put in were in an effort to find the fun. I didn't succeed, but it did lead me to re-buy Medieval II and pick up Shogun II for $8 during a sale. I know I'll find the fun by rolling back the clock.\n\nAvoid this game if you're a total war fan.

So when word came round about Rome II, I leapt onto the hype-wagon and held on.  Every preview I pored over, and my interest in the classical time period renewed in full.  Preordered the game and pre-loaded it as soon as I could.\n\nThen the release happened.  And my love met a grisly demise.\n\nIt should be common knowledge by now, if you've read any of the other reviews, what happened on launch day.  Players with Godzilla-grade monster rigs like Attila16 noticed troubles running the game on Day 1.  Rome II was unplayable.  It was horrendous.\n\nI contend it is absolutely unforgiveable what Creative Assembly did here.  We were promised even better graphics than the "pre-alpha" models we saw the summer before; launch visuals were nowhere nearly close to that.  I don't know how they took the solid engine from Shogun 2 and botched it beyond belief a game later.  Within a month after release, DLC was announced.  DLC!!  And the game was still struggling with ruinous bugs and whatnot!  And the faction packs?  Yeah, those were in the game already; CA just turns them "on" for the player once you've paid for them.  And after that?  Boom: new campaign.  Courtesy of another $15 at the time, of course.\n\nI essentially stopped playing by the end of 2013.  I write this review as a plea and a warning.  A plea, because I do not want you to buy this game, like I naively did.  Creative Assembly lied to us.  The result of their "work" is this unfathomable drivel.  I don't care how much better it's gotten over the months; it should've run this smoothly back in September 2013.  It was utterly dishonest to release such a travesty as was done here.  The warning, to never preorder a game again.  I don't care how much you love a franchise; I've been burned too many times to trust any developer.  Wait for some time after the release.  Read/watch a review or four.  Determine for yourself how much the game will be worth to you.  Don't preorder for a better deal; wait and purchase a better game.\n\nTL;DR: Please don't buy this game.  It will only encourage developers and publishers like these to release half-finished garbage and reap the positive feedback months later as they patch it after the damage is already done.","November 27, 2014","false","78.8"," 62 of 86 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","62","86","3","2"

"It has its moments.''' ''It's competent''.  You see, I was searching to express the good parts of Rome 2 and I' can't quite reach the words ''It's awesome, get it now'' , like I would about most other Total War titles. That must mean that I'm mixed about Rome 2 and after some pondering, I don't think I'll recommend it to my friends.\n\nRome 2 is in itself a solidly designed strategy and if it weren't for the other titles in the series, I'd probably like it more. It certainly has a few things going for it:\n\nIt's different and modernised enough so that you don't feel like it's the same as its predecessors, the battles are mostly entertaining, modern graphics, and there are some nice design additions:\n\nThey've introduced a system where armies level up and gain traits, even though they need to stock up on new recruits they retain their "unit tradition". A good addition that mimics the way real life legions retained their own unit's traditions, stories, habits and in-jokes over time. Case in point: Legio IX Hispana, "The Ninth" , about which a few novels and films where made.\n\nAgents and generals matter a lot now and you can level them up in different ways, which makes you pay much more attention to individuals.\n\nSome design decisions are a bit wonky: they've done away with the family tree, which removes immersion from your lineage. The political system is good in theory but fairly annoying in practice, everyone hates you anyway. You now have a limit to the number of your armies which takes away a lot of the fun of managing your empire. The building system is convoluted and ultimately not engaging.\n\nUltimately, my biggest gripe with R2 is that I feel it lacks in flair and immersion.  The little things add up, from the interface, the music and the unit cards and limited rosters, to the fact that it all feels 'game-y', from the weird build&tech trees to the general abilities and the all-too-many unit stats. There's no real passion for the ancient era flowing from R2, it could just as easily be a Heroes title or some other decent strategy game.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it's just... the other Total Wars are better, so why play this one?","June 22, 2015","false","20.3"," 57 of 78 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","57","78","2","0"

That's all. Units don't collide realistically, they run at each other and then clank to a halt all at the exact same time, all reacting to orders, changing direction in the exact same way all at the exact same time. They are not human. Soldier-to-soldier interaction is done only via a set animation, so there is no flexibility in the combat, it is decided by stats alone and because it is just one-on-one, advantages in numbers cannot be used to full effect.\n\nMusic: Makes me cringe, doesn't play most of the time and actually sucks life out of the game.

DLC:s....... they cut out alot of parts of the game and sold them as DLC:s, which made me extremely disappointed and angry. This is one of the largest disappointments out of everything I'm about to bring up. Us, Total war fans see this as a "F*ck you, we don't care about you. We just want money."\n\n2. "Wrath of Sparta" DLC: When I played as Sparta I noticed a few things... the military building gives minus public order. Pretty f*cking stupid. On the battlefield I noticed that some of the troops say something like this "Don't be scared men". Which is pretty wierd since all men in the spartan society (not slaves) were trained since birth, and were renouned for their bravery -_-'. Details like this are very important for me and surely for other people aswell.\n\n3. The politics system: It's insanely bad. You have no emotional connection to your generals. Since there is no family tree or anything, and you can just replace them instantly if they die.\n\n4. Mods: I really didn't enjoy the game without using mods. There are factions that have insanely bad and small rosters. Which led me to install unit mods to have a larger variety.\n\nI have a really good computer and I run all graphics on max. And I was extremely disappointed in the results, which led me to also install graphical enhancement mods.\nThere are many other mods that I have but you see the point here... without them, it's pretty bad.\n\n5. Bugs and glitches: After years of patching I still come across major bugs, for exampel. During a battle an enemy boat of soldiers literely went through across the whole battlefield to land on the other side of the map. This bug was seen in launch and obviously is still seen today.\n\nSoldiers are spacing out sometimes and act very wierd.\n\nFinal words: Even tho the game have all these problems/issues, I still enjoy it (mods being a huge part of it). In the beggining tho, I forced myself to play the game. I'm a Total War fan, and I've been that for many many years.\n\nWarhammer is the next game that Creative Assembly will release, and if these things still appear in that game (especially the DLC b*llshit) I will literely will go insane, probably will be the last game from them I'll buy if it continues. It has already been shown that they are doing the exact same thing in Warhammer, they have ripped out Chaos Warriors out of the game and is a pre-order bonus (DLC). I'm extremely tierd of this b*llshit and they better stop before they lose all their fans. I won't buy Warhammer until this DLC b*llshit stops, you shouldn't either.\n\nAnyways, to the actual subject. These are a few points of issues out of a hundred that I've brought up.\n\nFor those who aren't Total War fans, I really don't see you enjoying this game at all. And I DO NOT recommend this game, not worth the money. Not even close.\n\nThe vanilla game is not worth playing at all but with mods it's okay. Still not acceptable.","October 31, 2015","false","476.8"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","42","56","2","3"

One half is filled with potential, graphical accomplishments and a sense of community through the additions in the Workshop.\n\nThe other half is a mess of bugs, poor balance and a total lack of attachment to a campaign. Bugs on release and balance issues have been part of Total War since the days of RTW1, but not after 20 patches and certainly not with the level of game-breaking effects present even nearly a year later after I pre-ordered it.\n\nThe attachment is where it really hurts for me as a long time fan. Shogun Total War II made you feel attached to every member of your clan, they each gained skills and traits that made them feel genuinely unique. Rome Total War 1 was arguably the epitome of this though, with sprawling family trees and a real sense that you were taking a Roman family (or an enemy of Rome) through one of the greatest eras of history. Now most turns feel like a slog, destroying factions is commonplace thanks to the huge number of seperate areas, and characters all end up with similar traits (If everyone in my faction likes Romans then it's not really a very unique feeling to each person).\n\nSiege bugs are the worst I've seen in an RTS game, missile units sometimes don't fire and melee battles sometimes just look like two blobs fighting eachother. Naval Battles, while initially absolutely awful, have been improved but still feel totally void of character or any real sense of strategy. Mods solve some of these issues, but the game appears to irrepairable without the right combination of mods that match the the patch your at.\n\nIn short, I cannot recommend it. It's easily the worst Total War game ever made and has essentially killed any chance of me pre-ordering a Creative Assembly game again\n\nEDIT: There have been several complaints on this review about my amount of playtime and how I should change my opinion based on it. I didn't spent £40 on a game to abandon it and just leave it with a bad review. I came back patch after patch, including the most recent Emperor Edition, not because I would tell someone to buy it but because I want to be ABLE to. Creative Assembly are a company I support, still support, but unless reviewers like myself make it very clear that this game was not an acceptable release and still isn't mistakes will be repeated in newer titles.\n\nComplaints about my playtime will be deleted from the review.","June 26, 2014","false","463.2"," 534 of 891 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","534","891","0","23"

Well, it looks nice I guess, but promised way too much. If you're coming to this from Rome: Total War then you'll notice a lot that is different and not so much in a good way. The game is literally still riddled with game breaking bugs 1 year from release, even after hefty patching that seems to have just covered up an otherwise sinking boat. AI that doesn't know how to siege your settlements, the game engine itself struggling to cope with 2 full armies on the field at once resulting in a perfect FPS on your part but the units in-game moving in a stuttering motion being just one bug that's been there from release and has yet to be fixed, The huge battles take such a toll on your system even though on paper your machine should be able to smash this game, leaving you feeling bitter for the price you've had to pay for a series that keeps letting it's fans down but lying to them to get their money again.\nThere are a few interesting features like on the campaign map how you have to deal with dilemma's in your empire, I like that, makes you feel like your involved with you populace on a personal level. There is a large unit variety which is nice but after a certain point, if you're not playing as Rome, your empires tech just stops which has also been a problem in previous Total War titles, for example. Rome has a meagre power in your game but they can still happen upon the tech for their heavily armoured and well trained legions yet if you're playing as another faction then a few upgrades later is all you're going to get.\nThere is too much that is wrong with this game and I've found that contradicting something the Creative Assembly has said gets you insta-hate from their fanboys which is a constant on the forums or blocked entirely from saying anything constructive about the game at all. With a mix of bad customer service, bare-faced lying to their customers and combined with a broken game, this Total War game isn't worth your attention unless it's on sale for a very low price.","October 26, 2014","false","206.4"," 70 of 104 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","70","104","0","0"

I do recommned the game, it's fun, has a very large and extensive campaign with many factions to play as. However, the game has been stripped of some features previous in older Total War games such as the family tree. The game in general moves far too fast to get attached to your commanders, like in previous games, and they die a lot without any real notice.\n\nThe buildings and campaign planning is now at an absolute minimum, with a new provincial system that works well when you are  a large nation, but suffers from a lack of depth when you are a small nation. The politcs screen does nothing, and can be ignored completely, providing nothing in terms of gameplay to the world.\n\nSeasons have been re-introduced because the community cried out for it, however the game moves at one turn per year, so seasons don't fit the timescale and don't play much effect.\n\nThe graphics are top notch. Both on campaign and on battles, however my PC is very capable at running on Ultra, but only around an average of 30fps. Optimization is extremly poor for entry level PCs and the graphical fidelity falls extremely quick when you lower the settings.\n\nBattles are fun to play, they look impressive and work well in general. It's taken 12 major updates to get to the stage where I am comfortable at recommending this to someone, but as with most TotalWar games, the AI is terrible. On the campaign it's fairly smart, however diplomacy is almost non existant. You can't trade money effectivley, you can't gift regions or demand them you cannot bribe armies or settlements, you cannot co-ordinate with any certainty your nation and another to attack a particualr spot or nation.\n\nOn land, battles work pretty well. The AI behaves appropriately and in some cases smartly. This is where the game is best. Open terrain battles with large armies clashing in the fields. In large towns, it's more cumbersome as the enemy try to navigate streets quite poorly. In full on walled cities, the game falls flat on it's face. The AI pathfinding is terrible and they will pretty much throw armies at one spot until they break through, which they never will.\n\nThe multiplayer scene is dead. For a game that's sold over 1m copies, you'd be lucky to find 20 active games.\n\nCo-op campaigns are brilliant. This is because AI isn't an issue and you can play against someone for the entire game. You just need someone willing to play with you for a full campaign.\n\nThat's all. Like I said, half price at best. The game's DLC packs offer nothing great, more factions and more of the same. this is probably the worst Total War game to date. But it's still a Total War game, if you need to play battles where 1000's of troops clash together, this is your game. If you need good strategy, in depth campaigns or history, I'd look to Civilization V, Crusader Kings II, Total War: Shogun II or Europa Universalis IV\n\nIf you're a hardcore Total War fan who wants to boycott the series, no point, they've sold 1m+ games. It's by far their most successful game to date. Just don't pre-order the next one.","May 19, 2014","true","045.0"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","28","33","0","1"

It was released with severe bugs; three months (not to mention seven patches) later I still experience occasional, unexplainable crashes.

Oh, and the Blood & Gore setting -- a standard option in most games -- is sold as DLC. As if a $60 dollar game shouldn't have that option by default.\n\nOn the flip side, the game is eminently moddable, so if you're open to experimentation you could search for mods that make the game entertaining for you. Or create those mods yourself! And hey, despite all its rough edges, I still find Rome 2 sometimes engrossing, and you might too if you're a fan of large-scale strategy...

The game in principle should be good - an apparent forty percent increase in budget from previous total wars and a brilliant precedence led me to pre purchase the game, and at first I was pleased. However after about only ten hours I began to realise there were several problems that I was experiecing (I wont go into detail), but they included a dodgy public order system, that seemed to make it counter productive to get high tier buildings, an extremely useless politics part, Generals that came and went without any real family or attatchment, Im sure you can find a long list of its problems online.\n\nThis is not why I hate Rome 2.  The campaign I enjoyed (despite the problems) and I liked the battles (despite the worst Ai i have  ever seen in a total war). I hate Rome 2 because of the continued corner cutting and obvious fan based exploitation. The most obvious of this ROME 2 Emperor edition - which (and correct me if Im wrong) promised to contain all the content and DLCs so far and (again correct me if Im wrong) but all Rome 2 owners were promised a free upgrade - which technically means that they owe us all the DLCs, but nevermind that.\n\nI loved Rome 1 because they gave you so much content without paying too much extra. Emperor edition brings almost no content to the game (unlike rome 1 barbarian invasion), has no extra units, and even though I played my first campaign as Eygpt it gave me the pregame cinematic for the Rome faction (there is only currently one type of pregame cinematic in the game). Rome 2 augustus campaign is extremely half-arsed, bringing no more units to the game (unlike barbarian invasion in rome 1 where there were tons of different units. Although Rome 2 was already money - grabbing (SEE THE £44 worth of Dlc!?!?!) This free lc of augustus campaign is just a rearanged map and factions of Rome 2 (currently) with even less effort than there was in the origional game.","September 19, 2014","false","289.5"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","41","57","0","8"

The AI didn't function, the graphics options and optimization were a joke, many major and critical campaign map features were almost as non-functioning as the unit pathing in battles....\nBut that was then.\n\nCreative Assembly has applied patch after patch for the last few months, added a fair amount of Free-LC, and an expansion that adds seasonal graphics. In addition, CA has released the official mod tools and construction kit....meaning the Steam Workshop for Rome II is loaded with goodies now.\n\nI highly recommend the "Divide et Impera" mod for the ultimate experience, as well as the "G.E.M" or "Graphical Enhancements Mod". Divide et Imperia (or DeI) adds a terrific new array of historically accurate units to nearly every faction, new skills/traits for generals and agents, improved textures on all existing units, 4 turns per year with spring/summer/fall/winter seasonal effects (graphical and technical, like agriculture and happiness), and much more to fix the battles and unit morale/defense/offense. G.E.M. removes the absolutely useless and irritating Instagram Filters that the game used, and it adds MSAA to replace the blurry and hideous FXAA that the game comes with.\n\nSo what is Rome II now? Is it a worthy sequel to Rome I?  Well, no. The soundtrack, the lack of family trees, the lackluster siege battles, and the many other little glitches and missing features still bog down the game.  But it's absolutely worth a purchase.  With a little modding it's up there (in my opinion) with Shogun 2 and Medieval 2. Definitely better than Empire, but it can't quite reach the polish and wholesome experiences that Rome 1 and Napoleon still provide.","January 23, 2014","true","577.7"," 451 of 767 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","451","767","0","6"

Exploitive DLC aside, the game itself is actually pretty lacking. Play any Total War title that came out before this and you'll know what I mean - Rome 2 just isn't satisfying like other total war games. You may be thinking "Well that's just a matter of opinion" and you're right, it is, but my second major gripe with this game is that even with all the DLCs, there just aren't as many features as previous games. For example: you can no longer order ships to go forward indefinitely, you have to give them specific orders on where to go, making naval battles more of a hassle. The in-battle HUD has been made big and clunky, and you'll find yourself disabling it until you need it because it takes up half the screen, making land battles a hassle. Even with the bigger, clunkier HUD, the buttons to order your men forward or have them rotate or increase file have all been removed from the HUD. There are still keyboard keys for these functions, but it seems that if CA wanted to make the HUD bigger, they should add more functions to it, too. Everything in this game has been grouped into folders. Researching a tech, which used to be an easy two click process, now is much more difficult because the techs are grouped into 6 different categories, all on different pages. One thing that is extremely annoying for me is CA has removed the ability to gift provinces. This was already removed in Shogun 2, but I just assumed it was for historical accuracy. Gone are the days when you could make the map look how you wanted it, now the game forces you to have one play style - that of world domination. Even the graphics seem to be lacking compared to previous games. Even Empire, which is very old now, looked prettier than this. I don't know what these screenshots are on the store page, but they look nothing like the actual game. I could go on and on about what I don't like in this game, but quite simple it isn't worth it. If you have a big budget then I might could recommend this, but even at a 75% discount it's not worth the $35 for the game and all its DLCs.\n\nWhich is why I tried to return it, but I had it too long. )-:","January 1","false","21.9"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","32","43","0","0"

It took a year till it got shaped and being in a state it should been have back in Sept. 2013.\n\nIn Steam Store it says: scalable experience regardless your rig\nCitating CA: We had +40% more budget; AI dev said: "We never invested more into AI development"; CA promised "sieges battles of immersive scale".\n\n\nHonestly this game was failure on release.  The pictures we can see on Steam and in the trailers are in-game graphics but very much edited. I am not saying this to beat an already dead horse but because we customers have been betrayed like Varus.\n\n\nSome people say the game is now absolutely fine but honestly CA is not able to fix this game completely because of the warcape engine which was never intended for Rome 2 like battles as it was made for line infantry battles. So if you care to directly compare the battle mechanics like Dr. Sane did on Youtube you will notice differences.\n\nAt the end of the day the problems this game has due the engine (core issues) and which have been discussed to death in reviews and forums either way STILL exist, despite the good efforts of the Emperor Edition and more than 14 major patches!\n\nAlso watch out this game is available legit for about 29 € so do not trust the prices on Steam. People in Russia and Britain pay a lot less than us even without discounts. Check out {LINK REMOVED}onlinekeystore.com to get legit and well priced keys for this game.\n\nHowever, saying the game is not worth a penny is a bit exaggerated meanwhile.\n\nBy today (Sept. 2014) I rate the game with a 8/10 (original rating September 2013 4/10)\n\n-1 point for the severe AI issues, which propably cannot even get patched.\n-1 point for performance and LoD issues, which propably cannot even get patched.\n-1 point for the streamlined functionality compared to previous TW games\n-1 point for the athmosphere and music (music mods available by now)\n-1 point for the battle mechanics compared to Rome 1 / Medival 2\n+1 point for the good mods available\n+1 points for the Emperor Edition release and changes\n+1 for continued support\n\nI still do not recommend to buy this game full priced!

Although after playing the others this will feel like an empty experience.\n\nWaited till the game was playable till I write this review.  Over the last 12 months the game has gone from being unplayable due to graphics bugs, crashes and fps problems after a year of patches they now have a game thats unplayable as you get bored and think of other things you'd rather be doing instead (like sorting socks).\n\nI've played the total war series since Shogun and have thousands of hours of play on the series especially the original Rome (I Love classical civilisations) and Medieval 1+2 even a couple of hundred hours on Empire.  This game looked like the game I was waiting for fantastic graphics, complex gameplay and a lasting challenge (even more so with DLC) how wrong I was.\n\nComparing it to the original Rome (Which I still play) from ten years ago is difficult as the new version lacks so much content, gameplay and complexity that made the original so much fun.  The new one has better graphics (just lacking visible unit upgrades, terrible unit cards and cohesion in battle).  Whats lost is summed up well here(not by me):\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1qwj7a/everything_rome_1_had_that_rome_2_doesnt/\n\nOver all its like they thought lets take the strategy game they've been waiting 10 years for (Rome with modern graphics) and cut all the top level strategy out (politics, dynasties etc) take off the factions people will want to play (all were playable in Rome1) to sell for premium DLC's.

While big and pretty, the overland map is not very functional, and serves mostly as a vehicle for moving your ten million agents that has to be moved every turn. Of course you also move armies here, and this is where the biggest disappointment of the game comes out.\nThe AI is horrible in almost every single way. While it has gotten better, the AI still has no real idea what to do in sieges other than the extremely weird magic torches.\nCombat between armies end up being large blops of men, something that was introduced only in this latest of the series.\n\nAll in all, I can only recommen people interested in the series to get Rome: Total War 1, Medieval 2 or Shogun 2 - all three are much better games with more features and better strategic combat.","December 29, 2013","false","414.9"," 61 of 97 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","61","97","0","6"

I have a quadcore and SSD and plenty of available memory and loading was still too time consuming.\n\nGraphics were cute, but prettier graphics do not make game play better.  The game play was too directed, not enough free form game play.\n\nThe agent system is irritating.  A single agent can stop an entire legion in its tracks and the legion can do NOTHING to stop it.  The % chance of success of any agent action seems to not reflect the action mission accomplishment at all.\n\nIn battle labeling and unit information identifiers are frusterating.  In battle unit maneuver is sluggish.  The visibility of other units is inconsistent.  Invading a city of any size plainly favors the computer player because of the awkward in battle user interface.\n\nDiplomacy is bad comedy.  Even when I have intentionally given the AI a deal that clearly favors them, they often decline.  The AI may start a war or initiate a battle against a clearly superior force for no discernable reason.  The labels describing how reliable a civilization is or their tendency does not actually mean that much.  The most defensive, honorable, factions still are likely to stab your civilization in the back.  Curious. . .\n\nSure, I have finished the game 4 or 5 times.  I don't feel like I have really won though because it took SO long and the in battle engagements were not much fun.  I ended up simulating almost every battle on my last two campaign wins because I was sick of waiting.\n\nThis game has nice graphics, but the overall game experience is unbalanced, tedious, and too directed.

Here is the thing: Overall, now is a solid game, on single player only( at least for me and my buddy).\n\nAlmost 2 years after release how does the game fare? Well, the thing is, this game fails because of what sorrounded and still surrounds it,  from a design and gameplay perspective.\n\nAllow me to elaborate, if you will: this game was HYPED to no end. Several live action videos and developer diaries, ALL of it to deliver an inevitably weak game.  From a  design perspective, many strange decisions: unit cards, UI, retainers, generals, agents, faction bonuses, turns per year are just some features that seem like a downgrade from previous Total War games, namely the previous title, Shogun 2. Gameplay wise,  the battles suffer a lot, and is in this aspect that  most critics arise from. Unit collision is still an issue, cavalry still has absolute no way to it,  kill moves are quite franckly a poor way to make units interact with each other ( even tough recently they appropriated the animation of projectile hit to kill other soldiers without using the kill move mechanic, which is just lazy).\n\nFaction wise, there is almost no variety between them, (amazing that even though Shogun 2 has the exact same unit models and soldiers for every clan they still manage to give more variety and personallity than Rome 2's many factions).  Seriously, aside from character skins and faction banners, there is no difference in gameplay between Rome and Carthage.\n\nThat is not to say that the game is a disaster, it is not. It has some good ideas, like province happiness, and graphics wise it is impressive, it is wonderful to see the ancient world more vivid than ever.\n\nWhat ultimately makes this game a thumbs down for me is the preposterous practices on the part of the publisher and the developer. Sorry, no ammount of justification will ever make up for a broken game at launch ( don't believe me? watch a certain " angry"youtuber review of this game); day one DLC  also is unnaceptable under any circunstance, for it means it is content that was created along with the main game and cut and sold later to boost their profits ( I'm looking at you greek states DLC ( bought it later for 1 buck during sale) );\n\nAlso currently, at the time of this review, we are at PATCH 17! This is absolutely outrageous, I ask you fellow gamer, how can a game need 17 PATCHES to be in a working state? Simple, an uttlerly broken game. Even if the state has improved (  sfter almost 2 years.... yay....), the point is THIS SHOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTABLE. The thing is, the moment they released this game is when they decided it was good enough for sale, and this clearly wasn't the case, so, a Shameful display.\n\nIn the end, it is painfull, because this could easily have  been the greatest Total War game ever made, a comeback to the glory days of Rome 1, now it is a reminder on how not to launch a total war game.\n\nP.S. The most amazing thing, recently I played with my friend ( fellow Total War fanatic), a Fall of the Samurai coop campaign, over 60 hours  of campaign and not a SINGLE issue, NO desyncs and smooth framerate. We tried to play a Rome 2 grand Campaign recently, and it crashed on turn 2...\n\n\n","September 4, 2015","false","343.6"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","31","44","0","0"

Except for the battles are not just dice roles, you have the opportunity to raise armies, control real-time offensive and defensive battle formations, hire spies, dignitaries and companions to subjugate, assassinate, and cause all other forms of havoc to your enemy/neighbors.\n\nSeveral key elements exist within any game that very import to a lot of gamers such as immersion, re-playability, user friendly interfaces, uniqueness, and the list can keep going and going depending upon the player and their personal interests. I will review several facets of the game as they are important to me and stood out fairly immediately.\n\nThe empire I decided to start playing first was Sparta, cheese I know, but 300 is an awesome movie and I just had to choose them first.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nStability\nFor my system, the game is not stable at all. Rome II is default set to high graphics and causes immediate issues. I have also found these same issues (freezing, graphical glitches, black screen of death, ect) were discovered with several different "standard" computer systems. Several known bugs have already populated the technical support forums with issues from integrated Intel chip-sets and graphics cards. My aging gaming laptop was barely able to keep up and setting the graphics down to low helped out tremendously. At the obvious sacrifice of visual stimulation. The game ended up looking like Medieval: Total War from 2001. Even with the game set to low, the performance was still very sluggish however playable.\n\nAfter starting the game up for the first time and loading the tutorial, I didn't make it very far past that. After annihilating my enemy in a very fashionable noob manner, the screen turned black instead of populating a victory window. Needless to say I ended up closing the program and "failing" my first mission. After doing a little bit of homework, this is also a known error with game as of day one.\n\nImmersion\nImmersion within Room II is non-existent comparatively speaking. There is not any avatar/character customizations, renaming, history, background story, nothing. The generals and statesmen are empty husks of simple skills with predefined names in order to keep track of your armies. When they died in battle or of old age, it doesn't mean anything to the player because there is literally no connection. When you are required to replace the generals you eventually don't even look at the names on the newly populated list. You just randomly click and go because there isn't any difference. Where did these people come from? Who knows? Who cares? They just in charge of my entire army now! They are also identified as royal versus non-royal families. What does that mean to you? Nothing, not that I have discovered thus far anyway.\n\nAnother calamity within Rome II that erodes any element of immersion for the game is waiting for your turn. I am not opposed to turn-based strategy games, honestly I love them however I do have a significant problem with the amount of time Rome II takes to get back to your empire. By the time my empire had scouted or obtain city-states from one part of Europe to the Middle East, I had to watch and wait for ALL of the empires to take their turn. This may not sound that bad, but it is, because you will wait on average 10+ minutes for all of the other empires to move their armies and all other units. I was able to get up and do some chores, make my kids lunch, watch some TV for a moment and come back to my computer and it still was not my turn! By this time I was ready to just turn the game off because I was losing interest. Not to mention during some stages of your empire's development, you may only have a minute or two worth of improvements and/or movements to make. Thus, most of your game play hours are spent watching little computer army symbols skip around a map.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nDumb. I could leave the review at that because there really isn't any other way of describing the AI, but I'll try to elaborate. I have slaughtered over 1,000s of enemy hoards, outnumbered 3 to 1, just by using simple military strategies at the loss of only a few hundred of my forces. These same battles were originally calculated as being a defeat or victory with severe losses, at times predicting over 60% my forces will die. I am not an epic military strategist and I only had the difficulty set to normal however I find it hard to believe I was able to turn the tables of battle by approximately 50% in my favor (You'll always have some battle losses regardless of what you do).\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nEntertainment Value\nRegardless of all the problems annotated above the game is still highly addictive and fun to play. I am honestly surprised at the fact I have played 25 hours of this game within first 5 days of release, but the game is honestly hard to put down. There is nothing better than scaling the walls of my enemy and slaughtering the archers as they try to flee or running the enemy down with my cavalry as they retreat from the battlefield; out flanked and tasting my Spartan spears!\n\nPotential\nThere is a lot of room for improvement which can be added in order to make it more timely and enjoyable for the average player. Such as adding a save option on the battle maps for starters, would be nice considering you have an hour to finish the battle. Sometimes the enemy just doesn't want to walk into your trap and these things take time. The fast forward time function only feels like x1.5.\n\nBrief closing comment: Good game with a lot of enjoyable features and addicting battles however covered in bugs and empty handed immersion. Not worth $60 but if you really want to try the game out wait for steam to put it on sale because it is going to happen.","December 5, 2013","false","71.8"," 33 of 48 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","33","48","0","0"

Of course it ran normally, but you could not do one thing without there being a bug to hinder you.\nThe AI: bugged.\nAll kinds of naval combat: bugged.\nThe real time combat gameplay: bugged.\n\nIn other words, the game was crap and I cant believe I paid the full price for such an unfinished game.\n\n\nSecond is due to the fact that Rome Total war I was in my opinion way better than this version (and I'm saying that even though the comp I had at the time wasnt powerful enough to run it and the game didnt stop crashing)\n\n\nThird  is because the DLC that come for this game should:\n1: be free for those who got the pre ordered edition who had no idea how bad the game would be.\n2; be free for all others because AM I THE ONLY ONE TO THINK THAT BLOOD AND GORE SHOULD BE IN THE GAME AT LAUNCH ??\n\nI simply cannot forgive companies who think they can release a game as bad as that and STILL try to make extra profit out of it. Don't you get it? All sega obviously cares about is money. They dont give a damn about us the players (after all, we've already bought the game) and I sometimes wonder if the updates really change anything at all.\n\nMy final rating is a 5.5/10. I highly recommend you wait for this game to be at least at -50% (which is under 20 pounds) before buying it.","February 11, 2014","false","67.4"," 66 of 107 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","66","107","0","19"

You can have the largest empire and a 1 city enemy still gets to max out their army stacks with no repurcussions. Battle AI is equally awful with skirmishers no skirmishing, everyone getting willingly ganked by horsemen and aggressive troops. Micromanagement at every level makes battles a chore and not fun.

I pre-ordered this game because I love Shogun 2 and Fall of the Samurai (I bought shogun 2 on sale and then pre-ordered FotS).  I played Rome 2 for around 50 hours after it released.  I then stopped because I couldn't accept the numerous design flaws and "glitches"/problems with the game.  My friend and I started a coop campaign just a few weeks ago after a 7 month hiatus from the game.  There have been numerous patches, and guess what?  The game is still in its unfinished state!  The ONLY thing that the patches fixed were the de-sync coop campaign issues, or at least my friend and I aren't experiencing them now.  Now I will get to the review.\n\nPROS/Improvements over Shogun 2:\n\n+ The game has rather nice battle maps for towns in siege battles (they look like a real town that you want to defend).\n+ There is a great variety of different buildings to construct in your cities.  Each building has a branching tree of slightly     different types.\n+ The random events are somewhat cool and definitely a fun/funny diversion.  For example: One time an event told me that our crops weren't growing as they should, and that I should offer something to the Gods to help us.  I chose to sacrifice a white bull and the Gods blessed me and my people.  The events are random-ish and provide a good laugh.\n+ There is a GREAT variety of units in the game.  There are war dogs, roman Triarii, Spartan Hoplites, Etrsucan Hoplites, War Elephants, siege ballistas, slingers, many different ships, Parthian horse archers, and even barbarian warriors who don't need to wear a shirt in the cold winter.  (And many, many more units).\n+ Armies now have "traditions" that are basically rank-ups for them.  When an army dies, you can reinstate their legacy and have a new army with the old traditions/upgrades.\n+ Multiple cities form a "Province" now.  Once you hold an entire province, you can put an edict into effect that provides bonuses.\n+ Huge map.  The map is very large and goes from Great Britain to the Middle East.\n\nCONS/ Steps backward (anti-improvements)/questionable design choices:\n\n- The ai cannot siege for ****.  Every time the ai sieges one of cities they fail miserably, even when my chances of victory are slim to none.  The ai will send their 4 siege ladders (hopefully together) without any other units to support them.  They try to set up the ladders but just end up spinning in circles at my walls.  Eventually, they might set up a ladder or 2, but only the unit who set it up will try to climb it.  After that, the ai will send one unit or 2 at a time to one of your gates to throw torches at it.  The ai fails and ends up losing all his units because he sends them to gate one at time or 2 at a time.  PATHETIC.\n- The ai will still do questionable moves on the campaign map sometimes.  A good example would be where the ai leaves his cities unprotected while an enemy army closes in, and when a small enemy army effectively "suicides" by attacking a city of yours that has WAY more units than he has.\n- There is no family tree.  You have a faction with faction members, but you have no idea who they really "are."  There are no fathers and no sons.\n- What are gravitas?\n- The battle mechanics are just ugly.  When a melee unit attacks another one, they just form a moshpit with only the ones in the front having a chance to attack.  If you zoom in, you will notice that most of the units are just having a staring contest.  The men eventually strike the enemies or die, but those animations looked forced and not very cool.\n- In my opinion, the battles are just not all that fun.  When I played shogun 2 I have fun and see myself saying "that was awesome" so many times.  When I play campaign in Rome 2, I try to avoid the battles altogether by auto-resolving because of the fact that I just don't find them fun to play.\n- When you have ships that need to land on the beach in a battle, there are many sections of the beaches that you can't land on.  The beach looks the same everywhere, except you can't land on some big random zones.  Makes no sense.\n- One whole year per turn.  Every turn is a year, so expect all the generals and agents that you like to die quickly.\n- The UI during battles takes up half of the screen.\n\nSo, those are the PROS and CONS in my opinion.  I have played over 80 hours, and will play more coop campaign with my friend mainly because he likes it more than I do.  Coop campaign is fun-like i guess.  It is fun to see the game's numerous flaws in action.  I will admit that coop campaign makes the experience somewhat fun and bearable.  I do like the campaign map for the most part, but I hate the battles.  The ai can't siege even when he has hundreds of more men than you have.  And in battles on the open field (where the ai doesn't usually **** up) I just don't have much fun.  So, battles aside, the game is not half bad; but not half good either because there aren't any family trees.  But sadly, battles do matter A LOT in total war games.\n\nUltimately, I cannot recommend this game.  If you want a total war game, get Shogun 2 and/or Fall of the Samurai, they are really, legitimately fun.  And yes, the ai will beat you in a siege if they have a good advantage.  If coop campaign didn't exist, I wouldn't even still be touching this game.  Sadly, my friend only has rome 2 right now.  When Shogun goes on sale, we'll play that.  Rome 2 = Utter Disappointment.","May 4, 2014","false","155.5"," 95 of 160 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","95","160","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065186325/recommended/214950/","76561198065186325","Sgt. Lillard","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065186325/","36 products in account","I was introduced to Total War only last year, and since then I have played Medievil 2, Shogun 2, Attila, and Rome 2.  Of those, I have to say Rome 2 is by far the worst.  While it can still be fun, the game is just a sloppy mess that tries it's best to suck the enjoyment out of itself.\n\nWe'll start with the good things.  The time period is fantastic.  This is Rome during the height of their power, not the shadow of glory that is present in Attila.  You can re-enact the war against Carthage, you can play as the ancient Greeks or Egpyt if you like, or even try to reclaim Alexander the Great's empire as one of the successor kingdoms.  As I said, the time period is great and the map size is awesome.  I love how at the beginning of the campaign there are dozens of different factions trying to fight for control of the ancient world.  And the game is still a Total War game, with all of the positive things that that entails.\n\nNow onto the negative.  The game is a broken, complicated mess.  Mechanics don't work as they should.  Fortify stance giving you +50% reinforcement range?  No, it doesn't.  Units tend to blob up despite the use of a "formation attack" toggle.  Morale mechanics are broken, I've had units at over 50% break and route even though they were "winning decisively."  Your general is useless, he will always be one of the first troops to fall if his unit is attacked no matter what angle it's from.  Sometimes units won't even follow orders.  I had a unit of Roman Cavalry that I was telling to attack a unit of enemy slingers.  Despite the fact that they registered the order, they stopped thirty feet from the slingers and stood there.  No matter how many times I told them to attack they just sat there until they finally routed from losses garnered by standing in the line of fire for ten minutes.\n\nOther battlefield mechanics make no sense.  How are slingers dropping my Super Heavy Spear Infantry locked in a shield wall from the front?  Then there is the truly broken:  Pikes.  You know your game has severe balance issues when multiplayer rooms are usually tagged with "no pikes allowed" because Pikeman > EVERYTHING.  Without a doubt.  I once had a unit of heavy swordsmen in a shield wall acting as an anvil for a unit of light pikemen.  I then hit those pikes from behind with a unit of heavy melee cavalry.  Both of my units routed without the pikemen taking any significant losses.\n\nThe campaign map isn't much better.  Buildings are overly complicated with their bonuses and negatives, turning empire-building into a game of hardcore addition and subtraction.  Capturing territories is extremely slow because the public order system is designed to bog you down.  Generals will pick up negative traits for idling in cities after only one turn.  The "political intrigue" system is boring, time consuming, and doesn't really have any effect on the rest of the campaign.  The entire game just feels...Broken.  This isn't even mentioning that half of the playable factions are locked behind a paywall.  So you charge me $50 for a broken game that isn't even close to the whole package, then charge me an additional $35 to unlock the rest?  What a joke.\n\nWhat makes this worse is shortly after I played this I bought Attila.  Attila is everything that Rome 2 should have been, which is even more upsetting because rather than fix the broken piece of junk they charged everyone good money for, they went ahead and just made another game that actually worked and said, "Sorry guys if you bought the crap that was Rome 2,  go ahead and buy Attila instead!  It works!"  Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on CA, I understand that ♥♥♥♥ happens sometimes..And since Rome 2 they've really stepped up their game.  Look at how TW: Warhammer is shaping up!  Not to mention that they're walking everyone through that development every step of the way!  I am, however, hating on everything that happened to make Rome 2 the piece of ♥♥♥♥ that it is today.  This is the black stain on your record, CA, and you owe everyone by making sure that this fiasco never happens again.\n\nIn short, don't play this ♥♥♥♥.  Either get Attila or Warhammer instead, or go with one of their older titles.  Those actually work.\n\nOVERALL:  4/10","April 30","false","118.1"," 66 of 108 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","66","108","4","0"

Creative Assembly claims it had a 40% bigger budget for their latest game Rome II, meanwhile  I'm dumbfounded as to where that money was allocated.On second thought, No.  That money was clearly spent on false advertising; they promised us working seige battles and a full year and then some of patching and I still can't play this interactive movie for more then 30 minutes (just enough time to finally hit my first actual battle due to ridiculous loading times.) Once I reach battle it all comes back to me... the reason why I left in th first place. No ammount of modding or patching can make this a game. If I could give this game a score less then 0 I would because on every single level of gameplayablity they simply dropped the ball. If you wanted a game where you have to auto resolve all battles just to get through the game with a shred of sanity then you should buy crusader kings 2 or something (anything) else. What else can I say about this waste of time and money these people call a game. Well the music was claimed to be orchestrally epic and what did we get? Some interns and a lute, at least that's what it sounds like to me. This along with the voice acting or lack thereof. they shortened general speeches to about a 10 second coomment which you will miss every time. The graphics, ugh. This is the one place that could have given the game a score of 1 in my eyes, but even this part was just too complex for these teenage flash programmers. The videos they showed up had fake antialiasing which never showed up in the game and with every patch those idiots at CA claim they optimize their dung of a game, when they simply lower the graphics LOD (level of detail.) As of now the game looks worse then shogun 2 their subsequent total war game, even with mods. CA broke my heart releasing this "game" and I'm never giving them another penny in this lifetime at least...

If you send in two group vs one enemy, you might win the fight.\nIn TW Arena the swordsman vs spearman, allways the swords wins. But not here. Swordsman is a bad choice.\n\nSea battle is a complete mess. You give orders to your fleet and they "try" to do it. Order a boarding action, and hope the best they will do it. Sometimes, I don't know, they are just watching the waves, and the falling arrows/stones. Or maybe they are seasick?\nIn melee your sword wielding mercenaries mostly loose against ranged infantary, at a boarding action!\nMy flagship just sails away when its ordered to attack an enemy ship. If I give him order. If he just have to stay and get arrowshower, he is doing his job nicly.\nBuy a couple of siege warship, and hope that, you will stop the enemy before they reach you. Or you will loose. On the bright side: if you were try to use normal units, they will lose.\n\nCity management is a joke now. It have some nice aspect, but its just difficult to understand (first), plan, and get any intresting benefit out of it. Money, maybe a few new unit. Done. Dull.\n\nThere is a political system in the game, but I havn't found any intresting interaction.\n\nThere is no depth in diplomatic interactions.

Deal with it).\n-The AI is (after patch 8) avrage for a total war game, although sieges still need work.\n-The units are ballanced, wich I find very rewarding: Because they are so balanced, you know that it is your superior tactics that won the battle.\n-The graphics are truly stunning, even though i pay on a high/very high combo.

Take this into account when buying this game.\n- Historical battles are fun to play, but arn't as memorable as in earlier Total War games.\n- Multiplayer campain is broken at the moment (mostly desync), but normal multiplayer is fully playable, challanging and fun. Sadly, the avatar conquest does not make a comback in this game.\n- The DLCs that are present should have been included in the game from launch, not a pay-to-play option.\n\nAll in all, I think this Total War is good. not the best, but far from the worst\n\nFinal verdict: 7.5/10\n\nSigned etc. etc.\n\nShadow","December 20, 2013","true","012.9"," 234 of 412 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","234","412","0","27"

I suppose from the beginning like most stories start. The game was brilliant, couldn’t go wrong. Though many people have complained about it in the past I can only find the odd few things.\n\n\nThe advisor is horrid and deserves to be killed but oh well, we all get over him at some point, mainly when we turn him off but that's just me. “This is a shameful display!” that's to you advisor.\n\n\nThe graphics are also horrid in comparison to Attila Total War and the FPS are terrible. They really need to be improved.\n\n\nCA really needs to start adding blood and gore to the basic price and stop money grabbing, three weeks and three DLC’s with every game now, seriously, stop or do it more subtly like GTA and and Assassins Creed do.\n\n\nThe campaign map is good, you can control your family tree through adoption / marriage / assassination  / and securing loyalty , make allies, client states / satrapies and even rename settlements! You get much more free reign over your armies. The graphics are really best here and depending on which campaign you want you get a large or small map. The DLC’s provide smaller maps but have more cities in and smaller provinces so you don’t do it all to quickly. The Grand Campaign has the biggest map and is probably the biggest in Total War history.\n\n\nThe modding community is great, I have a few on my friends list and they certainly help out. You will also find them great people to work with if you make guides like I do. Though they can be busy they also make personal request mods (some do not all) and the grand overhaul mods would certainly help out those in a rut.\n\n\nThe battles are great but not as good as Attila, prepare for war as you face off against the ever expanding factions that you never heard off before or should die out early on but never do. Or perhaps face off against your enemies as Rome and destroy Carthage which is defeated early on due to Africans and Spanish… Well at least you can be Egypt… And get crushed by the Seleucid Empire… Or Parthia and experiences Horse archers and massively underpowered Cataphracts… Hey at least we have Britain’s Iceni tribe that gets invaded twenty four seven by its much stronger and superior other British tribes… Perhaps just stick with Sparta and be limited on what you can select as the cappo for certain units is ridiculously small. Argh screw it.\nWell don’t worry as all these problems can easily be overlooked as you change to Attila or quit Total War in anger, either way you will find Rome II an interesting buy that will either make you hate yourself and CA or the happiest man in Brooklyn. For those who don’t know Brooklyn is that place in America where people often try to avoid.","February 28, 2014","true","423.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

The launch 'bugs' are everywhere just do a google. while they glossed over a few of the glaring flaws they forgot to entirely redo the campaign mechanics to even a standard of any of the last games.

The only factions that they put effort into was Rome, the Selucids, Carthage maybe, Parthia, and thats about it. The barbarian factions, the Iceni, Arverni, Suebi, were identical to every other faction they bordered, even their high tier troops, so that when you reach late game, a random tribe that played no historical importance becomes ruler of Germany, Gaul, Britania, etc.  They didn't add Arverni troops that dual wiedled battleaxes(as badass as that would be) or cool eastern Parthian infantry, like dismounted Parthian cav, or master swords men, or ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE EVERY FACTION INTERESTING OR BALANCED.

I feel THAT cheated.\nWhy?\nPromotionally CA did its best to lure us to buy a game with high expectations: "40% higher budget", "it will look much better at launch, this is pre-alpha footage", "our goal is to make Rome 2 the best Total War game yet"\nWe trusted them and gave them money for a product we have not seen.\nWhat did we get?\n\nI'll state my positives so to be fair:\n- Cinematic camera\n- Addition of naval warfare (it is unplayable but is the best in the series :P)\n- Depth and number of factions\n\nTo the important stuff:\n\nBattles:\n- Super awkward formations and unit movement\n- No realistic collision between clashing units. Ironically Rome 1 had more realism than its successor\n- Animation seems idiotic and fake\n- Individual persons interact only 1v1, so if even if they are outnumbered one unit can survive waves after waves of enemies\n- When charging, units awkwardly stop and lose momentum instantly (and this applies to the entire unit)\n- Music is unspirational and does not change with battle conditions\n- Control areas in open fields (whaaat??). Instead of playing the enemy and thinking strategically, you run to a controll area, stay for a little time and you win the battle\n- Battles are super short\n- AI is stupid beyond imagination\n- Buggy and laggy as hell\n- Naval battles are even more broken and buggy\n- UI makes no sense, all units look exactly the same\n- One spot for unit condition, so you lose precious time to understand all the status ailments of a unit e.g. fighiting, taking fire, firing etc.\n- and much more\n\nCampaign:\n- AI is even more stupid than that in battles\n- Diplomacy is broken with out any explanation of what led to an ally's/enemy's particular decision. AI decisions are spontaneous\n- Very easy even in high difficulty level\n- Building system makes no sense\n- Loooooong wait turns\n- and much more\n\nOverall, Rome 2 is a beta game. It is blunt, boring and uninspirational\nI attribute the fiasco to awful project management, but I can only speculate\nI understand CA tried to mend it with continious patching, but a game so flawed in its core is unfixable no matter how you try to improve specific features. Also, when you talk about patching at launch, means you should not have launched in the first place.","May 21","false","45.7"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","23","34","2","0"

This is probably the most dissapointing title I have played in the last twenty years.  This is the product of a once passionate and aspirational studio which has now sunk under it's own weight of success and has lost all perspective on what makes a game work at it's core.  At launch the game was simply utterly broken.  The tutorials didn't work, the end turns took minutes, the graphics didn't work, the lag and stutter was incredible, the AI was non-existent, the mechanics weren't thought through.  What's more, CA added some awful features (random capture points on the battlefield, magic spells and 1 turn per year anyone?) and removed many staples of the series that made the game so great (seasons, family tree, map trading).\n\nEight full months on, some of this has been amended but the game today is still a shell of a TW title and doesn't really cut the mustard.  Seasons have finally been introduced and the game has been optimised so that it actually runs properly but it's just not enough to overcome all of the weaknesses of Rome 2.  Siege battles are absolutely redundant, the AI is simply non-functioning.  Unit rosters are limited and generic, unit formations do not work properly and battlefield ai remains poor.  Naval battles are a joke and sieges are an embarassment.  The portraits in the game look abysmal.  Because the number of armies is restricted and troops are so easy to afford, every army on the map will be a full stack, which is stupid.  Public order and slaves are game systems that do not work properly and detract from the game.  Generals and agents die far too quickly.  Terrain has no effect in battle (ie archers will have the same range from the bottom of a hill as at the top).  Armies can magically cross oceans without the need for building boats.  The time it takes armies/navies to traverse the map is stupid (4 years to sail around Italy etc).  You can't build walls or roads to improve a settlement.  You can't control public order in your settlemets unless you own the entire province, which makes no sense.  The civil war is a poorly executed idea which is unrealistic and stupid (armies just spawn out of nowhere in their thouands).  The politics system is just tacked on as an afterthought, it's barely worth being there.  The technology research is uninspiring and boring.  The traits system for armies/generals is similarly unexciting and tedious.  The game engine itself doesn't seem to be able to handle the simulation of armed combat (which is a bit of a problem).\n\nAll in all, this is an absolute trainwreck of a game where the developers obviously looked back over the elements of the TW series that made the games so successful and then decided to jettison anything that was worth a damn and replace it with the worst features they could imagine.  There is no hope this game will ever be in a decent state and meanwhile CA pump out the DLCs to be lapped up by devoted fanboys digging the grave of PC gaming by accepting a game made with such low standards.","April 2, 2014","false","170.2"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","2"

These weekends have interpolated twelve patch cycles, eight months, two console releases, a government shutdown, a winter olympics, a plane disappearance, and — of course — this review itself. I wanted to succeed. After a decade of storming châteaux forts, firing by line, and charging samurai uphill against spearwalls, I wanted to return to the legionary maniple. But I couldn't love Rome II.\n\nAm I being melodramatic? Well, okay, I'm being melodramatic.\n\nBugs don't factor into the equation. This game is just poorly designed. Political, economic, and military concerns don't relate properly, the first being especially loosely coupled. The lifespan of characters has dramatically decreased while the level of management characters require has doubled. The campaign copies the CKII civil war system and Civ V victory system without apparent understanding of what made those systems work in their games. And battle movement and killing speeds have accelerated to the point where tactics — and more importantly, tension — are virtually impossible.\n\nI won't waste my time detailing the many sins of this game. Three Move's Ahead's "Odi et... Odi" episode does that, as does Reynold Sanity's "Why Rome 2 Failed" series, if you prefer a brasher, more offensive, and (for those who dislike the game) more cathartic approach.\n\nRome 2 has spectacle, and that's why many people love it.

Napoleon Total war is what got me into the franchise because of the era . Shogun II and FoTs were decent products even though there were 1 billion DLCs for them . I didn't buy this game,but won it from a tournament - still I wish I didn't(Rome II) . It was a pure waste of time even though I had sometimes fun when playing with friends and trolling on online battles . I enjoyed playing campaigns but it is just not enough . Also so many factions are missing - this means that there will be around 20 DLCs for this game . The campaign now is kinda ...good...but BORING . In my opinion there is not enough big variety of units in the game . Battles are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too ♥♥♥♥ing fast , even in shogun II they did not finish their fights for 20 seconds ... WTF ,CA? Terrain doesn't matter that much at all and this reminds me of the long games on Napoleon where you actually had to be ♥♥♥♥ing careful . Even in shogun II thanks to the units with muskets and the bow cav the games could be longer . Rome I and Medieval II's online battles were decent and fun . In my opinion Napoleon total war is the most balanced game in the aspect of online battles . I will give you an example - http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/487812320661884097/EFBF821C573C5256897E22B3965E8124DEBAD948/   . For those who don't know - UK is the strongest nation at shooting in the game . I rushed , even kited when needed ,pushed on one of the flanks,then ran back and let my friend to make the final blow . The game was more than 30 minutes and our opponents were very good and it was all pure fun . As you can see I am using Austria which is one of the worst nations at shooting,their skirmishers are weak,their infantry is no match in melee,even in shooting vs the UK ones. The only thing I have that is better are the Ulans . Even though as you can see - if you think you can beat your opponent no matter what factions you are using . And can you do that in Rome II ? You simply CANNOT unless you are facing a brand new guy who doesn't know what people ''usually'' bring . What the ♥♥♥♥ , CA? Are you serious ? Why did you even release this game - why don't you 'freeze' it until you ♥♥♥♥ing fix it ? Better don't waste your money on this crap and play the other titles (except Empire which is still broken as ♥♥♥♥ :D) and have fun . Oh ,wait a minute ... I forgot ....CA WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ HAPPENED WITH THE SOUNDTRACKS? They were so epic in Rome I , M2 and Shogun II ... NTW and ETW didn't have the need of those because the muskets were some kind of a music ... But ,seriously ,when I listen to these soundtracks I get even more bored except 1 or 2 ... I can listen to the Rome I soundtracks all day anyday . G ♥♥♥♥ing G CA ,you failed,I hope that you will fix this ''game'' if we can call it a game soon enough .

Whatever way you look at it, Rome 2 is a disappointment. From the farcical siege battles reminiscent of a mexican stand-off, to the bugged out textures, terrrible performance and awful battle mechanics, Rome 2 really pushes the boat out when it comes to how much a game can be screwed up.\n\nTo put this in perspective, I have accumulated over 200 hours on Rome 2. During that time I had been forced to restart a Rome Campaign 7 times due to "post release game patching". At least 3/4 of my total game time has been campaign restarts, testing bugs, testing performance and most recently, attempting to create a series of videos with a friend that show up all the broken battle mechanics that limit the game so much....basically, I have spent most of my time trying to get this game to function and trying to squeeze blood from the proverbial stone in trying to eek out a sense of enjoyment in this title.\n\nOf course, all this would be acceptable if there were any form of communication from CA, or any intents to fix these problems. Unforunately anybody who highlights these issues is removed from the main forums and treated like dirt.\n\nCustomers unite, do not buy CA's next title. Certainly do not preorder it.

But anyway if you do decide to read this and give Rome a shot, make sure you look around on the community mods workshop - just discovering them myself properly (They are fantastic)\nCA should employ these guys instead of the $40k a year "experts" ***","October 3, 2014","false","82.8"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

You can draw on the map, which actually substantially improves the gameplay during a co-op game. For example, while your partner fights a battle, you can draw a nice ♥♥♥♥ cumming on the enemy. Or you can actually use it as it was intended, in the way of advising  your partner on avenues of attack or enemy troops he might not see. Either way, 10/10 feature, Creative Assembly. It's just a shame the other parts of the game were awful, unfinished and to this day, those features remain unpolished, unfinished, and awful. And months later, the game still remains unfinished and awful, and instead of POLISHING and ADDING features, you make unit packs and add in paid factions that should've been included in the base game. Great job, Creative Assembly. I won't be buying a new total war game until 5 months after release, and even then, from the state of this game, I don't think i'll ever buy a new total war game.\nIn retrospect: While the release was awful, unfinished, and ultimately unplayable garbage, I will say, CA, you surprised me with the Emperor Edition.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/okRaleyn/recommended/214950/","okRaleyn","Raleyn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/okRaleyn/","52 products in account","Total War™: Rome II - Emperor Edition is a historical turn based RTS game based in.. Ancient Rome. I thoroughly enjoy playing this game, and perhaps this review will persuade you to try it out and, hopefully, enjoy it.\n\nRome II is a sequel to the famous Rome: Total War game. It's a part of one of the largest historical strategy game franchises to date. Total War games are similar to the classic board games Risk and Axis and Allies. So if you enjoy playing those games you should feel right at home here. It is true that as of late the Total War franchise has the infamous reputation of rushed releases. However, I find that this game, after over two years of being out, has come a long way. It may still not be what people expected at release, but it's definitely come a long way.\n\nThere are mainly two parts of this game, the Grand Campaign and the multiplayer. The Grand Campaign lets you play as multiple types of factions ranging from Rome to barbarian to all sorts of others. Each faction has unique units that all have their strongpoints and weaknesses. When you start off you can come from a small state with a handful of soldiers, to domination of the ancient world. As you make your way from the bottom to the top, you'll have to deal with foreign threats. These threats can range from other nations declaring war on yours all the way to widespread hunger across entire provinces.\n\nA Grand Campaign completed game can last from a couple of days (Speedrunners) to months of hard work and effort. So you should be able to get a large amount of playtime out of this game, if you like it. Grand Campaign playthroughs may or may not get repetitive based on what you classify as repetitive. In my honest opinion the Campaign can have very rich gameplay that does not involve doing the same boring task over and over. The battles against the AI can become a bit repetitive, but that's only if you exploit their dumb nature.\n\nThe AI in this game is by no means the best out there. But it's definitely improved from the release. The AI can sometimes be incredibly smart and display great ingenuity, but they have a bad habit of running headlong into a pike phalanx. Not to mention misusing artillery, chariots, and elephants on mroe than one occassion. This doesn't mean the Campaign can't be fun against just AI, it's incredibly fun for me at least, especially on Very Hard or Legendary modes.\n\nThe multiplayer. In my eyes this is where Rome II truly shines. The multiplayer is where you can go onto servers or create your own, where you can battle other players with factions of your choosing. This can range from 1v1s all the way up to 4v4s. Connection issues is a common problem among multiplayer games, considering you're playing with people from all around the world. However, the sheer amount of units you can have on one single battlefield when you have multiple factions going against eachother is insane. This can definitely cause major lag and a lot of times people ragequit when it's so bad everythings in slowmotion or the framerate is below 15.\n\nLike I said earlier, each faction has their own unique set of units for their choosing. This makes for very dynamic gameplay especially in multiplayer. No faction is the same. Granted there are very similar factions but they still have their unique ups and downs. With these in mind, you can choose from dozens of factions to find your right playstyle. If it's tanky sword infantry that can still pack a punch, you're in it with Rome. If you like to cripple people with charges, you can go with barbarians or cav heavy factions. If you like to use pikemen to protect valuable skirmishers to pick at enemies from a distance, then you can go greek factions. These are just a handful of examples of how dynamic the multiplayer battle gameplay can be.\n\nYou can also play multiplayer campaigns. This goes for quite the interesting time. Play with your friends as allies or enemies. Multiplayer campaigns can be a lot of fun if you can get your friends to play with you, random people joining isn't really recommended as you probably couldn't play an entire campaign playthrough in one session. One of the biggest problems I have with the multiplayer campaign is the fact that when the other players turn cames around you just have to sit there. For 5 to 10 minutes you just sit there doing absolutely nothing. You can use this time to your advantage by trying to help your friend out with what you two should plan with the help of your trusty paintbrushes, but normally you just sit there. Like a lot of multiplayer games, voicechatting can really help. It might also help make the time it takes for the other player to play his turn go by with a bit more excitement.\n\nThis game has a serious learning curve to it. So if you really want to get into this game and know how to counter things with the right tools, then it may take you a lot of playtime and a lot of watching videos. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for those of you who like to just sit down right away after getting a game and then being good at it in the first 10 hours, then you may be out of luck here. In my opinion the large learning curve just makes for more time to enjoy this game.\n\nThe battles. The battles are probably one of the main reasons why you're looking into this game. With thousands of soldiers at your command you can fight equal amounts, smaller amounts, or overwhelming larger amounts of enemy troops in a dynamic game of intense strategy and timing. You'll have to move your troops around to effectively counter the troops they have in a certain place, make sure you have backups, move those backups in when necessary, and strike at the most opportune moments. Learning all of the stats of every unit is a big help. Knowing the stats will greatly benefit what you know will kill and what you know will not kill an enemy unit with the smallest amount of casualties on your end. You can see why there's such a large learning curve now.\n\nOverall this game is relatively well optimized, for my PC the game runs into a bit of trouble when there are 6,000+ units on the battlefield at once. But to be honest, that much is to be expected. At max graphics I can get a steady 50 FPS in normal battles. On the campaign map I get lower frames, around the 30s or so. So if you want solid frames all around, go with a lower graphical setting and you should be fine.\n\nThis game is very fun, and I recommend it to you as well. Especially if you're a Strategy game fan.\n\nTo Me: 9/10 I love it\n\nTo Strategy fans: 9/10 Definitely look into it\n\nTo Average gamer: 8/10 This game is a lot of fun!","February 10","true","496.7"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SardaTFK/recommended/214950/","SardaTFK","Sarda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SardaTFK/","559 products in account","Just no strategy required at all.\n\nI've been playing the Total War series of games since the original Shogun, I've played them all and never had a problem playing one til Rome 2; the problem comes from armies, their compositions and their tactics.\n\nNow forgetting how worthless this game was on release, I've tried to come back to this game every so many patches to see whats changed, if its better, ect. Everytime I'm bored past caring before even a 1/5 the world is conquered and I forget the game exists and go back to the previous TW's. So what's the main problem? Basically army composition is meaningless. In Shogun 2 if you made a army of a general and 19 katana samurai you'd be screwed, In Napoleon if you went general and 19 line infantry you'd be screwed, In Medieval if you went general and 19 knights you'd be screwed. Here if you go general + 19 of the heaviest melee troops you got with shields its a perfectly legitmate strategy basically only counted by another army of nothing but ultra heavy melee.\n\nEvery Rome game I play it just devolves into me just raising a army, building 19 legionaries and just sending them tword the nearest town. There is zero need to have any seige, auxiliary units, ranged units, ect. Because of this tactics is also meaningless, you assign each of your 19 legionaries to each one of their units and 2 possible things occur, 1. the unit is to fast to be engaged so it's probably a ranged unit in which case who cares; they'll run out of ammo before they kill even 10% of the unit then kamikazi melee or rout. 2. They'll engage in 1:1 melee and die.\n\nIt's like that with everyone. Sparta? Nothing but royal pikeman. German Barbarians? Nothing but nobles. You get your heaviest Infantry and build 1/19 armies. The fact they limit your total armies even reinforces this, because it means you will ALWAYS have the money to be able to afford armies of nothing but these expensive units because you can't spend it on anything, it's like playing Shogun and there's no reason to ever use a Ashigaru-type over a Samurai-type when you have more money then you know what to do with, there you'd still use Ashigaru because you could always just make more armies so cost-diversity still ment something. When you only have so many spots on the field you only want the best of the best or nothing.\n\nOverall. I got nothing, this was my 6th attempt to find anything of value in this game but it just feels like nothing but busy work balancing out towns happiness inbetween rubber stamping clone armies to walk around with impunity taking more and more cities I don't even want but am forced to balance through.","February 15, 2015","false","11.6"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","26","41","0","1"

However, be warned that the base game is bland for the most part. I would highly reccomend using mods, because you will find that this game has a few missing features from its predecessor, Rome I.\n\nAlso, before you buy, you might want to consider a few problems on this game:\n\n1) Compared to Rome I, Rome II's campaign is watered down and has some of the dumbest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you could ever imagine. Remember when I said the game feels bland without mods? Here's why:\n\n-There is a limit to how many armies a faction can have on this game. If you want to increase that limit, you have to conquer a specific number of regions. This really is the dumbest BS you can add to a game like this. The devs lack brain cells and fail to realise that this limit they added is useless and just makes the game dumbed down. You should be able to build as many armies as you want in regards to the state of your economy, just like the older titles. Adding an army limit to all the factions on this game means that you might be fighting less battles than you did in Rome I. The developers were too stupid to realize that if we wanted to fight less battles, we could have just used the auto resolve button just like the previous titles. There's no strategy involved with a limit like this...\n\n-On the campaign map, you can't split armies into smaller groups like you could in the previous titles. This is another incredibly stupid feature that makes the campaign overly simplified. For example, let's say an enemy army containing only 3 units shows up in your territory, and the nearest army you have to counter them contains 20 units. Since this army is so puny and would be destroyed in no time with, say, three of your higher quality units, you'd think it would make more sense to just send in 3 units to counter that army. Well, in this game, you can't do that anymore. You have to move your ENTIRE ARMY if you want to get rid of them, which is a complete waste of time because you could be using the rest of your units for more useful purposes. You simply can't split armies to cover more territory, scout unknown parts of the campaign map, or provide support to another army. You're just commanding completely immobile armies that have had their strategic potential neutered by this ♥♥♥♥ing stupid mechanic.\n\n-Just like armies on the campaign are unable to split up, they are also unable to merge with other armies. This means that if an enemy army containing 20 units, for example, is in your territory, and you have 2 armies that each contain 10 units, you can't merge them into one strong army of 20 units to take on the enemy army. Instead, you'll have to go through the BS of having your two separate armies stuck on two different sections of the battle map, wasting precious time trying to get them where you need them. Once again, the strategic value of this game has been further watered down...\n\n-It is mandatory for every single army to have a general. Now, I don't mind having generals in all of my armies, but it'd be nice if you could have some of them under the command of captains and turn them into generals after a few battles like in Rome I and Medieval II.\n\n-You no longer have the choice to build walls in your settlements. Only a certain number of cities will have walls by default. Once again, the strategic value of this game has been watered down a by the diminished brain cells of the developers.\n\n2) The soundtrack of the base game is your bland, run of the mill dramatic tryhard collection of the works of a composer desperately trying to become the new John Williams. The developers should have kept the composer from Rome I. Thankfully, there is a mod for this game that allows you to use the soundtrack from Rome I itself.\n\n3) Voice acting on this game is ♥♥♥♥. In Rome I, different factions from different parts of the campaign map actually had their own accents, giving them a unique identity. Instead, there are only two accents on this game. Basically, 'civilized' factions like the Romans and Athenians have the same old, plain and boring British accent. 'Barbarian' factions like the Britons and Suebi just sound like a bunch idiots.\n\n4) The Greek City States are a mandatory DLC, so you can forget playing as Sparta or Athens without paying extra money. CA, like your average AAA developer these days, just loves to manipulate its fanbase by locking content on a game and calling it "extra" content.\n\n5) In battles, projectiles fired from archers and slingers don't look deadly and fast at all. The devs came up with the stupid idea of putting tracers on every single projectile thrown. None of them look dangerous at all, and when you zoom in on the unit of soldiers being attacked by arrows or rocks, the sound effects don't sound like any of these projectiles were able to hit anything with a great amount of force.\n\nThe only good things about this game are this:\n\n1) Better graphics.\n2) There are mods.\n\nUse as many mods as you can if you're still reading this review.","June 2","true","110.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","7"

Certain changes aim to make certain game systems less complex. I imagine this was to attact more people to the franchise, but it really ruined the late meta-game of the series. The biggest stand-out from many is how you manage armies. You can't manage an army without a general. Given that you can have a finite amount of generals you are thus stuck with a limited number of armies late game. It forces you to lower the amount of stratgies you can use late game in constrast the other entries in the series. An unfortunate change which waters down the game.

The whole aspect of politics in Rome II has either been dumbed down or removed completely, i usually ignored it until i got the expansion packs which actually changed a lot of the random events and made them far better (even for the grand campaign) but did not give it anything else than that. with 3 campaigns currently there is a lot to Conquer with the original grand campaign as the biggest time sink by far.\n\nBattles : Normal battles on the campaign maps are very enjoyable. the AI will take different approaches depending on your unit composition, if you have the fast siege equipment (rock lobbers) they will try to rush you before their reinforcements arrive instead of getting shelled, while if you have slow ones or even the stationary ones then i have noticed the AI will pull back, wait for all the reinforcements and then attack you in force.\n\nAmbushes: they work pretty much the same way as they always did, they are fun to play and an easy way to eliminate big armies quickly. especially the mechanics when you are being ambushed are very enjoyable (you riding in semi first person view inside the army scouting for the enemies in a semi cut scene that will end when you get attacked). the only problem with ambushes is that the AI NEVER WILL USE THEM, in shogun the AI used Ambush when they found it to be a good tactic while in Rome the only times i have been ambushed is when i am moving my army at 2x speed (automatic ambush by attacking army).\n\nFortification : one of the stances in the game is that you essentially build a small fort (with arrow towers) making it easier to defend key area`s with a smaller force. although i rarely use this myself the AI loves to use this mechanic.\n\nPillage: AI loves this one, will sneak a small army (more often than not a single General) into your area`s and pillage them. will lower your income to 0 and remove quite a lot of happiness per round. if you dont pay attention to this or the Raiding equivalent (boats) you will get a rebellion.\n\nnow to the "Elephant in the room" siege battles : the AI is HORRIBLE for the most part. until the second to last patch the AI would dance around rather than attack your castles in force and defend properly, then they fixed it and i had several VERY enjoyable battles where the AI would siege for several turns and bring quite a lot of siege equipment (rams, towers, Turtles and ladders). but the last patch ruined the AI again and now they rarely build anything (and if they do they will abandon it at the start of the battles), the only thing they will attack with is the standard ladders you automatically get from besieging a capital.\n\nThe patch in question also destroyed the AI of your own troops meaning that they will not follow your orders as you give them and they will not always take the "smart" route but run out of your fortifications to enter them again further down the line. more often than not when i tell them to move somewhere with the Right-Click-Hold command they will decide to do something totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and move somewhere else.\n\nif they refix your AI and the enemy AI then the game will be improved greatly.\n\nCoop: This is my favorite part of the game. i have probably played more co op than single player because i enjoy splitting armies in two and playing battles with a friend. only thing that annoys me mechanically about they way the Coop is built is the lack of possibility of the other player controlling the AI which was possible in shogun. (please bring this back and don't limit it to non allies SEGA !).\n\nyou will desync, you will curse and it is very annoying and time consuming swapping save games to fix something that should be working correctly, the funniest moment i had with this was when i got attacked in a capital and my buddy loaded a different city(which also got attacked that turn but in a later order). essentially he was watching the AI defending one of my towns and i was defending a totally DIFFERENT battle. because we loaded two different battles without problem is weird to me and should have been fixed.\n\nNaval battles : Hate it - Auto resolve 90% of the time.\n\nFactions: Tons of different ones, i found this to be the easiest way to determine game difficulty (Rome - Easy  Barbarians, Medium, Nomads hard, a little rough comparison).\n\ntry one of the Horse Kingdoms on legendary for a challenge :)\n\nAll in all i both love and hate this game, it is definitely worth it, especially if you have someone to play Coop with (random players for campaign in my experience never works out). have some patience with the AI and laugh at their mistakes.\n\nGrab a drink, Grab a friend and conquer the World !","June 27, 2014","true","832.3"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","31","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/214950/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Total war: Rome II is alright I guess.\n\nYou play as the conscience of a single nation while you coerce them into annihilating anyone who had the absolute audacity to be born different than you.  Just like real life. The game revolves around the uprising of the Roman Republic and empire. Of Rome. An ancient nation so unique looking you would swear they fell out of a Forgotten Realms novel.\nAlso, there are a plethora of other nations but they aren't important because their name is not in the title.\n\nWhen the game first came out, it ran as smoothly as my grandfather's chest hair. Which is to say not smoothly at all. I got this game at launch from a underground bum fight first prize, I would have preferred the wedge of cheese. Textures looked like mud, models looked like mud. Strangely enough, mud looked like water. There was also this thing where the A.I was so incompetant that my one year old nefew could have out smarted them in a game of build-a-blocks. It's amazing to see soldiers trained for years break out into a mosh pit as soon as a fight starts like a sweet sixteen at the Kardashians. Though I would admit, the combat animations are neat, especially with the blood and gore mod where you get to watch the Roman elite cut down farmers and city folk with sharp pointy swords.\n\nThe campaign reminded me of my high school years where nobody liked me. It seemed that everyone had it in for poor little Rome, to be perfectly fair though, we do have nicer hats. I would be jelous as well. Diplomacy was practically useless and you could have probably sat in your chair and remembered all of the embarassing moments in your life, like the time you made a mix tape for Kelsey in a misdirected attempt to get her to fall in love with you while waiting for the A.I's turns to end.\n\nSorry, Kelsey. Call me sometime. I've waited for you.\n\nBut that was the past. And you know what they say. Those who don't watch Discovery channel are doomed to repeat discovery channel. Just like Discovery chanel repeats.\n\nWith the Emperor Augustus update, you get a bunch of game fixes as well as a new campaign. The new campaign follows the Second Triumvirate where Rome split quicker than the cool kids at a lame party. You can play as Mark Antony, Pompeii, and a bunch of people who's names aren't nearly as cool.  The game no longer runs like a cripple on gravel roads, and you can now keep your units in formation, though you could probably do that before in the time I stopped playing this game.\nI found myself actually having fun (Which is illegal in some countries, be sure to check your local laws and jurisdictions.) with the Emperor Augustus update.\n\nShould you buy Rome 2? I guess you could, I mean, it's there isn't it? Just push the button. Come on. Do it. I dare you.\n\nI give Creative Assemblies ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child four Tim Allens out of five UERUGH?'s.\n\n","September 22, 2014","true","139.0"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","67","18","27","12","0"

I'll try to sum it up for any casual gamers like myself out there, although I'll ultimately be comparing it to the original. Sorry for that if you two haven't met.\n\nPROS:\n\n--(As of the moment I write this) As playable as any other Total War game I've played (Rome, Medieval II, and Empire). Don't know about the issues other people are talking about.\n--Stunning graphics.\n--Satisfactory sound effects, voice-acting, and soundtrack (in all honesty, doesn't stand out from any other strategy game I have).\n\nCONS:\n\n--The price; if you really, really want it, I'd recommend waiting for another sale.\n--The "fast forward" option during battles is painfully slow and does not appear to be much faster than the normal option of "play"; so, if you're moving an army into position, be prepared for some comparatively long waits.\n--Gameplay mechanics feel a little... "dumbed down," shall we say, compared to the original. I mean, they cut quite a few features I liked from the original (the family tree, the ability to recruit units without a general, no limitation on generals, etc.), and added only a handful of features I do like (the random family events for one, the ability to fight naval battles on the map for another).\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nTotal War: Rome II is a playable and okay RTS, but I believe the graphics are really the only major feature it has in its favor. Honestly, if you're into strategy games, I think you'd be better off just buying / playing the original Total War: Rome. It may not be as visually stunning, but it feels more fluid and, in my opinion, is the better of the two. Plus, you save a handful of cash, and who doesn't like that? :)","February 14, 2014","false","6.7"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","22","35","0","2"

So I waited more weeks for the update, disappointed but still eager to play. Thankfully, CA worked hard to release updates, which happened almost weekely in the start.\n\nSoon I got my Rome II to run on my computer.\n...but that only makred the beginning of my frustrating experience with this game.\n\nI won't go into any details about the specific problems as for they have been extensively covered by many expert reviewers.\nPlus the CAs part on over-promise and under-deliver, I'll leave it to others. It is beating the dead horse at this point.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that besides the countless bugs and flaws in the codes, many aspects of the intentional game design is inferior to that of its more successful older siblings. These flaws will never go away, such as the Civil War, which appears to be getting more and more unreasonable as the patching goes on. The game design cannot be changed at this point.\n\nAgain, CA worked hard to patch the game. They updated weekly, which soon became monthy...\nPlus they gave us free DLCs that opened up a few more factions in the game for the players to command.\n\nAnd about 3~4 months after the release, the game finally became enjoyable.\n...then the Rome II+DLCs went on 50% sale.\n\nAt that point I was beyond certain that pre-purchasing this game was a terrible mistake.\n\nI could've waited 3 months for the 50% sale since I wasn't able to play the game anyways.\nEven with the 3 free DLCs, the savings from the half-price discount was worth more.\n\nThe message/impression I got from this event was that CA is really hell bent on selling more copies of this game than anything else. Of course, any reasonable buisness would do that, but while offending those who love their work and delivering inferior product?? ...I don't think they should. All those little friendly guestures (or at first they seemed like friendly guestures) CA made went down the drain. If it was something you were going to do anyways, it cannot be an apology.\n\nThose of us who pre-purchased got screwed hard. There was no benefit in buying early and at full price.\n\nIt has been 11 months since the release and we are now at 14th Patch and updates are becoming very few and far in between. The game has noticably improved and I've logged many hours in this game. Although it does not have the charm the old Total War games had, it certainly has new fun things in it.\n\nHowever, the lesson Rome II has taught me (and us) is to never buy the next one on pre-release and to never pay full price for another Total War.\n\nEven better, never be the first one to buy CA's game in an untested state. Let those fools who cannot learn from experience to taste it first. Once it is certain that it is not poisoned then consider buying it.\n\nThis is what I'll do if I ever buy another Total War.","August 3, 2014","false","492.4"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

I have every game!  Was disappointed with this new installment especially when the game initially came out.  I was told recently the game was patched up and works great.  Well went to play the game again and it crashed my computer, uninstalled/installed game and still nothing...\n\nThe graphics look great.  I was disappointed with the game mechanics, it seems that no thought was done to seriously upgrade from the original Rome game.  Diplomacy is still very basic and the economics could use work also.  Also would love to see more of an upgrade on the amily history tree mechanics...\n\nI am still boggled how the Total War series has the great Medieval, Empire, Napoleon franchises and then this game?\n\nWould love to see a Crusader Kings and Total War developers get together and create a game, Rome II has failed to spark my interest.","December 22, 2014","false","121.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Then this is the perfect game for you!\n\nSee those amazing screenshots on the store page? You won't be seeing that stuff ingame! The actual graphics are something you would've seen several generations ago even on maxed settings. The alpha gameplay footage looks better than the 'final' version. Creative Assembly knew that Rome 2 owners wanted to be called retro gamers and gave us the graphics we wanted so we could claim the title!\n\nThought the User Interface was too intrusive in previous Total War games? Good news, Creative Assembly went with a bare minimal approach this time around! Unit cards have been replaced with ancient greek pottery looking designs. Good luck telling some of your units apart when the difference on the card is a tiny squiggle on it's shield!\n\nPrevious Total War games too hard for you? You don't have to worry about that! They hired Julian McKinlay the developer behind Battlefield's AI to come in and strip out any and all ounces of strategy the old AI had, and hype up the brand new intelligent AI. Can't defend you cities? No worries, the AI never builds siege and when they do they just send 1 unit up a ladder then procede to run through the gate.\n\nRemember how tedious it was to have the AI in previous total war games create advanced units and kill yours? No need to worry about that in this sequel. The AI will only build it's most basic units and never upgrade them with armor or weapons. Also McKinlay was kind enough to make the world map AI destroy all its military buildings and build temples and only temples if the cities happiness gets too low. Easily beat the game on legendary difficulty which would've been classified as very easy in previous total war games.\n\nSpeaking of happiness. Loved having your cities revolt in previous games? Well the new public order system makes sure that all your cities are revolting every 4 turns. Good news though, Julian McKinlay made sure that the revolted armies never attack and instead die from attrition. Don't have to worry about facing annoying rebels with the new public order system!\n\nRemember how tedious features like family trees, seasons, generals' stats, and complex building systems were in previous total war games? Good news, those are gone! Just hire a general, and he's part of the family! 1 turn = 1 summer year! Build a set number of select buildings, mostly temples due to public order! General doesn't need his Loyal or Temperamental traits anymore, those just make the game too complex!\n\nThought the previous total war games were too balanced? Well good news! You can be overpowered all you want! Have 1 elephant general wipe out 1000 troops! Research Boiling Oil and go make a sandwich during a city defense while a near endless stream pours out and slaughters your enemy! Don't recruit a navy, cause land units are stronger than naval units when you send them on water!\n\nToo few bugs in previous games? There's plenty of those this time around! Watch the world map disappear. Watch the game crash again, and again, and again. Hope you don't have certain hardware that makes the game unstartable! Enjoy low fps battles! Normal speed? More like 3x slower than real life speed! 3x speed? More like normal speed!\n\nGame not working or fun? Don't go to the steam forums to voice your opinion. You're not allowed to complain that the game is bad unless you have no less than 400 hours spent ingame. You'll only find buyers remorse this strong on the Aliens: Colonial Marines steam forum. By the way, don't bother complaining that Superman 64 is a bad game unless you have 400 hours put into that either.\n\nDon't have 400 hours put ingame yet to complain? Buy some DLC! The creative director of Creative Assembly said that Rome 2's launch issues were "Totally unacceptable," and what better way to forget about those issues (which still persist to this day) then buying some paid DLC to forget about the problems. Get amazing factions which are the same as current factions. Why play Rome and attack Gaul when you can buy Caesar in Gaul and play Rome and attack Gaul with paid DLC! Want Blood and Gore? Well, that basic feature in every other game has been stripped out and is being sold as glorious DLC.\n\nLike the choices that regularly came up in the Crusader Kings series? Well good news, there's a system in Rome 2 that's just like it called political intrigue. The political intrigue is so well developed with so much thought put into it that even 3 months after launch not a single person knows how it works or what it does! Tribal leader blackmailing you? Well you can retaliate and get 3 chiefs supporting you, or ignore it and lose 3. What the chief support does, who knows!? Don't have to worry about that pesky Senate breathing down your neck like in Rome 1, since to this day, no one knows what the benefits or downsides to the chief support system are. You'll only have to open the interface when you need to promote someone maybe once every 10 hours. Once again, Creative Assembly knew that we didn't want to navigate through those pesky menus and interfaces to use the political intrigue system.\n\nTired of the terrible diplomacy in previous titles, and the AI ganging up on you and declaring war? Well good news, that diplomacy system has been improved and simplified. You'll only need the diplomacy system now to declare war! Creative Assembly knew how annoying it was having to open that screen and form alliances and trade routes. You'll no longer have to worry about getting too big and having everyone attack you and end your 100 hour game, cause the improvements have made sure that the AI barely ever makes alliances with one another, and barely ever declares war on you. You'll have no obstacles beating the game on legendary difficulty in this total war game!\n\nSun Tzu probably said something along the lines of, "Something, something, something, something, military formations are important to stay in to win or something." Well historically he was correct, but historical is BOOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIINNGGG. That always bugged me in previous total war games, all your units would stay in tight formations and fight enemies in tight formations. Well Creative Assembly decided that it was boring too, so instead of fighting in formation, all troops now fight in awesome mosh pits. YYYAAAAAAA PARTY!!!! WOOOO!!!!!!\n\nHated how sssssssslllllllllooooooooowwwwwwwww previous total wars' battles were? Well they've been sped up! Those 20 minute battles now last 4 minutes. Creative assembly knew that we wanted shorter battles and longer load screens, and they delivered. Nothing like waiting 5 minutes after clicking end turn to take your turn. Great way to work out and get buff!\n\nIf you love strategy games where you have to use zero strategy and can just afk and win 99% of the time and the other 1% you just charge all your units straight toward the enemy, then Rome 2 is not only for you, but game of the year material. If Aliens: Colonial Marines didn't give you enough buyer's remorse then Rome 2 is perfect for you, and you'll soon be raiding those steam forums to make sure your money was well spent.\n\nIncase you couldn't tell this is sarcasm and no one should ever buy this game.","December 21, 2013","false","38.4"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","1"

Stripped down to some dumb mechanics in the campaign map, taken away most of the things that made past TW great. It got streamlined, made more "accessible" and during this it got boring, repetetive and just not really intruiging to play. Even with mods its still a dull experience. During Campaign you run from one war to another to the next and yet another. There is basically no economy any longer, diplomacy is near none existent and whats left means nothing. Just throw some dice, it will probably get you more reliable and fun results.\n\nWhat a waste of time the campaign is. If you like the fights go fight. They are fun if you install AI mods. Without them...pointless, CA is just crap beyond believe at programming ai. One might think they figured it out by now. I mean after all TW is around for a few years now.

Let me start by saying I completely disagree with the "do not recommend" reviews, especially if Rome 2 is on sale. This game is NOT rome 1, and it is NOT medieval 2, and it offers a different playing experience.\n\nOne thing I didn't like about rome 2, that they limited the amount of army's one faction an field at one time. This can be easily worked around with mods. The modding community can fix almost any problem you have, outside of AI (TW AI has never been the best, am I right?). Give it go, then check out the workshop to see what mods you may like!\n\nI did like, In Rome 2, that they added army stances. You can set your army into a 'Fortified' mode, where they build a fort for defences, used if your're going to stay put and guard an area. A 'Forced March' mode, which will allow great distances to be traveled,  but at the cost of morale and being vulnerable to an ambush. Or 'Raid' mode which allows you to plunder an enemies territory, angering the populace and possibly drawing out an attack from any enemy army's.\n\nI'd not recomment purchasing Rome 2, unless you have at least the 'Recommended'  system requirments listed above, otherwise It will likely look pretty ugly, and lag in larger battles. Though, I can't say with certainty it will not run well on a "2 GHz Intel Dual Core processor / 2.6 GHz Intel Single Core processor" I can't imagine it running very well.\n\nEveryone has reacted differently to this game and since release it's been under much scrutiny, and while I agree, Rome 2 had it's fair share of post-release issues, It's still a very worthwile experience. Don't let all the negative reviews sway you from this great game, because it's definitely become my most played Total War title, and I had played a LOT of TW prior to Rome 2.\n\nAll-in-all, I would definitely recommend this game to any Total war fan, or even as a good place to start for someone new to Total War because of the way they simplified the user interface. It does seem to require less micro managing than shogun 2, or Empire. It does feel more limited, though, as you cannot build ANY given bulding type in ANY given city.\n\nYou will just have to decied for youself if this newest installment to the Total War series, will be YOUR new favorite.\n","March 18, 2014","true","207.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I bought it on sale in a bundle which included some of the more expensive DLCs. So I'm content with the game for what I payed. Also having had waited until well after its release (2+ years) I did not have to deal with the bugs this game was infamous for upon release.\n\nSo why can't I recommend this game? Well, Sega is DLCing this game to death. There are DLCs in this and other TW games that should just have been in the original release. But why add them for free when you can charge more for them? I'm surprised they have not started microtransactions where you actually have to pay for the mercenary units you hire or something even more ridiculous.

The original Rome was considered by many to be one of the best and after so many promising gameplay videos, why would we even question if this would be better?\n\nIt's just NOT fun. The battles have been improved and there is still a bit to them if you play them in slow motion, but the appeal has gone. I don't know how to describe it- it's as if the units are smaller on-screen. Play the original Rome and they're larger than life. You can see every single spear and unit as if they're a person. I simply don't have the interest in them in Rome 2. The units tend to blend together. You don't spot a certain type of archer unit from across the battlefield and feel excitement or fear. They're just another unit that needs to be slaughtered. Maybe this is just me, it's lost what made the earlier games feel so unique.\n\nHowever, the campaign screen is unquestionably worse. I see what they've tried to do with the changes but they simply don't make the game more fun. They've added more depth to the boring bits and have sapped the fun from the others. Whilst in earlier games I'd buy a new building that would give me new units to play with, or have a noticable impact shortly afterwards, this game is so slow-paced I can't be bothered with it. I have completed Empire, Napoleon and Shogun 2 so please don't accuse me of having a short attention span. It simply isn't long enough for this game.\n\nWhile before I would make large decisions, like which factions to attack and where to position my armies, I find most of my time in Rome 2 is taken up with pathetic trivialities. Do I want my spies to have +5% success in deviousness or man-smelling? (Okay, not proper topics, but probably more interesting than what you actually get to choose). I DON'T CARE any more. It's as if there are so many variables you can't see the big picture any more. Give me the old Medieval Total War system of having more command stars = better general, or 'buy this and you get a larger castle!', not 'wait for population to gradually reach this and then have enough food to get a town that will be slightly bigger but not big enough to justify the time or money spent getting it there'.\n\nThe game is too deep and too complex. While before I would invade India, France or Italy, I'm now too busy trying to take over Cornwall. If I don't play each battle separately I'll lose and it takes so much time to get one step ahead that I've been distracted by another game on my computer that offers a far faster and more exhilarating thrill than the hours invested in this game can achieve. I thought I'd be excited about the changes and cinematic graphics. Instead I'm sick and tired of upgrading minor, pointless units.\n\nAnd yet, I will continue to try this game. Even if I can only stand playing it for an hour at a time, I'll chip into it and hope that, hidden amongst the rubbish are gems of fun to be had from it. I still can't believe how far they've fallen from the incremental but positive steps taken in the previous games. Shame on you, Creative. Now, give me the new patch and I'll give it another go.

It has good graphics and gameplay and can run smoothly on a decent GPU, the Ai is not as good as it was in Rome 1 or other total war games but is still better than the dreaded Empire total war. Rome 2 is amazing to look at, has some decent historically correct dlcs and is so fun in general. The multiplayer is so fun and can teach you good tactics and units weak and strong points as a lot of people are much better than the ai in the campaign. The morale system in Rome 2 can be stupid at times and screws up the AI quite a bit.

Thank you, franchise sale, because Rome 2 is my favorite strategy game experience ever.  The world map management feels like a combination of Sid Meier's Civ V and Total War, and the research tree is a cool addition to the building. My only complaint about the world map is that it does feel a little oversimplified; definitely do your campaigns above "normal" difficulty if you want a real challenge.\n\nDiplomacy is easier to do than ever before and it actually makes sense; your standing with a particular faction and its allies will actually affect what kind of treaties they'll enact with you, if any at all, and you're less likely to encounter random backstabbing. (Although why my client states maintain military alliances with countries I'm at war with I'll never know)\n\nThe actual battles are the same as before, with a pretty UI that tells you all you need to know and the addition of abilities - not just the formations, phalanxes, fire arrows, and stakes that we had before - but things like war cries to rally your own troops and intimidate the enemy all makes battles feel better and grittier.  All the different types of battles are great too, and it's awesome having an online battle work out when you're the reinforcing navy coming rescue your teammates :P\n\nAll in all, would totally recommend this game, especially as a good starting point into the Total War franchise if you want something that's actually historical and cool\n\n","May 7","true","80.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

But maybe I should start by saying that this game is the latest Total War game in a universe of 7 to 9 games if you consider Napoleon and "Last Samurai" as StandAlones.\n\nIf I were to review this regardless of the previous games I would say it is worth buying, it is a solid game, has some bugs but none game breaking at the moment, the devs update the game once in a while, the battles are epic, the campaign in early and mid game is engaging kind of feels like Civilization and then mixing that with the accomplishments of your RTS battles it's a pretty solid rewarding experience. And I'd have to give it at least a 7/10 in the game's current state. Shame that the developers decided to go with all those DLC things with factions and units. But the game is there and it's good. I already spent 460h on it and most of the time it was great.\n\nNow reviewing this taking into consideration the earlier games... This game was very, very disapointing. It is a little better now with the patches but it's still disappointing. Family trees, the building system of Rome I, the inability to have smaller defending armies to complement the garrissons that are led by captains instead of generals, the AI which isn't better and at times is worse, the agent system is rather dumb, all the mini clips that would pop out throughout the game are gone, the field battles are quicker and have arcady goals and sometimes it looks like arcade games. So... There's a lot of thing that were dumbed down, others totally removed. When I first started playing I thought "Oh my god, the graphics are nice, not as good as I thought they'd be but nice, gameplay is nice... oh but where is the family tree? but... I can't have armies without generals? what?"  Well I got used to it.  But the emersion is just not there. You play because you want to win. And in late game it just feels like a Grind. It's painful. The Civil War system is completely broken as well. How is that? I would have made it as one army goes rogue or all the armies controled by the family who rebeled and those would go take your capital. If they took it they'd be in charge. You could either give up command or lose your territory and try to re-capture the capital to gain control of the empire. That'd be awesome but no. You just get a random number of armies spawn around one of your cities and that's the civil war. Plain dum and stupid.\n\nThe only reason I kept playing Rome II is because I made a mod to make the battles exponentially better. Plus there are features I can't live without and with other mods the game is pretty nice to play. Considering all this and the earlier games I'd rate the game a 4/10 due to the huge let down, with mods I'd give it 6/10.\n\nIt's worth trying. But wait for it to go on sales. Below 35 ~ 40 euros/dollars it is worth to pick and try.\n\nThe only reason I don't play Rome I more than Rome II ? In Rome I you have to go into a city and retrain your armies.  :P\n\n","July 13, 2014","true","833.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Read reviews made by people here. Shimmy on over to their Attila reviews and they will talk about all the massive improvements and fixes Attila has made that Rome needed. I'd like to add that it has a far worse rating then Rome II as well.\n\nWhile the game is playable now, optimization is still poor you will go from +60fps to -20fps for no reason. Patches haven't fixed any of the major problems. AI's tactics still consist of rushing for the center of your city during a siege or going for the only people they see in field battles. (easy for ambushes) AI still places their units outside of siege walls and does nothing even under a constant barrage of ranged fire.\n\nCombat animations look terrible: kills without animations look like a guy just touched someone as the person they hit gets thrown like they got rammed by a truck. Bow animations look horrid on foot or horseback, they give a little pull for half a second and let loose a deadly rain of arrows. Thrown animations look great however, a massive improvement.\n\nThis game boils down to three factions, Rome, Carthage, Greek (more than 3 w/grecian deal with it). Unit variation is poor, I don't care how many different units they made upgrading T1-T4. You will never find a use for anything below T4 with the exception being the 30 turns it takes to research them.\n\nThe community support is overwhelming, it's really a shame considering the quality of the game. The developers proved how unwilling they are able to cooperate over something simple with the community in this video: https://youtu.be/m5g6HpKOwa4?t=1m34s . Game developers recommending mods, the future of gaming at your doorstep.\n\nThis game has acted as a place holder for the last two years, to what I don't know. But they made a lot of damn money for such a poor game.\n\nOverall this review boils down to one reality: When you expect nothing, you settle for less.","July 11, 2015","false","803.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","2"

This led to poor fan reception and a Metacritic score lower than that of any Total War title to date. At launch, and for quite some time after, I would not have recommended Rome 2. Thanks to Creative Assembly's continued support of the game, it has now reached a stage where it is extremely enjoyable with the recent release of the Emperor Edition. The game has metamorphosed drastically since the game received is initial reviews.\n\nThe Emperor Edition, released on September 16, 2014, drastically overhauled the game. The building system was redesigned for the better, factions all underwent extensive rebalancing and recieved new, more natural factional colors, unit abilities were overhauled, and last but not least, a new free campaign, Imperator Augustus, was released. All of this was added to the game free of charge! With the changes introduced in Emperor Edition, I definitely recommend Rome 2 to anyone interested in a grand strategy game with RTS and TBS elements set in the ancient world.\n\nAll of the DLC is recommendable, though depending on your personal preference, you may wish to skip the unit packs. The two DLC campaigns, Caesar in Gaul and Hannibal at the Gates, offer an experience different from that of the Grand Campaign and Imperator Augustus. They are more focused experiences, zooming in on the world map to flesh out Gaul and the Mediterranean, respectively, in greater detail than what is found in the Grand Campaign. Caesar in Gaul, Hannibal at the Gates, and Imperator Augustus all also operate at a slower yearly rate, with one turn per season, as opposed to the Grand Campaign's one turn per year. This greatly increases the number of turns you will have generals and agents at your disposal before they die of old age, allowing them to accrue more experience than they would be able to in the Grand Campaign. All of the DLC content is reasonably priced for its value, especially during sales.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the Rome 2 is how visually disappointing it is. The lack of true AA makes the game so much uglier, and the art direction really is vastly inferior to that of Shogun 2, in the UI, graphics, and soundtrack.\n\nThe UI itself is my second biggest problem with Rome 2. Coming straight from Shogun 2, I don't understand how they managed to make the UI so much worse. In Shogun 2, the UI beautifully blended with the style of the game, and functioned perfectly for gameplay purposes. In Rome 2, they somehow decided it was a good idea to make the UI take up more space on the screen, while at the same time making it more difficult to navigate and use. Between the advisor constantly popping on the screen for no reason, the unit stat card being permanently there and GIANT unless you want to manually hide it completely (instead of fading away like in Shogun 2), and the unit bar section taking up a way larger than necessary portion of your screen, right in the center, they really succeeded in consuming as much screen space as they could with their devolved UI. I just don't understand how they could have made the UI so much worse coming straight from Shogun 2, which had a magnificent UI.\n\nMy two gripes aside, I do recommend the game.","August 18, 2014","true","188.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

I have played all of the total war games with the exception of the original Shogun and medieval. I was introduced into the series in 2010 when i saw my housemate playing barbarian invasion and i was blown away. the dude was kind enough to lend me his total war rome cd and it just got me hooked. After that i played medieval 2, empire, napoleon, shogun and fall of the samurai and i ♥♥♥♥ing loved them. I did not even mind empire with all its flaws, trully. And then i was i was introduced to the amazing comunity with the exeptional mods like europa barbarorum, stainless steel, third age total war (best lotr game ever btw), and of course the darthmods. I came to the realization that i could not play the vanila games anymore. The mods for these games were so much better in terms of content and gamplay that i just could not. I am not saying by any means that the vanila games were bad nor do i have less respect for CA cause if it wasnt for the original product i would not get to play these versions.\n\nFor empire total war i have played (and im not proud saying that) more than a 1000 hours (with darthmod platinum). with this out of the way when i first heard that they are making a rome 2 total war i went ♥♥♥♥ing mental. the game that introduced me to the series was being remade with all the experience that game with CA after all these titles. How wrong i was......\n\nThe state of the game when it was releashed almost a year ago was at BETA stage and im being super kind by saying this. I completely agree with all the rants and videos out there and im ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with how CA or SEGA treated the fans. The reason im am writing this now is that after almost ONE year, i can say that the game can be enjoyed. I have had no lag and the battles are playable (unmodded). However i still do not agree with most of the changes that have been made (requitment, provinces, not being able to build wall nor roads and many more).\n\nFinally i will treat this game as a spinoff for the total war series. It  feels that it was made by a completely different company who though what total war was about but missed the point along the way. With that in mind i will recomend this game because it NOT a bad game but total war as i remebered it and played it (as i do to this day) it is not. it is a fun arcade strategy and nothing more. And maybe it can intoruce new players to the classics that i mentioned.\n\nI am not going to give any pros and cons cause im sure other players have done it a lot better that i ever would. Im just here to say that it took literally 1 year for CA to get the game sorted after patch 14 and that players who bashed the game should give it a go, just think of it as a spinoff game.\n\nLast thing people are entiled to their own opinions CA should be critisied for their games and actions (im talking DLC whoring and the likes). If theres no negative opinions we are gonna get more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games and that in the end hurt the gamers. I personally will not preorder a game anymore no matter how many free factions or gay little catapults they throw at me.

I was one of the critics. I refused to buy this game after the first reviews surfaced making clear this game was released in a terrible state. I was looking forward to this as it spans over my most favorite historic period of time. I played all the Total War games from the beginning with the first Shogun and I would call my self a fan of the franchise.\n\nNow I got this game during a sale and firstly felt bad about it. Lets not kid ourselves, the dlc politics of EA is rather cheeky demanding money for factions that would have been included in older instances of total war. But its our fault. They tested us when they brought faction dlcs in Shogun II and we bought them. I got the feeling in a few years we will have to pay for a games core engine and for every single faction in it and they will sell it to us as feature. We brought this upon ourselves.\n\nIf you want to play the greeks, the germans, the iberian tribes, the balcan factions and even some gaul tribes you will have to buy the dlcs. Especially the greek states as being one of the major antagonists of the early roman republic are a must have for anyone interested. But enough of that.\n\nThe Game:\n\nThe Game right now on 8th September 2014 with all dlc included is the most complete, most playable, best looking, most enjoyable strategy game of the Total War franchise. Yes even better than Medieval II. The game feels and looks astounding. You will be sucked in into ancient times. you will find yourself speaking with the voice of a roman consul during the battles. You will cheer your elephants trampling down poor barbarians with Carthage. The epic struggle for power in the east with vast armies and the biggest ships the world had ever seen at that time. Slave uprisings. Forming your own barbaric confederation to face the roman onslaught. You will be in the middle of it.\n\nThe tactical and strategical depth is incredible. Multiple Army battles. Naval invasions in the style of "Troy" the movie. Even combined Land-Sea-Sieges of cities with large armies are possible and incredible fun. Ambushes, Plundering, Mowing down of barbarians with organized armies. Roman legionaries advancing in turtle formation. Huge siege machines. It is all in here for you.\n\nThe politics of your factions are there but they are toned down. I feel split in opinion about that but i have to say you can actually ignore the whole political side of Rome II and still succeed. Occasions of civil war are very very rare in my experience.\n\nArmies, Generals, Agents all gain experience and skills. Agents becoming extremly useful. You dont like to manage them? Leave them in your provinces and set them to overwatch and they will help your economy, stability and military developement and defend against enemy agents.\n\nThe technical aspects of the game are pretty well right now. It looks good and is reasonable quick. I am playing this on an older PC with  4 GB of RAM  and it works well with medium graphics. Loading times will however be signifcant. Especially after and prior to huge battles.\n\nThe criticism of the game was always about the innitial state it was shipped out and it was terrible. There is no denying. But today with all the patches and changes and the community input this game is finally what was promised and it delivers.\n\nGet it but you maybe want to wait for a sale. Including the important dlcs it is one of the more expensive products on steam.\n","September 8, 2014","true","527.0"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","2"

I spent my time in college studying Roman Civ, so the game was hugely appealing to me. But I'll try and take a step back here in order to review it from the point of view of someone who isn't completely infatuated with history.\n\nI'm a big fan of the old tactical JRPG style games, like Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics. I haven't done much gaming with its cousins in the subgenres of military strategy and real time strategy, but I really enjoyed how this game seemed to blend both of those genres together, and I respect that Creative Assembly is basically designing two games in one, here. There's the overarching strategical game in which you're managing your cities and towns and moving your military and spy/champion/dignitary units, and there's what is obviously the meat of the game in the battle system that occurs once you engage in combat with an enemy unit. They flow together quite nicely, allowing you to build up the efficacy of your units via upgrades in your cities and towns. It scratches the RPG itch in that way while at the same time providing a great strategical and tactical experience. You can easily find yourself dumping hours upon hours into this game, thanks to the patented "Just One More Turn" addiction technique made famous by the Civilization series. It's quite enjoyable, and there's quite a lot of it -- One campaign can take nearly 100 hours to complete.\n\nThere are some really cool features to the game. I got the most enjoyment out of it simply due to the fact that it strives to be historically accurate, and it does a great job of it. The Roman military is clearly split between the Manipular system of the middle Republican era, and the Marian reforms later on that transformed the army from the group of levied farmers it classically was into the group of professional, disciplined fighters that would eventually conquer most of Europe and all of known Africa. The historical accuracy of the military units also extends to the Celtic tribes of Gauls and Britons, the Iberian tribal fighters, African and Asian horsemen, etc. It's all really enjoyable given my interest in history.\n\nThere are numerous little touches that are really nice, as well. The art on the unit cards is really awesome. It's clear they went for an antique style with them, and it really works well. The Celtic tribes look particularly cool. Another thing I found really enjoyable was the pre-battle speeches that the general can be heard giving his troops. They're phenomenally well voice acted, and they make accurate references to religion and state. It's enjoyable down to the cornua that the centurions blow whenever you tell a unit to move. It matters a lot that they get the little things right here, as they do a lot to immerse you in the time period, and Creative Assembly has absolutely succeeded there.\n\nThe actual combat, and being able to zoom in and out as your units go to battle against others, is absolutely phenomenal. You can zoom in and see each unit, in great detail, fighting against the enemy. Or you can zoom out and take in the entire battle from a colossal scale. Watching your cavalary charge the rear of an opponent is immensely satisfying. I had one situation where one of my legions was caught in enemy territory. I had had the foresight to send my units into a defensive stance, so the battle began with them entrenched in a wooden fortress. I was heavily outnumbered, and didn't have many units to do anything with other than just station them in the doorways of the fortress and hope they could hold off the enemy. They ended up succeeding, breaking the enemy waves at the entrance in true Roman legionary fashion. It was awesome, and easily my most memorable moment in a game filled with them. The problem is that about half of the most memorable moments are due to terrible bugginess, and those memorable moments always caused battles to end in disaster for me. Imagine fighting a battle for close to 40 minutes, and having it suddenly turn because one of your key units got stuck on geometry and slaughtered since you could no longer maneauver them. It's just as infuriating as it sounds.\n\nI've gotten into this game somewhat late, playing it a full year after it originally exist, and I've read quite frequently that people say it's become way better, that it's been fully patched and is now recommendable to everybody, but my experience with it has not proven this to be correct. I've had units refuse to enter a breach in a wall literally a dozen times, which has caused me to stop knocking down walls altogether and just use siege ladders. But then I had units get stuck on a wall and do nothing but continue to climb up and down the siege ladders, which caused me to lose an extremely important battle. I've also experienced a bug where my cavalary has run in the completely opposite direction from which I've ordered them. There are numerous other things like this that really destroy the experience for me, but it's also incredibly poorly optimized, even after Creative Assembly has patched the game several times and repackaged it into the "fixed" Emperor Edition. I'm running 780ti SLI and I see dips down to around 20fps at times, which is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nIt really hurts me to give this game a thumbs down, because I did enjoy it quite a bit. But the frustration from dealing with its bugs and its poor optimization make it hard for me to recommend to anybody outside classical history buffs and hardcore Total War fans. If you fall into either of those groups, then by all means, take the plunge, because you'll get quite a bit out of this game. I surely have. But if you're not, then you should probably just pass it up altogether, because the frustration will likely outweigh any enjoyment you'd get out of the game.","November 27, 2014","false","76.8"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","26","45","0","2"

The AI is much better both on the campaign map and during battles and capture points have been removed from open field battles which makes them much more tactical and longer lasting. At launch, most battles would resolve in five minutes or so, now they usually last ten or fifteen minutes. While it still isn't as slick as Shogun 2, Rome 2's massive scale and varied factions make for a entertaining and addicting strategy experience that is closer to what fans expected before the game released.\n\nThere are still some lingering problems with AI in battles, particularly in sieges when the AI is attacking. The game also doesn't look as good as the latest builds of Shogun 2, they still need to implement a better anti-aliasing system to smooth the visuals out. However considering the state that Rome 2 launched in, its nice to see that Creative Assembly didn't abandon the project and instead patched it to the point where it is well worth playing.\n\nGet it on sale if you have been on the fence about this one, it is finally a worthy entry into the Total War franchise.","April 9, 2014","true","52.6"," 37 of 66 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","37","66","0","0"

I do not want to write a full review, there are some great features, such as the food-happiness-money triangle that you need to juggle when developing your provinces, but what really kills this game is....\n\nThe AI.\n\nThe AI is so extremely dumb in this game, it is unbelievable. Yes, it is a very complex game, I'm sure coding an AI for it is nightmarish anyways, but I believe no matter how rushed the development is, a good AI is quintessential for any strategy game.\n\nThis makes the game very snowballish (and this is my main point) in singleplayer. After I had 4 whole provinces I was pretty much unstoppable. AI states don't conquer at the same rate as you, although some intersting things can happen (Gauls in Carthage in my last game). So once you become a giant, there are no other giants you could play against. No alliances made to stop the huge Rome (or anyone) from devouring half of Europe. And as I know strategy game balancing, all a higher difficulty level game would do is make the AI cheat harder. My only problem after securing Italy was the occasional food or unhapiness crysis that resulted due to my mismanagement. Now that I have about 12 provinces I'm just not interested in playing the game anymore, because I KNOW that nothing can get in my way. They did TRY to balance this mechanic out, but it was a weak try.\n\nIt's fun to meddle in on the free weekend, but I wouldn't suggest buying it, especially at full price.","February 15, 2015","false","86.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I love you so much. I also hate you so much. Let me explain...\n\nWhen I bought Rome II at launch, the game was a mess. Seriously, Total War Arena is far more polished right now and that game has not even entered open beta yet (it just finished closed beta on March 3rd). Still, there was nothing else out at the time that really appealed to me, so I continued to play it through all the patchwork and DLC shananigans that Creative Assembly seems really addicted to right now. Honestly, at the end of the day, the game is not perfect, but it works 100 times better as compared to launch and is entirely fixed as of March 2016 IF subsidized by mods such as the radious mod. I am aware that saying something is made complete or better because of mods does the developer no credit, but do not worry, I will address that elephant in the room at the end of the review. In my oppinion, I can recommend the game today in its current state if you use mods. None of the mods I use are obtained anywhere but steam workshop, where downloading mods takes no effort and is as easy as clicking "subscribe". If they required any more effort than that, my review may be different. As things stand however, they do not.\nThe Good:\nThe Setting...\nThe game has an extremely large scale and is a very interesting historical "what if" simulator set in the historical period after Alexander the Great's Empire disintegrated and states such as Rome, Persia (not called Persia right now, but trust me, it is) Macedon and Carthage (to name maybe 5% of the faction list in this game) made their bid for expansion in the Ancient World. The setting is really exciting and really sets a mood for expansion and ancient warfare between mighty nations where pretty much anyone could have ruled Ancient Europe, Northern Africa, the Asian Steppes and the Middle East all of the way to India. When you finally reach the end of a game you cannot help but marvel at the size of your empire and all of the epic battle symbols on the terrain and say "yeah, I built that". The setting also makes the game incredibly addictive and the feeling of "one more turn" is omnipresent. The state of diplomacy in the game is almost completely fixed, and with mods is 100% fixed so that nations respond to rationally, even if you don't see their grand strategy upfront and their actions do not make sense to you in the short term. One game, I was playing as Rome, and I sought a trade agreement with a nearby rival, Massalia, who had expanded but was diplomatically friendly to me. They refused me every time, to my bafflement. However, I later realized that Massalia had no plans of being friendly, as they launched a sneak attack on me by sea right after I became engaged in a war with Carthage, breaking a Non-Agression Pact in the process. Needless to say, things got interesting, and they behaved deviously rationally: a trade agreement with them would have made me a stronger foe in the long term, despite the short term boost in wealth. And that, as they say, simply will not do.\nThe Gameplay...\nThe gameplay, both on the campaign map and in battle are vastly improved, and immensely challenging. Enemy AI, if subsidized by mods, is capable of highly sophisticated flanking maneuvers and uses ranged units to deadly effect right where you don't want them to be. A superior force is no longer a guarantee of victory like it used to be, and this means every engagement is as tense as the last. The political and diplomacy systems are fixed even pre-mod, and make a lot of sense to me. Some people remain baffled by the political system and true, it is poorly explained. But it is not overly complicated I promise you. In short, it is a game of balancing your factions prestige and power with the other factions in the game. Become too powerful, and you will become a dictator that will be despised and subject to uprisings and schemes. Become too weak, and you will be forced out and exiled. The extreme result of either disbalance is a civil war: either from a position of the majority or minority. The catch is that maintaining a balance of power becomes increasingly difficult the larger the empire or potential pie becomes. It really is a cool dynamic when subsidied with mods like 2 turns per year or 4 turns per year that result in almost God like Generals that command the respect of tens of thousands facing off against one another in a political tug of war. Also, the Province system is a huge improvement to the system for land management  in Empire to Shogun 2, and really motivates you to expand quicker so you can control an entire province rather than just part of it in order to capitalize on the bonuses of "complete" ownership such as edicts, food bonuses, public order bonuses, and economic bonuses. It really makes me smile when addictiveness is built into a game mechanic that works well on its own already.\nThe Shiny Baubles...\nThe game looks great on higher settings. My PC is 4 years old and I cannot touch ultra on anything except unit textures, building textures, and unit sizes. The game could run better at times, but it is a thing of beuty if you crank the graphics a little bit and have a system that can do it. I am thinking of upgrading my PC soon JUST so I can see this game maxed out. The UI leaves a little to be desired though, and the unit cards are just ugly, albeit historically accurate (the unit cards look like a drawing on an ancient pot or urn). The campagin map looks beautiful though, and it is huge. Attila is a better looking game than this and is optimized better (runs smoother, better load times etc.) but Rome II is still impressive to behold.\nOverall, Rome II is an excellent addition to the total war series, and becomes crazy addictive once modded out to reach its full potential. The gameplay is fun and challenging both in the campaign map and in battles. The game looks great on high end machines. The setting and sense that you are creating the story of a nation in a historical "what if" scneario is immersive and addictive in its own right, but even more so given the time period of epic ancient conquest. This game, unlike so many on the market today, is as much about being ballsy as it is about being smart and cunning. This is why I love it.\nToo bad CA sucks.\nThe Bad:\nDLC DLC and what do you know? DLC...\nThe DLC for this game was out of control from day one. Normally I do not mind DLC, as I believe in freedom of choice and the free market, and I honestly have no problem enhancing a product with DLC if the product is complete in its own right out of the gate. The way CA has used DLC however, has perverted the practice to the point where I am not so sure anymore, and I am very sceptical of new games nowadays. CA is certainly not the only party guilty of this in gaming (for an example of the most eggregious customer pillaging to date on consoles, see Destiny and how Bungie flogged anyone stupid enough to get that game out of the gate with shameless DLC flaunting in the season pass), but they are one of the worst. Day One DLC is an abysmal practice in its own right, but when combined with CA selling an incomplete product, using their consumers as free product testors for patchwork, AND dumping DLC behind a pay wall rather than fixing the game, the result is downright buggery on an epic scale. Again, selling DLC = not offensive. Selling DLC for an aplha build that cost 59.99 + lying to consumers  = insulting. The game was not complete until Emperor Edition (one year later), and by then creative assembly had added countless culture packs, expansions, a blood pack that should be standard but is not, and who knows what else. In the end, the game suffered, the fans suffered, and CA laughed its way to the bank. This is why I hate it: CA dropped the ball.\nConclusion: buy when on sale. A solid game with a troubled past, but if you like total war, you will like this. With mods, you will love it.

As a huge total war fan, it's a shame to see the sequel to one of the best strategy games ever (Rome: Total War) be released in such a poor state, and still not be fixed. The graphics are good, and a lot of the idéas put into the game are brilliant on paper, but the poor execution makes for a lot of frustration.\nthe game is also overly convoluted at times, making it unnecessarily hard to find information might be crutial in a grand-strategy game.\nBut all of this, and the games poor AI, are problems that we have seen in other total war games as well. Some have gotten bigger in this installment, some have been improoved, and some have stayed the same. So the real issue I have with this game, is not in the gameplay itself, because I actually enjoy it more than many of the other games in the series. My big issue with this game, is the poor performance.\nI have pretty decent rig, and so does a lot of my friends, but the trend i keep seeing, is that whether or not you get a good performance seems to be a total coin toss... And, a fatal bug, causes the game to stutter like crazy (without the actual framrate dropping) whenever the units have pathfinding issues. This is especially prominent in sige battles (mostly in barbarian settlements, but also occurs in any large scale battle) this occurs even on te lowest settings, and I'm running this on a 680M and with an i7 processor, so I should be able to run the game at OK settings at least. CA have stated on their website that they are aware of the issue, and even said in one of the patch notes that the issue should be resolved, but as the patches grow fewer, and the problem percists, my hope for the game to ever be truly playable for me are diminishing.\nThis came as a big shock to me, especially since Shogun 2 (and every other total war game for that matter) runs silky smooth, even on the highes settings. I realise that Rome 2 is more demanding than Shogun 2, but when I can't even run it on the lowest settings there is clearly a problem.\nAs of the time I'm writing this, CA still havent fixed the problem, but I'm still hoping for a fix. If they would resolve this issue, Rome 2 could easily become one of my favourite strategy games, but when the performance is so poor, it just makes all the other little anoyances so hard to deal with, and therefore I canno't recommend this. But as I said, I hope CA resolves this issu, so I, and anyone else with this issue, can once again be proud to call oureselves total war fans.\n\n(Sorry for poor grammar)","May 23, 2014","false","132.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It was much more complex with city management but there was an auto-manage button. The AI wasn't to great but it didnt ruin the game.\n\nNow Rome II is garbage.\n\nPros\nGraphics(as if that would be a reason to buy the game)\nPrologue was actually fun\nTotal war Encyclopedia in game\nGenerals are also politician\n\nCons\nTutorial teaches you NOTHING\nCity management\nPoor AI\nDifficulty Jump\nAutoresolve\nNaval System\nConfusing Tech tree\nConfusing building system\nUI is a mess\nDiplomatic AI\nLimited units unless you buy the dlc\nCan't Merge Units\nMultiplayer bugs\n\nLets tackle these individually\nPros\nThe total war encyclopedia is very helpful when you want to look up a units stats and maybe a little history. It was not helpful however when looking up tech trees and building trees\nA Cool Aspect of the game is your generals can rise through the ranks of your family as you use them\n\nCons\n-Doing all of the tutorials and they don't teach you about: Tactics, Diplomacy, Politics, Regional management, Unrest.\n-City management is a confusing mess. Each city has smaller cities part of their region. They all share bonuses(including population). So if you can recruit in one city you can recruit in the whole region. My problem is they don't tell you that. They also don't tell you anything about edicts and the requirements for those. You also can't build things like walls in sub-cities(I am looking at your Jerusalem)\n-The AI is consistently dumb. Sometimes they get stuck on boats when doing a landing, and sometimes the enemies general will walk to the edge of the map and stay there. Your long term "Friends" will betray you instantly if you don't have your cities well guarded(even if you share a common enemy).\n-There is a massive difficulty jump when switching from any faction besides Rome. Rome can just walk across the map, but you can easily spend 50 turns doing nothing as the germans or british. This is because each city has a large garrison and they can reinforce armies.\n-In Rome 2 they added a little more control over autoresolve. However autoresolve has no idea how to judge your odds. 1 extra group for the enemy will drop your chances down to 1/5. Also expert units don't seem to make a difference, and you can destroy anyone with just a ton of slingers.\n-The naval system is completely over powered. Each ship carries a full set of troops that can get off their boats and attack cities. Even if you kill an entire unit the boat doesn't disappear. They also require less researches to get epic boats(including onagers).\n-The tech tree and buildings are mostly unique to the faction(which is a plus) but it offers no advice on what to get or what future things offer. Sometimes you can unlock powerful unique troops by getting a religous building but you wont know unless you make those choices. The tech tree is split up into obscure categories that don't offer you any real reason to go for a specific tech when you start. Unless you know what everything unlocks you will find yourself starting a research when you can't build something, and you have to waste time to advance.\n-The user interface is so confusing and is very pointless. You will find yourself search through all the tabs just to figure out why you are having a civil war. You can easily ignore most of the buttons until you have a problem because the tutorial doesn't go over the interface at all, and you won't bother figuring them all out because some of them do nothing.\n-Diplomacy is probably the most frustrating thing in the entire game. Your allies will betray you. You sometimes have to pay thousands of gold for a non-agression pact. Sometimes people from across the world will give you money and ask for ridiculous things(like an alliance). Some people will completely refuse to trade even if you offer 4k gold. Their diplomats will want something but via audio will insult you.\n-You are seriously limited in gameplay unless you buy dlc. More then half the nations you cannot play.\n-You can't merge injured units(like in the previous games). I even went out of my way to look this up. You have to either disband them all and re-recruit or what like 8 turns in a city.\n-In Multiplayer, desyncs were frequent and sometimes you will find out 10 turns in the future that you desynced ruining the save. You have to start over or manually send them the save file.\n\n\nOverall, This game was a huge disappointment. I have played all the total wars and beaten them all except this one. The most I'd pay for this broken unfocused game is 10 bucks with all the dlc. It is seriously disappointing that their is so much dlc and they still want 60 bucks for this game. They seem to have invested in things that the total war fans don't care much about. If you have any interest in playing a total war game save your time and money and just play shogun 2 which is a much more polished and focused game. Rome 2 was a catastophic failure and couldn't deliver on any level of satisfaction. With buggy AI and completely lame intricacies this game has destroyed my hopes for this series, and alienated me with Creative Assembly's future projects.","September 28, 2014","false","115.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I will briefly bring up the following flaws: game feels void of any meaning customization, many bonuses are so arbitrarily useless its unclear as to why they are included, diplomacy is basically a throw gold at it till they like you, political systems is bare bones and uninteresting, user interface in battle does not feel refined or aesthetically pleasing, many AI tactics are utterly similar or make a larger battle line if they can and march forward, unsatisfying campaign ending, unrealistic end game goals, tech takes too long is fairly linear and uninspired and also gives a lot of things that feel like they should be standard.\n\nLastly, that was all based on the merit of the game by itself.

Compared to Shogun 2, its a lot more stable; i kept having the famous autosave crash during the whole shogun 2 series , even with fall of the samurai every second autosave. Just once( !!!!) in rome 2, using the cloud for save.\n\n2. Some people complained that the game engine obviously comes from Empire, and wasnt therefore suited to melee warfare. Well, pure hogwash, Shogun 2 had the same Empire engine, and melee worked just fine!\n\n3. The premade tactical formations in battles work extremely good, and are very realistic. Frankly 80 % of all real battles in antiquity worked like phalanx in the front and cavalry on the flanks, skirmisher screen in front. If the main line budged, or the flanks got lost, battle was lost. The game here pretty much works the same way, it´s astonishing how well the engine emulates that logic of ancient phalanx/maniple warfare.\n\n4. The new region system saves you a lot of micromanagement and is frankly more realistic. On the downside, you cant fortify every border town anymore, but that just makes proper strategic planning and gaining client states or satrapies more important, since you cant defend each settlement.\n\nWell, the naval battles are quite crappy, but heh, no cannon broadsides without cannons, and ancient sea battles resembled a crazed ramming and boarding contest anyway. And rest assured, as soon as you got ships with on deck artillery, the transport rush thing is over. Besides, the often mentioned super transports can barely survive 3 rammings, whereas a quinquireme or somesuch can easily take a dozen hits. And transports tend to burn down real quick, therefore you just do need a real navy after the opening phase of the campaign.\n\nSo yeah, the game is totally worth it´s money now, and i´d dare say it´s one of the best in the series in her current patched state( 12 patches lol, was the original qualitiy assurance done by drunken monkeys?) with more content coming up every 2 months or so.\nHaven´t played the Gaul and Hannibal campaign yet, gonna buy them with the next steam sale, and will write  probably a review about that too.\n\np.s. patch 14(!!!!) out , a real big one commited just on artificial dumbness for siege battles. The comp attacking your walled cities was one of the weak points of this game; I kept butchering 4k plus barbarian armies with just a few units behind the walls repeatedly for example.

Probably the most disappointing aspect is that it fails to live up to its older brother, the original Rome: Total War since the Creative Assembly decided to take the original Rome game, improve the graphics and then make it worse in every other possible way. That cool feature allowing you to see a city on the battle map outside of combat? Gone. Family trees? Gone.\n\nAbout the only decent thing added is naval combat and the ability to perform amphibious landings, but the glitches therein where the AI are concerned do tarnish that somewhat (the AI likes to land troops on the beach and then just leave them standing there).\n\nEven the helpful information pieces on each unit and building to tell you what each of them do and to provide historical context has been moved to an online service, so if you don't have an internet connection you have no idea what anything does until you can build it. Honestly, what was wrong with just having that as part of the game?\n\nThen there's the fact that the game has glaring mechanical issues too - perhaps most pronounced in the closed system of the Britannic tribes, where often times if you start as the Iceni you can find yourself in a ridiculous stalemate where everyone has a 20 stack of identical units and can't take anybody else's city because of the garrisons and can't build more/better units due to a lack of cash. The root cause of this ofc is the fact that even across cultures all the units are fundamentally the same - they're all either swordsmen, spearmen, cavalry or missile units, and since all the units are equally terrible it comes down to a simple matter of whoever has the most men wins - which may be fairly accurate historically but it doesn't make for an enjoyable experience in-game, particularly since you can't have any more than 20 units per army.\n\nThe blandness of the uni choices is further compounded by the fact that a lot of the abilities and formations don't do what they're supposed to; the testudo is underpowered if not totally useless and when last I checked the shield wall had literally no effect whatsoever.\n\nI'd recommend the original Rome: Total War game over this (or any other Total War game really if you're not set on the time period) any day of the week.","September 27, 2014","false","5.9"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The AI is actually a decent challenge on very hard to legendary difficulty. The AI make Armies and fleets with power behind them and usually attempt to out number you 2 to 1, sometimes it's 3 to 1 and it is almost impossible to win unless your units are all elite and have amazing ranks (which wouldn't happen cause you wopuld be in serious debt) The senate mechanics actually mean something now. The only thing i wish they would put in this game is a option that you can force another faction to make peace with another faction.....too bad they didnt do that. The game runs great now after the countless of optimization patches they have released. The modding community makes this game fun as hell to play and makes your campaign experience much better cause most people use mods that make the construction and unit build times better. Overall I think i have said enough, It is time to start playing this game again cause now you are finally missing out. Believe me you will no longer regret buying this game and will play it for countless hours. I also recommend buying the DLC pirates and raider becuase in multiplayer if they are used right , they can be extremly deadly. The multiplayer is decent now and connection issues are mostly resovled!\n\nMy final rating for this game with mods is a 10/10 becuase there is so much more added content wise\nThis game in vanilla state had managed to achieve a 9/10, still a good rating to be honest.\n\nThis game overall i would give a 9/10, it's entertaining, fun, sometimes difficult, and just plain awesome.

I've loved these games unconditionally and went straight to the local games shop to preorder when I heard that there would be a sequal to the legendary rome title.\n\nFirstly, when it was released and I went to collect my pre-order, for some reason 'there were no DLC codes left' for me to collect my additional context (which was the Greek cultures pack). I don't know or care if it is the retailer or the supplier or whoever that buggered that up, what I care about is seeing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ price on the DLC pack in my library every day even though I went to the effort of pre-ordering and paying the whopper pre-order price. So that was the first little slap in the face.\n\nAnyway, this story gets far worse. I'm from South Africa and the bandwidth ain't so good here. I get like 100 KB/s on average downloading context through steam. You heard me, 100 KILOBYTES. Im sure you know what is coming next. I install the flipping 30gb or whatever onto my computer and fire it up like a giddy child at christmas. Unfortunatelly, it is bug-littered like you can't believe as we all know. Soon enough the gargantuan patch comes out - 5 gigabites or so if I remember. This naturally takes about a week to download, with my laptop on and connected 24 hours a flipping day. Literally, it just sat downloading in my room for around a week,  keeping me awake at night and highly frustrated.\n\nEVENTUALLY, the patch downloads. Is the game fixed? NOPE. its hanging and taking forever to change turns and weird patches of black are rendering on the map and AI is stuffed ETC ETC ETC we've heard it before. And my machine is WELL above the reccommended specificantions (not the minimum specifications, the recommended specifications). At the same time, something went wrong with the synching between my steam account and the game, so that my achievements stopped unlocking (something I seem to care about although I can't explain why). I look everywhere online and the only solution seems to be clear out the local content. I KNOW RIGHT, CLEAR THE !*$#*&%! LOCAL CONTENT. DESPERATE to get my monies worth (if you think this game is expensive, try converting $60 into South African Rands!), I eventually decide to clear local content.\n\nAfter deleting the game, however, another patch was announced, and I simply counld't muster the emotional strength to try and reinstall and download all the s*&$ neccessary to get this game to SIMPLY RUN. It has been sitting on my shelf ever since, a painful reminder of the godawful experience of trying to play the game and the unholy waste of my money that it was. I literally spent about 1/4 of my monthly income on this title. Everyday I get a flare of anger when that f*&*!@# Rome II box blinks in the corner of my eye and I think to myself, *@#! you CA and everyone involved. I don't give a crap if it has been finally updated to a playable level in 'the emperor edition' - it is still about 2 weeks of downloading and a sea of negative feels away from me ever bothering to try this game again.\n\nIn total, excluding loading and crash times, I probably squeezed about 10 pitiful hours of painfully buggy and interrupted 'play' out of this disgrace. I don't even know if the game is good, because I  never got to really play it, although most people seem to say its crap compared to previous titles anyway.\n\nIn conclusion, if you live in a developing country with crap internet, and were as excited to play this game as I was - throw away you commemorative Roman tunic, or better yet, just hang yourself with it.","October 25, 2014","false","38.6"," 80 of 150 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","80","150","0","12"

Rome 2 is up there with the great gaming ♥♥♥♥ ups  of recent years; in fact, I'll go so far to say it's the Aliens:Colonial Marines of strategy - a game hoped for with a naive twinkle in my youthful eyes, but resulting in only despair and depression.

There are still some bugs such as ships traveling through land and siege engines being stuck in the open. The AI can sometimes keep moving it's units back and forth until you attack but i have noticed that with all the total war titles.\n\nThe AI is much better on the campaign map and will hide its units for an ambush or fortify defensible areas against attack. It is very aggresive and will show no mercy against newly captured and unguarded cities. ALWAYS destroy all enemy armies before advancing. The AI on the battlefield is not as bright as on the campaign map but will always hammer your archers with a cavalry charge from the back even if it means scuicide. It will also attempt to surround you and try to outflank you instead of a head-on assault.\n\nThe graphics are very well done with a couple of odd textures. The units move smoothly and are visibly tired and will run much slower if tired. Siege battles are well done with one walled city to a province and 1-3 unwalled towns within the province. It provides a good balanced between sieges and assaults; although most of the major battles will take place in the major cities.\n\nUnits are varied very well between each faction but wiht the same style of units per culture or related factions. Each unit types has major advantages and disadvantages: the spartan hopolites and pikeman for example, are superb against cavalry and frontal assaults, but are tightly packed and vulnerable from flanking, archers, or siege weapons.\n\nthe tech system is completely different from any other total war and is not the best. It splits into two parts: civil, and military. The trees are poorly done and are not deep at all. there are usually only 2 braches per section. If you like the family systems and ruler systems you had in previous total war games, you will be disappointed. There are no families or even rulers, it is all about holding political power among your faction. Having your balance of power too low or too high will result in a civil war and many army stacks appearing at your capital. You have gravitas and gerontens. It is pretty confusing at the start but once you get the feel for it it becomes easier.\n\nOverview: Rome 2 is a huge step up from the original launch and has a very well done AI. There is a great balance between walled cities and small villages and unit types are very well done with weaknesses and strengths. The political are tech systems need a total makeover but could work in the future.\n\n\n80/100\nRemember, Rome wasn't built in a day.","January 1, 2015","true","287.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Now after almost a year since it's failed release, writing a review on the current game seems a proper thing to do. First of all, considering how proud CA were in talking about their huge budget, i expected something 10 times better then the final product.\n\nFirstly, it was false advertising with the graphics of the game. In the gameplay trailers they touched it up alot to make it look better then it really was. Then in the Teutoburg forest gameplay they talked about how the battle maps in Rome 2 will be very detailed and unique like in the historical battle. Sadly, all the maps look basically the same. Unit selection i simply miniscule. Then i go to the most annoying part of it all. The DLC whoring. I had a fear that with Segas huge involvement in this game, that they will release a few DLC like they always do. But i didn't expect it to be on this scale. The sheer lack of respect from CA just sums up how they treat their customers. Releasing units that were already in the game (Camal Catapracts) and then selling them in DLC for 2.49 euro. The sad thing is that the modded units are 10 times better then the CA ones. The simple fact that CA looked at factions that people played as with the all factions playable mod and then locked them so they can sell them for over 7 euro. That was the major change in my attitude to this series. Not to mention the lack of basic features that i expected in the game. They took out so many things that were put in Shogun and should have been in Rome 2. Agent cutscenes, family tree, better advantage for killing a general. In Rome 2, they just create generic generals which replace the general who had been killed. So now losing your only family general which is also your family leader makes no difference. Because a new one just appears. Also, the fact that the game just creates random generals sums it up in this moment that happened to me. I was playing as the Julli and it passed the date caesar came to the military scene. I saw he was in the game when i was creating a new army, But!!!!!!!!!. He was with the Junia family. The Junia family. The family of Brutus who killed Caesar. Not to mention his name is Julius. Julli-Julius. But yeah, thankfully he wan't the family leader so i was able to adopt him.\n\n\nAnd this brings me to the political system. Has got to be the most pointless system in total war history. Why in hell would we use the assassinate a rival family member with the option in the political page for 12,000 denars when i could just end him to his death in battle. Not to mention Gravatias is pointless and is only a negative because it starts civil wars.  It doesn't give you high office positions like in Rome 1. It doesn't get you popular with the plebs or senate. So whats the point. The simple fact that the Ai for rival family only uses the political options on you if you have enough money to counter it. So for example, if it costs 10,000 to adopt a member of your family. They will not try to adopt him unless you have the money to stop the adoption. This means all you need to do is have a generally low treasury and the only thing the Ai will do is attempt assassination. And this brings me to my new point. Just a simple question. If you have a skilled general leading your only army against the enemy, meaing if that army were to be destroyed, your entire nation will fall and the only person who can win with that army is this skilled general, why the ♥♥♥♥ will you try to kill him, potentially bringing about the complete demise of your nation. The same applies to when your army is finally built up and a battle is soon to come. Then the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ai family kill your general, making the army leader less and losing a huge amount of morale. It just makes no sense.\n\n\nAnd just 3 more things. The whole point of Capture points are to prevent mosspits. But especially as the greeks, all you need is pikes at the entry points in the gates and the walls and you win no problem. I literally had a levy pike unit with 2000 kills by doing this. Why would you take out the material requirements for certain buildings. Why must a mod fix your mistakes. How in hell can i make a blacksmith with no iron circulating in my empire. And lastly, although many might disagree. The online avatar was a good idea in my eyes. Although people who had played for awhile will generally dominate new players, new players could till win. I did it many times. People with the DLC would think they have the advantage, but with the right movements i would win. I loved upgrading my avatar and giving him new armor aswell as giving my troops unique colors. For Rome 2 there was much potential. The amount of different types of general apperances was huge. Eastern, celtic, roman, dacian, germanic, punic, iberian, greek, nomadic, mix of eastern and greek. But they took it all away and made multiplayer a boring match up game with no attachment to your units. If i lost my veteren samuri unit, i would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Even if i won the battle, it would be a loss to me. But in a match up, you have no attachment to these units. If they get destroyed, who cares.\n\n\nPersonally, i would recommend you buy this game on sale, DLC wise, they are boring. I bought both the Caesar in Gaul and Hannibal at the gates when they were 5 euro and i never even played them. I only played the Factions they unlocked on the grand campaign. If you want a fun total war game. I highly recommend Medieval 2, Rome 1 or Napoleon total war. If you want a newer total war. Get Shogun. It was the whole rotate on campaign map feature and the generated maps aswell, which are better then it is in Rome 2. This game has been a huge failure in my eyes. Poor graphics considering their budget, boring and liveless campaign and the horrible DLC whoring. I got all the Rome 1 DLC including the base game and Medieval 2 and all it's DLC for the price of just 2 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC in Rome 2. I was stupid enough to pre-order this game. I'll think twice before they release a new one. Hopefully, they detach themselves from the SEGA money monster and start making total wars which they actually put effort into.","August 24, 2014","false","535.8"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","18","31","0","6"

It revamps territory, politics, military infrastructure and armies amongst other things, but the changes more than not are either not radical enough or just worse. To be more specific:\n•	Territorial changes and the Province system:\nI love this particular idea and personally is probably my favourite thing about Rome 2, the new larger territories and very complex building trees makes it far more complex and tactical to manage and maximise food, happiness, research speed, military, population and of course PROFIT. The disadvantages of higher level buildings are too steep and It does have the downside that you often left sharing a province with someone you don't want to kill but have to. The max limit on the number of edicts you can have is also obnoxious.\n•	Politics:\nBare, often meaningless and a money sink easily the weakest part of Rome 2, but i really never found this stuff to be that good in other total wars either. So still actually an upgrade, just didn't get taken far enough.\n•	Military:\nMilitary matter have really remained unchanged, in my limited experience the armies often feel a little bland and are far more realistic than rome 1, with factions often having similar armies. Army traditions are underwhelming like the political aspect but this is easily fixed by mods.\n•	Balancing and combat:\nCombat is a strange affair here, when Rome 1 launched combat was far too short and the AI was rubbish but it has got a lot better and now is of decent length with standard fair total war AI (so still pretty damn dumb). I find that skirmishers are very good in T:R2 with more infantry fight often becoming slogs (especially if you use defensive infantry) and with cavalry generally being somewhat slow in total war terms and taking a lot of casualties when running through archer units to chase then down, but the balancing is pretty good.\n\nI personally like rome but always find myself only playing it for short times before stopping, even though I can't find a reason why I do\n\nSo it's a good game that continues the franchise. It's not rome 1 (my favourite) but it's ok and can be easily modded and improved by mods.\nI'd recommend it if you've enjoyed the other Total Wars, but i am not going to called it amazing or terrible it's GOOD nothing more nothing less\n(I am enjoying the rise of Constantine mod now, makes combat take forever and totally changes tech trees, army traditions and general upgrades)","August 16, 2014","true","165.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Since then the gama has been patched into a stable and playable state, and thanks to mods I have gotten my moneys worth out of this game.\n\nHowever even considering the much improved emperor edition I cannot recommend this game. Battle AI is terrible and seige AI is downright laughable. Interesting mechanics and actual strategy are abandoned in favour of absurd arcady features (burning down metal gates with torches?), units have trouble keeping formation and most battles are over before you have a chance to flank or apply any real strategy.\n\nProper sieges are non-existant and most cities do not have and cannot build walls. Even cities with walls may be instantly taken the turn they are attacked due to the ridiculous torch throwing mechanic. This was supposedly an attempt to reduce the number of repetitive sige battles present in earlier games but it has the opposite affect of forcing the player through the same uninteresting garrison battle dozens of times every campaign.\n\nThe graphics are good (but not amazing) and the historical immersion is ok, but still with enough inconsistencies to make me cringe (why does Syracuse not have walls?).\n\nAdditionally Creative Assembly has joined the list of developers which dole out features which should have been in the base game in the form of overpriced DLC's. This is downright insulting considering the state of the game upon release.\n\nOverall as much as I tried to enjoy vanilla Rome 2 It has too many flaws which ruin the experience, for every thing I enjoyed about Rome 2 there were 10 frustraing things I didn't. If you are looking to enjoy the total war experience I recommend Shogun 2 or Rome 1 with mods.\n","July 3, 2015","false","272.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/214950/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","Here we go again.\n\nRome 2 did not have a pleasant launch, but after lots of fixes and some really lame DLC (Seriously, I have to pay to play as ATHENS? SPARTA? You have got to be kidding me), it is done. Or at least it won't be getting anymore updates despite the fact that there is still at least one thing (broken achievements) that need fixing. But with Attila out and this Warhammer thing coming soon... I doubt CA or SEGA cares about this game anymore.\n\nShame too since it's not bad. Since Shogun 2 got the series back on track and back into the realm of the more melee-centric combat CA is just better at doing AI for, Rome 2 generally does well.... mostly. Melee combat in this game seems rather overpowered, or rather ranged combat just does not seem to do much damage before the big melee brawl begins. This means that any faction that traditionally relied upon arrows and stuff to do much of it's work is at something of a disadvantage... unless you are the Parthians or someone else with awesome horse archers. But if you don't have speedy horses, or you play as a nation that relies more on "skirmisher" ranged units that are mainly on foot, then prepare to be eaten by the melee juggernaut that is Rome or any country lucky enough to have Macedonian-style Pikemen. That's not to say that you can't win. You can. It just will be rough.\n\nDo I sound bitter? Well, I sort of am. And the reason for it lies in one of the game's historical battles that, because of the game mechanics I described above, is basically impossible to do as it was done in reality. Which battle do you ask? Cannae. Yes, that Cannae. The legendary victory Hannibal won by using a smaller and more lightly equipped army of ~50,000 to surround and annihilate an entire Roman army of ~80,000 men. To make that work you need to have your center, consisting mainly of lighter troops, manage to not have their morale break as they fall back until you are able to use your elite troops on the wings and your horseys to close the Romans in. Except... your center is going to get eaten alive by that giant mass of Romans. Even if you get far enough to close the net (and I did), it all went to hell once the center broke and the Romans were able to then eat their way out of this encirclement. One of the most famous battles of all time... and I had to win it by exploiting the game mechanics (which has the Roman Army march straight ahead for a while no matter where your actual troops are) and forcing all the Roman troops to chase my lighter troops all over the map until I was able to pounce on them after they got exhausted. Even then, it was a mess.\n\nSo CA messed up one Historical Battle. Who cares? Who even plays HB's anyway? Well, I do for one since they are neat and some of them have been very well done (See most of the ones in Napoleon). Even so, I concede that the campaigns are where the meat of this game lies. And in that regard... well it's mostly good. It takes times to get used to the new city management stuff in order to balance out things to make sure the people are happy, fed, and paying you the monies you need to FIGHT EVERYBODY - because you will be fighting lots of people in this game. But that isn't a problem because, well, it's Total War and all that. The whole point is to fight people. o_o\n\nMy biggest problem with the campaign part of the game lies in the AI's -very- heavy tendency to use force march to dash little armies all over the map running just out of range of the armies I have chasing after them. Unless you can corner them, the AI can just keep doing this over and over, particularly at sea, with you having great difficulty in managing to force them into a battle at all. Unless you do one of two things. First, you can deliberately weaken your own forces so the AI decides to attack you rather than flee. You still will deal with AI armies and fleets running around, but some will attack you at least. The other thing I ended up doing was to take a city/town, then leave it open and undefended to temp one of these AI roamers to attack it, and then (since you can't really move with the army that takes a city after it has done so that turn) eat them when they can't escape. I find all of this... rather annoying. >_>'\n\nOh yes... those victory conditions. Can't forget those. Makes every campaign game take a very long time. And there are soooo many factions to get achievements for. ;_;\n\nThe battles themselves, aside from the stuff I wrote above about how the game seems better geared towards melee combat, is fine. Lots of variety in the unit types, and the distinctions between the different cultural groups in terms of their strengths and weaknesses add quite a bit of variety to the tactics you have to fight against. The AI still does stupid AI things you can exploit, but at least they can put up a decent challenge at other times. On land at least. At sea... well. Lets just say that ramming ships very much became my tactic of choice. It made most naval battles, even when the odds were stacked against me, pretty easy. I had more difficulty with having my ships getting stuck on the wreckage of enemy ships and being unable to move than by any real opposition the enemy put up. Oh well. At least the land battles are cool.\n\nSo... overall impressions? Fairly mixed with a positive leaning, as it was with TW games during it's Empire/Napoleon days. Rome 2 does stuff right with being a competent game that has fun battles, but then annoys me with it's AI armies running all over and how the game's battles seem much more favorable to melee-heavy factions like the Romans or Greeks (unless you are the Parthians or some other horse archer country). One last negative is the volume of DLC SEGA put out for this game. Yes it's kinda neat to play so many different varied factions, but some of the factions that ended up being gated by DLC (Athens, Sparta) really should have been playable from the start. Rome 2 is a major offender when it comes to excess DLC, and SEGA seems all too happy to continue that trend into the future. ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. >_>\n\nAs for the DLC campaigns, i'll review those individually. I still need to play some of them to see how they are anyway. If nothing else, you can certainly get your money's worth out of Rome 2. There's enough stuff to do in this game to keep you playing for a -very- long time. Or at least until you get bored or aren't a crazy achievement-hunter like me.\n\nSo... this gets a "yes" from me while I frown slightly at CA for some of it's mistakes and glare at SEGA for all it's DLC. This is a competent game, but I still prefer Shogun 2 even if this game has -way- more variety with it's factions.\n\nGet this on a sale if you want it. It seems to end up on sale often enough, and you don't want to buy all that stupid DLC for full price. Trust me on that.\n\nBwee...","March 2","true","245.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

All they've done is patch the bugs and (slightly) finish the political/civil war system.  Even the best modders out there can't fix the way buildings and provinces interact.  The main problem is that if you don't have all the regions in a province your buildings are *much* less efficient because all buildings provide their bonuses on a province-wide basis.  This results in you declaring war on your allies when they take the wrong province in a war.\n\nWhy declare war on them?  Because there's no way to diplomatically deal with it.  You can't trade provinces or even give them to your client state.  You can't threaten to intervene in a war between your client state and another.  The diplomacy boils down to: "Want a trade route?" or "Declare war?"\n\nThese fundimental issues are unmoddable, and every time I come back hoping to see improvement it never is there.

The campaign UI really does do a poor job conveying information, often hiding the information you want in metrics that are misleading. The diplomacy system is wretched, as rather than being able to freely specify an amount, you are required to give in incriments of 10% of your treasury. When trying to get AI powers to sign trade treaties, its rather odd to offer them several thousand gold because you can't offer them a few hunderd.\n\nOn the battlefield, the combat is more of a grind. Even when flanked or encircled, units will stick around for a disconcerting length of time. Naval combat is not an improvement over Shogun 2, and the tactic seems to be, "Get artillery ships, win." Battle is just not as fun as in past games.\n\nOn the campaign map, the province system is rather clunky. Having multiple areas connected to a capital really makes things problematic from a strategic sense, since it makes far more sense to go all or nothing, and take an entire province, than settle for a portion of it. Additionally, the objectives given in the single-player game, while historic, force the player to play the game in a way that might not be fun for them.\n\nIn short, Rome II has shaken my faith in the Creative Assembly as a quality development studio.","November 8, 2015","false","87.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Campaign: As always, Rome 2's campaign is a mix of turn based strategical management on the campaign map, and real time battles. For the most part, the AI does a good job managing their cities and armies. They don't make foolish mistakes, they defend their cities, and they attack any vulnerabilities left by the player. The UI is fine, but the lack of branching skill trees for generals can be annoying. The removal of family trees is another annoyance as you feel no attachment to your faction's characters. One place where Rome 2 shines, however, is its variety. There are dozens of faction to chose from, exact numbers based on DLC, all of which have interesting units, traits, and challenge levels.\n\n2. Battles: Once again, we see the return of CA's battle AI. While it is not totally imcopetent, it consistently makes moronic mistakes. It will engage your pikemen head on, charge cavalry into the front of heavy infantry, and often attack with no real tact. However, the battles are still fun. Troops are easy to control and the battle UI is slick and customizable. Sure, when a cav unit inexplicably gets stuck on one lonely spearman it can ♥♥♥♥ you the hell off, but it never detracts from the overall expirience.\n\n3. Multiplayer: Due to the variety of factions, Rome 2's multiplayer shines. Each faction is fun to play as and offers different stregnths and weaknesses. The added bonus of phasing out the battle AI is just the icing on the cake. However, technical issues still at times hinder the multiplayer, as you will often expirience severe lag and will occasionally be dropped from the game.\n\n4. Graphics: As one of the best optimized PC games out there in its current state, Rome 2 has no issue delivering both stellar graphics (in-battles and on the campaign map) and smooth framerates.\n\n5. DLC offerings: While the 'Wrath of Sparta' DLC fell short, and I still have yet to see the point of 'Blood and Gore,' Rome 2 still has some fine offerings for DLC. Some packs will add fun new factions, and others will offer new, full legnth historical camapign scenarios to be played out on customized maps. Without a doubt, 'Hannibal at the Gates' and Caesar in Gaul' stand out from the pack as superd additions to the game and engrosing windows into some of the most fascinating wars in antique history.\n\nWithout a doubt, Rome 2 stands out as one of the most extensive and deep offerings in the RTS genre. It is a stellar game and in its current condition, and it is the best Total War game to date.","November 25, 2015","true","3.0"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","22","39","3","0"

So I really tried and wanted to like it, being a huge TW fan anyway.\nBut I have to say R2 was and is a deeply flawed, partially completed, hastily assembled, sub-par product. It has no redeeming qualities compared to other games of the franchise. Yes they fixed some bugs and improved some features since the original release, but even now R1 back from 2004 still has the better gameplay experience in my opinion. Especially considering the abundancy of great mods for it. No, R1 wasn't perfect, it has it's flaws that's for sure. And modders work alot on R2 now too.\n\nSo one might ask why compare a vanilla R2 with a modded R1? I can only say Why not? Did time flow at a different speed in CA HQ? Is it unfair to compare the work of paid professionals to that of unpaid amateurs? The year is the same for everyone involved. R2 has to be judged in context and that contains all the modding advances since R1. Ideally CA would have incorporated all that, both in terms of essence and polish. And they should have dealt with issues like pathfinding that have plagued the franchise since the very beginning. They certainly had the time to.\n\nAll that being said, it is still only a game. It is playable. It does not CTD on launch. Has a menu. Options...\nWhy not get on with it? Well what ticks me off is CA showed some really poor business practices.\nThey just ploughed on into release of the game despite clear awareness of all the major inconsistencies in design. They heavily marketed and pushed the game despite knowledge of the inherent, dyed-in-the-wool problems. Simply put scamming customers by deceiving and misleading them.\nAnd instead of taking responsibility and to apologise afterwards when people found out, they tried to cover up ("only 2%", "it's a feature") and shift blame on customers for their "unreasonable expectations".

Most of them are dedicated to finishing a campaign, and that's because I didn't want to say that preordering was a complete waste of money. After all, the game was playable after the third fourth patch or so. By the time of the seventh patch it was quite an enjoyable experience.\nHowever, do NOT repeat my mistake and judge the game by this photoshopped "screenshots", as I did, back when they were the only thing to base my preorder on. They are not even close to the real deal, and that's coming from someone who played it on the so-called ULTRA settings. Believe me when I say that Rome II at launch was looking worse than his predecessor. I won't ever bother with glitches and bugs, as the released version was so unpolished that you just couldn't get to the point of actually seeing them.\nThe Rome II as of May 2014 is quite OK. Is not nearly as good as it could have been, if it wouldn't have been released in an Alpha state. Some of the small things that made the Total War series so good have been either cut out, or simplified. Some of the features and units have been hidden in the game files, just to be unlocked by DLC along the way. And that's outrageous.\nFinally, the multiplayer is a joke. Remember that cute avatar system in Shogun II ? With cute little units gaining experience so that you can drag them in future battles ? It' gone. The multiplayer in Rome II is from a technical standpoint  any point of view underwhelming and should only be considered if you have a friend to play with and you are bored out of your mind.","May 3, 2014","false","95.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

I prefer Vae Victis because it centers on historical accuracy and includes the ability to play every faction.\n\nCreative Assembly used to be fairly diligent when it came to historical accuracy; but now they can't even be bothered to correct the misspelling of an important Celtic tribe of the period, the Atrebates, as Atrebartes - even after many patches and updates and multiple DLC.  CA is only in it for the money now and the days when the devs loved the history enough to care about such things is long gone.

I have been playing the Total War series since Rome 1. Every iteration of the Total War has added new things, and sometimes removed others. I have known about the negative attitude towards Rome 2 for some time, but I decided to try this game with an open mind.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the fact the the graphics were very buggy. Bear in mind that this game has been out for over a year as I write this. I have an Intel i7-4770K processor and an Nvidia 660 OC at 2GB, and the framerate was mostly smooth. However, there were tons of glitchy pop-ins out in the distance. Sometimes, the soldiers would glitch, causing the skin to be removed from their faces revealing their teeth and eyes. The game was otherwise quite smooth and the load times for the game were better than Shogun 2 (well, for me they were).\n\nThe next problem is all of the little things that were removed from the game. There are many things, so I will only list the one that kills the game for me: No captains. In Rome 2, it is impossible to remove smaller units from a general's army and have them operate on their own. You cannot leave any behind to protect your settlement as you advance. In order to improve your defenses, you have two options. You can either upgrade your settlement, which improves your basic garrison soldiers. Or you can create a new army, new general and all, and have them camp there forever. It gets better, though, as you can only recruit generals from your capital (at least in the singleplayer campaign). If your front line is far away, you will have to wait until the army is completely built before you can send it there, which takes several turns.\n\nThe no captains decision was clearly made to address player complaints in multiplayer. It is so obvious that this game was made to be played in multiplayer. On the Steam community forums, you can find people complaining about people abusing small armies. Thats like complaining about the "noob tube" in the COD series. Removing something just to gave unskilled players an advantage is terrible, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. You can't even send cavalry to scout.\n\nI can't give this game a score because I feel that I didn't play it enough, but thats only because I found the lack of captains to be completely game breaking.","September 27, 2014","false","23.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

We return to the age where we will relive the ancient Rome, the greatest empire ever existed in human history. Compared to the first Rome: Total War, this one is completely different in most aspect. Some might think this game is great, some might think this one is not great. This is my opinion.\n\nThe gameplay, it is clear the game is becoming more streamlined than the previous, settlement are now being managed in provinces, with each provinces contain 2-4 cities including the province capital. Recruitment, public order and food are now provinces wide so you don't have to build barracks or temples in all of your cities. Battles are also improved, with soldier that throws javelin before charging, like the Roman Legion, doesn't have to wait to stand still to throw their javelin. Research tree are also present. Auto resolve battle now has 3 stances with each stances has different advantage and disadvantage. And now, each army or fleet must have a general or an admiral commanding them, and the amount of general and admiral that can be employed is limited, which mean, there will be no army spam in the map. Diplomacy is also improved and there are more treaties can be made.\n\nThe graphics has also been improved, both on real-time battles and the campaign map. They look even better and beautiful, if the game runs the right way. Unless you're running the release version of the game, which contain many bugs and glitches even to the graphics itself. Unit collision is a mess. And sometimes which is most of the times when the game is first released, there were many texture errors from the menu, loading screen to the unit model, terrain and many more. It was mostly fixed by now.\n\nThe AI, I think this is the worst part of the game. The AI on battles are somewhat stupid, extremely basic, their morale is also low, losing just 40 men and they start running away even the when they outnumbered your army. They even sometimes didn't move at all and if you play battles without time limit, this could be a problem when you're outnumbered. AI siege weapons don't move at all most of the time. Now with the game has been patched several times, the AI is improving, but still not really good. At least now you can have some challenge playing on harder difficulty.\n\nBut other than that this game is great since many patch made through. I recommend this.\n\nUPDATE: Now with the release of the Emperor Edition, Total War: ROME II is now better than ever. The AI working as they should now although still not perfect. The performance is also great, and I notice that with medium setting, the graphic looks way better than previous medium setting. Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition are now very playable.\n\nRating 8/10","February 18, 2014","true","178.9"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","17","30","0","3"

The game lacks depth, for example, I have played 300 hundred hours of this game and that has been over half a year. Rome total war 1 was better because of the engine it used. The engine used for this game was meant for RANGED combat, not melee. This is why there is just a complete moshpit and no orginisation what so ever. The ancient Romans didn't break formation like they so easily do for this game. Now I have over the reccomended specs and I still have a frame rate drops. This is unacceptable. Napoleon, Medieval and Empire don't have framerate drops for me, so why does this? Total war Rome 2 was cleary rushed by Sega in order for them to get some more money. This can be seen from the amount of DLCs which have had to been added to the game. The old AI designer was fired? Why? This new one which has creatred the AI for Rome 2 is not the best to say the least and that's putting it mildly. If you have below the reccomended specs, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! This is because when I played with just under it, it barely ran on the main campaign screen, never mind the battles! Even with above average specs, the game still looks terrible! In today's day and age I would expect to see these graphics on the PS4 or Xbox 1.\n\n\nIn conclusion if you want a MILDLY historicly accurate Roman game then go straight ahead... but only if it's on sale. But be warned, if you want to play as Sparta etc, you will have to buy the MoneyMakingDowanloadableContent (MMDLC). Out of 5 stars? 3. An average game... hopefully Creative assembly and Sega can top Napoleon and Rome 1 otherwise, the Total war series looks like it will die.\n\nThanks for reading.","June 22, 2014","true","639.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Thats not acceptable, the dlcs are really expensive and add too little, and lots of things that were added in Shogun 2 were basicallly removed from the game, Sega and Creative Assembly STOP!!! Dont fu*** up total war, do Expansions!!!! not those bad dlcs that just add facions that shouldve been on the game!!! Even Rome 1 had more factions the Rome 2 wthout dlcs...  This is still a good game and i recommend it, but total war is becoming a cash grab and i dont know for how long this will continue, Attila already has 1 dlc announced and probably 1 blood dlc to be realeased as the animations shown in the gameplays dont have any blood.","December 31, 2014","true","72.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have spend many hours on Rome II and yet I still keep coming back for more. Whether it be to try a new faction, a different early game strategy, change up my research priorities, focus more on naval prowess rather than raw manpower, empower trade over combat as a continent-spanning empire or mix up my tactics in the battles themselves.\nThe Total War games are packed with content, like the unique scenario battles that represent a key conflict in history, narrative campaigns and tutorial campaigns that each require a few hours or more of your time at the very least while presenting a mostly distinct experience, many entirely separate factions each with their own various traits at both a regional and cultural level, and the grand campaigns.\n\nEach of these is a massive undertaking and has almost endless permutations for the path to total victory, dependent on any number of the factors mentioned above. You can even use the skirmish battle system to try out all different tactics and unit combinations from any of the numerous factions present in the game against a battle AI that you can freely adapt to your tastes in terms of difficulty. Lastly, Rome II offers an expansive suite of multiplayer options to back up its gargantuan single-player offerings, allowing you to play challenging battles against your friends or compete for global domination through the usual turn-based campaign system, even if the multiplayer isn't as functional as I would like! I have put many hours in every single Total War game and each new entry is both fresh enough and packed with quality to easily justify that kind of investment time and again - truly, this is a franchise that knows how to eat up the small hours of the day. If ever you needed a game to kill time in while trying out multiple different approaches to victory, allowing you to succeed either through making friends or destroying enemies in equal measure, then Rome II has been tailor made to match your desires.","June 3","true","172.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alienpope/recommended/214950/","alienpope","Alienpope","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alienpope/","291 products in account","I've been a HUGE total war fan for over 10 years. I've played Creative Assembly's games for 100s upon 100s of hours. Rome 1 was legendary! Medieval 2 was grand! Shogun 2 was beautiful! Rome 2 is................ the product of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, stupid, ugly and lack of creativity (oh the irony) all smashed into one. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN CA?\n\nI will put this review in different categories. I will compare this product to other total war games. (My playthroughs have been on the hardest difficulty.)\n\nThe campaign: You start of as a small faction with a limited amount of armies. As you capture more and more cities you get stronger. Pretty basic for a strategy game isn't it? However... you'd expect the AI doing the same right? So you wont steam-roll the whole map once you get strong enough to do so. In shogun 2 there would be atleast 3 other factions in the endgame who would give you a challange. In rome 2 this never happens! Not even a single great empire rises. The AI is almost non-existant! Its like playing chess against a 2 year old!\n\nThe battles: Where you are supposed to have the most fun! THE BATTLES! It is here where you the tacitical mastermind can shine! And yes! you do shine! ALL THE TIME! Is it because you outsmarted the AI? YES! and no... Outsmarting the AI in this game is like outsmarting a potato. Either the AI doesn't move at all (mostly this happens in sieges) or the AI do the most stupid moves not even you can think of.\nDoes the battles look epic? yes kinda. The projectiles look awesome! how the stick to the shields, bodies and bounce off things. But the actuall melee look like a mess. soldiers rubberbanding all over the place and bugging out. Soldiers now only fight 1vs1. Which is a downgrade from Rome 1. that game was made 10 YEARS AGO! In rome 1 armies clashed realisticly. In rome 2 armies clash and morph into a huge epileptic seizure.\n\nGraphics: The graphics is good. It isn't outdated or anything... but compared to Shogun 2 it is basicly nothing. Shogun 2 had great lighting effects, an amazing set of colors, beautiful water effects and so on. Rome 2 have all that completely removed. They've put in some cool facial animations... or so they say. Never really seen it. other than their mouths opening and closing from time to time.\n\nLast words: This game is build upon a game engine designed for Empire total war. That shows. the projectiles works great! But that's about it... The melee was never a key focus for this engine. And thus the battles look stupid and kill immersion as soon as armies clash. If you haven't been a total war fan you might find this game fun. If you are a total war fan and know what this series can do.... then... You will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. As many fans are.","January 29, 2014","false","246.1"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","21","38","0","3"

They have added upgrades to the culture system, seasons and seasonal effects (both visual and in applying bonuses or penalties), campaign and battle balancing, more playable factions and units, building chain revamps (more variety of buildings and chains), and various performance improvements.\n\nThe latest update, which upgrades the game to Emperor Edition for free, has modified politics and civil war in ways that are very impactful to your campaign. You have reason to constantly track your family or partys influence, having to assasinate your own generals for fear of sparking a civil war or engage in political actions to improve your influence. Failure to do so results in harsh public order and tax penalties that will really cause you problems if you dont handle your politics correctly.\n\nThe update also adds improvements to the user interface (color coding various things and reworking the politics screen), although overall the ui is not as visually appealing as in previous games. It also adds the Imperator Augustus campaign, which adds the playable Armenia faction to the Grand Campaign as well. It uses the Grand Campaigns map while adding various roman factions and changes to other factions to fit the setting.\n\nOverall the game is as it should have been when it launched last september. However, the user interface still a downgrade from the beautiful Shogun 2 scrolls. You also dont get as attached to your generals as in previous games (partly due to the lack of a family tree and the minimal importance given to aquired character traits). I would have also liked to have seen the return of the system where some settlement buildings were spread out across their territories (e.g. the farms or gold mines of Shogun 2 being represented on the campaign map as potential targets). It got removed in favor of the province system and of armies using the raiding stance in enemy territory, even though both systems could have worked in tandem to greater effect. It would have also made strategic raids of provinces more interesting since you had an additional, strategic target to attack or defend besides settlements, ports or other armies.\n\nIn short, the game has substantially improved since launch and the Emperor Edition is a testament to that. I give the game in its current form a solid 9/10.","September 16, 2014","true","396.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Очень хорошая графика, сочетаемая с детализацией и тактическими возможностями. Однако, она наследовала и все недостатки предыдущих, а именно набор одинаковых (в больше мере) штампованных населённых пунктов и локаций, которые начинают надоедать через определённое время. Также ограничение по фракциям, которое потом снимается постепенным введением платных дополнений. За это винить нельзя - это бизнес, и это стоит того. Но вот совершенно, на мой взгляд неудачные дополнения с отдельными малыми картами регионов типа Гальской компании Цезаря и Ганнибала у ворот - совершенно не оправданы. Они не интересны своей скоротечностью и ограниченностью. Во всём остальном - игра замечательна.

The release was rocky; I was one of the lucky ones who got to play from the release. To say the game is in a similar state as the release (Or, at least from my experience, buggy) has not played the game recently.\n\nThe game has an inferior "feel" to shogun 2. I can't pinpoint what exactly causes this... I suspect that, perhaps, the in-campaign maps are not as stunningly beautiful as those in shogun. The game also has a few "logic problems". For example, when defending a point after fortifying it, the game has a tendancy to automatically force one into the least advantageous position. Come on! If I were fortifying a position, I'd do it from the top of a hill, all the better for my giant fireballs to crush people!\n\nThis said, TWR2 is quite fun to play. CA has done a lot to fix the game, and my FPS are finally jumping up. A widely varied unit roster is good to see, in comparison to shougun. Some of the controlls have changed since shogun, as well. For example, a pike phalanx is told to attack by clicking through the enemy unit, not clicking "attack". Tactically, this is more intuitive, but can be rather confusing for veteran players of past TW games.\n\nI strongly advise buying this game...on sale. The gameplay has not improved enough since shogun 2 to justify spending 60 bucks on TWR2. 40, or perhaps 30 dollars would be closer.\n\nWait till the summer/fall/christmas sale, buy the game, go crazy.","September 4, 2013","true","179.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Don’t go by the recommended requirements as it will likely not deliver the proper gameplay for this good game.","November 8, 2013","true","263.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However, since then  the game has made a beautiful comeback and is all around the best strategy game on the market right now. The multiplayer scene is a bit of a mess, with all of the barbarian sword rushes, but it still is fun. The barbarian sword rushes are easy to counter as long as you bring an eastern faction such as armenia or parthia, or you could just bring another barbarian sword rush army. But not everyone brings the barbarian sword rush army which is cool, you very rarily run into pike boxes, and the online community is really nice.

This game lacks a lot of content that more serious gamers would appreciate, as has been the trend with the Total War series. It is also based on an engine built for for cannons and gunfire (IE forward, not up and down), not catapults and arrows, as such, it doesn't quite feel like some of the units are doing what you'd think they would.\n\nIts got beautiful graphics, but lacks a lot in the sound department. The AI is alright, but kinks can be found and exploited rather easily when you get used to the game. The game is slugish even on better machines, and you may find yourself waiting for the turn to end for what seems to be a rather long time.\n\nThis aside, if you love everything Roman, this will definetly be something for you to try, maybe look for it on sale though. :)","March 8, 2014","true","16.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I've waited till all the patches were in place. I've got all the expansions, dlcs and so forth.\n\nAs a fanatic of previous Total War games (all of them, but Rome, Medieval and Shogun 2 are stand outs) I really wanted to give this game a chance too, without the bug madness and all that.\n\nI think over 100 hours of gameplay is more than a fair chance.\n\nPROS:\n- The game runs fast on the highest settings.\n- The units are detailed.\n- The UI is convenient enough.\n- The campaign map is nice, realistic and not too cumbersome.\n- The army specific traits are a nice addition.\n- The graphics, on highest settings, are very nice to look at.\n- Plenty of mods make the game slightly better.\n\nCONS\n- The Game has been stipped down to bare bones.\n- The AI is laughable at best, both strategically and tactically.\n- Family trees are gone.\n- Diplomacy is completely void.\n- No matter what difficulty the game is too easy (as Rome I've conquered the whole map in less than 100 turns).\n- Units lose formation, every battle turns into a brawl, or a mosh pit at best.\n- As long as you field the heaviest infantry possible you win everything.\n- from a tactical standpoint, all battles are the same, once you have defended a camp, or a city, or attacked a camp, or a city you have seen everything there was to see.\n- Naval combat is a sad joke.\n- Even the units and buildings icon look cheap.\n- The technology tree is non sensical.\n- City building is limited to a maximum of 6 buildings (usually 4-5) in capital provinces.\n- Every faction looks different but behaves the same way.\n\nOverall 4/10\nYes, the game is playable, not buggy (as of April 2015), and looks great. Too bad it's not funny, there's no sense of achievement, and a total failure in terms of strategic and tactical play.

Command vast armies in your hands!\n\nWhat I think of the recent patches? The game is getting better and better in my own opinion. When it first came it, it was very buggy which I admit that. The campaign was very confusing because without a clear of political system.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was that there is no avatar mode in Rome II. I was getting hyped and had high hopes about it which I was expecting something big. That gotten the best of me and I should be more self-aware of it.\n\nDepsite of that, I am still happy that I got it. There are many who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about it. Then, why you bought it in the first place?\n\nYea, it's called marketing. Customers should have the right to know of their products before making a choice. Didn't I know it was going to have a bad launch?\n\nThe patches has improved the game and need to go deeper in CA's website and the forums to know how the game work. If you didn't preorder the game, you will have to pay separate to get the Sparta faction along with Greek factions. Others are paid DLC and some for free which that depends  how worthy they are.\n\nThe another biggest disappointment was that the Beast of War is a wasted 3 dollars because in my opinion should be a freebie and should have focused on making a avatar mode package instead with real time strategy like Crusader Kings II and other strategy to give more fluid campaign in multiplayer.\n\nWith two disappointments in the way, how does it holds up? It's good, but that not good. Rome II's battles are very damn impressive and I mean it's a beauitful to wreck destruction on destroying things and massive battles.\n\nThe Army system is much better and there's no need to setup garrison which you can focus on the invasion while your settlements has it's own garrisons. It's a unquie Army system that you can named your armies and navies as you can give them symbol of their standard, pick a army skill, and better understand how you will use your army works.\n\nGenerals and Agents works the same way like in Shogun 2, but the sad part that family system like in Shogun 2 is not that instead replaced by Political system that no one seems to understand. That's a another disappointment as well.\n\nHow I rate this game with the latest patch? I give this a 7/10 for unqiue world on terms how Rome II wonderful is, but it has drawbacks.\n\nIt is better than Rome I? In my  opinion, it's much better and more impressive than Rome I  because I think that CA did their research well except their fantasy units.  Multiplayer is another story.\n\nMultiplayer before the patches was broken at the start and it improves better with the patches. It's just like Rome I with a new map choice. It has co op and head to head campaigns in Multiplayer which it has nothing else to do there.\n\nEither you love it or hate, Rome II kicks ♥♥♥!","September 9, 2013","true","673.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's not a diplomacy game as all of the Total War games but I can say that diplomacy part is quite advanced than Empire or Napoleon. As a fan of Europa Universalis I think this game still lacks diplomacy but in the other hand, you directly control the army, do manuevers to defeat your enemy, ambush them etc. To be honest, it's quite hard to control a huge army, but watching every single man fighting is the joy that Total War offers. This game is a good one to buy I think but, I have to remind something; you better buy "Blood & Gore Extention" because without this one game wouldn't be that fun to play I think.","February 8","true","24.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Being the successor to Rome: Total War, there are some pretty big shoes to fill. Yes, Rome II provides a splendid variety of units and the unique factions - an aspect which Shogun 2 lacked. Yes, it is a great leap in graphics in comparison to its predecessor. Unfortunately, the game's substance does not live up to the hype it generated prior to release, leaving much to be desired:\n\n1. The battle AI is subpar compared to its Shogun 2 counterpart. (Campaign AI is okay)\n2. The game is not well optimized unlike said Shogun 2, whose graphics are pretty comparable.\n3. The political system is more an annoyance which drains resources, and merely requires you to shuffle your generals around rather than being an actual mini game which requires proper strategizing and attention.\n4. The traits system for Generals are unlike Rome 1, which were honestly pretty perfect a formula with the outcome of battles directly influencing his characeristics.\n5. The immersion from pre-battle speeches is watered down to a mere monologue by some unit you have to manually zoom in towards.\n\nI wouldn't call this one a terrible game, it is pretty good without comparing to the other titles in the series - I still play it from time to time when I need my Rome fix. However, it is more style than substance, with prettier graphics masking a pretty unfinished/unpolished game that will never be able to meet its full potential. What a shame indeed.\n\nB-\n\n\n","June 24, 2014","false","138.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Also they have been updating the game and even gave us the nomadic tribes DLC for free if you got it in time. What im trying to say here is just because someone says something is bad and they show "proof" dosen't mean you should jump on the bandwagon. i've personally gotten no glitches in my time playing this epic game.

I see they are still asking $54.99 for this disingenuous mess. I read the above claims and realise that the gaming industry has plumbed new depths of cynicism and laziness. The game was broken on release, we all know that. Now a year of updates later and there is a clear split between die hards defending the game no matter what and people attacking it no matter what. I realise it will be difficult to get to the truth and  know if this is the game for you. I suggest you read as many of the posts as you can to get a better understanding of the problems. Also, you only have to look at what the modders are doing to try and add content to this game to realise how empty and vapid the whole thing is in vanilla, especially their much vaunted political system which is non-existent. You will not feel immersed or invested in the political and diplomatic system. The modders are guys working on their own time and providing material for free whereas CA release DLC that adds nothing to the game but charge you money for it. The modders are more hard working and dedicated to the idea of Rome II than Creative Assembly ever were or certainly are now. But the mods can cause problems with the vanilla build so you will have to be cautious there. The point of all of this, is that to get enjoyment out of this game you have to work, you have to research what mods you want and find work arounds for a plethora of issues and problems with de-synchs and AI etc. My opinion is that for $54.99 you should be getting a game that is a finished and polished product.  I for one will never be pre-purchasing anything on steam again. To sum up as best I can, the battle mechanics are now ok, and I believe if you just play multiplayer battles there is probably fun to be had here. However, if you want a rich and vibrant grand strategy game filled with political and military adventure and misadventure as advertised by CA you will not find it here. You will find a world that makes little sense, a world that is devoid of character and is not fun to be a part of. No amount of patches can fix what is ultimately wrong with this game - that is, at it's core, at it's heart, you will find it doesn't have one.","July 15, 2014","false","204.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The Sluggish controls, seemingly squishy units, and very blocky feel to the game left me speechless, in a bad manner. I cannot really say I enjoyed playing custom games either, I enjoyed having unlimited money and spending it on my units to make a long match with highly trained units, I also enjoyed knowing what I was looking at.\n\nComparison and Contrast:\nI: Solid old controls, tried and true, amazing to follow interface, simplicity.\nII: Trying to Build on older controls, more optimization for hotkeys, less focus on actual interface, seems over cluttered.\n\nI: Basic and easy to follow art style, easy to find out the differences between units.\nII: New Theme for units, old card style. While bold, hard to follow and often misleading.\n\nI: Campain meant for the player.\nII: Expanded campains, extreamly large stories, historically spot on.\n\nI: Controls feel smooth and responsive, units feel like they know the commands.\nII: Slow and sluggish controls, more options present better fighting and different battles.\n\nI: Highly optimised, but still good looking graphics.\nII: Amazing high end graphics, low end graphics look like someone took a large mexican style dump and smered it into a shape resembling a man, or is it a woman?\n\nI: Units have minimal soul, feeling like numbers rather than soldiers.\nII: Units have conversations and end up giving the player attachment.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game to someone who has played Rome the first as much as I have, it may or may not be a let down; Rather, I'd assume someone could enjoy this game, but from my personal opinion, I'm glad I got the ability to play before I bought, this wasn't something I can play.","September 26, 2014","false","0.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

My only complaint is that diredting units on the battlefield can still be clunky but no more so than the other games in the series and in fact I would say it is a bit better in this edition than others.\n\nIt seems fairly well optimized for my PC, but I did have to turn down some of the graphics settings for the big battles when I had troop number maxes out. I run a GTX 760 though and I imagine if you have a 900 series card you should be able to play all maxed out. I got 121 hours of play out of this and did not even do the last scenario in Sparta. I may play that campaign later after a break, 121 hours and I think I have had enough for a bit, lol! I recoomend you get this game if you like the other games in the series.

Hey you can poison a well in the village.. sure, but where are the family trees.. i'd like to LIKE someone! .. You can upgrade your generals... But they feel IMPERSONAL.."\nI even tried to get drunk and play like i'm used to play Rome 1 .. oh .. it doesn't work.. it just p....... me more!

They shouldn't have tried to fix things that weren't broken.\n\nI've played TW games since the original Shogun, my favorite being Medieval II Total War, which improved greatly upon it's predecessors. Medieval II TW was intuitive.  Unfortunately Rome II was clunky and far from intuitive.\n\nThe interface seemed to be a random hunt and peck setup, scattered throughout the screen in a chaotic order.  Many details that added color to M2TW were removed from Rome 2 and then things that created nothing but tedium were added. The unit cards were larger than necessary yet gave no way to know the exact number of troops in a unit by looking at them; you have to guesstimate.  The creators also decided to use a mimicry of old Roman art instead of more appealing and identifiable pictures:  I feel that was an aesthetic, if not functional, mistake.   Management of settlements and provinces was limited and yet clunky.  Most everything is based off fighting penalties and not gaining bonuses.  Overall control leaves much to be desired, yet the AI factions, of course, flourish without fail or penalty.\n\nAttilla looks like it made some improvements although it uses much of the same flawed system, so perhaps I would suggest playing that one over Rome 2, but honestly I have not had enough game time on Attilla to accurately commit to that suggestion.\n\nAll I can say is that Rome 2 has been painfully dissapointing to me, and I write that with sadness as a TW fan.","June 30, 2015","false","5.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

However, doesn't feel an inprovement at all with respect Rome, or other Total War games. After finishing the grand campaign here are my feelings:\n\n-This is a couple of things that they have done better but fall into nothing\n\nThe political intrigue is more deep now than the mechanics with the shogun, the pope, or the 3 rome factions. However, is completely worthless. I have spend millions of talens to secure promotions, I have only active my family generals, and adopt and bribe any other character, and still I only have a 35% maximum of the senate control. The civil war meter hasen't move from 0 in the entire campaing.\n\nThe thing about the provinces seems like a good idea, you can also build into several settlements at a time which is nice. But doesn't seem to have a significant bonus. The province control seems rather useless other than the own satisfaction of sorting your own stuff in an arbitrary matter. You can't even interchange settlement in the diplomatic view to complete provinces.\n\n-One thing that is actually an improvement respect Rome.\n\nThe art style is fantastic. It quite similar to Shogun 2 in regard of placing you into the historical settting. Not so much the music though; not bad, but not good neither.\n\n-Other than than the game falls flat in many aspect.\n\nThe AI is horrible. Is worse than other TW games. Most of the naval battles are the enemy waiting there doing nothing. And the diplomatic interchange is just silly. I have multiple faction declaring war on me, only to surrender in the next turn and giving me 5000+ talens in compensation without even having a battle.\n\nThe combat seems simplify respect other titles. I remember using way more siegue weapons, archers, hoplites and lancers, and their respective special moves. In here I don't have a feeling of actually having to do anything on the battlemap. And to make things worse, the last tier lancers are replaced with swordmans preators, which are cool and nice, but albeit no sustitue for a spear wall.\n\nAnother thing that I have no idea what is for, the victory/strategy points in the battle map. Previously, if you loose the plaza, you loose the settlement. Now nothing happens. there is a flag that goes up and down but it has no consequence. The only thing that you can use it for is to capture gates and towers, but nothing else.\n\nThere are bad things with the IU. For example now you can click and draw a unit where what should happen, and what happened before is that you will make a square for multiple selection, and this is quite annoying actually. Another thing is that the tactical map in the continent view doesn't draw the icon if you zoom too much; why?? doesn't make any sense. The diplomatic view could also be mix with the tactical view, they are pretty much the same. When you click a general to figure it out the family you need to click in another 3 menu and look for him manually. The artifact bonus thing, I got 50+ extra at the end of the campaign without use. And I haven't figure it out yet how to build the coliseum. And the slums are horrible and annoying, there is no way to have a multiple settlement view to tell you where are space available and you need to look for them manually or else the slums will pop-up.\n\nAnd finally, the DLC market strategy and promotion/spam aspect of the game is not acceptable. There is a constant reminder to "buy this other cool stuff" all over.

There is a huge map with large number of opponents but it all feels more oppressive than grand. If you're willing to put a hundred or so hours into the game it will most probably be rewarding but as there is no short-campaign option, more time-challenged gamers will find this too slow paced. The need for large investments of time in each game you play means that it can be almost impossible to see why one faction differs from another (apart from starting position) as the bonuses don't add up to large gains very quickly.The unit cards used as displays for what is in your army don't differ enough and the user interface is unusually cluttered without actually revealing any more information than the previous games in the series did. All in all it means the user will have to have a very long look at the game's encyclopedia before any action takes place.\n\nThe parent company, Creative Assembly, have continued to release patches for this game but have also continued charging a high price ($80 AUSD base game + $7 AUSD for factions/unit packs +  $14+AUSD for campaigns) coupled with core-game features needlessly hidden behind DLC (Blood and Gore, All the faction packs for the grand campaign). Imperetor Augustus campaign is a good free DLC and there should have been more for free up to the point of writing this.\n\nOverall 2.5/5 - The tighter combat and map design in Shogun 2 was more to my liking. I live in a place in Australia were online play is unstable so I can't comment on this game's multiplayer.\n\n","August 9, 2015","false","23.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

Some people argued that it was to be expected from Creative Assembly and was no worse than empire however having played both games (and all the ones in-between) on release I would disagree and say it was actually worse simply because of how poor some of the underlying political systems were along with my own views on some of the directions taken (most significantly the removal of family trees and adoption of one turn per year). Basically to me the game wasn't just broken....it was bad.\n\nThere is no doubt that within the last 3-4 months Rome II has improved significantly, so much so that I would argue it is actually a fun and playable Total War game. Performance is now at least on par with what you would expect from a demanding PC game, the AI has seen a number of improvements and while not problem free it is more capable and responsive on both the campaign and battle map. The amount of small tweaks implemented have also made the user experience much better including removing the performance tanking 'ghost' unit icons and adding numbers onto the unit cards. More promising mechanical changes have also started to be implemented including modifications to the culture and recruitment systems within the last patch.\n\nA huge part of Rome II becoming more enjoyable to play is due to the work of the community and the various free mods developed for the game, adding the steam workshop on release is probably one of the best moves that CA made with Rome II. While not averse to applying mods I generally like a more 'vanilla' experience however Rome II is an exception and I could not imagine playing without 2 turns per year, unit icon and Trait overhaul mods.\n\nDespite improvements and mods issues still remain with Rome II, the political systems are obviously half baked and lacking in explanation, the game relies on far too many unit buffs and incremental improvements which are sometimes put behind other systems which despite having played 40+ hours still make next to no sense ('Gravitas', 'Authority', 'Cunning' etc). The AI still displays moments of utter stupidity or non-responsiveness, especially in sieges which will hopefully be further improved upon by patches. I would also say that despite tweaks the 'blobbing' of units is still a big problem, this may be more down to the lack of unit object collision detection that is inherent to the engine CA is now using but units still have a rather nasty tendency to morph into a single compacted blob which doesn't always make for interesting battle mechanics.\n\nSo overall...I would be willing to recommend Rome II. I think it is somewhat helped by the fact that the time period is probably the most suited and interesting it could be for the series but the game has also improved a lot since release and will hopefully continue to do so. A complete revamp of the political systems along with a re-implementation of the family tree would be highly appreciated however I do not expect this to take place until the inevitable retail expansion. Up until that point we have a fairly flawed but nonetheless fun and working experience that will hopefully be improved upon further into 2014.","December 22, 2013","true","94.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

Also, ramming is the way to go, over and over again until everything dies.\n\nit feels like the AI cheat. I had a province rebel at me, they attack it unguarded and managed to size controll with a minor force which took quite heavy casualties.

And the Rebels where more trained than my standing army!\nLater on I dealt with rebels, took the city back but had to fight public disorder which I couldn't lower in any way.\nSo I ended up in war with neighbouring countrys, moved my army away from the town and BAM! New rebel army stormed in and sized controll once again without any kind of warning.\n\nThen Carthago attacked.\n\nI sailed out to engage one of their minor fleets. Didn't have the movement point to engage them two meters away from port for unknown reason so my fleet stopped in the middle of the ocean, surrounded by enemy fleets.\nThis is when I notice that the army I'd told to garison the town, was loaded on ships following my fleet. I had never told them to load onto the boats at any time during the campaign.\nNeedless to say, it was a slaughter.\n\nAnd this is a few turns after I tried for several turns to get another army onto another fleet but couldn't do it for unknown reason again.\n\nIt's so frustratingly unintuative, uninformative, cluttered and clunky that I can't even play for an hour without tearing my hair.\nAnd on top of that, the whole game look like two steps backwards in graphical quality compared to Shogun 2.\nI seriously can't understand how they ♥♥♥♥ed up so badly on every level when you look at their last game!","July 15, 2015","false","15.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

Rome 1 is better despite the dated graphics. Shogun 2 is better and you get more for your money. Overall an ok game brought down by cutting corners, bugs, and missing features. Also much of the game needs to be bought through dlc which is pretty lame. Battles are odd even after many months of patching. Campaign is 'streamlined' to a point how mcdonalds cheeseburger patties are streamlined steaks. This is the weakest game besides the weird mobile/tablet games. Unless you want to have nice looking soldiers fighting from ancient history I would pass on this. Overall 4/10 reviewed on 7-18-14 which is after countless patches.

Javelins are devastating if left to do their thing, cavalry if used correctly does exactly what it should, and top tier troops can last a VERY long time.\nThe battlefield AI is on occasion outstanding. On these occasions it can leave you gobsmacked. The AI's usage of Line of Sight and it's ability to wait until the right moment in defensive battles is particularly impressive. Siege AI is passable and often very good, it is good enough but still needs work mainly to resolve ongoing glitches.\nOh, and most of the magic abilities are gone :)\n\n\nCampaign\nWhile the styling and design of the campaign mechanics are up for debate, Rome II's less clinical approach to empire manangement is on the whole more involving, much more maleable and less predictable.\nIn Emperor Edition public order is more complex to balance, and also much more changable. Seasons, wars and other factors can contributed to large changes and overall it is much more complex to manage than previous games - which used 1 single attribute for this - population. Rome II's system is more complex and fickle, and for me this is a good thing. In Rome II you will find yourself destroying buildings and redesigning entire provinces often, something I have never done in previous games.\nSteamrolling is a thing of the past in Emperor Edition - Creative Assembly have finally reduced player income to sane levels, a good player can still make a lot of money, but no way near as much as in the past/previous games. Late and mid game will be much better now.\nThe updated Civil War/Politics mechanics now actually does something, which is good, but the system as a whole is still in my honest opinion nothing more than a polished placeholder with glaring ommisions, such as dynasties/families - no longer can your character have long lasting bloodlines where their offpring inherit traits, like in Medieval 2 for example.\n\n\nVisuals and Performance\nThe game looks and performs very well with a few exceptions - like when a gate is on fire with a lot of men around it, or when thousands of bodies litter the battlefield.\nThere are a LOT of units in Rome II, but because of the sheer massive amount of factions (around 150 in the grand campaign) many factions and cultures can start to feel a bit 'samey' - hopefully we will see further unit/faction packs/freelc's to remedy this. Overall i'm very happy with visuals and performance.\n\n\n\nSCORE\n8.5/10 - A great Total War game.","September 23, 2014","true","419.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Chuck in some of those generic, scripted kill move animations from the campaign map XD\n2- Ruin the campaign by ripping out key features at the last minute to hasten release\n3- Utterly destroy the already abysmal AI, literally go all out on this, make it as utterly stupid, amateurishly wacky and as bizarrely comical as humanly possible, remember, you can never have too much moshing and be sure to stir in extra lashings of slapstick seige behaviour.\n4- Rip out popular factions, set aside to resell later to fools.\n5- Rip out animals, set aside to resell later to fools.\n6- Rip out blood effects, set aside to resell later to fools.\n7- Place in the hype oven and crank up the heat to BIJLLSH|T FACTOR 10, No! make that 11\n8- Tell barefaced lies about content that will be included at release and tell more brazen lies about the general quality of gameplay.\n9- Pay Shill reviewers to spam 90 - 95% scores before release, PRO TIP - offer for 'pre release purchase' because once real reviewers get their hands on this turd... we are sooo busted : o\n10- Remove from the hype oven and release to the unsuspecting public, take the cash and run, but maintain a steady supply of fools gold by drip feeding members of the imbecilic 'Fanboys Union' all the witheld content via an EA inspired, blatantly gratuitous DLC \/\/horing policy\n11- Season generously with many fail patches that are designed only to mask problems rather than solve them.\n12- When the playerbase backlash becomes too much and it's painfully clear that the Meta score will only keep on plummetting try a cheeky reboot : D Rebrand the game as Emperor Edition with yet another fail patch in a pathetically futile attempt to draw a line under the whole shameful sorry affair, deny everything.\n13- Make a quick Steam Workshop inspired reskin mod and call it Attila, add insult to injury by slipping in some of the ripped out campaign features : P and laugh again all the way to the bank as a mighty host of halfwits with no memory, no ability to learn from mistakes or the past, no capacity for critical thought and an over developed propensity to slavishly swallow every spoonful of hype fed to them throw cash at you.\n14- Warhammer lol, rinse and repeat step 13","July 5, 2014","false","75.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","3"

Continues the long line of grandcampaign inovation that we have enjoyed from the series. Some of the minor factions lack distinct units and as a result can feel like blah. However, the historical major powers are great.\n\nSeige play has always something that bothered me about the series because there was not incentive to attack. You could starve out the units and not suffer any damage to your stack. This game fixes that with both sides suffering attrition. As a result you have decent seige fights now. Furthermore, stacks of units regen per turn so you don't have disband and send up replacements.\n\nThis make upgrading more desirable as the units produced can surrvive for many campaigns making the turns to build improvements finally cost effective. Before in rome 1 having three more stacks of legions built was always better then a 4 turn upgrad as bigger armies always won an gained you more income.  This is no longer a issue.\n\nI don't agree with the "army limt" but, it does slow snowballing and allows for epic battles bettween larger empires later into the campaign.\n\nBugs: Mostly ironed out, but some strange AI behavior on the battlefield. In my opinon its not that bad but keep in mind i'm a  fan of the series so I'm used to Rome 1's staionary army bug where you had to wait 45 minutes for the batttle to end.","January 3, 2014","true","885.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Gameplay is poor most of the factions are unavailable unless you buy dlc that should have been part of the main game to beginw ith. The AI computer both main map and espically combat is beyond horrible even worse than Rome 1. No family tree you, cannot buy garrison units without a damn general. City building is too limited and buildings effects make no sense how does getting food lower happiness. Sea battles and combined land sea battles need more work. Capture the flags in pitched field battles make 0 sense. In seiges perhapes holding important city blocks it does make sense. Unit cards are beyond confusing. Graphics are not all that great certainly the screenshot slook better than the game running on max everything.  Unit blobs to much and inability to give certain commands like stopping pila from being thrown. Animations of units break down rapidly into poorly constructed affrais testudo appear slike magic rather than disciplined troops forming up. Huge step back from Shogun 2 which was a step forward. This game should only be bought for 75% off from an already reduced price. Side note maybe by the end of 2014 it will be playable unmoded and maybe the opus it was suppossed to be rather than the rushed ♥♥♥♥ it is. Creative Assembly and Sega have had only excuses rather than admiting they failed in their promise.

Complete, utter failure. The patches made it more then playabe now. But, it's still very rough around the edges. You'll find yourself sighing in dissapointment when all your units do is just clump up and a huge cluster♥♥♥♥ in battles, and fail horribly to keep a steady-formation in battle.\n\nThe archers in Rome 2 are just horrible. You'll find that flaming shot arrows are completley pointless. Despite the looks. It's just disgusting. They literaly go through troops and do nothing. The standard/heavy shot seems to devistate. Also, a huge problem is in battles, they never seem to want to shoot. I've lost battles cause of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThe cavalry is very awesome in Rome 2. I love the diffrent kinds of types/formations. Never gets old when you hear the thundering hooves of pure devistation. Though, it seems that the light cavalry is really underpowered when it comes to actual melee. Imo, don't rely on medium/light cavalry in battles. They will dissapoint you to the fullest.\n\nThe amount of factions/settlements available to play as / fight is AMAZING. Compared to just a few years ago, (Napoleon, Empire, etc..) It's a huge improvement. But, the lack of diplomacy options kind-of ruins it. Like, example. I was playing as Rome, and I conqoured All of Germania, Carthage, Egypt, and most of the major factions. The Selucid empire was being dominated by Parthia, and we were Very Friendly, and they DECLARED WAR ON ME. The desicions are horrible by the AI diplomacy. It infurates me that a mod for Napoleon: Total War has better AI desicions then the latest installment of Total War.\n\nAI-Wise in battles are alright. Way better then launch. Nothing much I can say. I am satisfied with it.\n\nNow. The thing that floors me, and makes me highly resent Total War: Rome 2, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T and LIES In the SS's. The actual graphics in the game are alright, but NOTHING Like in the screen shots. I've managed to get a 45-50-60 ratio FPS With medium-high graphics, and I am floored to say that they are nothing like in the SS's. My friend irl has a very nice PC. And can run the game on extreme to 55-60 FPS And it still can't compare to the SS's. Pretty cheap that you guys have to lie to impress.\n\nAlso, the lack of multiplayer options is dissapointing. I cannot say how dissapointed I am that I can't do the awesome customization, as in Shogun 2 in Rome 2. I'm not a huge fan of Japanese history/culture. But the idea in acient roman times is AWESOME. And the fact they didn't add that is ♥♥♥♥-taking.\n\nWell. I guess my final verdict is a 6/10.\nHuge dissapointment. Thanks for ruining a great oppertunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, I did a review on this a few weeks ago, almost a month. And I had to say. It was 100% Honest. Luckily, I have some new things to say about the game, and it's future according to my opinion.\n\n\nSo, a few weeks ago, they released two major updates, on fixing the game and it's problems. And now, I have to say. The game is excelent. The faction-ballance has been improved, so one unit of pikemen in a phalanx can't hold off 5-6 other units. The units look ALOT better. I am very impressed and suprised on how this is.\n\nNow, the things they did not fix. And really dissapointed me.\n\n- The barbarian tribes starting-units are still AWFUL. I mean, 20 seconds of engagement, and they already are broken.\n\n- Some factions still seem un-playable (Such as, Epirus, Boii, and some others.)\n\n\nNow. This is what tons of people want to know, "How is Caeser in Gaul", "Does it suck?", "Is it worth the $15?"\n\nIn my opinion, no, it's not. The actual CiG campaign is really weird. It's near-impossible to recruit more units, and if you dare lose Caesers "Legio I Galacia" You're screwed.\n\nBUT. It is really cool that they add more barbarian tribes to play as in the normal campaign. It's really fun fighting the Germanic tribes as the Gallic tribe, "Boii", and seize control of Beligum as "Galacia" (Something like that.)\n\n\nAll in all, I do recommend this to any TW Fan. And I hope they are still to improve it.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10. Way improved.","January 31, 2014","true","329.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

But I am so disappointed with this game that I feel that I must do it.\nAs you can see in my profile, I have been trying desperately through hours and hours of playing, to make this game enjoyable, remembering how wonderful and superb this saga was with Rome I and Medieval 2. If I had never known and played his two predecessor (rome I and Medieval 2), I think I should have enjoyed rome 2, but I knew them and I loved them. Then, the question is inevitable: how can Rome 2 be such a big failure? (yes, it is a big failure, no matter how more patches you bring). Here is my answer directly to Creative Assembly:\n\n- DO NOT RELEASE a BROKEN GAME. I can forgive you the first time, with EMPIRE, but AGAIN AND AGAIN this is a JOKE.\n- If you do NOT KNOW to CODE a  IA to build correctly buildings so they do not auto-kill starving each of his armies… DO NOT ADD this feature to the game!. Or just make the IA CHEAT and give it infinite FOOD!.\n- IF I play Rome, I expect to fight cataphracts of Partia, or phalanx from Macedon, not ALWAYS LEVY Pikemen, LEVY archers, LEVY swordsmen…  AGAIN, If you DON´T KNOW how to CODE a decent AI, make it CHEAT so they can SPAWN ELITE units.\n- Reconsider about making strategy games with the absolutely brain-insanity features like:\n- If I AMBUSH an enemy army I can only use ONE army. (I usually force march my armies to engage IA armies one to one..  It´s crazy!).\n- A spy can poison an entire army of elite+veteran units with a high chance. Where´s the epic in that?. I wan´t “TOTAL WAR”!!!.\n- A spy/diplomat/heroe can´t STOP my army from moving from turn to turn. Where´s the epic in that???. I wan´t TOTAL WAR!!!.\n- …  don´t make me continue…\n\nFinally, I must say, because it is true, with all this flaws and design errors, this is a 7/10 game. But as I have written at the beginning, I will always remember Rome 1 and Medieval 2, and I KNOW how GOOD it COULD HAVE BEEN if you have done your work correctly. You have FAILED us, your hardcore fans, and you have FAILED…. HORRIBLY…   And there is nothing you can´t say or apologies to give to erase that in my memory. Please, I beg you, learn the lesson, and try to live and work true to the legacy of games like Rome 1, Medieval 2, Shogun, ….\n","December 26, 2013","false","449.9"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

That's great for them, I'm sure it'll keep them warm at night.\n\nOn the other, it left the fans bitter toward the developers and the producers, having been tempted by virtue of its predecessors. Where Rome I - for its time- was a phenomenal game, Rome II has failed to live up to its hype. Perhaps we have just grown older.\n\nComing on to the Emperor Edition of Rome II, we have finally recieved a game worthy of the series' reputation and the money spent acquiring the thing.\n\n\nRome II set out to change the series, which is an admirable goal almost achieved- but not worth alienating its established audience.\n\nTechnical issues appeared, of course. One of the most off-putting was the change to the campaign's factions. Fans requested a more in-depth faction system, and CA divided the world according to numerous historical nations and tribes. It sounds good on paper; the sheer amount of factions, however, breaks the flow of the game by extending end turn times and slowing AI growth, so that the player's empire--once established--has no clear rivals, such as in Medieval II.\n\nSome of my pet peeves include the Faction DLCs- the worst of which is the Greek States DLC that cost me more than reasonably- and the odd lack of historical battles, which I fear may also become paid DLC. My will to make this game work paid off when I picked up the nomadic Tribes free, but it will take more than a few new cultures to fix this game. I particularly dislike the campaign AI, which takes its quantity-over-quality armies and finds the most isolated lands nearby to carve a short-lived empire before my army can sweep in, and I am forced to manually fight an easy battle that, if autoresolved, would have had my legions scattered. The political system is difficult to comprehend, as little clear indication is given of how it actually affects the game; it's no better (and not much worse) than Rome I's system. Similarly, character levelling is difficult because they die off quickly, and there is no longer an ability tree- you are choosing abilities blind.\n\nI found that many players complained about issues that simply required them to have had experience with past Total War games, or to have simply done a little exploring of the game to understand. The two that stood out for me were the battle AI and the new province system, and those issues and solutions are respective of each other. Let's face it: Total War's AI has never been top-quality stuff. I take it many of the complainers weren't around when it was making the same poor decisions in the previous games- that said, it is somewhat odd that CA hasn't yet developed a more advanced AI to give the seasoned commanders a proper challenge. As for the province system- it works. Move on.\n\nLuckily, most of the issues stated above are able to be fixed, whether it is by the developers themselves or by the now supported modding community. Negativity aside, there have been many great additions to the game that I hope will remain. The province system brings a level of strategy to building your empire, as you must now choose your buildings carefully, rather than simply your build order (arguably, that was present in Shogun II but grouping the cities into provinces shares their effects which improves the system). In battles, the men talk to each other and give the feeling that a battle is really going down; the cinematic camera works very well with this. Unfortunately, the unit-vs-unit AI is hard in my PC, and I can't view the battles up close. You can also now choose to fight replay battles again (Note that they're called 'replays' and not 'recorded battles'- as such, don't expect to be able to relive your finest battles exactly as they went).\n\nJust remember: almost everything that made Total War what it is is still here.\n\nWith everything said about the DLC, if you have the money I believe they're all worth it. The campaigns can give you access to neat mods on more detailed maps, and the paid DLC factions are certainly worth buying if you take a particular interest in those cultures.\n\n\nIt's still big, epic Total War. Buy this game on sale (like any game ;3 )","November 30, 2013","true","669.3"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

I played the game for a good 70 hours during the broken stages of the game playing the game as they fixed it slowly adding to my enjoyment as the game was slowly fixed. However I had a very long hiatus of the game around July time till a few month ago and If we fast forward to 2014 the game got its “official debut” in the form of the Emperor edition or as I like to call it, “The version we meant to make” it’s taken me from a game I found hard to recommend only to those who are hardcore Total War fans willing to wait out the storm to now I can highly recommend this game to those who enjoy the types of games however I have to make clear there are much better entries in the series.\n\nThe game is a successor to the first and probably greatest Total War game, Rome. Set in the same time period however now you have a hell of a lot more factions to choose from 117 factions, with say about 20 of those been playable of the top of my head including the DLC factions. The game also boasts a few very good campaign DLC with my personal favourite been Wrath of Sparta and Hannibal at the Gates, but each to his/her own if you choose to purchase them along with the faction DLC.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game runs just like all the games before it with a few new game changing implements such as: now Armies are formed under a general, you can’t make random armies and you only have a limited number of generals and fleets that is based on your successes of your empire in the form of prestige. Personally I like this new addition, it makes the game a little harder but does slow down the pace of majorly large factions but adds a tactical edge to the planning of your empire. The problem with this however is smaller, one settlement factions can afford to somehow field a huge, massive one General armies meaning fighting those small settlements is a dreadful thing to have to do time and time again, but I personally think this is to make the game harder so I can tolerate it and with the pace of the game by the time you are 50 turns in large factions already start to appear and that’s when large wars ensue. Another new feature is the region system, now each region has one large settlement and 2 to 3 smaller non-walled settlements. At first I hated this as you can’t add walls to all settlements making it feel like I’m not in controlled of my cities as much as I wanted but later I grew to like this idea for spicing up the game options and means I have to choose my buildings wisely. Overall I love all the additions to the games apart from Slums, Slums and go fornicate themselves but slums are easily avoided just make sure you build in empty slots before they appear.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics of the game are very well done, at the time of launch for the scale of the game I saw it to be a very beautiful game and even now I think the games graphics are done very well, my full system specs can be seen on my Profile however I have a TITAN Z with a 2560x1440 monitor at 144Hz and the game runs at about 30fps to highs of 90fps however I would still like to see some better optimization in the game as I feel they can do this. The graphics of the game really help sell the environments and atmospherics of the game from the African deserts to the green forests of Europe. I would agree with some that the graphics are not as promised but if I’m honest I don’t remember what we were promised and enjoy the graphics regardless.\n\nThe games rocky start means I wasn’t very happy with Creative Assembly who I always saw as a very high end professional PC developer who have created flawless games in the past but let’s hope they have learned from this.\nI can personally now highly recommend Total War: Rome 2.\n\nPros\n-	Beautiful looking game\n-	Classic Total War\n-	Easy level of complex and simple RTS management\n-	Lots of Factions\n\nCons\n-	Game can be very easy even on Legendary\n-	Game still needs some optimization in graphics\n-	Slums -.-\n-	One region factions have huge armies compared to there size","January 10, 2015","true","276.2"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","11"

So after waiting for a while to have some major bugs fixed, I finally decided to give the game a try.\n\nThe first thing I noticed at a faction choosing screen is that there were no hints as to what military strengths and special units each faction has, like in previous games. A minor disappointment, but a disappointment nonetheless.\n\nSo, after the game loaded I proceeded to make my first turn. I've always been taking my sweet time in such games, but even then I was surprised that my very first turn took a whole hour. The reason is a completely new interface (minimization is being popularised too much for my tastes in the later years), new features, and the lack of some old ones. After that one hour I decided to play the prologue first, which took me 10 hours, by the way, and didn't explain any of the things I wanted to find out.\n\nSo, what's there to notice in general:\n\n* You can't hire units without a general, nor you can move your armies without one. No more quick reinforcements from the heart of your empire. No more splitting your army to catch up to some weaker enemy armies with your cavalry. Speaking of which, I didn't notice a type of units affecting the overall army speed like in previous games, where hiring a siege weapon greatly reduced the army speed. But maybe that's just me.\n\n* Diplomacy has been significally cut. No more political marriages between the factions, no open map trade, no city trade. The only way to get a settlement in Rome II is to capture it, you can't purchase it from other factions anymore.\n\n* Several close-located settlements form provinces now. Each province consists of a city, where you can build your most advanced buildings, and 1-3 villages. Happiness is spread throughout the settlements you own in that province. Culture is spread throughout the whole province no matter how many factions own it. Which, in turn, can make alliances a little less effective, because you would obviously aim at owning provinces in whole, without having your ally spreading his culture to your cities, thus affecting a public happiness.\n\n* You can't adjust tax rates for each province exclusively anymore. The tax rate is the same throughout your faction. The only thing you can do is to exclude a province from tax collection.\n\n* There is no more faction family tree. Totally. The ony people your faction consist of are generals, admirals, and senators, which are fully interchangeable (a general can become an admiral, then a senator, etc.), and there is no confirmation as to whether they are even blood related.\n\n* Agents have become more useful. The main reason to that is because they can't die during a mission. At all. The worst thing that could happen to your agent after a failed assassination attempt is the agent being wounded and coming back to work in a couple turns. The only ways to lose an agent are him being assasinated or manipulated with an enemy agent. By the way, manipulating enemy dignitaries to join you is somewhat strange. I managed to capture a druidess and have her spread Latin culture the very next turn. Really?..\n\n* Even after so much time since the release of the game it has still got a lot of bugs. So don't be surprised if you get a critical error after winning a long and tough battle.\n\nThe overall rating:\nIf you are a fan of TW series, I'd still recommend to play Shogun 2 instead. Too many features have been stripped, not many new added in their place. But if you are new to the series and have nothing to compare it to, the game itself is good enough to spend a couple weeks on.","February 5, 2014","true","103.6"," 57 of 109 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","57","109","0","3"

The game suffers from AI problems and other misc bugs, and I feel it's not nearly as polished as Shogun 2 (one of the most polished TW games after expansions/patching imo), but it has a way better campaign, factions, unit rosters, building/culture rosters, and other features that make it a lot more fun than Shogun 2.\n\nI wrote a positive review about Shogun 2 before, claiming it to be the best TW game released ever, and while that's true for the most polished and bug-free total war ever, I feel that Rome 2 will become the better game if it continue to be patched positively.\n\nSo in summary, I feel Shogun 2 is the better polished and bug-free game.  Rome 2 is the more fun game and better campaign with more interesting units.  It just needs help to improve and polish it.","December 29, 2013","true","431.6"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","24","45","0","0"

It still isn't a good product. Why?\nI was shocked by CA's policy switch in making Total Wars in the recent years. The whole switch to arcadey styles, rushing, questionable and enraging DLC policy, closing mod development support and more.\n\nWhen Rome 2 came out, it was a mess. Unplayable, buggy, awkward in all aspects. Then all that mess about "listening" to player feedback, staunchly defending the obvious issues and ignoring them. After 15 patches here we are and I gave the game another shot. Still disappointed with the game mechanics and polish...and then they announce Attila. A reskin(Barbarian Invasion, anyone?) which any modder could make if they actually released proper modding tools and unlocked all aspects. All in all, the Total War series is dumbed-down, and in my opinion not worth buying until CA gets their bussiness together and stop charging reskins after reskins with overpriced DLC(Which should be in the base game anyway).\n","October 8, 2014","false","114.4"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","25","47","0","2"

I've played since Medieval I, and was blown away with Rome I when it first came out. I think CA knew that a majority of their players felt the same way, and made Rome II to be something much more grander than the original with their siege of Carthage video and the new Rally Point teasers. I pre-ordered...and CA played me well I'll give them that.\n\nI played through all the patches, but I think it's safe for all of the players to assume that nothing CA can do will bring back the immersion and strategy that the prior TW games brought to the table. I swear to you, I've never even bothered to look at the general's traits because they don't matter. They die before they become significant. All that matters is grinding them to commander, general, infantry commander II, and great leader and bringing them to your "training" Providences to pump out level III gold units for the rest of your armies so that you can steam roll the AI. Rinse and repeat. I've played many factions, and every time Rome is annihilated very early before I can even fight them...in a game called Rome II. Seige AI? Ha...just send out your useless plebs to attack their ladder units, and then slaughter the rest of the army at your gates when they abandon their ladders. Battles? Just use your infantry line to hold the enemy (after you take their skirmishers out with your calvary) while your javelin units get at least 200+ kills and eventually lead to the route of the enemy unit. No real strategy at all. You can use a different faction, but the same strategy always works. You can't lose unless you purposely try to. The series has been dumbed down beyond belief.\n\nThis is probably the only time I felt like I was scammed into buying a game based on past reputation and hype. CA, for me, has lost all credibility. I'm not saying I won't play again (because there is nothing else out there like the TW games), but I'll be sure to buy a game after it's "Gold Package" with all the additions is on sale for $25 (being generous), and the reviews for the game are above 8.0 out of 10 on the average. You'd be a fool not to do the same.","May 15, 2014","false","873.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The bad release, held back content for DLC greed, and over all bad form are just what the forums are full of. 12 patches later some of the launch bugs are fixed but you cannot fix what's wrong with this game. The AI is totally scripted and although you can break the linear campaign play by avoiding most political shanghia from "allies" you still get the same super stack factions that have to be scripted to do something stupid because they could just roll you off the map if they kept going. The building systems leave little to no variablity as you almost always need food and pub order just to build stuff. The the monetary system is so freakin ridiculously out of wack you end up with millions and have factions pleading for huge amounts of money for silly things just to spend down. A civil war that has no rhymn or reason just randomly pops. The combat is just blobs nothing like Rome 1 was. The AI cheats in several ways; not following the same economy as you, cavalry that has more moral than typical, ambushes when army was in clear sight...ect. Instead of the tactical battles that were the norm for this series you instead have a series of power ups that your generals "earn" so combat turns into a pause-fest unless you're quicker than snail snot ona hot day. They only difference in gameplay through difficulties are stat manipulations and nothing the ai does is situationally relative, hes just better....\nAll in all I knew the TW series was dying, I had thought Empire was it's death rattle. Sad to see it still spit up a few more titles before its collapse into this mindless arcade clicker.

Also there has been absolutely no real changes, since about December, and this is frustrating as the patches are large and (therefore take a long time to download) but often offer no real change unless the last patch had screwed up your game up and the new one may now correct it.\n\nAlso although worth buying (on sale), the DLC do not add much to the game apart from widening the very limited vanilla faction range or unit roster. You would have thought that having screwed the game up, they might have given units such as war dogs (present in Rome 1) to the poor people who have bought the game and put up with all the problems (and not charged them to expand the factions by three from the meagre 9 or so at the start).\n\nHaving derided the DLC in the section above, I must admit that the two campaigns are nice to play (on sale). (Out of choice go for the one with Hannibal, as it offers more variation in the opponents- Gauls, Africans, Italians, Carthage... etc.)\n\n[THEY ARE GREEDY] You just have to make sure anything you buy, including the game itself, is only ever on sale so as not to feed them so much money.\n\nThe game itself isn't really that bad, it just didn't live up to all the hype and this has led to a bad feeling running through the community.\n\nI would recommend it for any who like the total war series but I implore you to not expect much.","February 13, 2014","true","482.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","11"

I've played since Medieval I, and was blown away with Rome I when it first came out. I think CA knew that a majority of their players felt the same way, and made Rome II to be something much more grander than the original with their siege of Carthage video and the new Rally Point teasers. I pre-ordered...and CA played me well I'll give them that.\n\nI played through all the patches, but I think it's safe for all of the players to assume that nothing CA can do will bring back the immersion and strategy that the prior TW games brought to the table. I swear to you, I've never even bothered to look at the general's traits because they don't matter. They die before they become significant. All that matters is grinding them to commander, general, infantry commander II, and great leader and bringing them to your "training" Providences to pump out level III gold units for the rest of your armies so that you can steam roll the AI. Rinse and repeat. I've played many factions, and every time Rome is annihilated very early before I can even fight them...in a game called Rome II. Seige AI? Ha...just send out your useless plebs to attack their ladder units, and then slaughter the rest of the army at your gates when they abandon their ladders. Battles? Just use your infantry line to hold the enemy (after you take their skirmishers out with your calvary) while your javelin units get at least 200+ kills and eventually lead to the route of the enemy unit. No real strategy at all. You can use a different faction, but the same strategy always works. You can't lose unless you purposely try to. The series has been dumbed down beyond belief.\n\nThis is probably the only time I felt like I was scammed into buying a game based on past reputation and hype. CA, for me, has lost all credibility. I'm not saying I won't play again (because there is nothing else out there like the TW games), but I'll be sure to buy a game after it's "Gold Package" with all the additions is on sale for $25 (being generous), and the reviews for the game are above 8.0 out of 10 on the average.

The bad release, held back content for DLC greed, and over all bad form are just what the forums are full of. 12 patches later some of the launch bugs are fixed but you cannot fix what's wrong with this game. The AI is totally scripted and although you can break the linear campaign play by avoiding most political shanghia from "allies" you still get the same super stack factions that have to be scripted to do something stupid because they could just roll you off the map if they kept going. The building systems leave little to no variablity as you almost always need food and pub order just to build stuff. The the monetary system is so freakin ridiculously out of wack you end up with millions and have factions pleading for huge amounts of money for silly things just to spend down. A civil war that has no rhymn or reason just randomly pops. The combat is just blobs nothing like Rome 1 was. The AI cheats in several ways; not following the same economy as you, cavalry that has more moral than typical, ambushes when army was in clear sight...ect. Instead of the tactical battles that were the norm for this series you instead have a series of power ups that your generals "earn" so combat turns into a pause-fest unless you're quicker than snail snot ona hot day. They only difference in gameplay through difficulties are stat manipulations and nothing the ai does is situationally relative, hes just better....\nAll in all I knew the TW series was dying, I had thought Empire was it's death rattle. Sad to see it still spit up a few more titles before its collapse into this mindless arcade clicker.

Im not denying that it was utter unplayable crap when it first launched; it was unacceptably to launch the game in the buggy and unoptimized state it was in.  In the last 12 patches however, CA has not only eliminated most of the bugs but optimized the game superbly and released loads of free lc including entire new factions.  The single player campaign is long but rewarding but where Rome II really shines is when it is played with friends.  The multiplayer campaigns seem to have finally been freed from the prevelent gamebreaking desync issues and conquering the Ancient World with a friends is a blast.  The online battles are also surpurb, with a plethora of units to experiment with and maps to fight strategically on.  Also excellent is Rome II's extensive modding community.  With mods that enhance graphics to completly new campaigns mods give Rome II hundreds of hours of extra replayability. The only main flaw in Rome II is its horrendous naval combat.  Having gone an played the layered and realistic approach to naval combat in Napolean, Rome II's naval aspect is a step back for the series.  I frequently enountered glitches that caused two ships to simutaniously destory each other while ramming, ships that refused to board other ships, glitchy pathfinding, and graphical bugs that left chunks missing from the ship models.  As a person whose first Total war game was Rome II (although I've played many others since then) , Rome II is a game with good mechanics and excellent multiplyer that is only dragged done in its current state by minor (but irritating) bugs and the atrocious state of naval combat.  6.5/10","June 4, 2014","true","186.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

EVER!!!!!!!\n\nAlright, passed my earlier uninspiring review of this game. Rome 2 to me is probably one of the best total war's to have come to the table, along with stunning graphics, immersing battles, and amazing campaign maps (that you see in every total war) it brings some other new cool things to the table (previously not seen in any total war's that I'm aware of).\n\nThe first Total War that I ever got the chance to play was empire, in which if you haven't played you should, I immediately was in love with everything from the gigantic map to the battles (a new concept of play in strategic games to me) but empire was lacking so much, whether it be the poorly designed technology advancement, or the lack of siege equipment, or even the sad diplomatic communications that certain other games like civilization 4 and 5 bring into play. Then I got to try out medieval and was immediately disapointed by the lack of ability to play through naval battles (although the family tree dealings was amazing). Clearly both of these games had things lacking and after playing through Shogun 2 and seeing the basic line of a map I was starting to think that total war games were just a swap of dissapointment, if one game had one thing that was awesome then it would lack something awesome from another game. Then total war rome came out and my faith suddenly came alive with it. Rome 2 finally offers the oppurtunity to bring in naval ships for player use, along with a land army to charge through the city streets (the results being rather destructive). The map is probably larger than any other I've ever seen and the political dealings have finally been patched with some beautiful details that I have been (silently) screaming for them to bring into the game, such as the use of satrapies previously only seen in medieval 2. The game also brings in the new "multiple cities per-province" deal and makes war a more complicated prospect than just "army go here, city is mine" if you want a number of cites, taking just one of them could hurt you, due to if public order is low in one of the other ones (possibly owned by an enemy) you'll have a rebellion show up near your recently captured cities. There are tons more new prospects besides this, and all of them together provide a new feeling to the game that (again I say) was incredibly lacking.\n\nBUT! This game did still certainly have it's dissapointing faults that at first made this game unfun for me. Like the fact that your own family hierachy dealings were pitiful, basic at best. Or the fact that you can't move seperate army units without a present general to go boost a garrison. This bothered me so much in fact that the first time I wanted to make a review it was going to be negative. Thinking on it a little longer though (in terms of on the lack of ability to move army units without a general present) this actually properly complicates the game with a obstacle to overcome, while also putting one in place for your enemies.

IF YOUR COMPUTER IS SLOW, so is the game [with the exception of downloading certain graphical mods , deselecting the ability to view other player movement and using the advanced graphics option (at the top of the page under graphics, under options under the menu that comes up when you press the esc key)]\n\nSUGESTION\nGet it Now! while it's cheap, and if you are reading this when it isn't less than 30 dollars on steam get it another time while it's cheap and make sure you get it online in an area with a good internet speed and an ether net cord (cord for direct internet connection) because it's a pain in the you know where to download from a disc.  Spend money on the game the expansion packs seem worthless though with all the cool mods.  Play epic battles in campaign, limit the amount of time you spend on everything in the game, always make quick decisions while playing (in campaign and in battles) open another window before playing the game so you have the ability to multitask with the alt tab key between different things [if you don't but you want to multitask than you're screwed, (I like to play Rome while watching a movie with an HDMI cord and the projector function in the computer)].\n\n\nMODS\nWithout certain mods Rome II may be unbearable for you, so don't invest large amounts of time into your first campaigns unless you know what you're doing.\n\nSUGESTED GRAPHICAL MODS!!!\n\nTREE REMOVAL MOD (best mod!! allows for much faster game play + looks more realistic (can boost other graphics like terain atroscopic and texture to get the best effect)\n\nSPLENYI' BETTER CAMPAIGN CAMERA(MOD FRIENDLY) + CLOUD REMOVAL (the version you want just says cloud removal)\n\nLITTLE SETTLEMENTS [(don't worry big cities still have big walls in battle) (first 4 mods listed go well together)]\n\nEXTENDED CAMERA MINI MOD (you might like this and it might be the best thing ever for you or not)\n\nNo HDR mod [helps battle frame rate and again you might really like this but probably not (reduces light dynamics)]\n\na world to explore (simple mod that just makes sense, especially in the beginning of your first campaign)\n\n2nd WARNING (mods)\n\nMods don't usually work unless installed before a campaign is launched\n\nMods don't always work together (although the graphical mods that I suggested I think work with\njust about anything)\n\nMods that are old don't always work - these mods show a yellow triangle infront of them after downloading\n\nMods of a feather don't flock together (usually) [mod overloads=good but don't usually work together or with certain mods (This goes for unit mods as well)]\n\n\nIn General\n\nTHE GRAPHICAL MODS I CHOSE ARE MUST HAVES, BUT with campaign mods there are many ways to go and no right or wrong campaign mod to choose. It all depends on what you want to do. Depending on which faction you are you may want an Italian mod or a mod that develops major factions (these mods -- and there are many -- are highly recommended due to the fact that the campaign is never ending and almost dissatisfying at the end because of it) or mods specifically for certain factions (this is especially important for troop mods). But keep in mind that when you're just starting out you should test a few good unit mods for your specific faction, grab a serious overhaul mod [one that is comprised of multiple (3 to 6) mods]  make sure you have the graphics mods I mentioned and to get rid of view enemy troop movement and don't make the AI too easy or too hard just start out with normal or hard level of difficulty.\n\nJust Remember\n\nREMEMBER to hold down the clicker before releasing and sending a troop to somewhere that it will atrophy or into enemy territory sending a troop to enemy territory is extremely easy due to several occasional glitches in the game also\n\nREMEMBER to close out of the little diplomatic window by pressing x before you click on the next faction otherwise you will think you’re on the next faction but you're really still on the same one additionally\n\nREMEMBER to delete mercenaries after a battle the same turn you bought them and to only buy them on the turn of the battle because their upkeep is ridiculously expensive make sure you\n\nREMEMBER public order and keep it in the green to do this\n\nREMEMBER that when clicking on city details (a little circle that has a building in it) after clicking on the city that you can stop taxing a specific province by clicking the box in the top left corner that is checked when they are being taxed also\n\nREMEMBER  that if you have enough built up public order or are still getting more public order you can increase or decrease your taxes by clicking on your treasury chest button (always at the bottom) and by moving the little red dot on the bar furthermore\n\nREMEMBER your food and don't let there be a food shortage or your troops and city troops will atrophy and be extremely easy to take over this goes for public order to except instead of losing troops you'll receive more and more and more rebel troops after a certain number of turns that can be seen by hovering a mouse over the face that changes color to show public order that is visible on the left when the city is clicked on also\n\nREMEMBER to create a strategy when you're researching tech don't just click something way down the line that you want but start by getting stuff that really good that only takes a couple or a few turns also try to pic things that are essential like I always like to research the technology that gets artillery first because they are essential for taking over capital cities and save you from having to fight battles against small annoying armies like rebels by destroying them long before they even meet your troops also artillery is useful in most fights\n\nREMBER to have the infantry to guard them though and to keep a close eye on them so you can tell them to drop siege equipment and to then run away before enemy infantry or Calvary get them\n\nREMEMBER that one of the best generals you can have are Calvary for almost all armies except in rare cases where you need a strong defensive infantry unit to help defend a city or something\n\nREMEMBER to be nice to other factions but when they really want something -- no matter what make the pay up the wing wang for it -- by in the diplomacy box under the compass at the bottom of the screen and after selecting on a nation to negotiate with you press payments and chose to either give or demand money\n\nREMBER to just select one and start dialing in a fare bargain the select the other box and the price asked for will carry over and if you have different incomes, which you always do, you will be able to go back and forth changing the dial until you find the perfect price and you should\n\nREMEMBER to pick a price just below what it says is high so some where a little below high on moderate and this will get him to accept without rejecting you and will get you the best deal\n\nREMEMBER in battles to use defensive formations and to have enouph room to move troops around and to flank and or surround a troop like you would in go also make sure you back your troops up like you would in chess and most importantly make sure you don't take risks to great like the ones you wouldn't like to do in a game of risk.","June 26, 2014","true","036.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Im not denying that it was utter unplayable crap when it first launched; it was unacceptably to launch the game in the buggy and unoptimized state it was in.  In the last 12 patches however, CA has not only eliminated most of the bugs but optimized the game superbly and released loads of free lc including entire new factions.  The single player campaign is long but rewarding but where Rome II really shines is when it is played with friends.  The multiplayer campaigns seem to have finally been freed from the prevelent gamebreaking desync issues and conquering the Ancient World with a friends is a blast.  The online battles are also surpurb, with a plethora of units to experiment with and maps to fight strategically on.  Also excellent is Rome II's extensive modding community.  With mods that enhance graphics to completly new campaigns mods give Rome II hundreds of hours of extra replayability. The only main flaw in Rome II is its horrendous naval combat.  Having gone an played the layered and realistic approach to naval combat in Napolean, Rome II's naval aspect is a step back for the series.  I frequently enountered glitches that caused two ships to simutaniously destory each other while ramming, ships that refused to board other ships, glitchy pathfinding, and graphical bugs that left chunks missing from the ship models.  As a person whose first Total war game was Rome II (although I've played many others since then) , Rome II is a game with good mechanics and excellent multiplyer that is only dragged done in its current state by minor (but irritating) bugs and the atrocious state of naval combat.  6.5/10","June 4, 2014","true","186.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

EVER!!!!!!!\n\nAlright, passed my earlier uninspiring review of this game. Rome 2 to me is probably one of the best total war's to have come to the table, along with stunning graphics, immersing battles, and amazing campaign maps (that you see in every total war) it brings some other new cool things to the table (previously not seen in any total war's that I'm aware of).\n\nThe first Total War that I ever got the chance to play was empire, in which if you haven't played you should, I immediately was in love with everything from the gigantic map to the battles (a new concept of play in strategic games to me) but empire was lacking so much, whether it be the poorly designed technology advancement, or the lack of siege equipment, or even the sad diplomatic communications that certain other games like civilization 4 and 5 bring into play. Then I got to try out medieval and was immediately disapointed by the lack of ability to play through naval battles (although the family tree dealings was amazing). Clearly both of these games had things lacking and after playing through Shogun 2 and seeing the basic line of a map I was starting to think that total war games were just a swap of dissapointment, if one game had one thing that was awesome then it would lack something awesome from another game. Then total war rome came out and my faith suddenly came alive with it. Rome 2 finally offers the oppurtunity to bring in naval ships for player use, along with a land army to charge through the city streets (the results being rather destructive). The map is probably larger than any other I've ever seen and the political dealings have finally been patched with some beautiful details that I have been (silently) screaming for them to bring into the game, such as the use of satrapies previously only seen in medieval 2. The game also brings in the new "multiple cities per-province" deal and makes war a more complicated prospect than just "army go here, city is mine" if you want a number of cites, taking just one of them could hurt you, due to if public order is low in one of the other ones (possibly owned by an enemy) you'll have a rebellion show up near your recently captured cities. There are tons more new prospects besides this, and all of them together provide a new feeling to the game that (again I say) was incredibly lacking.\n\nBUT! This game did still certainly have it's dissapointing faults that at first made this game unfun for me. Like the fact that your own family hierachy dealings were pitiful, basic at best. Or the fact that you can't move seperate army units without a present general to go boost a garrison. This bothered me so much in fact that the first time I wanted to make a review it was going to be negative. Thinking on it a little longer though (in terms of on the lack of ability to move army units without a general present) this actually properly complicates the game with a obstacle to overcome, while also putting one in place for your enemies. Do you need a garrison boosted? Build a building to do so. And many of the basic family hierachy problems were fixed in this latest update adding "emperor edition"","March 21, 2014","true","171.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

AI was too aggressive against the player, but not each other. There was a weird glitch in Gameplay everyone complained about I never saw (And was fixed within the second week patch). When I first played it, it was funnish still, but all these new diplomacies out of reach due to overly bizarre AI was the main issue. Not so much anymore.\n\nAI follows a state based on their relationship status to you, which is based on if you're war with their enemies (+) or with their friends (-) and follows a fairly sensible pattern, where someone at 150+ relations won't declare war on you unless you attack someone in that is their defensive alliance (But if they are afraid/good enough friends, they'll peace out fairly quickly.) Someone at -200 is undoubtly going to declare war on you, even if they have to launch a naval invasion to make it happen. The AI does get afraid though, The selecuids at war with everyone suddenly found Galatian Barbarians running rampant over their stuff, and they peaced out with a massive gold gift to avoid further destruction.\n\nCombat AI is mostly good, especially in field battles. If your line is too short, they will flank you with their infantry. Sometimes they go with a lopsided strategy against your weak flanks to try to break them and sweep into the side. Cav will chase your archers round and round unless you counter them. They use scout cavalary to try to find your people if you hide in the forest rather than marching around aimlessly. Combat AI gets a little weird in city sieges. THey kind of understand how to defend, in that they'll move to fill gaps you break in the wall, defend the right areas, put archers to counter movements. Without siege weapons, you'll get punished trying to climb the walls. Attacking though it's a bit weird. First it'll move up ladders, and if that fails, they'll attack your gate (AI has siege gear, but never allowed it to get to my walsl before). Most of the time this still goes straight forwards, but this does allow your archers to pepper them freely, despite ladders on the walls. Though since the ladders appear to be made out of adamintine, that's probably for the best. Once trhough, they tend to just stream their entire force through. Archers, cavalry, infantry, everything.\n\nCombat stats are pretty nice. Morale is still a big deal like Shogun 2, though even the most untrained levy is not nearly as much of a pansy as the Rise of the Samurai Levy units which would take one casualty and panic like the world is ending. Some morale seems a bit ridiclous (Killing 119 Thorax Swordsman in a group and yet the last one still fights on) but most respond to shocks like hard shock cav charges pretty well. Generals are important to maintain morale and their abilities are really helpful. They also have other bonuses that vary heavily, like reducing unit cost or improving everyone's skill, or reducing enemy morale. Army Groups now are permenant things that build traditions as well that outlive their generals and can be reinstated if they are wiped out. These can represent a key doctrine certain groups employ. Combat can get a bit slow and sloggy though when you have spears in defensive position and all they have are is spears. BRING A SWORD. Will admit, combining Shield strength into armor and missile accuracy into missle damage on the stat screen is a bit weird.\n\nCampaign isn't like Rome 1 where Population is the only important stat and money is infinite. Population is still important, population growth allowing areas to gain new buildings to make more money. Money really varies though where you start. If you start as Parthia and take over Iran, that's a free money from the trade goods and Eastern bonus to towns (Local COmmerce bonus+10% bonus from Being Eastern.) Whereas Rome is very tempting to go full military, and you'll wind up bankrupting yourself in your war against Carthage, unable to pay for reinforcements and navies.\n\nCampaign other nice note: Nobody plays that similar. Geography and unit types are nicea nd diverse. Now, some, like Parthia, play totally different from most others. Parthia plays like a Steppe Horde that got some full plate knights. They also get bonus damage on all their ranged weapons. Even after a 15% bonus, Rome's slingers and javs still do way less damage than parthians, and that's not mentioning the archers. Slinger: Normal 18, Parthia: 21. Jav: 39, Parthia 45, Archer: 27 Parthia: 32. Cretan archers of some hellenic factions have the 32, but those are a tier 3-4 unit. Parthias get those archers from a tier 2 building... that also ride horses. Rome has Legionaires. Sparta has a diverse set of units based aroudn their social stratifications, Athens has a few nice cavalry, Macedon with their units, Egypt with their mixture of native Egyptians and greek things, Pontus and Selecuids with mixture of eastern and hellenic, Galatia as he invading gauls. Lots of fun.\n\n86%, Would recommend.","February 11, 2014","true","336.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Captainzens/recommended/214950/","Captainzens","Captain Zenscuel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Captainzens/","594 products in account","So, let me toss my hat into this ring.\n\nRome II released a fair bit buggy. AI was too aggressive against the player, but not each other. There was a weird glitch in Gameplay everyone complained about I never saw (And was fixed within the second week patch). When I first played it, it was funnish still, but all these new diplomacies out of reach due to overly bizarre AI was the main issue. Not so much anymore.\n\nAI follows a state based on their relationship status to you, which is based on if you're war with their enemies (+) or with their friends (-) and follows a fairly sensible pattern, where someone at 150+ relations won't declare war on you unless you attack someone in that is their defensive alliance (But if they are afraid/good enough friends, they'll peace out fairly quickly.) Someone at -200 is undoubtly going to declare war on you, even if they have to launch a naval invasion to make it happen. The AI does get afraid though, The selecuids at war with everyone suddenly found Galatian Barbarians running rampant over their stuff, and they peaced out with a massive gold gift to avoid further destruction.\n\nCombat AI is mostly good, especially in field battles. If your line is too short, they will flank you with their infantry. Sometimes they go with a lopsided strategy against your weak flanks to try to break them and sweep into the side. Cav will chase your archers round and round unless you counter them. They use scout cavalary to try to find your people if you hide in the forest rather than marching around aimlessly. Combat AI gets a little weird in city sieges. THey kind of understand how to defend, in that they'll move to fill gaps you break in the wall, defend the right areas, put archers to counter movements. Without siege weapons, you'll get punished trying to climb the walls. Attacking though it's a bit weird. First it'll move up ladders, and if that fails, they'll attack your gate (AI has siege gear, but never allowed it to get to my walsl before). Most of the time this still goes straight forwards, but this does allow your archers to pepper them freely, despite ladders on the walls. Though since the ladders appear to be made out of adamintine, that's probably for the best. Once trhough, they tend to just stream their entire force through. Archers, cavalry, infantry, everything.\n\nCombat stats are pretty nice. Morale is still a big deal like Shogun 2, though even the most untrained levy is not nearly as much of a pansy as the Rise of the Samurai Levy units which would take one casualty and panic like the world is ending.

Bad AI too.\nApart from the dull soundtrack (which can easily be fixed with the 4 part music mod) and the dull colour pallet (which there will be other mods for) it is a good game. I had to change the collision on mine because I hated this clustering going on, but it was not unbearable, it was just slightly irritating.\nThe good points are:\nFew crashes, they only happen with lots of mods (55)\nBest current AI on any total war to date. (It actually is)\nGreat campaign in most playthroughs, but can get too easy.\n\nA few minor critisisms are the removed family tree (happy to see it making an appearence in Attila)\nYou have to have someone leading an army and you can't just select a few units, send them out to kill a few rebels and come home or have 3-4 units of light cav wandering around your borders to scout for enemy armies.\nLots of the units looks very similar their faces) and none really look majorly different. Voice acting is minimal, it could keep the game very fresh if people had different accents.\nCities never tend to look very different, barbarian cities are all the same, same with greeks and romans, same with eastern factions.\nCharacters feel expendable because they have no real meaning in your family, in Med 2 I would be both sad and scared when my King died, they usually had great influence in the world and my faction could easily fall apart after their death.\n\n\nI think what makes this so good is the superb modding community. Champloo, Wolfman and many more who made me play this game. Overally it gets 60% good, though if I had not seen the majesty of Med 2 and Rome 1, it would probably get a higher mark. I just hope Attila can do better.","November 26, 2014","true","469.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So, at first, I was absolutely horrible at this game, but as I learned more about it, it became a really good game. Micromanagement is great. Keeping your calvary moving while making sure your infantry line isn't getting flanked is fun. Might not be too great the first hour or so though, you'll get absolutely smoked by everyone. Watch some videos on YouTube or something and get over the learning curve. Its a great game to play with friends.\n\nCons:\n-You have to have a relatively decent PC if you want to play this. No ACER 300$ laptops, sorry. Not my choice. Lucky for me I'm able to get normal settings.\n-Camera movement in my opinion struggles. I found the "Classic Total War" camera setting or whatever and it was much better for me.\n-AI sucks. Can't practice with AI to get prepared for human players. Humans will make a line and have calvarly on the outside. AI will bring generally the same units, but they'll just all come randomly at you. No strategy.\n\nAll 3 of those cons, however, are no biggy. Once your good with the camera, if your PC can handle the game, and you like to play online rather than with AI, the game really shines.","June 29, 2014","true","76.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Overall a great game and i give you my thumbs up.","December 2, 2013","true","16.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The whole squalor system is a major disapointment even in comparison to the Europa Universalis aggressive expansion system which was done materfully .. The Squalor or how to control it isn't even mentioned in the tutorial ... Sure the tactical battles can be fun if your units decide to listen to you , but the strategy mode is seriously lacking and can be frustrating, you find your self sitting for turns on end trying to put down revolts or trying to figure how to lower the squalor .... Overall if your looking for a great Strategy game go with Paradox and their Crusader Kings 2 / Europa Universalis games , they are way more fun , and eventhough they are more indepth/complex game , the learning curve and tutorial make things way easier and enjoyable. or the alternative stick to Shogun 2.....\n\nI guess my only hope now for the Total War series is if Paradox buys them out , hehe\n\nseriouslty how do some of these people still have their jobs ......","July 1, 2014","false","35.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Cockles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solsroyce/","116 products in account","Competitive turn-based strategy game incorporated with real-time strategy. Sets an entirely different setting than any other Total War game so far. The combat experience is great because it's fairly balanced out and requires a lot of concentration.\n\nPros:\n- Very realistically refined historical accuracy of units.\n- Great open field combat and mechanics.\n- Turn-based strategy can be quite difficult.\n- Amazing mod community.\n- O.K. co-op multiplayer.\n\nCons:\n- AI is stupid. Could of been made more tactical to increase difficulty instead of being so heads-on agressive.\n- Graphics are fairly demanding, and evenso when setting up high graphics doesn't meet marketing screenshot quality.\n- The Total War encyclopedia for this game is just horrid in comparison to Shogun 2's.\n- Political system could of been more like Shogun 2.\n\nI've spent a lot of time playing this game right from the start. I pre-ordered it and really looked forward to it. People complained from the start, mentioning errors throughout gameplay and the game being very glitchy. I personally felt like they publisher literally released a beta. Honestly, many issues didn't start bugging me until later. The game remained very competitive but it could have had some improvements. Overall I always just turned a blind eye to the issues and the game remained very enjoyable, as I've experienced no different with CA in a positive way. All bugs and glitches were fixed very quickly.\n\nImagine playing Risk table-top but with enhanced 3D aesthetics, and when in combat instead of throwing dices you just get into real-time strategy which can possibly involve multiple armies and AIs depending on the conflict scenario. The game is very immersive and drags you right into the historical sphere mainly due to how all the units function and what abilities they bring to the field. The units for each faction are very refined in terms of what purpose they served in the days of old; what weapons and armour they carry onto the field.\n\nThe experience is very detailed from first-person camera tracing to follow units into a heads-on charge (as seen in trailers) to the morale boosts commanders provide to their battalion as they are near forfeit.\n\nThe game is very competitive and remains challenging and remains so throughout dozens of hours of play up into the hundreds, due to how every faction has its own types of units. You can literally just model your army's organizational structure after how they functioned in reality, or run experimental tests of your own, and this alone makes every battle a surprise. Fighting other factions will require you to adapt your armies.\n\nOn top of that there's the economical elements brought to the game, aswell as political intrigue, each different factors that can change the outcome of a war.\n\nTo end with the negative things; the AI could be better. Armies often just attack in small stacks, making it very easy to be victorious, sometimes not even posing a challenge. When you increase difficulty, armies just receive combat modifiers. They don't really become any harder to fight strategically. They don't grow 'smarter'. Even on high difficulty the AI is stupid, such as how siege battles are very boring. While provided with siege weaponary, you can basically just go stand in front of your gate with one unit and wait until they break through, only to see them try to push you aside instead of fight you or face you on multiple flanks. They just perform suicide missions and you can easily fight off an army of 3000 men with just two-hundred spears.\n\nThe graphics are great, although fairly demanding. You'll require a good processor and memory to render all the units in the field, although performance of the game has been significantly improved through later patches mainly in regards to units moving on the field, which in the past could happen through lag spikes. - High graphics don't par with the screenshots marketed.\n\nThe encyclopedia is very bad. It's hard to find certain elements of the game for more information, if you don't have the ability to right-click elements in a unit roster. The search function is just horrid because it doesn't let you find anything that would even bring you to using the encyclopedia in the first place.\n\nI feel the political system could be better such as having the old family tree from Shogun 2. It gives your faction an individual touch, while having an avatar as your faction leader doesn't really mean anything. They are only displayed as portraits in the diplomacy window wherein they will have some generic dialogue. Their appearance is very generic, while for Shogun 2, each faction had unique daimyo's (clan leaders) that didn't look like your everyday general. You don't really grow a bond with the characters in your political system anymore, and wont care much for the political intrigue, because all the characters and armies are, are stats. At one point somebody may assassinate your Hannibal Barca, but two turns later another with the same name is added to your pool.","March 6, 2014","true","436.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Rome II was a mess at release. With each patch it's gotten better, and the form it's in now is well worth having and playing. That being said, it's still nowhere near what the promotional materials and videos showed in the lead-up to the game's release, so it still feels like a little bit of a letdown from what we were hoping for.\n\nAnyway, if you're at all familiar with total war games, you know the gist of it: turn based strategic map, realtime tactical battles. Both types are solid for the most part, but marred by somewhat stupid AI depending on the circumstances. If you're not, a little more detail: Total War games are effectively two games in one. There is a turn-based campaign map where you build settlements, recruit armies, and move them around to strategically useful locations, as well as a real-time tactical map where your armies battle with other armies (which can be optionally skipped via an auto-resolve function) to fight one another. It is my personal opinion that this is the best strategy series on the market, and while Rome II is not the best offering in the series, following the patches since release it has ended up being a competent entry in that series.\n\nBeyond that, I feel that I should take a moment to rail on Sega for their terrible DLC policy. The DLC is way overpriced, and limiting Sparta and Athens behind a paywall, in particular, is just ridiculous. Let alone the "Blood and Gore" DLC which was free in previous entries.\n\nSo anyway, yeah - recommend for the core game (which is only likely to increase as it continues to be patched and improved), but huge lack of recommendation for the DLC on a value perspective.","February 15, 2014","true","103.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Both types are solid for the most part, but marred by somewhat stupid AI depending on the circumstances. If you're not, a little more detail: Total War games are effectively two games in one. There is a turn-based campaign map where you build settlements, recruit armies, and move them around to strategically useful locations, as well as a real-time tactical map where your armies battle with other armies (which can be optionally skipped via an auto-resolve function) to fight one another. It is my personal opinion that this is the best strategy series on the market, and while Rome II is not the best offering in the series, following the patches since release it has ended up being a competent entry in that series.\n\nBeyond that, I feel that I should take a moment to rail on Sega for their terrible DLC policy. The DLC is way overpriced, and limiting Sparta and Athens behind a paywall, in particular, is just ridiculous. Let alone the "Blood and Gore" DLC which was free in previous entries.\n\nSo anyway, yeah - recommend for the core game (which is only likely to increase as it continues to be patched and improved), but huge lack of recommendation for the DLC on a value perspective.","February 15, 2014","true","103.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Blood, as a DLC, and not as a graphical option, really? Nevermind, I payed for those 2 on sale, and I will get most of the rest when they are on sale again, NEVER on the normal price, because I don't support what SEGA is doing here.\n\nAnother thing I noticed that is different from the original Rome and Medieval 2, is the workshop integration. You can find some amazing mods made by the community, from small ones to improve your gameplay and experience, textures to improve graphics, and complex yet high quality overhauls like Divide et Impera.\n\nLike I have been saying, this game is really different from the other 2 I mentioned, it took me a little while to get used to the new system of conquest and managing cities, and now I'm loving it, and the battles are improved as well, that nice feeling you get when using the cinematic camera while charging to your enemy is just priceless.\n\nI recommend this game, I don't support what SEGA did here, again, but the game in itself is great. If you can, get it on sale, because the DLC is just not worth the whole price, I just whish this evil market strategy changes in the future.","March 20","true","188.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Scenario\nYou start with certain countries and have to reach certain goals in a limited amount of time.\n2.) Sieges & battles\nYou can play set up fights / set up your own fights against another army.\n3.) Single Player\nNo rules, just you and the world. You can choose between a lot of different starting countries.\n4.) Multi PLayer\nNo rules, just you, your friend and the world.\n\nThe game splits up into 2 sectors. First, the world map where you can build citys, recruit armies, move them around, conquer other cities, use diplomacy, trade [...]. Then there is the RTS part - once you encounter an enemy you can choose to auto-fight him or fight him yourself. If you choose to fight the enemy yourself you are thrown onto the battlefield and can start setting up your units & get ready to fight.\n\nThe game does a lot of things right, and only a few wrong. The world map, the city-building, the diplomacy, everything is incredibly cool and well done. The RTS fights are challenging and its awesome to win a battle against a huge army with a small amount of units - simply because you used inferior tactics and unit controllings.\n\nThe very few downsides are the very long AI turns and the loss of RTS once you start having a huge empire. Later in the game its Quantity > Quality and you managing the units yourself and taking the fight into your own hands is getting unnecessary.\n\nOverall, i fully recommend Total War: Rome II. You can play a lot of different countries, have endless fights with other empires and spend countless of hours building up your empire. 8/10","January 18","true","92.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Little to no tactics involved with the combat compared to original total war in which certain units benefitted significantly from fighting specific units with weaker stats or weaknesses.\n\nSea combat is very boring, can very easily win just about every battle with fire or ramming over and over as AI doesn't know how to compensate.\n\nGraphics are fantastic, visual effects are great, but game play overall is lack luster.

Let's start with the bad thing. They are: the AI, which is very bad.... they tried to fix it but still is not good enough. Units during combat become chaotic and in turns in to a massive cluster f**k. The game had some performance problems but I have played it today again and it run very smooth on high settings (My rig is 3570k OC, EVGA 660ti 2gb, 8gb 1600 RAM CL9). The good thing about this game is... the scale. There is nothing like fighting with 3000 Romans versus a horde of 7000 barbarians. It also innovates from the previous iterations of Total War. It adds features like Land and Naval combat on one map. It has some limited politics but not as in depth as Crusader Kings 2. Overall I hated this game when it came out but the recent patches seem to have addressed most of the issues and now I found myself playing for 8h strait. I don't know much about multilayer as I haven't spent much time playing it. I don't like the fact that they put soo much DLC out for example they knew that people will want to play as Sparta so they decided to charge for it. If you are a fan of games like Crusader kings 2 or Civ 5 only buy this game if you miss the lack of advanced combat.\nThank You for reading this review.\nIt is my first review and I hope I can make more in the future.\n","November 27, 2013","true","85.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Granted, I have not played RTWI or anything else in the Total War series. However, Total War as a whole is very interesting. The biggest downside for me personally is crashing and replay glitches. As mentioned, this game has some serious bug problems. It also crashes (for me) unpredictably. EDIT: Crashing seems to have been fixed in the last update\n\nIn terms of gameplay (I assume the whole Total War series works this way), it feels like a hybrid between Civilization and Age of Empires. Like Age of Empires, you can command your troops on the battlefield and organize formations in real time (except even better: you can pause it offline! Drives me crazy in Age of Empires!). Like Civilization, you can persue diplomacy, setup trade, and manage military positions from one province to the next in turn-based campaign. There are a few elements which really cannot be compared to either. Cinematic camera and inter-character communication is one of them. It does really feel like something from the movies. This game is probably even more combat dependant than Age of Empires, and far more combat dependant than Civilization. You are pretty much forced to wage wars of expansion, not just sit back on your haunches and make the world your friend. In Age of Empires it is theoretically possible to win by creating a wonder and develop such a powerful defensive network that few dare attack, and those who do suffer (I have never seen it happen except VS AI). In Civilization (AI games, I can't do online for some reason), you can use science, "diplomacy" (i.e. monopoly on city state puppets), and culture to avoid war, just as long as you have a significant military to intimidate the opposition. In RTWII, you pretty much have to take stuff over as part of the overall victory condition.\n\nI have to say, I have never played anything quite like it. A very interesting franchise, when it works.\n\n[I am not going to give it a /10 rating, because I have no idea what it would be]","December 4, 2013","true","292.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You can now only move an army if a general is in command, which is overly restrictive. Also, most annoyingly, the distance from which reinforcements can join a battle is immense! I believe armies from within the province a battle is taking place can join it as a reinforcement. As some provinces are huge, this feels particularly silly.

If you have not played the the original, and you like Real-Time Strategy games, then you will like Rome II. If you have already played the original game or the other Total War games (Medieval, Shogun, Empire), then you'll probabily hate the sequel.\nFor those who are new to the Total War series, I will briefly explain the game: Rome II: Total War is a strategy game about conquering lands and building an empire, using diplomacy, trade, agents and, of course, war. You control one nation, with its own strengths and weaknesses. There are two main moments in this game: the campaign map (turn-based) and the battlefield (real-time). The campaign map displays settlements and cities throughout the lands and armies and fleets, and when it is your turn you may chose where to send your forces, to engage diplomacy or improve the buildings in the cities you own (wich can provide benefits such as better soldiers or more income for your treasure). Once you decide to attack an enemy force or city (or if a enemy attacks you in its turn), you switch to the battlefield. In the battlefield, you will deploy an army composed by the forces you had in the camapign map and then fight your enemy in a real-time battle. You control battalions instead of individual soldiers, and must watch for their morale, numbers and how tired they are and use wisely your soldiers. After the battle is over, you switch back to the campaign map and the forces involved in the battle advance or retreat accordingly to the outcome of the battle.\n\nGood features and improvements\n\nRome II: Total War added important features to the previous Total War games.\nThe first is the Army Instances: you may issue orders to your armies use forced marches, travelling faster but being easely ambushed, to build defesive positions, being unable to move but gaining defensive bonuses or to loot the land, advancing slowly but earning money.\nThe provincial system bounds smaller settlements to large ones, making all ot them share bonueses from buildings. Also, you can issue Edicts to provinces you control entirely, giving bonueses to achieve specific goals (better income, faster recruitment or improved public order).\nPublic order has a index that goes from 100 (very happy) to -100 (the province rebels), and it is more realistic than the previous system in which it took two turns to a perfectly happy city go berserk after a minor change in taxes.\nThere is a large variety of units. Balkanic spearmen, Iberian spearmen and Arabian spearmen look different from each other, which increases the perception that you are in a vast world inhabited by many different cultures.\nAmphibious battles are certainly one of the better improvements: ships fight in the sea while armies clash on the land. Artillery ships can bombard a city's towers and a vessel full of legionaries can disembark to aid their allies in mainland, or even disembark directly inside a enemy port to capture the city.\nLast and least, the game is truly beautiful and you'll watch one of the most realistic graphics in the market.\n\nBad features and what was left behind\n\nMany important features from previous games were stripped in Rome II: Total War.\nThere is no more family tree, which displayed your faction leader's family. Even if it seems a useless feature, it greatly improved immersion in the game. Without it, your generals became uninteresting characters.\nThe game is corrupted with bugs: aside from graphical issues and good computers being unable to maintain a steady rate of FPS, the game crashes too often.\nThe game was extremely streamlined: the buildings options are shallow, characters have few and uninteresting traits (in Rome I, a general could have dozens of traits that reflected the path of their lifes), transport ships spawn instantly making fleets near useless, siege battles are almost worthless playing (in fact, many siege battles now do not even include walls...) and all agents (Spies/Dignataries/Veterans) do basically the same thing (assassinate, slow enemy forces or slow down construction in enemy cities).\nUnits in the battlefield now possess arcade abilities. On exemple: many spearmen have a speed boost ability that enhance charges. It seems ok at first, but why spearmen? Can't a Roman legionary run faster for a while? Some abilities like a "form phalanx" or "form shieldwall" should be, and are, availabe to pikemen and soldiers carrying shields, but generic abilities like "run faster" should not be "active skills", but "passive skills" available to whoever can run faster. In Medieval 2: Total War, if cavalry had enough space to run, they would deliver a devastating charge, but in Rome II: Total War heavy cavalry simply have the "devastating charge" button. Arcades abilities such as "run faster" or "improved charge" kill the realism that was supposed to be the most remarkable feature of Total War.\nAI has never been anything close to clever in previous Total War games, but in Rome II: Total War it is even worse. If the AI is defending a city, it will hold its position it doesn't matter what is happening around them: they stand idle and happily get butchered by your arrows and artillery, and if your actually sneak into the city and take the central flag in order to win, there is a great possibility that the defending units will not respond to that and simply keep watch over the main gate.\nNaval battles are broken, terrible after the pathces but unplayable at release. Many times your ships will simply stop responding to your orders, and they do not seem to know some basic laws of physics (gargantuan battleships moving fast suddenly stop when a small vessel attempts to board it).\nLast but not least, the main problem with Rome II: Total War is that this game uses the same engine as Empire: Total War and Shogun 2: Total War, it's called Warscape. It worked fine in Empire, when most battles consisted of musketeers shooting each other, with fewer meele fights than any other Total War. But Rome II: Total War relies mostly in meele fights, and it is a problem, because it demands many units interacting at the same time - but Warscape only allows two units interactiong with each other with "kill moves", choreographies with two units that only start when both are in the right position. It means that most units will juts walk around the battlefiled until they are in position to do a "kill move", and if a soldier is surrounded by ten enemies, only one will actually attack. Also, units are less able to hold their positions in battles and lines are easely broken due to the lack of collision between units. In the end, the game fails to deliver what it promissed: the epic battles that made Total War a legend.\n\nConclusion\n\nRome II: Total War is a good game. It is beautiful. It is huge. But it is not what the community was expecting, and not what was advertised. If you never saw a Total War game before, you may enjoy Rome II: Total War, but will enjoy more the other titles: Medieval 2: Total War, Napoleon: Total War and Shogun 2: Total War (considered a masterpiece).\nIf you know any other Total War, you will realize that Rome II: Total War is hollow shell of the former games. You can have fun, but the thought of what this game could have been will follow you through all your campaigns and diminish your experience with the game.\n\nA good definition of what is a good sequel is one that makes the original unplayable, because it improved so much that you do not want to play the original anymore. Rome II: Total War failed to do that, because it even failed to recreate the atmosphere, the immersion and experience of the original Rome: Total War. And, obviously, failed to enhance the experience.","January 6, 2014","false","476.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

If you have not played the the original, and you like Real-Time Strategy games, then you will like Rome II. If you have already played the original game or the other Total War games (Medieval, Shogun, Empire), then you'll probabily hate the sequel.\nFor those who are new to the Total War series, I will briefly explain the game: Rome II: Total War is a strategy game about conquering lands and building an empire, using diplomacy, trade, agents and, of course, war. You control one nation, with its own strengths and weaknesses. There are two main moments in this game: the campaign map (turn-based) and the battlefield (real-time). The campaign map displays settlements and cities throughout the lands and armies and fleets, and when it is your turn you may chose where to send your forces, to engage diplomacy or improve the buildings in the cities you own (wich can provide benefits such as better soldiers or more income for your treasure). Once you decide to attack an enemy force or city (or if a enemy attacks you in its turn), you switch to the battlefield. In the battlefield, you will deploy an army composed by the forces you had in the camapign map and then fight your enemy in a real-time battle. You control battalions instead of individual soldiers, and must watch for their morale, numbers and how tired they are and use wisely your soldiers. After the battle is over, you switch back to the campaign map and the forces involved in the battle advance or retreat accordingly to the outcome of the battle.\n\nGood features and improvements\n\nRome II: Total War added important features to the previous Total War games.\nThe first is the Army Instances: you may issue orders to your armies use forced marches, travelling faster but being easely ambushed, to build defesive positions, being unable to move but gaining defensive bonuses or to loot the land, advancing slowly but earning money.\nThe provincial system bounds smaller settlements to large ones, making all ot them share bonueses from buildings. Also, you can issue Edicts to provinces you control entirely, giving bonueses to achieve specific goals (better income, faster recruitment or improved public order).\nPublic order has a index that goes from 100 (very happy) to -100 (the province rebels), and it is more realistic than the previous system in which it took two turns to a perfectly happy city go berserk after a minor change in taxes.\nThere is a large variety of units. Balkanic spearmen, Iberian spearmen and Arabian spearmen look different from each other, which increases the perception that you are in a vast world inhabited by many different cultures.\nAmphibious battles are certainly one of the better improvements: ships fight in the sea while armies clash on the land. Artillery ships can bombard a city's towers and a vessel full of legionaries can disembark to aid their allies in mainland, or even disembark directly inside a enemy port to capture the city.\nLast and least, the game is truly beautiful and you'll watch one of the most realistic graphics in the market.\n\nBad features and what was left behind\n\nMany important features from previous games were stripped in Rome II: Total War.\nThere is no more family tree, which displayed your faction leader's family. Even if it seems a useless feature, it greatly improved immersion in the game. Without it, your generals became uninteresting characters.\nThe game is corrupted with bugs: aside from graphical issues and good computers being unable to maintain a steady rate of FPS, the game crashes too often.\nThe game was extremely streamlined: the buildings options are shallow, characters have few and uninteresting traits (in Rome I, a general could have dozens of traits that reflected the path of their lifes), transport ships spawn instantly making fleets near useless, siege battles are almost worthless playing (in fact, many siege battles now do not even include walls...) and all agents (Spies/Dignataries/Veterans) do basically the same thing (assassinate, slow enemy forces or slow down construction in enemy cities).\nUnits in the battlefield now possess arcade abilities. On exemple: many spearmen have a speed boost ability that enhance charges. It seems ok at first, but why spearmen? Can't a Roman legionary run faster for a while? Some abilities like a "form phalanx" or "form shieldwall" should be, and are, availabe to pikemen and soldiers carrying shields, but generic abilities like "run faster" should not be "active skills", but "passive skills" available to whoever can run faster. In Medieval 2: Total War, if cavalry had enough space to run, they would deliver a devastating charge, but in Rome II: Total War heavy cavalry simply have the "devastating charge" button. Arcades abilities such as "run faster" or "improved charge" kill the realism that was supposed to be the most remarkable feature of Total War.\nAI has never been anything close to clever in previous Total War games, but in Rome II: Total War it is even worse. If the AI is defending a city, it will hold its position it doesn't matter what is happening around them: they stand idle and happily get butchered by your arrows and artillery, and if your actually sneak into the city and take the central flag in order to win, there is a great possibility that the defending units will not respond to that and simply keep watch over the main gate.\nNaval battles are broken, terrible after the pathces but unplayable at release. Many times your ships will simply stop responding to your orders, and they do not seem to know some basic laws of physics (gargantuan battleships moving fast suddenly stop when a small vessel attempts to board it).\nLast but not least, the main problem with Rome II: Total War is that this game uses the same engine as Empire: Total War and Shogun 2: Total War, it's called Warscape. It worked fine in Empire, when most battles consisted of musketeers shooting each other, with fewer meele fights than any other Total War. But Rome II: Total War relies mostly in meele fights, and it is a problem, because it demands many units interacting at the same time - but Warscape only allows two units interactiong with each other with "kill moves", choreographies with two units that only start when both are in the right position. It means that most units will juts walk around the battlefiled until they are in position to do a "kill move", and if a soldier is surrounded by ten enemies, only one will actually attack. Also, units are less able to hold their positions in battles and lines are easely broken due to the lack of collision between units. In the end, the game fails to deliver what it promissed: the epic battles that made Total War a legend.\n\nConclusion\n\nRome II: Total War is a good game. It is beautiful. It is huge. But it is not what the community was expecting, and not what was advertised. If you never saw a Total War game before, you may enjoy Rome II: Total War, but will enjoy more the other titles: Medieval 2: Total War, Napoleon: Total War and Shogun 2: Total War (considered a masterpiece).\nIf you know any other Total War, you will realize that Rome II: Total War is hollow shell of the former games. You can have fun, but the thought of what this game could have been will follow you through all your campaigns and diminish your experience with the game.\n\nA good definition of what is a good sequel is one that makes the original unplayable, because it improved so much that you do not want to play the original anymore. Rome II: Total War failed to do that, because it even failed to recreate the atmosphere, the immersion and experience of the original Rome: Total War. And, obviously, failed to enhance the experience.","January 6, 2014","false","476.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

That being said, I do have a few things to say that have probably been said already. Rome II is the not long awaited sequel to Rome: Total War and though the game has been created in a era where better game mechanics can be made and better graphics can be created, The Creative Assembly has not made very many improvements to the original game. Many of the changes that you will see in this game will be in the campaign section, where TCA has decided to put much of their work on by making it simplistic as possible, and while I see that they are trying to expand their audience by making the UI of the game much easier, it ends up becoming a flop since they make it too simplistic. By making it too simplistic, you as the player cannot make very many changes to a specific provience and even finding the problem for the specific region can be difficult.\n\nAnother problem that is in the game is the AI, and even though TCA has created so many game in the Total War series, they still have not tackled the bad AI issue. Much of the AI in the game is terrible, both in the battles and in the campaign section, on the campaign side the AI might put up some fighting chance in the beginning of the game but when you actually gain a large empire the game does not become fun due to the fact that the AI does not form any sort of coalition or federation to destroy you and you can just simply steamroll though the entire game by attacking them one by one. Also the balancing of the AI in the campaign map is certainly a huge problem, as the faction of the Roman Empire can easily be crushed by a single northern barbarian tribe or the mighty Egyptian empire can be destroyed by a random faction from west Africa, and many of the AI is very stubborn when diplomacy comes into play, when a large portion of the factions will not have any contact with you unless  you give them several thousand gold coins.\n\nAs long as it has been in the Total War series, the battle AI has always been a considerability huge issue where TCA has never seemed to fix over each game. Various bugs and problems always seem to riddle the game where the AI will never play smart and most of the time will try to rush straight forward towards you or the units will stay in place regardless if you are on the defending side. The bugs in the game make the units might even just walk into walls or just run in circles, which saddens me because these problems are never fixed or are "patched" way too late in advance. As usual besides problems on land, the sea battles are just as awkward as ever as units sail through the land or cannot keep a single formation straight and even sail around the place just to board a ship that is right in front of them. The sieges in the game are an issue as well as the one centerpoint in its past games have been scraped and multiple points have been put in place where you have to defend from multiple sides. So in retrospect, instead of consolidating your forces into one last stand, you have to divide them up into two or three groups to fend off oncoming attackers, which is annoying and frustrating to me. *Side Note: When on the offensive side, throwing sticks at a gate is not a logical way to take it down!*\n\nAs much as I could rant about the game there is only a small handfull of things that I could say that is a good thing about it. The graphics of Rome II do look beautiful and makes the landscape and its nearby cities look amazing, as well as the look of the soldiers but unfortunately it does make the game lag alot and makes load times unbearable. Another good thing about the game is it's expansive campaign map, where there are at least over a hundred proviences that you can take over which makes you feel like that you are creating a empire, which is nice since in other games (besides Empire Total War) you feel like the world map is very small and condensed.\n\nThough I could go on and on about the bad (and very few good things) about Rome II I feel like I have spoken enough about this game. Even though TCA will patch their game to fix many multiple problems and bugs, continuing to release games with a poor polish and huge problems will not help the Total War series in the long run. It is sad to see such a great series crumble like the fall of the Roman Empire, but if TCA continues to make these games in this terrible of state then the longevity of the series is doomed.","January 19, 2014","false","51.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The game crashed, it froze when you ended your turn and when it didn’t freeze it took you 10 minutes to wait because only then all the other factions did their turns. I got a very good PC with good specs. but I couldn’t run the game on the highest settings which is quite ridiculous and the game was lagging as soon as the battle started (bad optimisation)  So Rome II wasn’t that enjoyable at the release. But after the patches done so far I’m enjoying this game a lot. The game now runs perfectly and I can run the game without trouble on the highest settings.\nRome II total War is a mix of turn based and real time strategy game and as soon you get attacked you got the choice to either simulate the battle or play the battle real time and command your army. When attacking a city you, as a spectator and commander, can see how your troops are climbing the walls capturing victory points, etc. The graphics are also very nice in this game and the sound effects are also perfectly done. However in Rome 1 when you started a battle your commander would give a speech to the army which was like one minute (you had the choice to skip that) but in Rome II the commander doesn’t give a speech at all. When the battle starts he says one thing and that is supposed to be the speech. Also the weak factions are way too strong and it’s not realistic a small tribe can destroy the mighty Rome (happened to one of my campaigns when I was playing as Sparta) I still think that should be patched.\nThe last Total War game I played was Napoleon and I didn’t enjoy that game that much and it’s very nice to see that Rome II has so many improvements comparing to Napoleon.\n\nVerdict: 7/10","November 30, 2013","true","583.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

It is not OK if your game DURING SALE costs as much as normal game without any sale.)\n\nI will just sit down and hope they will some day release package with full game in reasonable price.\n\nIf you have too much money to spend, buy this and all DLCs. You won't get disappointed.\nIf you are like me and don't want to spend almost 140€ for one game then I don't recommend to buy just yet.\n\n(And yeah, sorry for bad english.)","June 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It's true, there are many aspects of the game that have been changed, some for the better and some for worse, but I give this game no less love.  There's nothing missing or added to this game that breaks the Total War formula, so unless you're hung up on the little things like no more family trees, or the fact that units can be transported across bodies of water without dedicated naval units, then this game is nothing short of amazing.  I can understand the gripes of the Total War fans that cry foul for some of the changes but, at its core, it's still a fantastic game.\n\nFor people who aren't Total War players:\n\nAny fans of turn-based strategy will enjoy the dynamics of the campaign map, while also getting a huge thrill out of the real-time battles that are inevitable.

However, given time, it has become one of my favorite games. This is in part due to the fact that I have modded the game extensively. Should you play the vanilla game? Yes, but only really if you have just started to play the game, and want to know how to actually get around the menus and such. To get the full enjoyment, however, play some of the mods from the Steam Workshop. Examples of good starter mods, in order of importance:\n1. All Factions Playable: Direly needed if you want options and more of a non-linear experience.\n2. Radious Total War: This mod helps with a number of issues, including balance, AI, recruitment, etc. You can also get the seperate packs of Radious Total War to help you out. Depending on your preference, the DuB series of mods may also be fun, if a bit challenging. Be sure to check out their collection!\n3. Traits Talents and Toadies: Not sure when they are going to make it compatible with the latest patch, but this mod adds a trait tree and makes character development much more fun and adds many ancillaries.\n4. Blood & Gore Pack: While a DLC and not a mod, I personally very much enjoy the extra bit of cinematics. If you have extra steam wallet money, get this, otherwise there's no rush.\n\nOverall, I'd rate Total War Rome II now as a marked improvement.

I feel dirtied for having purchased it. I didn't get it at release because of the current state of main stream releases; bring it out with a plethora of bugs and fix them as they're reported. I managed to dodge the mess that was this launch where the game was fundamentally unplayable.\n\n\nBut it wasn't worth the wait. The game that is here now is a sad lament for what Total War games used to be. I've genuinely reinstalled Medieval 2 TW with 'The Third Age' mod to try and forget that this is where the series ended up.\n\n\nThe game isn't very pretty. By modern standards it's actually quite clunky, in particular the campaign map which is quite simply ugly to a modern market. But who cares about the graphics; The gameplay is where the game really lets you down. The battles are tedious, easy, and feel less like fights between individual soldiers (a hallmark of the series) and more like you throwing elaborate rocks at scissors and avoiding the papers. The intergration between naval battles and land battles is embarassingly clunky, and offer hundreds of immersion breaking exploits such as landing a crew of peasants in the middle of a major city and taking it whilst the AI twiddles thumbs on the walls. There are mods that can salvage this, but it isn't fair to review the game on a modded version.\n\n\nThe campaign management just isn't fun. You can tweak it with the mods again to rectify that, avoiding some of the now infamous 'agent spam' from the AI or also infamous 'pointless politics' which always culminate in scripted events whether you manage the country wonderfully or mash you face on the keyboard each turn. Building an invasion force becomes laughably easy on lower difficulty and pointlessly difficult on higher difficulty, tweaking the numbers rather than the ability of the computers.\n\n\nAll in all, this had the framework of a masterpiece. I enjoyed my time on it and if you're an absolute die hard fan of the series like me, then come on , we both know you have to buy it. But I know that if you are like me, you may also shed a tear when you see the list of DLCs, including playing as some content they originally made for vanilla but are locked until you cough up  a tenner. I'm not sure if the worst part of this game is that I can't play as Athens if I don't pay money equivalent to a whole new game, or if I also have to pay more money if I want to put the graphic settings on gory.\n\n\n","May 20, 2014","false","19.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Couldn't play for the first few hours, as this game is terribly made and optimized. Especially since it's running the warscape engine, which is more towards projectile warfare rather than melee warfare and accompanied with one on one combat focusing only on kill animations to determine the death of a soldier. Battles just become huge blobs of clusters, with formations breaking really fast due to these ridiculous kill animations. To make this game even moderately enjoyable, it had to be modded very HEAVILY.

But being a hardcore Total War fanboy, I tried and tried to enjoy it. It also upsets me that they are releasing these pointless $15 DLCs that add virtually nothing to the game. And $15 is just too much for something like that, epsecially with a broken game. But, they proceed to release DLCs instead of trying to fix the game, or perhaps as a stretch create an entirely new engine. Honestly though, I'll probably fall for CA's next Total War game, and preorder it, just to be dissapointed again (but everything can change if they make a new engine).\n\nThis game can't be fixed, as the game is broken to its core. Its design and mechanics are terrible. And again, the core flaw is the engine itself. I don't really care for bugs, as they can be easily fixed with patches, but a game that is broken down to its design can't be fixed. You have strip the entrie game to its bone and rework it.

Maybe I have become spoiled by great games like Crusader Kings 2 but the continued poor depiction of history and historic terminology (ie the use of gravitas for some reason as a core stat when dignitas or other words would be more appropriate for a core stat), as well as the failure to include old RPG features like a family tree has made this unplayable for me. I found this frustrating with the Empire series where I strongly felt the lack of a true faction leader and I was hoping that after Shogun, they were attempting a return to form. But they really weren’t. And this is not even going into the huge AI issues and other problems others have spoken of.\nI will say this, CA, a company that was once one of my favorites, has pretty much consistently delivered poor products on release SINCE the beloved first Rome. In the past this wasn’t a big deal and I was fine with it because they usually released splendid Add-Ons (Barbarian Invasions) which would make the base game have better features and then the Modders would come in and make fun historical campaigns that I still play to this day.

False previews: Even running the game maxed out on the benchmark, the game looked nothing like the footage we saw from the "alpha". Napoleon looks better than this...\n\n3. WAY too much DLC: I know TW has done this in the past with Napoleon: TW, but at least then you were only missing out on a few units (besides the one bigger DLC for the spanish campaign) and those units only costed maybe $2. This time around they are charging $8 for Greek States like Sparta and another $8 for Nomadic Tribes! They know everybody wants to play as Sparta, so instead of having it in the main game they decide to have it as DAY ONE DLC! That's just crap. And let's not forget they are now releasing an expansion, even though the core game STILL has MASSIVE issues.\n\n4. Battles: So they are still using the same engine used in Empire and above. The issue is that the engine was desinged for more modern combat and guns. It worked in Shogun 2 because you generally didn't have to have thousands of men attack each other, it was more organized and there were some guns here and there. This game is ALL hand to hand (well, mostly swords and spears) combat. So of course, the engine just doesn't work. The battles go REALLY fast (I took over a city and killed around 1,000 men, in 8 minutes, something that in Shogun and Napoleon would have take around 20 minutes and above) and since the AI is so dumb all you really have to do to win battles is send a few horses or guys to flank, and then just watch (which is hard to do becasue your FPS hits the floor).\n\n5. UI: This is the final reason and really the main reason I quit playing so fast. The UI is just cluttered and really hard to get around with. Managing cities is just akward compared to Napoleon and Shogun 2. Maybe playing through the campaign would explain it better, but I don't play TW for a story and scripted battles, I play it for my own little playground that I can have awesome and long battles, sieges, and diplomacy where I can stab smaller nations in the back or make a nation's allys turn on them and make them weaker. Also, the lady that explains things is REALLY annoying, I never really liked how they did that with a lady always bugging you to "Do this and that and upgrade this or check on that." But at least in the past I could figure it out on my own and mute her.\n\nOverall the two biggest issues for me is framerate and the UI. Maybe when the game is better optimized and I can finally stomach through the campaign with out my eyes hurting to figure out the UI, the game will be better. But considering the game has already been out for 4 months and they seem to be focused on DLC now, I doubt that will happen. Certainly not worth $60 even if the game gets fixed, that's just a dumb price for a PC game (where they are normally $50 or below at launch) At least wait till the Summer sale and maybe then it will be patched more.\n\nEDIT: So, I decided to go back and try out Rome 2 again, after playing through a decent chunk of the campaign, I must say I WAS having FUN with it. So now you may be asking "why is the review still negative???" well simple, city battles (which is what you'll be doing a majority of the time) are just...not good...at all. In the forest, where you can set up ambushes and take advantage of hills the game is actually pretty fun and it's quite a sight to see a guy get gutted by one of your loyal men, but in the city the AI just goes WHAAAAAAT????? It's just cluttered, you can't flank (well, not very well) because the city is so linear and the AI just sits there in the middle of the city where the flag is in this big ball of guys. This was an issue in Napoleon as well, but city battles then were more about taking over buildings and shooting from there, raining cannon fire from above, and shooting enemies accross bridges. This game is mostly melee of course, yet the city lay out is very similar to Napoleon it seems, which as you can imagine, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK! I have yet to ran into a "game crashing" bug, but the more I played, the more I just wanted to play another TW game that has more depth than this. I gotta be honest, it's the worst buy I made during the steam sale mainly becasue of how expensive it is. I just can't reccomened this game to anyone at it's current price. And now CA is working on a new Alien game so I think even they have given up on this game. Just avoid it, hopefully the next TW will fix things and be a step in the right direction (and if it's a melee focused game, CA PLEASE MAKE A NEW ENGINE and AI)","January 5, 2014","false","18.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Though there has been rocky points in the game with bugs, AI glitches, graphics issues and pathing issues, I can confidently say MOST of those are behind us. It is true that people should expect a complete product on launch, but the devs have not and are still not giving up. Here are some highlights that also answer some negative responses you will likely find;\n\n-New multiplayer games are now working and are fun to play though it is limited to 2 players on campaign\n-The AI acts much more intuitively, though not perfect, they are still working on it and it can pose a challenge especially on legendary.\n-New factions are added for free and in packs for a minimal cost even when not on sale, this is not required to play or gives anyone an advantage in any way\n-Graphics are gorgeous and scale very well, the leaks in code are gone\n-Unit balance is fine with a "paper rock scissor" setup for every unit\n\nBottom line most of the crap you read is over with, and the game is well worth full price of $60.

While some people still claim the game was not fixed following eight patches, I still took my chances, and bought it when it was on sale. Call me a sucker, but I love the Roman Era, and the Total War franchise. Before I installed any mods to the game, I played the vanilla for awhile to see how bad it was. Maybe I was not looking hard enough, but it performed like any Total War game I've played. Yes, the AI would do some stupid stuff now and then, but every Total War game I've played has the AI occasionally making stupid choices. My biggest gripe about the game is how poorly optimized it is. I have a mid-tier rig, so of course I'm not running it at max settings, but even on medium or high, the game experiences texture pops, and significant frame rate drops every so often. It's clear Creative Assembly wanted to make the game next-gen, but left many of their loyal fans who don't have a nice rig out. So if you don't have a high-end rig, don't be surprised if you run into these problems. After awhile, I installed the Radious Total War Overhual Mod (Highly Recommend), and since then, I really haven't experienced any issues with the game. I've been playing a multiplayer campaign with my friend, and it has gone pretty smooth. So far, my time playing Rome II has been mostly enjoyable especially with the Radious mod. However, I do not recommend paying full price for this game as CA does not deserve it. Wait for it to go on sale before considering it. It's a fun game, but it could have been even better had CA, and Saga not pushed it out the door so early. If you're not really into this franchise, don't waste your time, but if you are, and you've been on the fence due to the mixed reviews, my opinion is that the game is in working shape, and better with the Radious Mod.

Unfortunately the game lacks in many area's, the biggest area's are, number 1: The AI, which doesn't have a clue how to fight a battle, Number 2: The broken siege battles which have men dancing around at walls, men not climbing ladders properly and god for saken stupid AI movements. The game all seems a bit rushed in development and yep! patch 8 nealry and cleary that says this title was not ready for release and SEGA wanted to cash in quickly.\n\nNow I do recommend this game, WHAT!, I hear you cry, after the above words stated, well yes, I say this because I love the franchise and it's still a good real time battle game to get your teeth into and if like me you love the Roman era than it's fun to play for about an hour or two, yes unfortunately it's not as gripping as the previous games in the franchise and things are rather easy once you learn the new systems.\n\nGive it a go but don't be dissapointed when battles become a bundle of troops forgetting their military formation training or when the AI decides to do wierd things on the battle field.

The pinnacle of which was Empire: Total War. That is about as fine as they come. Since Empire we've had Shogun 2 and now Rome 2. I found Shogun 2 to be underwhelming and now with Rome 2, the downward spiral into obscurity continues.\n\nPros:\n1. Phenomenal graphical potential if your hardware can handle it.\n2. Cinematic camera mode. Makes it quick and easy to get a glimpse of the action up close.\n3. Strategic camera mode. A nice zoomed-out tactical camera option that's very reminiscent of Supreme Commander.\n4. HUGE world map.\n5. Decent in-game Encyclopedia\n6. "Continue Campaign" option right from the launch screen in Steam.\n\nCons:\n1. The UI is unnecessarily huge and impeding\n2. The In game advice cannot be turned off. No matter how many times I click "suppress advice", I still get it. If you turn it on "Audio only advice" to avoid getting the extremely poorly animated advisor from popping up, It still pops up, only with no text.\n3. Animations were underwhelming. Units looked like little paper-doll clones.\n4. WAY too much DLC for extra cash. The only one worth getting (and should've come standard with the game) is the Blood and Gore DLC. Makes me feel like I bought an intentionally bare-bones game with the intent to sell me DLC later.\n5. Standard Total War long load times.\n6. Research trees are small and boring.\n7. Ultra high system requirements. It's a real hog. Crashes and freezes way more than I care to mention. I've been steadily reducing graphics settings in an attempt to improve stability.\n8. Infuriatingly clunky political system controls.\n9. Voice acting became repetitive and corny after the first hour.\n10. Generals have magical. ♥♥♥♥ing. powers. That you have to manually control in battle.\n\nConclusion:\nRome 2 stays true to its Total War heritage. I jumped in and it felt familiar and comfortable. It's a weak and unworthy successor to the original Rome though. The resource management is basic, and the empire building is rather shallow. Empire: Total War felt deep. I felt invested in that masterpiece. I feel very little with Rome 2 other than disappointment at wasted potential. It's a big budget game that's worth no more than $30. 73/100","March 24, 2014","true","36.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","2"

Each of the total war games have been almost a piece of art, providing interesting and strategic gameplay unlike other RTS games. I was quite excited on hearing the reveal of Rome 2 and have look forward to it ever since. As soon as I was able I bought this game in prerelease it was pretty excited before the release of the game. When the game finally was released however I was extremely disappointed after playing only two battles. I Immediately jumped into the combat by playing custom battles and quickly began to realize that the AI (advertise on being the best AI in total war history(really just watch the videos)and ended up being the worst AI I've seen in a video game. My first battle the AI decided to throw all 2000 of its troops at a single unit of Calvary allowing me to simply surround the destroy the enemy. Another battles I found that the enemy AI often would commit  on the strongest side of my line or simply refuse to attack me even though they are the aggressor. If you're curious on what I'm talking about simply look at the many  videos that display the ridiculous AI. When playing the campaign I was also quite disappointed by the AI other factions on the campaign map. The UI also feels unfinished along with the tech tree and a lack of a family tree. If you asked me what I truly felt is the biggest problem of the game my answer is simply the game was not finished. This game was not only disappointing but it really made me distrust this company and will make me more cautious on future releases. I will probably never preorder another game due to this experience and I urge anyone not to purchase this game due to the fact that it was not finished. Instead of fixing many of the problems that are in this game they have decided to make DLC  to squeeze out as much money out of people that were willing to purchase it. This review may seem very harsh however my hope is to see better games from creative assembly in the future and hope that Sega never pulls this ever again.","December 26, 2013","false","40.2"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","2"

The game runs stable, but the AI is still terrible. Nothing new from a Total War game, but I'm very disappointed that the core mechanics are fundamentally broken.\n\nI disagree that the game is "dumbed down". Towns are streamlined, but the minor province/capital system works really well  and makes more sense than every province having a town the size of Rome like in the previous game. You no longer need ships to embark/disembark units, but navies now disembark their own units to patrol the coasts or help out in a siege against a coastal city.\n\nMany of the added features just don't make any sense to me. There's an intrigue system involving control of the senate with small events that pop up ala CK2 that can affect your family's influence and power. I have no idea what any of it means.The first major complaint I have is there's no family tree to give you an idea who you family is. If your family head dies, they are replaced by... someone. The second complaint is I have no idea what the influence does. If I make my family member a general, I lose influence? If I adopt someone into my family, I lose influence? Why do I even need influence if I control all of Rome's armies and cities?  Rome 1's solution of splitting Rome into 3 allied factions the dissolve into civil war wasn't perfect but it was much more intuitive and  a lot more fun.\n\nThe city happiness system has been made much harder. I think what they were trying to do here was prevent steamrolling entire countries with a couple full armies.  Once you conquer a province, you need to keep you army around until you culture eclipses that of your conquered foe and put down any rebellions that pop up. On paper I like this, but I feel like the math is ♥♥♥♥ed up because a rebellion popped up nearly every other turn in the same province (or slave rebellion). I don't know if I built the wrong buildings, but I spent nearly 10 years running back and forth between the same cities in Northern Italy putting down rebellions turn after turn. Something isn't right there.\n\nOverall, I don't understand why Rome 2 turned out how it did. Shogun 2 and it's expansions were probably the most polished games in the entire series, yet the sequel feels unfinished.","November 12, 2015","false","20.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"
