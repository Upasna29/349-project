"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/3390/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Everyone has their place on the food chain. It's a static reference to our predators and prey, dictating the creatures we're able to dominate, and those we would be better off avoiding. Sitting on the top of the chain, we as humans need not worry about being spontaneously eaten while simply out on a morning walk, but for the aquatic dwellers in Feeding Frenzy 2 it's a constant race to eat or be eaten, with a constantly evolving menu as every fish fills its belly and inflates itself in order to devour more and more. Morbid stuff for a casual game.\n\nFeeding Frenzy 2 essentially works on the basis that there's always a bigger fish, and you want to be it. Gameplay is almost suffocatingly simple, boiling down to "eat what's smaller than you; avoid what's bigger" with the only change coming when you eat enough of the smaller fish that you're no longer one of them, and can then swim around chomping on everything that moves. It's basic, though undeniably enjoyable for what it is. Levels aren't particularly well balanced, and the lack of widescreen support (which means you are forced to play in a very narrow field of view) makes most deaths seem unfair, but otherwise it's a perfectly solid casual experience (if far less rewarding than I remember it being almost a decade ago upon release).\n\nBudget priced and good for a few hours, I can recommend Feeding Frenzy 2 provided you are OK with playing what is ultimately little more than a mouse exercise. I doesn't hold up under extended play sessions, but for a few minutes a day it's a cute lesson on meaningless homicide, with some subliminal racist undertones to boot.

The basic premise is you begin as a small fish and must eat like sized or smaller fish until you grow big enough to eat the next largest fish.  The games graphics are bright and cheerful, the music appropriate and not aggravating, and the scoring screens even offer a little bit of fun information about fish.  While this game would be perfect for kids, the gameplay is brisk enough to be enjoyed by adults as well.  My only minor concerns with the game are the lack of Steam Overlay support, and a no Vysync option, which for high end systems may lead to some minor graphic tearing.  Altogether though, the game is fun and inexpensive and well worth your gaming dollar.","July 22, 2012","true","0.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","2"

As a small fish, you start out eating anything smaller than yourself, until you grow big enough to eat bigger fish. A simple enough concept, but difficult with the bigger fish trying to eat you while you try to even get to their size category.\n\nThough it is a relatively old game, and the levels are pretty much the same, just with increasing difficulty, Feeding Frenzy has that element about it which makes it challenging and worth playing several times.

Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown Deluxe™ is one of the last old-school classics, and every modern game should try to learn from the greatness of this title.\n\nFrom the astounding, vivid, almost LIFELIKE visuals which really capture the feeling of a deep sea aquatic adventure, to the dynamic, orchestral soundtrack which supplements the gameplay extremely well; this game is as close to perfection as one can get. But Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown Deluxe™ is more than a game; it is a critique towards the human condition in the 21st Century. The world order in Feeding Frenzy 2: Shipwreck Showdown Deluxe™ is eat, or be eaten; much like it is in our society.\n\nPersonally, I think this game should be remastered with modern technology, to give the developers the possibility to fully realize their vision for this groundbreaking game, which was not possible at the time of it´s release. Just imagine this: Feeding Frenzy 3. With even better visuals, Oculus Rift Support, and a multiplayer to fully capture the Online market. I have a dream. And this dream is Feeding Frenzy.","February 8, 2014","true","2.0"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","23","42","0","0"

I can't imagine playing it for hours on end though.","March 28, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is also the sequel to the 2004 title, Feeding Frenzy. The game was developed and published by PopCap Games.\n\nContents\n\n1 Gameplay\n2 Plot\n2.1 Special abilities\n2.2 Power-ups\n2.3 Environments\n2.3.1 Above water challenges\n2.3.2 Midnight Zone\n2.4 Playable characters\n3 References\n4 External links\n\nGameplay\n\nAs in Feeding Frenzy, players have to control several fast growing marine predators who are out to uncover a mystery which is lurking in the ocean. The aim of the game is to avoid predators and obstacles while eating other smaller fish and creatures, eventually reaching the top of the food chain. Feeding Frenzy 2 includes 60 new levels which feature scenery such as new underwater worlds, coral reefs, deep sea caves, and sunken ships, as well as above water challenges. The story mode starts the player as a small butterfly fish named Boris. The player has to eat and chomp his or her way to the top of the food chain. Along the way, the player meets new creatures, both friendly and unfriendly.\nPlot\n\nThe player controls different fishes. We start first as Boris the butterfly fish. In the end of each the 9th stage, the fish saw a dark shadow. After moving on and moving on until we reach Goliath the shark, Goliath reached the top of the food chain and battles the Intruder. He lured the Intruder to a nearby mine. When the INTRUDER explodes the mine, it stays stunned and we have to eat enough shrink shroom to attack the intruder. After defeating the INTRUDER, the alien fish shrunk and escaped, so we have to re-control the fish in the previous food chain to track down the Intruder. The stages after the first boss battle got more difficult, and each fish that we re-control have 3 stages only. However this is an exception to Edie the Angler Fish as the Intruder was said to be afraid of the dark. After we reach the last stage, Boris battles the Intruder in an ocean full of cuttlefish and poison fishes. After shrinking the Intruder for one last time, the Intruder was eaten by Boris.\nSpecial abilities\n\nThe animals which the player controls have special abilities, although these are generally quite similar to those in the previous title. They include a "dash" maneuver for a quick burst of speed, the ability to "suck up" a large school of fish all at once, as well as an ability which allows the character Edie to light up her way.\nPower-ups\n\nThe game features power-ups which can be used to gain instantaneous or short term effects. These include older power-ups from the previous game, as well as completely new ones:\n\nLighting Bolt: A lightning bolt icon which is usually stored in a bubble. The effect of this power-up is to provide increased swimming speed.\nShrink Shroom: The effect of this power-up is to shrink any fish whose size is bigger than the player.\nInstant Illuminate: Lights up the whole screen for a few moments during the "Midnight Zones".\nLooney Lures: This power-up is displayed as a hook icon. It lures and moves bigger fish off of the screen.\n1UP: The player is awarded an extra life.\nGolden Herring: This fish makes the player grow one level size, allowing you to eat the next biggest fish. This fish is fast though, and the best method of catching it is to use the inhale ability.\nPlankton: Can be eaten by Edie for light in midnight zones.\n\nEnvironments\nAbove water challenges\n\nIn some levels the player will be able to jump out of the water, catching several insects and bugs which wander near the surface. In the air, the player can use an ability which sucks a number of insects at the same time. The player can also do back flips to gain more style points, while a failed attempt will result in a belly flop. Also some are just in the middle waters of the ocean and are like midnights zones, only the giant difference is it has light.\nMidnight Zone\n\nThe player will also come across several “Midnight Zones”. During these levels Edie the anglerfish's illuminating lure will be used to light the player’s way. However, eventually the power of her illuminating lure will decrease. Hence, Edie has to hunt for bioluminescent plankton to increase the lighted area of the level. A bulb icon power-up can be eaten for instant full screen illumination.\nPlayable characters\n\nBoris - Boris the butterfly fish is the first playable character in the game. He lives in the warm waters of the Sandy Shoal, a beautiful area off the Frenzy Coast. He is the first to meet oysters that give pearls and sometimes power ups, and also meets starfish and sharks.\n\nLayla - Layla the queen triggerfish is the second playable character in the game. She lives in the warm water of Paradise Reef and is the first to meet barracuda enemies and shrink shrooms.\n\nEdie - Edie the anglerfish is the third playable character. Edie's levels are difficult because her several of levels are the "Midnight Zones". Note that the fish's gender has been changed to female due to the fact that only female angler fish emit light; this was a mistake in the original game. She is the only returning playable character from the first game.\n\nPeter - Peter the pompano is the fourth playable character in the game. He lives in Buccaneer Bay, where the player will first come across cuttlefish, which shoot ink.\n\nHarry - Harry the humphead wrasse is the fifth playable character in the game, the balloons are back after a while and you can again jump for bonuses out of the water. Also, he meets pelicans.\n\nGoliath - Goliath the great white shark is the sixth playable character in the game. He is very high up in the food chain, and is the first to fight "The Intruder".\n\nThe Intruder - The Intruder is an alien fish disrupting the food chain. The player is required to fight it every 3 levels after Goliath defeats it for the first time. The player then moves lower down the food chain, playing as previous characters until The Intruder is defeated for the last time, after which Boris eats it. This completes the game. The Intruder is then unlocked as a playable character, and the player can then play through the entire game again as The Intruder.\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/f/ffrenzy2xboxlivearcade/\n\nExternal links\n\nFeeding Frenzy 2 Official site\nFeeding Frenzy 2 at MobyGames\n\nCategories:\n\n2006 video games\nWindows games\nXbox 360 Live Arcade games\nPlayStation Network games\nPopCap games\n\nI would buy this game multiple times if i could, just buy it.\n\nBestgameyouwilleverplayonthisplanetdonotforgettobuybread/10","April 15, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Anyone who enjoyed the first stage of Spore where you were a little creature trying to eat small things and grow while avoiding things bigger than you should check this out.  There is enough variety across the 60 levels to keep things interesting.  You get to play as several different kinds of fish and prey on a variety of different fish as well.  There are powerups and obstacles that come and go.  There are some fun boss battles (against the same enemy as different fish.)  There is a decent, casual level of challenge, with one of the levels toward the end being rather challenging.  There is a nice surprise after you beat the game, and for some added replayability and challenge, there is a time attack mode.","April 30, 2014","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.","September 14, 2012","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And you try to avoid getting eaten by something bigger yourself until you are on top of the foodchain. It's similar to games like Osmos or the first stage of spore only you are a fish. The artstyle aren't great, but does the trick. The thing what makes Feeding Frenzy 2 less enjoyable is the horrible mouse controls. So I would recommend just getting another one of these games with more enjoyable controls.","May 10, 2014","false","0.5"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","4","15","0","0"

However, it has not aged well, at all. The first problem is the game's resolution. I know this game is pretty old, and super HD things weren't around back then, but the view you're given is so very very limited. There is no warning of any predators that are coming from off screen. Far too often you will find yourself swimming right into a fish. Another issue is that the game is crazy unfair. Most of the power-downs that prey emit are pretty much death sentences. Fighting the alien fish (5 times with no difference in the fight every 2 levels...) or a barracuda is pretty much impossible because they just turn around and eat you right away. Another big issue is your growth rate. You have to eat an insane number of fish before growing to the next level. This is hindered even more due to the fact you lose all of your growth bar for that level once you die. Finally, the concept of the game itself is pretty flawed as well. The game's level difficulty is reversed: it is easier at the end of the level than at the start. This makes the feeling of completing a level a chore rather than a rewarding experience.\n\nOverall, skip this even if you've played it back in the day. It is not at all worth $10. $5 is a decent price, but only if you've played it before and are prepared to rage often.","March 15, 2014","false","3.1"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","5","19","0","1"

It is fun and simple, a great game which is worth the money, from time to time you feel like replaying the game again.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and fun, I love it, you are a small fish at start and you have to eat other smaller fish to grow bigger. 60 levels are avalable, which is pretty much, it takes up to 3 hours to finish, and they are not so hard but sometimes they are really challenging. You play with different fish during your adventure, and eat many different fish during your adventure and you play in different locations. There are many power ups and abilites which make the game more interesting. After each level there is a fun fact, which is nice, I learned many stuff during the game.\n\nThe graphics are nice, with an unique art style which is very well-done, the sound is very good too, the music is relaxing and the sound when you eat a fish is very satisfying, I love it.\n\nI recommend this game, a fun and simple oldschool game, which I like playing from time to time, 10/10.","July 29, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was either this game or what was basically Two-Player Unreal Tournament if Unreal Tournament was played with robots and one person controlled the legs and one person controlled the cannons (so, nothing like Unreal Tournament), and we had run out of play time on the robot game.  So, I wandered over an booted up an old arcade machine for this game.  I was fascinated.  And now that I saw it on steam, I decided I had to buy it, for nostalgia, of course.\nIt's exactly as I remember it, which in this case is a very good thing.","June 14, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
