I am interested to see what the other modes will bring to this title in the future. I think the price is currently a bit steep for the amount of content you currently receive. But this game has a lot of promise and future content in the pipeline. More details in the video below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kctGh9gkncQ","February 4","true","1.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

Right away, I felt lost. There's nothing to indicate from the on-game screen or GUI exactly what the objective of the game is or how to play it.\n\nA basic Google search for, "How to play Super Bomb Rush" led me to a post in the Steam discussion forum asking exactly the same questions that I had. "What do I do?" "How do I play" What's the objective?" I saw a response from the developer to, "adhere to the help menu," and of course, that was not at all helpful. Still at a loss, I went back to the game and looked at all the menus that were available to me. I came across the instructions stating to, "attack the directional arrows," but that just confused me even further. How can I attack the arrows on the left side of the screen when the bomb vibrates but doesn't move? Is it a racing game? A combat game? Tower defense? What the heck is this crazy little game?\n\nI then came across a post from another player explaining that we were to, "copy the arrows." From there, I figured out exactly what this game is. It's like Simon, a game where you need very quick reactions to mimic button presses that are being randomly prompted by the game. Mimic the directional arrows with your joystick quickly enough, and the bomb is "diffused." This process then becomes more difficult with more complex combinations of arrows. Having gotten at least that much out of the way, I went back to the game prepared to diffuse some bombs.\n\nIt was at this point that my confusion turned into frustration and flat-out being underwhelmed by the entire experience. There were countless times that I knew I was completing the arrow combination correctly and quickly enough using the joystick on my XBox360 controller, and yet, the stupid little bomb blew up anyway. There just didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the game itself and no consistency to the controls.\n\nGraphically, it was mediocre. The colors were bright and even distracting, but didn't appear to require much thought. However, when you're staring at the left side of the screen at the arrows, I guess it really doesn't much matter what's happening on the rest of the screen.\n\nAudibly, there's also much to be desired. The sound effects give the impression of a classic standup arcade game from the 80s, and if you were gaming at that time like I was, then this bit of nostalgia might be appealing, but overall, there's just not much to it.\n\nThe user interface, sound design, and graphics all left a lot to be desired, and the lack of direction is noticeable to more players than just myself. If that weren't enough of a deterrent, the gameplay itself was inconsistent and underwhelming. I simply cannot recommend the game, but I do applaud the concept. It's got potential, but there's work to be done here.","February 27","false","0.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

On one hand we can have an incomplete product with the promise of future developments, on the other hand we can get in on the ground floor and help get these games through their Early Access phase. Super Bomb Rush is a game based around Dance Dance Revolution style inputs and Score Attack Gameplay while defusing bombs that currently has some weird design decisions.\n\nReview - https://youtu.be/zzb9GrvgxmM\n\nThe enjoyment of the game comes from the quick thinking mixed with high pressure situations. The game mixes it up by showing ‘special’ inputs, for e.g. a red arrow means you do the reverse of the direction show, a silver arrow means you have to click it last and do the opposite direction, confusing stuff. The game is paced pretty well though it can be pretty discouraging as there is no difficulty system so you’ll always hit a wall, possible game mode in the future maybe?\n\nIt also features a versus and co-op game mode, sadly these are stuck behind an in game progression wall, either score highly or play a lot of games. It feels a little silly to lock out the most interesting part of the game to players. The ‘Rush Coins’ you gain from playing the game can be used to unlock them, but you’re looking at an hour on gameplay just to unlock versus mode if you’re unable to get a high enough score in arcade.\n\nThe overall presentation is good, the game is easy to read when it comes to inputs and your current situation, the sounds really add to the game with special mention to the banging soundtrack. There probably could be some changes here and there which I discuss in the video review, but it gets the job done.\n\nOverall I think Super Bomb Rush is actually a pretty interesting game, it’s just that the most interesting features are stuck behind weird progression walls, but that’s how Early Access works, it’s out there in an early state so changes can be made. The base game by itself it quite difficult, and fans of high tension, Score Attack, DDR style inputs will love the game, for those not as interested in pushing leader boards or grinding to push it to the limit, the game doesn’t really offer much for you.","February 3","true","1.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","0"
