A lich is p.much a beefed up necromancer with an inconvenience of being unable to hire villagers for a career at Zombie Inc, he has to rely on kills to raise skellies in the field - however, he gets freespawn undead every turn (all the way up to f***ing ghosts later on, not as often though). Sorceress to the old mage is like D&D sorcerer to classic wizard - no more building magic towers and memorizing 3 fireballs, just level up spellschool skills, pick a new spell every level and cast it as many times as you have slots in that circle. Would make more sense if she couldn't un-learn previously selected spells though and had to stick forever with whatever you have picked. The pilot has wonderful mobility on strategic map (forget about landing straight on enemy capital though... can't attack forts from the air *and* can't walk on earth either until level 10); straight up warrior/scout for combat though. Haven't played the legate yet.\n\nNice to see unique victory conditions in scenarios too. Having to capture all enemy capitals is kinda tired by now. Here's hoping for a new campaign. More down to earth, presumably, no more soaring through astral?","June 3","true","26.7"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

Dont get me wrong, I loved the old Eador campaign, but having a large map with actual plot to it is pretty fresh for this game. The new units are interesting, though I'm concerned about whats going to happen to the some of the old units. I know you can still get things like swordsmen in the tavern and from recruitment sites, but I might end out wishing I had them over some of the new units available in town. Hopefully there'll be some sort of improvement made to that. I've only played the new Commander class, she looks awesome, has smooth and quick animations which is great in my opinion.\n\nIf you're not a fan of early access, please stear clear of this game. I've already seen people being toxic on the forums over minute unfinished details in the game or obvious placeholders. This game does need some community feedback though. So dont be scared to drop off ideas on the forums.","June 3","true","4.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Masters of the Broken World is my 2nd most-played (only behind TF2 lol) with 1,353 hours. I would just like to thank Snowbird Studios for making this dream a reality for all of us hardcore Eador fans.","June 4","true","2.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","3"

If something changes I'll revise my statement.\n\nthis "game" consists basically of just a few new units, whose skins mostly don't even function properly. The new pilot character doesn't function at all.\n\nas far as i can see, this is a rip off. Why? because it is the same game as Masters of a broken world. Minus the campaign of course. Have you bought the DlC for it ? Fantastic, because it doesn't carry over either as far as i can tell.\n\nhow in god's name can this be considered early access? it is the same game, and so far you have only added the localisation for a few new units? (-minus the skins)\n\nI want way way more then just this! and for chists sake, at least let us campaign with those new heroes!\n\n","June 3","false","0.3"," 51 of 107 people (48%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","48","51","107","5","12"
