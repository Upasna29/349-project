Perfectly describes the game actually. It wont take you long to finish (maybe 30-45 minutes), although if you go back to try and get to the top of every platform, perhaps a bit longer. The controls are seamless with the gamepad. I didnt try k/m, so no report on that.\n\nReally, just a nice experience, and the entire game coalesces into a cleverly constructed thank you at the end.\n\nI give it 8 rays of sunshine reflecting off of a placid lake of consciousness out of 10 possible.","December 24, 2015","true","1.5"," 74 of 78 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","74","78","9","2"

This is one of those games where an ‘on the fence’ recommendation would be perfect but I’ve decided to go for a positive recommendation since I did enjoy playing it.\n\nPresentation\nRefunct is an absolutely beautiful game, this is easily its strongest area. The graphics are stunning and fit the minimalist world you find yourself in perfectly. There’s no UI while playing the game meaning you can get some really nice looking screenshots.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535734328\n\nGameplay\nComparable to games such as Lemma, Refunct is effectively a parkour game where you run around the map to press big red buttons as well as collect little floating boxes. You start with a small section of the map but pressing a red button will unlock the next section as well as the next button, later sections sometimes contain two red buttons.\n\nAs well as running around on the surface you can also dive underwater and experience the world from below. This is generally used to get to a platform you can’t jump to but Refunct looks as good underwater as it does above so it’s also a great place to snap some screenshots.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535738100\n\nLength\nHere lies the main issue of the game, it’s roughly twenty minutes long. I’ve never been one for speed-running so I took my time with this game but even then I managed to complete it 100% after just twenty minutes, give or take a minute or two. I have nothing against short games and I did really enjoy playing Refunct but I feel it’s hard to justify purchasing such a short game for much more than £1.\n\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing on Sale.\n\nRefunct is a fun first person platforming game but coming in at twenty minutes long it’s hard to justify a purchase at full price. If you don’t mind paying for such a short experience then go for it, it is after all an enjoyable experience, but I would suggest waiting for it to get a discount of some sort.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","October 16, 2015","true","3.4"," 79 of 90 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","79","90","5","3"

The sound, the visual, the movement, it's lovely. But it's a prototype. A very nice prototype, but a prototype nonetheless.  I got 100% in 20 minutes. And yes, length isn't everything, I've played some FANTASTIC 60 minute games, but they had something that really stood out. This is just all-around nice, but has nothing big, no punchlines, nothing new. I really, REALLY want to see where this guy is going, but I don't think that this product, as it is, is worth spending money on.\n\nI feel very conflicted about this review, really. I'm posting it as a negative not to chastise the developer, but to encourage them to go bigger with whatever they do next.\n\nEdit: It turns out that this guy has previously made a very similar game with more mechanics to it that looks quite fun (called Refunktion), and has been developing various things for years. It's honestly a little disappointing that he's selling Refunct for three bucks when he can clearly do better than this.","November 9, 2015","false","0.4"," 74 of 109 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","74","109","4","8"

It's first person puzzle platforming, and it's just very well done. You can jump and wall-jump, you collect little box thingies, paint platforms green by stepping on them and you push buttons to unlock new areas of the level. that's about it. But while you don't have a lot of mechanics to work with, the ones you have are just well implemented and enjoyable. And the soundtrack is very relaxing and just suits the gameplay well. I had a very nice hour of gameplay with it (probably more like 45 minutes, considering I had a lengthy cigarette break ^^) and completed it 100%. I would gladly pay the same price again for a new level.","October 24, 2015","true","3.6"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","27","31","2","0"

The visuals are pleasant, the soundtrack is nice, and it controls decently enough.\n\nBut I can't honestly say that I would recommend playing it. There aren't any particularly imaginative mechanics, there's no challenge, and there's no story at all. It doesn't even have the inherent motivation of "I want to solve the puzzles", because it's always immediately obvious how to do the next section. You're just going to spend about 25 minutes making simple jumps between platforms to step on some buttons and collect some cubes, and then you'll be done with it (but you'll still need to leave it idling for several hours if you want to get the trading cards).\n\nOverall, I feel like this is the skeleton of a game. The developers could definitely take what they've created here, expand on it, and build it into a high-quality, interesting game. But Refunct is a lot closer to a prototype than it is to that hypothetical game.","April 21","false","0.5"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

It’s pretty visually and simple in function. All you do is jump from platform to platform. Each platform, once stepped on, will be revamped with colour. There are red buttons which you step on to expand to new areas and little cubes you can collect in harder-to-reach places.\n\nThe game in it’s entirety is short, simple and easy. It’s good for something to play between games, when you are bored and feeling lazy or generally don’t have much time but want to fit something in.\n\nIt took me 40 minutes or so to put colour back into every platform, to push all buttons and collect all cubes (Essentially 100%ing the game). So that’s likely how long it’d take, less if you don’t end up wondering around for 10 minutes looking for the last cube like I did.\n\n\nTL;DR : Short, simple and easy game.

Due to that, the game doesn't need to explain stuff to you with text on the screen, which keeps to the relaxing nature of the game.\nYour objective is to bring the minimalist world back to life, by pressing buttons scattered around. As you do this, more parts of the world rise out of the water, and are available to traverse. The cool thing is the entire game takes place in this one area, there is no level select.\n\nThroughout the environment there are some objects which create for a bit more interesting gameplay. Springs that throw you up into the air, or pipes you need to slide through. You also need to wall jump to get to some places.\n\nAlthough the game is very short, I had an enjoyable little journey.

It's a simple affair and, apart from a few possibly tricky sections, you can easily move seamlessly between blocks thanks to the tight controls: the actual gameplay is good enough to be fun while its simplicity and atmosphere easily make this a relaxing game to play.\n\nDepending on how easily you discover your abilities you might find certain parts a bit awkward to navigate but trial and error will generally solve things quickly: even if you find a jump a bit hard the lack of timers and the fact you don't necessarily have to 100% complete the game to get to its ending make Refunct an experience free of frustration. Sadly it's short, very short and once you're done there's no extra levels or anything else to do unless you want to go through it again: more levels or a way to randomize the area you play in'd have been a great addition.\n\nEven as things stand Refunct is a game worth playing for the experience it's able to provide, it's good, fun and easily accessible by people of all ages and skill: just be mindful of its short length and get it on sale if possible.\n","April 19","true","3.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The goal of the game is simple: Jump on the gray platforms to make them green and press the red buttons to make new gray platforms coming out of the water. But the most fun part of the game is in my opinion to get from point A to B. All these platforms give you so many opportunities to move forward that it feels easy to travel with a smooth run but still stays a challange. Smoothness is probably the best word to describe this game.\nLong story short, just buy it. It´s cheap, looks fantastic and it´s amazing to play.\nOne of the coolest games to just turn off your brain and play a little.","May 6","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(I was afk for a while, so my playtime is longer.)\n\nIn short, you jump and walljump from one platform to another, turning their concrete surface to grass (an easy and effective way to track your progress). You reach a checkpoint, and more platforms appear in the distance for you to reach and convert to grass. And on and on. Plus some items to collect. That's about it and it sounds boring to read, but it's so well done, relaxing and that muuuuuuuusic, that you enjoy it throughout.\n\nI definitely recommend it. So very simple, so very enjoyable. The music, again, is utterly lovely. I'd pay for the soundtrack. The two endings (you can see both, one for reaching the final platform and one for 100% completion) are cute and will make you smile.\n\nPS. As a totally absolutely amateur game designer / developer, this game also makes me happy because it's such a great example of a "first game" that's well done, keeping things simple and managing a great job of it. Coming up with a very simple concept, developing it very well and wrapping everything in a refined package. Definitely going to pay attention to this developer's next games.","October 30, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngsdd/recommended/406150/","fngsdd","fungusdude4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngsdd/","330 products in account","Refunct is a simple little 3D platformer that just wants you to have fun. You begin by rising from the sea along with a small island of square platforms. The map expands as you find buttons to bring more platforms up from the water. It's sort of like a growing playground of angular islands and towers and it's rather cool to see the world form around you. You can even dive below the surface to see all the islands lying in wait. Along with the buttons, you can try to color all the platforms by touching them or find scattered pickups to boost your completion percentage. The controls are fairly basic. You can jump, climb, crouch, and slide.  The climbing mechanic is very welcome, since it eliminates those frustrating, barely-missed jumps by allowing you to pull yourself up onto a plaform. Wall-jumping also becomes important later, but the slide maneuver is rarely used.\n\nThe graphics are refreshing and minimal,  crisp and colorful with some nice lighting effects. Unfortunately, some of the effects can be blurry and inconsistent since you'll be whipping the camera around a lot. The music is pretty upbeat and sometimes ethereal. It's very well done, probably worth a soundtrack purchase. Refunct is certainly nice to look at and listen to.\n\nThe platforming is, for better or worse, generally simple and easy. There are some tricky jumps, but they usually spare you the trial and error. Refunct is fast-paced and won't take you long to complete, but you could do multiple playthroughs or just run around for fun. The game is also very polished. I barely encountered any bugs or gameplay issues. The experience is modestly priced and easily enjoyable.

You just jump from one platform to another. You also have ability [SLIGHT GAMEPLAY MECHANIC SPOILER AHEAD] to jump between the walls, however you're not introduced to that ability. You need to discover it yourself and you're gonna need it a lot later on. Your goal is to step on every platform and to collect everything so you can achieve 100%. It took me only 40 minutes to achieve 100% and while doing so I got all achievements, and that's the only con of this game, the fact that is too short, so I would recommend waiting for sale.\n\nVerdict: Very relaxing game, with nice visuals and beautiful music. Simple, but fun gameplay. Too short, so maybe it's better to get it on sale.\n\nPersonal rating: 8/10","March 23","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's purpose is to step on different blocks and raise them from the sea by stepping on a red button. There's a couple of collectibles around for achievements and some of the blocks require a little bit of finesse but nothing too hard.\nThe soundtrack fits perfectly and is quite lovely and the overall message of the game will certainly lift your spirits.

The game is relaxing and it has fantastic music. The average person takes about 30 minutes on their first run to finish this game. The world record at the time of this writing is about 5 minutes, which I find to be pretty impressive. The developers do allow a seperate purchase of the sound track for $3, which I think is a great deal! I will give you one hint, because I started over the game 3 times when I was confused about how to get through certain areas. This game DOES have a wall jump. Its an extremely important mechanic and one that speedrunners use to get through the game more quickly. This game is fun, and a great romp. But if you have $3 and have to choose between the game and the sound track, I'd say go with the sound track. -PR0XIDIAN","May 31","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/406150/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","The current torrent of AAA releases makes for an overwhelming selection for a reviewer like myself. There are titles that we’re simply expected to play, like one I shall not mention until this time next week, and others which only appeal to a very certain demographic. Indeed that’s exactly why all these games can all launch at the same time and still find the financial success they were looking for. However most of these games are incredible time sinks and my one review a week schedule simply can’t accomodate them. Thus I look to the poor indies who found themselves in the mix with the giants of the industry to fill the gap with their shorter, more concise experiences. Refunct certainly fills the first requirement aptly clocking in as probably the quickest game I’ve ever fully completed.\n\nRefunct Review Screenshot Wallpaper Opening Scene\n\nRefunct is a first person platforming game, something which I’m sure strikes fear into the hearts of all gamers. You see platforming in first person has always been somewhat of a hit and miss affair, both in the literal and figurative sense. Judging distances in first person mode is a flawed endeavour as there’s no real way (apart from trial and error) to figure out how far your character can move or whether or not you jumped too early. Refunct however has billed itself as a game that everyone can play, meaning that the developer must think they’ve addressed the first person platforming problems. To an extent they have, but not because of any new or clever mechanics.\n\nInstead Refunct is incredibly generous with its hit detection when it comes to near misses on ledges and the height that you character can jump. For the first few jumps I was expecting the normal platforming behaviour, you don’t make it you fall flat on your face, however if you’re within a certain tolerance your character will pull themselves up. Later on, when its revealed that you can push yourself off walls, you can exploit this somewhat as even full misses can result in a successful jump if you bounce yourself off the wall. For new players this means that jumping puzzles, which typically rely on pinpoint precision, are much more forgiving. For power players like myself though it’s an easily exploitable system that significantly reduces the play time of Refunct.\n\nRefunct uses the Unreal engine and, judging by the world effects it makes generous use of, must be running on the latest version of said engine. Whilst it’s one of the most basic games you’re ever likely to come across, pretty much everything is a block or cylinder, it does look incredibly nice. The subtle day/night cycles, clouds gently passing by in the background and the accompanying soundtrack do make for a rather pleasant experience. That being said in terms of graphics it’s not much more than a demonstration of Unreal’s inbuilt capabilities. I guess where I’m going this is: I like the way Refunct looks but it feels like a low amount of effort went into making it look that way.\n\nFrom a game play perspective Refunct is pretty seamless with the generous platforming mechanic smoothing over what could have been many frustrating moments. At the same time however this means that for any kind of regular gamer Refunct is likely to be little more than a curious distraction as I was able to complete the whole thing, to 100%, in no less than 22 minutes. For some this might be a problem, especially in the age of numerous other $2 games that give many more hours of play time, so it’s something to bear in mind if a simplistic first person platformer is sounding like something you’d like to play.\n\nRefunct is a succinct first person platformer that is far more forgiving than its genre would lead you to believe. The generous platforming mechanics means that a wide variety of players would be able to play it start to finish without the frustration that accompanies nearly every other title that incorporates such mechanics. It simple and clean aesthetic does make for a kind of zen experience which is only heightened by it’s great soundtrack. However it is a brutally short experience, almost shorter than the time it will take many to download it. Overall I’d recommend it but only if you’re looking for an after-AAA mint to clean your pallet before you set yourself up for your next meal.\n\nRating: 7.5/10\n\nRefunct is available on PC right now for $2.99. Total play time was 22 minutes with 100% of the achievements unlocked.","April 24","true","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I also have some gifs of the game on my website if you want to take a look at them.  http://indiesense.github.io/reviews/Refunct/\n\nOverview:\n\nFirst person platforming games are making a comeback, and parkour-style games look they’re starting to come back in full force. Refunct is a short and sweet platformer, featuring a minimalistic art style, light elements of parkour, an engaging musical track and flowing gameplay.  Discover the world and create your own path as you jump, slide, climb and swim around a beautifully crafted world.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics in Refunct are simple, minimalistic perfection.  Refunct embraces the simplicity of it’s graphics and makes excellent use of its setting and environment to generate beauty from simplicity.  Refunct’s world features a day and night system, with the world gracefully changing from a blinding morning as the sun rises, to a cool evening as the sun slowly dips below the horizon as stars dot the sky.  The various blocks the make up the environment start off gray,  and regain their color as you bound across the world, as you revitalize the world and bring life to your surroundings.  For all of it’s beauty, Refunct does run into a common stumbling block that is seen often in minimalistic design, repetitiveness.  As beautiful as the world looks, the revitalized blocks look identical to each other, the same brown and green platforms dot the landscape, and while at first aesthetically pleasing, different color schemes would break up the monotony of the world.  Another small complaint about the graphics, is how the “grass” that appears after you revitalize a block, is just the top of the block colored green, not actual grass.  All things considered, the graphics for Refunct are gorgeous, with only a few minor details that take away from the experience.\n\nSound:\n\nRefunct’s gameplay emphasizes peaceful exploration, and the soundtrack does a wonderful job in creating a relaxing, almost dream-like atmosphere to complement the gameplay.  The music is never intrusive and helps push the gameplay along, allowing you to feel like it’s okay to take your time and explore all the nooks and crannies the world has to offer.  The sound effects that accompany your actions are functional, they help emphasize your movement and feel organic to the game.\n\nGameplay:\n\nFirst person platforming has never been a popular genre, with Mirror’s Edge being the only AAA game in recent memory that fits the genre.  With the recent resurgence of indie games, we’re now seeing a wider variety of games, covering genres that have largely gone untouched by some of the bigger studios.  Refunct has tossed its hat into the first person platforming ring, where it joins recent recent indie newcomers such as Deadcore and Lemma.\n\nWith exploration being the main focus of Refunct, tight controls and solid movement mechanics are going to be foundational to enjoyable gameplay. At first glance, Refunct doesn’t seem to innovate or push the envelope for first person platformers.  The basic movement mechanics are all there, you’re able to jump, climb up ledges, swim, slide and wall jump.  These mechanics aren’t particularly new or different and don’t seem to make the game stand out at all, but that’s exactly why the game shines.  The mechanics are implemented wonderfully, all of these mechanics feel organic and natural extension of your character.  There aren’t outstanding bugs, or quirks about these movement options, which allow you to become fully immersed in the game.  When these mechanics are combined with tight and responsive controls, any mistakes that are made, fall on you.  Refunct is a game about exploration, about forging new paths and discovering different avenues to reach your goal.  The controls and movement options are solidly implemented and augment the atmosphere that the game is trying to convey.\n\nThe actual gameplay for Refunct is simple, you spawn on a cluster of grey blocks that make up a tiny island and there’s a big red button that’s begging to be pressed, once you press the button more islands will rise out of the ocean with more big red buttons that you’ll need to press.  As you hop from island to island, you’ll revitalize the world around you, as grey blocks burst into color as soon as you step onto them.  The game isn’t particularly challenging, with only the last couple of buttons providing an actual challenge on how to reach them, but the point of this game isn’t to provide a challenge.  Refunct provides an unique experience that’s not common in indie games nor AAA games.  It manages to meld the atmosphere and purposefulness of walking simulators, with the joy and mechanics of a well polished platformer.\n\nConclusion/Notes:\nFor all of its strong points, Refunct does have one glaring flaw, length.  Refunct took me about half an hour to complete to 100 percent, and that’s with a lot of exploration(diving into the water is an amazing experience) and trying to find alternate routes to get to a button.  As much as I did enjoy my time with Refunct, the time was woefully short and left me wanting more.  The more challenging platforming came near the end and I would have loved an additional hour to spend roaming the world and completing more platforming challenges.   At times, Refunct feels like the engine for a much larger and more ambitious game, as the mechanics and controls polished to perfection.  Even given the length of the game, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Refunct and would recommend it to those that are looking for something a little bit different.\n\nI do want to spend some time giving out a shout out to the developer for the game, Dominique Grieshofer.  Not only is the game akin to a pleasant stroll in the park, he manages to fully immerse the player in the world.  He seems to have an inherent ability to speak to the player and direct the player towards an objective without explicitly telling the player what to do and where to go.\n\nIf you’re on the fence about whether or not the game is for you, hopefully the gifs do an adequate job on relating the atmosphere and tranquility that the game offers.  The game sits at $3 on Steam and I believe it’s well worth the money.\n","October 21, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I recommend doing one of those other things instead, but if this sounds like your idea of a good time you probably won't be disappointed.\n\nAfter my first several minutes with Refunct it struck me as a cross between Mirror's Edge and Q*bert.  As I bounced from platform to platform in the first person to change its color I was discouraged by the distinct lack of parkour mechanics.  However the evolving landscape guided me toward discovering the parkour mechanics just beneath the surface of the gameplay and not only was I pleased with this extra layer of depth, but I was also impressed with how the game design revealed the game mechanics.\n\nFrom then on, interacting with various features of the environment to reach the next chunk of the level passed without event.  I was apprehensive about missing a jump and landing in the water until again the evolving environment dumped me in the water and I realized that my character could swim.  That was a relief.  Then the sky began to darken and I was filled with a sense of dread in anticipation of the monsters that invariably come out at night, but night passed without incident.  I came to enjoy sundown in Refunct because I liked how the shadows lengthened and moved across the world.\n\nAfter 32 minutes I had 99%ed the game.  Refunct is everything it is advertised to be: it is short, it is colorful, and it is peaceful.  Peaceful however is not necessarily soothing or relaxing.  The colors of the world do not make for draw dropping visuals.  The short length of the experience isn't a strike against it, either.  It's a short, low-pressure romp through a colorful environment, and that is it.  Refunct isn't good or bad, it's simply another option among the multitude of things to do.  I recommend doing one of those other things instead, but if this sounds like your idea of a good time you probably won't go wrong.","April 27","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The graphics and gameplay are amazingly simple, but the goal is challenging. If you're persistent, you can get to 100% completion in under 45 minutes (much less for you speed runners out there), The surprises at the end are phenomenal. It drops you in without any explanation and you kind of just fumble around until you understand what's going on. It teaches you the physics and controls without a single bit of tutorial. I love that in games. Finding the achievements was very easy, aside from getting to them. Some of them you couldn't get right away, you had to wait until later in the game to reach it.\n\nThere are some of the graphics I'd like to see improved like the particle and stream effects in the completion surprise. I know it's a really simple game, but some effects could be improved.\n\nOverall, this game is charming and peaceful.

Its aesthetic and playstyle are fluid and calm (alongside then zen background music). The level (there's only one!) unfolds as you successfully platform to the top of various rising towers.\n\nThe platforming overall is very forgiving and fun, and I found myself creating challenges for myself as I went: "I bet I can get all of those grey platforms to green without touching the water at this part..." and "I think I can get to that button without dropping below my current platform height...should be challenging, but if I walljump there..."\n\nIt's short, it's beautiful, and it only takes about 15-20 minutes tops.

The frustration of a missed jump is soon washed away by the serene vista and chilled out soundtrack.\n\nIt's very easy to get into and needs no tutorial, and as long as you have at least some hand-eye coordination it is suitable for all ages.\n\nSome semblance of a story would have been nice, but then again it might have ruined it too. I pretended I was raising Atlantis from the seabed and that the red cube collectables were artifacts from those long lost beneath the waves. Made sense to me anyway. Perhaps a dark sequel where you are raising R'lyeh to release Cthulhu would be pretty cool?

The graphics and gameplay are amazingly simple, but the goal is challenging. If you're persistent, you can get to 100% completion in under 45 minutes (much less for you speed runners out there), The surprises at the end are phenomenal. It drops you in without any explanation and you kind of just fumble around until you understand what's going on. It teaches you the physics and controls without a single bit of tutorial. I love that in games. Finding the achievements was very easy, aside from getting to them. Some of them you couldn't get right away, you had to wait until later in the game to reach it.\n\nThere are some of the graphics I'd like to see improved like the particle and stream effects in the completion surprise. I know it's a really simple game, but some effects could be improved.\n\nOverall, this game is charming and peaceful.

But Refunct gave a question based on what you are doing in life, and gave me some questions to ask myself.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nI put this game on my wishlist for no apparent reason asside from "Parkour" was one of it's discription.\nI didn't think much of it untill I started playing it. It has a GREAT blend of indie, casual, and parkour gameplay.\nThe soundtrack is just simple but upbeat to fit the game perfectly.\n\nIf you don't what to play this game or don't like the base parkour feal to it, I understand, but for people who what a different game to play, I HIGHLY recomend this game. I also think the game had work still to be done to it, but out of 10 I will give it a 8.5/10","April 18","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The frustration of a missed jump is soon washed away by the serene vista and chilled out soundtrack.\n\nIt's very easy to get into and needs no tutorial, and as long as you have at least some hand-eye coordination it is suitable for all ages.\n\nSome semblance of a story would have been nice, but then again it might have ruined it too. I pretended I was raising Atlantis from the seabed and that the red cube collectables were artifacts from those long lost beneath the waves. Made sense to me anyway. Perhaps a dark sequel where you are raising R'lyeh to release Cthulhu would be pretty cool?

Its aesthetic and playstyle are fluid and calm (alongside then zen background music). The level (there's only one!) unfolds as you successfully platform to the top of various rising towers.\n\nThe platforming overall is very forgiving and fun, and I found myself creating challenges for myself as I went: "I bet I can get all of those grey platforms to green without touching the water at this part..." and "I think I can get to that button without dropping below my current platform height...should be challenging, but if I walljump there..."\n\nIt's short, it's beautiful, and it only takes about 15-20 minutes tops.

It's a quite unique game itself and I quite enjoyed it, don't get me wrong! But man is it short! Finished it in 15-20 minutes, which makes me sad to think about it. Not because 3 euros is a lot of money, but I've found a lot of games worth a lot more just for a couple of euros more.\n\nThe game was fun, but it wasn't really a finished game at all. It almost feels like an alpha - shame really! Because it feels to me, there's a lot of potentials here.\n\nMaybe because it was too similar to his older project Refunktion. It has the same core mechanics - the only thing this has is no enemies. But if it lowered the price maybe it was worth buying, but at this price, I don't think it is. I still going to recommend it, because it's an awesome time filler and fun platformer! :)","February 29","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fluid, and the jump/crouch system works perfectly. Conservation of momentum lets you crouchslide under short obstacles and the wall-jumping makes me long for an Assassin's Creed/Tomb Raider remake that uses the same physics. It's short, yes but for the £1.00 I paid for this (on sale) it's one of the best experiences you'll have in a long time. The colours are vibrant and the music fits the ambience correctly.

It's not replayable or anything but for half the price of a beer, you get about that much entertainment. Combine the beer and the game and you get this beautiful game set with great music. Don't expect much, but enjoy the minimalist game feelings you get. There's no tutorial, just a natural learning curve that encourages you to try and play. Fun, no strings attached and beautiful.","May 27","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
