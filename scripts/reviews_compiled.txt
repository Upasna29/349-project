Simply amazing for 1 night, then you will never play it again.

Its way too shallow on content with mostly useless items and very few reasons to craft things twice.

Play on hard to add fear and slow you down. Or better yet, buy something else.

This could have been a great series but has already been abandoned.

One of the best games I dont recommend, if that makes sense.

It was fun for a couple hours.  Buy Subnautica instead.

This game was great in the beginning, however, content is limited because the dev's quit on the game during early access. It's virtually an underwater version of minecraft, with rebuilding your sub as endgame. No sandbox mode, just 3 slightly different versions of a survival mode. I rarely see anyone with more than 10 hours of gameplay because really there's only about 5 in this before you have nothing left to do, with no real wish for a replay.

Personally, I suggest Subnautica for those interested in this, as it has regular updates and dev's that care.

I really want to recommend this game.

It has a really cool premise and it is pretty well realised.

The problem is that it is short as all hell. Unlike other Minecraft-like" games out there this really does have a hard end point to it. Your objective is to collect all the pieces of your sub so that you can get back to the surface(which doesn't 

Great fun for the first 2 hours...then you run out of stuff to do.

If your looking for an alternative that actually has some content and regular updates check out Subnautica.

You can grow potatoes. 10/10

Okay, jokes aside, this game is pretty great. Been following/covering it since it was in alpha, and let me tell you, it's come a long way. I haven't checked out too much of the release version yet, but I'm having a lot of fun so far. It's pretty impressive that it was all done by one guy.

The base difficulty is pretty reasonable. Weapons take a while to get and killing fish for food draws blood, which means you'll have sharks coming around and being jerks. Growing potatoes also takes a reasonably long time as well.

If you're into hanging around underwater, building houses and riding around with an underwater scooter, you should get this game.

Putting this at the bottom so it doesn't get in the way of the review itself. Just a video of me messing around in the game, if you're into that kind of thing. http://youtu.be/EROAGyCMsd0

*** Fun game that is NOT worth the full price of $15 USD ***
*** ABANDONED EARLY ACCESS GAME ***

Now that I have those disclamers out of the way...This game is a watered down (pun intended) version of Minecraft that takes place under the ocean. The object is to survive below water and reconstruct your submarine to get yourself back to the surface.

This game does offer a sandbox version to it, which has its limit of replayability.  You can play this game in 3 modes, adventurer, which is how everyone starts off (allows death and respawning). Survival mode where you have just one life and submarine pieces are harder to locate and sandbox mode which in some part requires you have played a few games in the first 2 modes to be able to play sandbox mode.

The game offers a grand total 8 predators that you can fight and kill in the game and 3 of the 8 are sharks, so really 6 different predators if you count sharks as one type.  AGAIN, this is an abandoned early access game thus why variety in predators is lacking.  Also, you have a grand total of 3 tools, also because it was abandoned.  This game has only 5 ores you can mine (not including crystals) to use in crafting...again lack of depth due to abandonment by developers.

I have put many hours of game time into this game, most of which was done in early access hoping this game would get better and have more depth added to it, but like many other I was sorely misled that this game would become as great as its developers claimed it would be.

This game is absolutely fun to play, but can be played and won within 2-3 hours of game time. I still play this game often to see if I can beat it faster than the time before.  However, this makes the current asking price of $15 USD a ridiculous amount to ask for 2-3 hours of game play.  I DO RECOMMEND this game, as it IS GREAT to play!!!  But do not buy this game unless it is on sale at 33% off OR MORE.

I struggled long and hard whether this game would get a thumbs up or thumbs down and I have to give it thumbs down as it is an abandoned game by its developers and it is criminally over priced for what it offers.  I do recommend buying it ONLY if it is on sale.





I remember years ago when I first purchased Ecco the Dolphin for my Sega CD. The gameplay was simple, move the dolphin from the beginning of the stage to the end of the stage, avoiding or destroying obstacles in your path. But, it wasn't the gameplay that intrigued me the most about the game, it was the ambience - the sheer joy of being able to immerse myself within the superior graphics (of the time) and excellently composed music to create what felt to me the ideal oceanic environment. I still have the soundtrack on MP3, for when I wish to isolate myself within once again.

When I purchased this game, I had high hopes that it would create a new dream of ambience, despite all of the negative reviews that I had perused, the simple gameplay mechanic really wasn't what I desired the most - in fact, it falls extremely short in depth of every other sandbox game that I have ever played. Yet, I was extremely disappointed after playing this game to realize that all of the potential for beauty that was promised was nothing more than an illusion designed simply to entice dreamers like us to waste our money on a poorly crafted attempt to make quick cash.

The music was engaging, until it became repetitive. The graphics were good, until I realized there was no way to interact. The extremely limited availability and flexibility of creation components destroys the sandbox" quality of the game. The overly simplified equipment upgrade mechanics destroy the gameplay. The collision detection is broken. The interlude and story sequences are poorly written. There is absolutely nothing about this game that I can honestly compliment other than the fact that it had wonderful potential if the developers had not given up on it so early

This game is basically Minecraft but underwater. You can harvest resources like seaweed, fertilizer, dirt, sand, coal, iron, copper, gold, silver, crystals (they're just called crystals), and turn them to weapons, equipment, furniture, and buildings.

Here are the differences between Minecraft and FarSky in terms of gameplay, not art:
- Your tools and equipment (including armor) never break (very handy) since you need only three primary tools
- You have three main tools: knife to cut or attack, harpoon (spear) gun, and drill (to harvest and mine all available resources, including sand)
- You don't have to arrange items to create items. You just need to have the minimum resources to create and you can create how ever much you want.
- Oxygen. Your character can only be outside for a limited time before you need to head back to a base to regain oxygen. It doesn't take long to refill.
- Bases. You can't just build a base with sand, floors, walls, etc. You need to make an item that builds a base.
- There is a plot. Which I will explain later.
- Boss battles against a mother******in' KRAKEN. If you harvest their crystal they will attack you and your base until you die. Then they leave you alone.

Here are similarities:
- Hunger, if your hunger is up 100% you will start taking damage.
- Mining resources and using those resources to make tools.
- Pretty music and visuals.
- Predators that attack more frequently at night. Never before had I had such sastifaction of killing a shark (an endangered species IRL). Nor the frustration of being attacked and killed by a shark (and pretty much anything that bites, stings, shocks, touches you even a little bit.
- Open world exploration. You can explore deeper parts of the ocean when you have the advanced equipment to go deeper.

Plot:
You are Nathan, a deep sea explorer of the coast of Austrialia, since everything underwater is out to kill you (including the jellyfish). For some reason, your submarine breaks apart into 9 pieces that scattered across the map. Your task is to get back all those parts and survive. You will have another researcher that will guide you and help you (a little bit). For the most part, you jump into the game with little to no help. Once you collect the 9 parts, you instantly rebuild your submarine and you can take it to the surface where you beat the game.

Once you beat the game, you can play sandbox mode.

What's missing:
- Bed or something to make it speed up time until morning.
- Some kind of radar to detect enemies. You can get attacked at all sides and no idea where they are coming from, how many, then you die.
- More story or tasks. I like that there is something more than surviving. Maybe look for lost treasure or something.
- More creative ability like in Minecraft to build and do whatever you want.

8/10.

It's a decent game - but with the lack of content it shouldn't cost 11 quid

Pros:
-original concept
-very relaxing
-pleasant under water scenery
-easy and solid controls
-crafting guide is straight forward

Cons:
-You'll get bored very quickly after a few hours
-When I say this game lacks content I mean you could literally finish it in under an hour
-limited crafting items
-no multiplayer

Get the game when it's on sale - no where near worth 11 pounds (or $15)

I really liked this game, until I finished it and realized I had done absolutely everything the game had to offer. I would like to recommend it, but it feels unfinished and lacking depth.

I am aware that it's finished as much as it was intended to be, but the game itself makes you want to have more of it when you reach the end. I did enjoy playing it, but I still felt disappointed at the end, because it could have been so much more than this. And I don't want to recommend a game that will probably disappoint you eventually.

I had gotten this game and saw it was a fairly fun game through Slyfoxhound. After a bit though, I had finished and waited for the next update. Only, there was no next update. I had heard there might be more added, but since the devs now claim this is the full game, I feel ripped off. It looked like more was going to be added on with more depths that we can go to, but that never happened. Quite frankly, this is not what invested 15 bucks in and this 'finished game' is definitely not finished. Yes it's a fun game, but when you're expecting more and more updates to come out, to find out that they no longer update it, that's a bit of a  off. There are a lot better games to invest 15 bucks in, Terraria is cheaper and has a way larger amount of content. So rather than give these devs who just dropped the game and said 'it's finished', go give your money to devs who actually still do update their games with new content, even after it's supposedly finished.

It's really sad. This game had so much promise and yet, we get the short end of the stick with a game not even worth it's price tag.

Buy Subnautica

dead game. buy subnautica instead.

just get subnautica. it actaully gets updates

The game was fun...

But then you discover everything there is about it in the first 2 hours.

I waited patiently for updates...

Its been at least one year, maybe two...

Nothing.

This game is calm, inoffensive and free of major bugs. It is also essentially a tech demo.

I cannot recommend it, mostly because there isn't much to it. There's no story to follow, the environment doesn't invite exploration, and the combat is unchallenging (although I appreciate the fact that it can be avoided almost completely). None of these is obligatory - if the game had just one strong feature, it would be enough. Sadly, it has none. The game's mood lasted for about ten minutes.

There is no interesting activity involved in finding resources, mining, or crafting - these systems exist in the game in a bare bones, token form. Base construction is essentially pointless: you may need to expand a bit in order to make room for crops, but that's it. You don't get to build anything pretty or impressive. Exploration is minimal: there are three depth levels"

Well... that was... quick. I liked it, but way too short, and needs more content. I recommend it, but get it on sale, or free if you can.

This game was an amazing experence but it suffers from lack of content. I really wish this game hadnt been abandoned. It is way to short even if it is enjoyable. I hope someone will add more content in the future

This trully was a nice little game to add to my Library. Its underwater enviroments are amazing,its creatures interesting and a serious threat to the Player,Gameplay never gets old.The Story is okay,be its not very large.Guy gets his sub-marine destroyed and now must fix it.Thats it. Sure its $15 Price is a little too much,Its only about 6 hours long,but im sure there will be more feutures in the near future. Either way i cant wait to see what this developer is currently working on for Steam.


7.4/10

Okay so I put many hours into the Alpha and have been playing the Steam version and I absolutely love this game!   Instead of a write up check out my videos where I talk about the great things this game has to offer to include several tutorials-

1st Impressions Alpha- http://youtu.be/Pm8R5Ez27xk
1st Impressions Steam- http://youtu.be/wL-ciTW_ovU
Tutorials- http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT2yWZD0aQDWJQ8lS9bA6LewbOxL64sh3

If you have any questions please feel free to post them.  For the price and everything you get this is a no brainer....alright back to the depths!

Could be better if it were not just a cash grab. Devs put it up on greenlight and then once it was accepted just stopped development. Stear Clear as what little content there is, is all there will be.

Admiring the beautiful fauna of the sea and listening to the relaxing music, FarSky will take you on an immersive journey like no other. While one might compare this game to Minecraft underwater"

A very promising game but with the stopping of updates and a short story it will get boring after awhile but it is fun for a week or two.

I have now played this game through once on Adventurer, and twice on Survivor. Here are my thoughts.

Since FarSky is tagged as survival"

Feels extremely unfinished. Takes about 1 hour, 2 hours at the most to finish everything. This isn't a finished game, this is an alpha version.

-- BEWARE THIS GAME IS CONSIDERED FINISHED THERE WILL BE NO MORE CONTENT UPDATES, YOU GET IT AS IT IS --

Amazing concept, lots of potential and interesting gameplay. (I'm a sucker for survival games)

However I deeply regret buying it for the following reasons:

- SEVERE lack of content, you can beat the game in like 4 hours
- its not Early Access and yet it feels like one
- no difficulty curve
- no support and no communication from the dev (he basically doesn't give a flying f**k about the community and feedbacks)
- there will be no new content added (clearly stated by the developer)
- too high price

I don't recommend buying it unless on a -90% because there's a high chance that you'll be very disappointed. For me it was one of the biggest disappointments of 2014

I only have nearly 17 hours of playtime in this game and I already feel like I've done nearly everything there is to do. This game is infectiously addicting, though a bit lacking. Make no mistake I love this game, though currently it feels like a beta. I thought it was an early access game untill I came back to this page. This game has potential to grow. There's no doubt about that. Deeper depths are always a possiblity, new ores, new building materials, mounted/mountable defences, scarier creatures, new objectives and missions, just to name a few ways this game can grow.

At first, FarSky seems like an excellent, under-water alternative to minecraft. If you enjoy games like that, then you'll definitely find enjoyment in the first few hours of FarSky.

However, after discovering how the game works you realize: that's pretty much it. There's a very limited selection to what you can craft and how you can expand your base. At this point, FarSky feels more like a tech demo with great potential.

if I bought this game, I excepted many hours of fun, but after 5 hours I finished story and discovered all content...just good idea is not enough

I really want to recommend this game. It has a fantastic atmosphere and at times can really make you stress out (in the suspenseful way).

Graphics                 - 6/10 not the best, but far from the worst
Story                       - 2/10 There atually is a story, but it was very basic and uninteresting
depth of gameplay - 3/10 no pun intended, this game is very shallow
sound track             - 7/10 would be 10/10 but it wasn't very present in game
Difficulty                 - 2/10 It really wasnt that difficult or challenging
Overall                    - 4/10 Sub average

The graphics made the game easy to look at and the areas below 250m were beautiful. There are a lot of pretty lights and the creature designs get very creative.

The story is that you crash a submarine and it breaks to pieces and you have to put it back together. That is all there is to it. I may have missed something, but it did not explain who I am, or who the person is guiding me through this survival disaster. There is no putting the submarine together, it just happens. There are bases scattered in various areas with little explanation and it actually defeats the purpose of building your own base, which is a big part of sandbox games. The point of building the sub is not so you can continue whatever mission you had to complete, which would have made the game very interesting, but so you can float to the surface and be rescued. (none of this is a spoiler because the whole story is literally handed to you in the first 5 mins of the game). If you just build a water scooter, you can swim up to the surface but it blocks you with an invisible wall at 30m which just killed the immersion, and explains why building the sub to complete your mission is a much more intersting story prospect.

Depth of gameplay
There jus isnt much to it. I will compare it to minecraft for this one. In minecraft, you make your own story because there is none. You mine resources for armor and weapons because they always break. You build multiple homes in different locations because it is beneficial. This game has none of that. You make an armor piece and you respwn with it when you die. When you die, you don't reload. You just magically reapear in your first base. All your droped loot is marked on the map and stored for easy access when you go back to it. It is really hard to get into this game because it honestly felt like the game was rushing me to beat it.

This game actually had a very good sound track. It was very ambient and soothing. The suspenseful sound track that plays when you attack a certain preditor is okay, but the ambient music more than makes up for it. My only complaint is that it didn't play enough in game. And the game only took about 2 hours to beat and I was taking my time with it, so if it played the same ambient track on a loop, I would not have gotten tired.

This game is not hard at all. I feel like survivor mode (unlocked by beating normal mode) would be kind of hard because there are more preditors, the sub parts arent marked on the map, and you only get one life. I'd try it but honestly, I'd either die and move on, or reach a point and get bored from always having to roam the ocean floor in a grid trying to find these parts, which even though they are engulfed in giant obvious glowing lights, only become visible when you get close.

Overall I can't recommend it for the above reasons as well as two other reasons. One is that it is not worth $14.99 USD and the other is that the dev gave up on it already. Even though people still buy this game, the developer got lazy and the odds of another update, more content, or even just paid DLC are probably zero. I will not be buying another game by this developer, and I will steer anyone away from this game that I can.

This game does not feel like a finished product to me. please read below for why I think so.

This is a pretty good game, however there are quite a few flaws that become evident late into the game as well as after the story mode.
I would still maybe recomend this came to some friends, but not without going through the issues with them.

-I completed the game in both adventure mode and the more challenging survivor" mode without dying once

Not bad for what it is.

I saw it on sale so I figured, Why not?"

Took me about 3.5 hours to beat the adventure mode. Never died.

It's good for someone's first shot at making a large game.

It's also good for a beginner's survival game.

I went in not expecting much for the $2 and some change price tag. I was thoroughly impressed. While it's not the deepest survival game I've ever played

Very fun game great environment and atmosphere but lacks content i do recommend the game but it does need alot more work

I used to play this game in both the Alpha & Beta stages. It had much potentional; howbeit when the game was Greenlit, everything had been rushed and from what I believed to be.... incompleted. Through out the time things were being added & taken away. Many of the things taken away were very valuable pieces that would've brought this game to life. The bosses, the oil resource, the leveling up, & etc were taken out. I hope Tim Speckler the developer would complete this game just as it rightfully deserves to be completed. As for comparing to Subnautica, well Subnautica had a whole crew whereas Farysky was a one man army deal, plus Farsky came out before Subnautica. Well, that's my two cents.

As others have said, this game is not finnished. You are led to belive that there are deeper levels of the ocean but the equipment you have dose not allow you to. multiplayer or more content would complete this game. It is unique however in my experience and would recomend if it went on sale.

It's horrifying to think that although humans rule the earth, we are totally outclassed in the sea. This is the pivot that FarSky works on. You are a survivor of a submarine crash and need to survive long enough to retrieve the pieces of your craft and make it to safety.

You learn to watch your oxygen. Your hunger. Your injuries. Depth. Daylight. Materials. Predators. There's a tight little game here.

Unfortunately the experience is a little shallow. Building your base is fun, but beyond the crafting tables and a small crop of vegetables, there's not a lot to do. Exploration is mandatory and soon enough you get into the gameplay loop of guessing when it's dawn, scooting out to find a little more resources, or travel a little further down. The world is procedurally generated, so that's both fun and frustrating in equal measures.

It's probably a nice game to play for a weekend. Music is nice and the graphics are at times stunning despite their simplicity. With a little more gameplay or variety, this could be quite a refreshing alternative to Minecraft, but lacks the complexity and creativity.

I picked this game up on sale for 3 euros, for that price, its worth it.

NOTHING MORE THOUGH.

Honestly, the developers claimed its out of early acces and now a full game.

While it is a 'underwater survival/crafting game' it lacks a ton of content and even the slightest of logic (though it be game logic).

There is gravity in this game, if you go up in the water,  you fall down.

Story mode is basically the easiest form of gameplay ever. 'collect the 9 pieces and escape'
So yeah, i did that in under 2 hours. i had a underwater scooter to aid my find with the last 5 and dicked around for a bit here and there. i could have had it done sooner i think. Anyway, you're at -100 below sea level and you cant go further than -350, even with a submarine. with the scooter you cant go higher than -35, and then fall down (yes, falling in water...).

The crafting has about 10 things per category you can build, its straight forward, and not much sadly.

Expect about 3 hours of actual gameplay in this. It lacks creativity and replayability with it.

For 3 euros, buy it, but not the full price. Go with subnautica.

After beating adventure and survivor mode and explored every where and even started going to max depths to see what else try not dieing and trying to kill as many krakens I can, but it dose get boring pretty quickly. I hope maybe someday the dev may release source code or allow moding. As far starting out it is a great game with a ton of potential, and its pretty good for a rainy day. It is worth giving this game a try.

This game could be summed up like this: Minecraft in the ocean. But there's so much more to do than that. Build your own underwater bases, craft a submarine, fight octopus, sharks and barracudas, or just grow potatoes and carrots.

The highlights include eating raw jellyfish to recover health and crafting bandages out of seaweed. You can't make this kind of thing up.

Full video review:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhhyRoctPJU

A shallow good time.

The game is quite fun and immersive, but only for a brief time.  There are essentially 3 tiers of crafting / toys, each of which consists of a small packet of upgrades of the same gear.  There's a small handful of fun toys outside of those, but not enough.   There's just not enough to experience in every angle.... crafting, exploration (3 biomes with just enough in them to pass as a game).

I generally don't recommend this.  But I DO RECOMMEND this game if you:
1) You haven't done much in the way of crafting / survival gaming, and want something non-overwhelming.  Just know there are better games for it once you are more comfortable.  Though it's not necessary to start with something like this either.
2) You are a survival game junkie, and are completely good with something you can just play for a little, but you won't get sucked into playing past it's welcome (about 70% of my time was past it's welcome" time because I had so much fun in the first 30%.  I felt a sort of "wasted time" feeling with that last 70%

The devloper quit on this game its not worth a buy because it is SHALLOW. haha get it? no but really dont get it. Just get subnautica :)

Came back looking for more hoping to see an update found nothing now i feel a little ripped off which is sad because this had so much potential. There just isnt enough in the game to make it worth the asking price.

Like most other reviews out there point out... It definitely feels like an unfinished game. But that's not to say the game in it's so called finished" state isn't fun or worth buying. I bought this game knowing exactly what to expect which is why I'm not all that disapointed in the game.

The game does lack a lot of content in many ways. The story is dumb and barely existing

After reading reviews and a note from the developer saying This game is about 10 hours long"

FarSky" is one of my new favorite survival games.  It's not as in-depth as some other survival games on the market

I bought FarSky on a whim. I had some extra cash to spare and the concept of the game looked compelling enough for me. Since I've finished the initial campaign mission"/"adventure mode". I think I'm qualified to review the game.

GRAPHICS (9/10):

I was hooked by the graphics in FarSky. I'm serious

Far Sky has a really nice atmosphere, neat graphics and is fun to play.
For some hours.
The game is definitely not finished and you can feel that.

The story" is pretty short

I bought this game years ago, and ever since then nothing new has been added. Subnautica is a lot better, just get that. The devs dropped this game pretty much. Really wish I could refund to get my $10 back that I spent so long ago.
