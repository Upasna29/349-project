This is not a spin-off or as some say "just a remake of Hitman 1". This is a sequel, this is Hitman 3. It comes after Hitman 2. This is not a remake. Only a few missions are remade from Codename 47, and they are so different that it doesn't matter. The rest of the missions in Hitman: Contracts are original and deserve to be played.\n\nPossibly the darkest and grittiest of the Hitman series. The story follows Agent 47 as he is discovered and shot right after an assignment. Seriously wounded, he staggers into a building and is treated by an old man. The whole game is a series of flashbacks of missions he has had in the past: some never played before, and some we have. Each mission follows a cutscene of 47's present condition. The police finally locate him and surround the building. The end finale is an homage to the finale in Léon: The Professional, and it is incredible.\n\nSome of my favorite missions in the entire Hitman franchise are right here in this game. The Bjarkhov Bomb, The Meat King's Party, Rendezvous in Rotterdam, Beldingford Manor, and Hunter and Hunted are all great missions and they can only be found in this game.\n\nTo say that this game is weak or nothing more than a remake of Codename 47 is absurd. I'm here to tell you that this is very much a worthy sequel and a great game that you would be thankful to play.","January 24, 2014","true","238.1"," 237 of 240 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","237","240","0","10"

The missions are HUGE and challenging, particularly on Professional difficulty.  It's a worthy entry in the franchise, despite the fact it "re-imagines" some of the original "Hitman: Codename 47" levels.  I highly recommend this one.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nThere's a problem when it's first installed that people have noted on the forum where the game will not save, however.  This problem does happen, but it's easily fixed.  Just go into the "Hitman Contracts" folder after it's installed and create a new empty folder called "Save"   For whatever reason, the Steam installer will not create it automatically, and you'll be very sad when your unlocked weapons and progress go away when you exit the game.","September 26, 2014","true","23.8"," 60 of 61 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","60","61","2","0"

Hitman 2 was an epic story that kind of spanned all over the world. This one, although there are different locations, it's not one big epic story. It's a lot of darker, psychological small stories mixed together, so the score follows the darker aspect of Hitman and his career."\n\nDue to a licensing issue, Contracts wasn’t available through steam until last year (whilst all others were released) but it’s nice to now be able to add this to my collection.\n\nFinally, I get to see the Meat King once more!

I picked up Contracts on Steam during the summersale for a ridiculously cheap price and decided to revisit the game. It felt nostalgic to play it again, especially the first 3 missions.\n\nThe PC version suffers from a lot of problems on modern computers. If I stood inside a building, close to an exit I could see the snow coming through the house. When you go into steam overlay and back to the game again you get two mouse cursors which is a bit annoying. Hitman looks very outdated BUT there's HD mods online and probably other useful things you should look up before playing the game. However, if you are like me and want to experience the game just as it was before (without mods) you will run into some wierd glitches and graphical problems. It is a problem possible to overlook though.\n\nContracts have 12 missons. The maps are huge and on every mission theres a bunch of disguises, weapons and methods you can try out. It's like a sandbox where you run around and try out different things. After every mission you get a rank based on how well you did. I like that you can choose to shot everyone or be a silent assasin. Sometimes the movement is a bit clunky. For example there is no cover system and no good way of sneaking around doors, which can screw you over a few times. Other then that the controls for PC is okay.\n\nIf you can look past the graphical problems, if you're running the game on an old machine or if you have found a good HD mod for it, then I wouldn't hesitate. Especially if you are a fan of the other Hitman games or you're just curious to see how to golden age of stealth games looked like.

I enjoy all of the games in this wonderful series, but there is something special about this game in particular. I cannot put my finger on whether or not it is due simply to the spectacular level design, or due to the fact that it does not hold the players hand, among many other possible reasons. Perhaps it is a mix of all these great aspects that makes Contracts rise above the other games in the series.\n\nThis game may not be the most technically polished, it doesn't look the greatest, or have the absolute greatest controls, but it has an undeniable charm that the other games lack. If you play Blood Money, you will notice that the graphics and character models etc are all much, much nicer and more realistic looking, but I find this to be a much, much better game. The missions in this game are exceptionally interesting, each with a unique location, always multiple, unique ways to complete your objectives as well. The levels are large, and interesting with many paths to take. For a game from 2004, the action is fantastic. Lot's of blood splatter when taking out enemies and it feels fun as hell doing so. Nothing more fun than popping an enemy in the back of the head with a silenced pistol and dragging his corpse into the shadows. It's an exhilarating feeling playing this game and I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys videogames, period.\n\nSummary:\n\nPros\n\n- Great level design\n\n- Decent graphics for the time, especially on pc, maxed out at 60 + fps.\n\n- Good ragdoll physics for the time. (It's no Half Life 2, and the ragdoll is a little much, but it's fun.)\n\n- Multiple ways to complete your missions, ensuring replayability\n\n- Good story\n\n- Doesn't hold your hand.\n\nCons\n\n- Graphics are a little dated if you have high standards\n\n- Could have used some more unlockable stuff\n\n- The A.I can be a little unbelievable at times","October 1, 2015","true","18.7"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","36","39","2","0"

Unlike the other Hitman games in the series, it has a much darker and grittier tone as shown by the constant rain, night time assignments and a greater emphasis on brutality.\n\nThe story in Hitman: Contracts revolves around a wounded Agent 47 who eventually collapses out of shock in his apartment and begins having hallucinatory flashbacks from his earlier missions. These flashbacks act as a way to fill in the gaps in the story after the first game’s, Hitman: Codename 47, aftermath. As a result, it may lack a cohesive narrative from start to finish since some of those flashbacks are jumbled around in time (some are even chronologically in reverse order), ultimately making Hitman: Contracts one of the weakest narratives in the series. But on the other hand, it is to be reminded that Hitman was never lauded for any complex story, or the lack of, so to speak.  By the end of the game, and to no one’s surprise, Agent 47 recovers from his wounds and sets up the scene for the events in Hitman: Blood Money.\n\nGameplay-wise, it plays exactly just like the previous games – patrol, analyse your environment, sneak in, change outfits, set up your traps, hide corpses, assassinate your targets and escape – but with much tighter and more refined mechanics. For instance, the game’s ability to switch to first-person was visibly improved as 47’s movements feel more natural. Whilst this feature tends to be used (almost) exclusively for taking down your enemies with your weapon of choice, its improvements are welcomed in this game as killing enemies in this perspective has never been more fun than this, and frankly, it even plays rather well. However, Hitman: Contracts is the type of game where playing it on the hardest difficulty is a requirement as otherwise it would not be a true Hitman experience. The lower difficulties are (subjectively) far too easy and forgiving. Not only that, but the simple fact that the game allows you to go all gun blazing, if you are willing to, drastically diminishes the concept of being a “hitman”. Bluntly killing someone wide open is almost like failing the mission in my eyes. Thankfully, playing it on Professional difficulty reduces the chances of turning on spazy Rambo mode.\n\nThe level design in this game is definitely one of its strongest aspects. The maps are fairly sandbox-y and varied with plenty of routes and secret paths to discover. Despite a smaller number of maps (only 12 maps) than in Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, it can easily be forgiven as it features some of the best and most memorable levels from the Hitman franchise: “The Meat King’s Party”, “Beldingford Manor” and “Traditions of a Trade” to name a few.\n\nAesthetically, Hitman: Contracts almost has its own sort of personality. As mentioned earlier, it noticeably feels a lot darker and even more atmospherically depressing than other Hitman games. Although visually it is without a shadow of a doubt a vast improvement over the previous two games, frankly even in gameplay, the graphics do show their age in places as more than a decade has passed since its original release. Whilst it looks better than other games from 2004, it surely was not amid the best looking from its period. A small observation: one thing which I personally liked in Hitman: Contracts is the way splattered blood appears on top of darker surfaces with its mirrory effect; a sign of how much gruesome this game can get.\n\nA Hitman game cannot be a Hitman without Jesper Kyd as composer, and this time around he succeeded once again in creating yet another thrilling, memorable and easily recognisable soundtrack for this game. There is a reason why Hitman fans regard him as the one true composer suitable for this franchise.\n\nHitman: Contracts is not without its flaws, one being the aforementioned weak narrative. But the game’s biggest flaw though, and the most recurring one, is the enemy AI. The best way to describe it is by calling it schizophrenic. It has its fair share of well scripted moments that immerse you in the experience, but sadly there are far too many encounters when enemies do implausible things which overshadow these moments. Accidently bumping into someone would totally ruin your cover as they immediately assume you are the hitman, as if the person would not have recognised you by now just simply standing a few feet away from you – at least realistically. For some unknown reason, all enemies also seem to be strangely telepathic at times, managing to unrealistically communicate with their mates from all away across the map. I like how they can work in groups when they are alerted or looking for you, but sometimes they can be utterly stupid. Another thing which it is never explained throughout the entire game is how enemies know that a bald guy must have killed the person lying on the floor when no one was even near the scene of the crime when it was committed. Things like these, whether small or big, can easily ruin the immersion and increase your frustration.\n\nLastly, the option of selecting your equipment during a briefing screen before each mission was removed in this game and I believe this was a huge mistake by the developers as it eliminates the sense of a tactical preparation beforehand.\n\nIn conclusion, Hitman: Contracts is far from the perfect Hitman game as it is only a mere, yet effective, refinement of the formula established by the earlier games. But thanks to its own distinct dark tone backed up by some great level designs, an atmospheric soundtrack and tighter mechanics, it is a worthy entry and easily amongst the most satisfying experiences this franchise can offer. Too bad that its AI - one of the most crucial aspects for this type of game - can let it down at times. If you are looking for complete realism in your playthrough or a compelling story that sucks you in, Hitman: Contracts is perhaps not the one which can consistently deliver. It does, however, provide enough hours of fun with solid gameplay finding exciting ways to assassinate your targets at your own pace in its grim atmospshere. So if that is enough incentive for you, then Hitman: Contracts is a great starting point to get into this stealth series if the earlier games look too clunky and rough around the edges.","November 7, 2015","true","5.9"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","30","34","3","0"

Six of the twelve missions in Contracts are remastered versions of missions in Codename 47. Do not be discouraged by this fact, though. Hitman: Contracts will provide you with a unique, rich and thrilling experience. It is my personal favorite of the whole franchise.\n\nThe game takes place between two missions in Hitman: Blood Money (The sequel to Contracts). It's a bit tricky to understand and timelines have always been a bit obscure in the Hitman franchise. After getting shot by a corrupt chief of police, 47 escapes to a nearby motel where he goes into shock and experiences several flashbacks. You will wake up, eventually, to a\n\nHitman: Contracts is without a doubt the darkest and most atmospheric Hitman game to date. In terms of atmosphere and tension, Contracts hands down outshines Hitman: Absolution. The dark, rainy nights, during which many missions take place are intensified by the masterful soundtrack by Jesper Kyd (Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, Borderlands 2), which is the best soundtrack he's made in my opinion. Missions are not that easy without sneak-peeking at walkthroughs, and the mission "The Meat King's Party" is awesome, dark and to some audiences a bit disturbing as well.\n\nContracts is a great game. The missions are expansive and interesting. Unlike Blood Money, where a bald guy in a suit only really raised suspicion when entering someone's bedroom with a gun in hand, Contracts always keeps you on your toes. Looking at your tension meter basically makes the game a thriller, especially when being frisk searched. The tension in Contracts, at least in my opinion, is spot on. The tension in Hitman: Silent Assassin was far too unpredictable and in Blood Money it was more predictable than Sheridan phoning Hyacinth Bucket. Disguises are plentiful and there is a wide range of them to help you get to your targets.\n\nHitman: Contracts is thrilling and atmospheric with great replay value, an amazing soundtrack and interesting characters. My favorite moments from the game include..\n1. Poisoning an English aristocrat by disguising myself as his butler\n2. Exploring a hotel in Budapest disguised as a bell boy\n3. Attempting to combat a triad leader and his bodyguard head on\n\n\nAll in all, considering the low price and the amount of awesome content you are getting, I really recommend giving it a try. The graphics are a bit outdated, but it's a 2004 game, after all. Also, a common mistake when playing a Hitman game (especially the first 3) is to look at walkthroughs on YouTube and whatnot. It's very rewarding to aim for the Silent Assassin (perfect) rating on a mission before checking out walkthroughs during your first time.

You get very few "sophisticated" tools as well, and you're left to mostly come up with your own creative lures. You can, however, shoot out lights for distractions and cover.\n\nBut essentially?

The story of the game picks up immediately after the ending of codename 47 and the majority of the story are flash backs of Agent 47's missions in the past. These flash backs include some revamped missions from codename 47. So if you ever wanted to play missions from code name 47 with updated controls, AI and graphics, this game should satisfy you. Hitman Contracts has a much better AI system then Hitman 2. I found myself able to run in this game and not be shot at randomly. Note that the AI could act unfair sometimes but not as often as Hitman 2. Also the sneak/crouch is much improved. I feel that Hitman contracts has some of the best missions in the franchise. Two missions that I consider that have the most replay value in the franchise is the Meat kings part and Hunter and the Hunted. If you were to pick up any Hitman game I would recommend Contracts or Blood money. Both games have strengths and weaknesses over another. I give Hitman Contacts a 9/10. I am very pleased that the game has made its way to steam.","January 24, 2014","true","18.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

On that score nothing has really changed drastically since the last game but I felt like the mechanics have been tightened up a little more. Think of the series as a fruit ripening to perfection. Hitman: Codename 47 was the green bud and every game since has been another step towards the harvest-worthy banana, Blood Money. (And maybe Absolution is the banana becoming just a tad over-ripe.)\n\nSpeaking of Blood Money, the events of this game take place in between two missions from that game. All but the last mission of this game are told as flashbacks, thus giving the developers a framework to be remaking old missions in. The story opens with 47 stumbling into a motel after having been shot. We later see the events leading up to this incident in Blood Money. It all dovetails nicely.\n\nAlso, the Chinese voice acting for the triad members in this game is shockingly good. Whoever they hired to provide the voices for those guys speaks proficient Cantonese, I was absolutely stunned to hear it.","July 11, 2015","true","13.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itswar11/recommended/247430/","itswar11","itswar11 ジ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itswar11/","660 products in account","Hitman: Contracts is a game from 2004 and has only just came onto steam after having licensing issues from a band called "Clutch" because of a music track in the game known as "Immortal".\n\nHitman: Contracts is the 3rd game in the Hitman Franchise and you play as series protagonist; Agent 47. After getting wounded from one of his assignments and collapsing in his apartment room, 47 begins to have flashbacks on previous assasinations he has done. The first mission is what happened directly after the events of Codename 47 and has you escaping from Dr Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer's Asylum, where other patients and clones of 47 are located.\n\nWhile the story isn't something to write home about and even felt a bit underwhelming, it still has a few well made cutscenes and even has a nice twist at the end.\n\nHitman: Contracts is definatly the darkest Hitman to date, the mentioned well made cutscenes are very grim and the introduction and first level are very disturbing.\n\nMany of the game's levels are based on levels from the first Hitman game: Codename 47 although have been improved and tweaked heavily to create a fresh new experience as well as less frustration. Aside from the first level, every level has atleast one target to kill using a varity of tools and strategies, sometimes you'll have secondary objectives such as finding blackmail photos or something similar. Once you've completed all the necessary objectives, it's time to get out of there using an exit.\n\nThe game's stealth controls are well done, such as the stealth kills and sneaking. However the shooting mechanics are a bit underwealming and definatly makes the run-and-gun approach more boring and harder due to the awkward shooting controls, I dare say Hitman 2 had better shooting. Speaking of shooting, there are a varity of guns at your desposal, such as SPAS 12 shotguns, AK74s, MP5s and so on, each well detailed and has a nice reload animation.\n\nWhen you kill somebody or happen to find a disguise in a level, you can wear the disguise and blend in as the enemy, being able to go inside restricted areas and carry rifles in case things get messy. However if you move too close to NPC you're disguised as, there is a small chance they will realize you don't belong there and will begin opening fire. Think of it as like Absolution's disguise system except without a blending mechanic. However the disguise system isn't perfect, I still felt restricted in exploring many environments with the right disguise with the large chance of being spotted easily and made the game needlessly more difficult.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty, many times I was spotted, I never knew why even with a disguise on, I didn't know if I was actually in a restricted area, was doing something wrong, carrying the wrong weapon, which made me extremely frustrated and again made it needlessly difficult.\n\nAfter completing the game's 12 levels, you can go back and try and earn the "Silent Assassin" rank, which will net you a new weapon for each level completed with the rank, which definatly increases the replayability if you want a lot out of the game.\n\nGraphically, the game for 2004 was very detailed and was overall beatiful and by today's standards, they definatly look dated but still looked very nice in many areas such as the animations. There are a varity of locations ranging from Manors, Russian snow areas, a Chinese city, Paris and so on and so fourth.\n\nSound wise it's great, most of the guns sound great, the voice acting is well done, and environment sounds are fantastic. Of course I have to mention the music composed by Jesper Kyd, and holy ♥♥♥♥ does he do a great job at the music. The music is very dark and fitting for Contracts as again it's the darkest game in the series, playing lots of foreboating music pieces and creepy tunes and possibly has one of my favourite main themes.\n\nOverall, Hitman: Contracts is a worthy entry in the Hitman Franchise, the game is very difficult, but also rewarding especially if you manage to get the highest stealth rank; Silent Assassin. If you haven't played Hitman: Contracts before or haven't played it in a very long time, I definatly reccommend picking it up.\n\nHitman: Contracts is a dark, disturbing game, and that's why I love it.\n\n8/10","January 24, 2014","true","15.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

When I saw this on sale for 99p, it was a must buy.\n\nApparently the levels in this game are a bunch of remakes of the missions from the first hitman game. (Hitman: Codename 47) Having never played that game though, I can't say how much they compare. Some fans of the series might see this as a cheap way of cashing in on a "new game", therefore being disapointed with Contracts. With this being my first Hitman game back in the day though, I was drawn in.\n\nOne of the first things you'll notice is the games dark, tense atmosphere, created through an excellent use of visuals and soundtrack. The lighting and shadow effects help to create a real intensity. Adding to that is the moody soundtrack which is right up there with one of the best featured in a game. (Credit to Jesper Kyd)\n\nThe gameplay/controls also feel really solid and familiar with the previous release. (Hitman 2: Silent Assasin) So if you've played that, the learning curve is easy to pick up quickly.\nSneaking around can be tricky but feels much more satisfying than just running and gunning. It's definitely recomended to play this game through stealth. The results are more rewarding and the game plays out much better if you choose this route. However, choosing the less subtle "mass murderer" kind of playthrough has a certain satisfying edge that you won't find playing more cautiously.\nWhat makes the player coming back for more however is its lasting appeal and replayability. The ability to perform levels in different ways (stealth, action, multiple ways to assasinate targets etc.) is what makes this so.\n\nOverall, a must buy for all Hitman fans. Plays and feels much like Hitman 2 but improves through its unique style and presentation. There are less levels in this game compared to its predecessor however, which may disapoint some fans.\nThe style of the game doesn't seem to have aged with time either. Only obvious difference being the games 2004 generation graphics. (which is forgivable)\n\nGameplay: 8\nGraphics: 8\nSound: 9.5\nValue: 9","February 7, 2015","true","9.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

(✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FigureofOptimism/","336 products in account","I remember my earliest childhood memories. My brother, sister and myself would huddle around our SNES, wrestling for the controller. What game were we playing you ask? None other than the original, the first hitman game : Hitman Silent Assassin. When I first heard that they were making a sequel, I was excited. But does it live up to the hype? Read on and find out.\n\nRun, jump, survive. Those are the basics of the new installment in the Hitman series, Contracts. In Contracts, you once again step into the shoes of the egg-headed killer/family man/cook Agent 3.14. Much has changed from the last installment, yet the key components remain the same. The game takes place after the events of  the previous game, the now retired Agent 3.14 lives in the humid yet calm region of Africa unaware of the seedy criminal underbelly lurking right under his nose. His son, Alexander IV gets kidnapped in an emotional yet beautifully shot opening sequence. Agent 3.14 is forced to call on his long lost brother, Agent 47. And so Agent 3.14 is forced out of retirement and together with 47, the two embark on an emotional journey that will take you from Africa to anywhere you can imagine.\n\nThe game's core mechanics are refined, Agent 3.14 can now do many more moves. To execute these moves you typically need to hold the A button while typing in a combination with the gamepad. It's very seamless. The family managing element is still here, though with some slight changes. Instead of paying for Alexander IV's cancer treatment, 3.14 has to pay for 47's bathroom addiction. Each month he has to renovate the bathroom or else 47 snaps and murders his family. It adds quite a dynamic to both characters. A major change is the addition of multiplayer. As there are two agents, you can invite one of your friends to embark on your adventures with you. Honestly, if it weren't for this feature I wouldn't be recommending this game, as it is more of the same however more refined.\n\nAs a closing note, I should mention that the soundtrack is mindblowing.

I orignally played this way back when it came out on the PS2. This game, in my honest opinion, is the best in the franchise. While it does not feature the custimaztion and notoriety system of Blood Money the games overall tone is the best of any Hitman game bar none. As you'd it imagine it's standard fair with a very open ended approach to completing objectives but what makes this game the best in the series is the atmosphere. To start things off you must flee a blood spattered insane asylum swarming with SWAT and unstable mental paitients, then it's off to BDSM party in a meat packing plant to locate a missing girl and murder her captors. The tone remains consistent throughout, you feel like you're taking out the scum of the Earth in this one more than any other Hitman thus far. This is how Hitman should be, dark, deep, and challenging. Now that it's here on Steam in proper resolutions with all the trimmings you'd expect from a PC game there's no excuse not to pick it up.","January 24, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It used to be my least favorite Hitman game, but now that I really got into it, it's probably my favorite.\n\nThe game is pretty much all flashbacks to 47's missions in the past, there are some new ones, but about half of them are great remakes of Codename 47's missions.\n\n\nPro's:\n\n+ Great, dark atmosphere\n+ Amazing soundtrack, it doesn't have many tracks though, you will hear some in multiple levels\n+ Great stealth game\n+ Awesome Codename 47 mission remakes\n+ Challenging.

The biggest thing to note with Hitman Contracts is the very different tone that this game brings from other games in the series it comes across as alot darker and really gets into the sinister side of the criminal underworld and the life of a Hitman like Agent 47.\n\nIn my opinion the greatest thing about Contracts is the amazing atmosphere this game achieves the setting is very gritty and in many ways the game comes across as almost moody but in a really good way because it allows you to immerse yourself in its storyline and keeps you on edge as you work your way through the game personally this kind of gaming experience is one of my favourites and this game does a fantastic job of doing this from start to finish.\n\nThe game achieves this by using some pretty basic things like flashbacks setting the missions at night and with lots of rain to give of a very dark atmosphere combine this with the once again outstanding soundtrack by composer Jesper Kyd gives you a winning formula from the start the soundtrack is quite different from the Orchestrals of Hitman 2 and instead comes at you with a very dark style of Electronic music that keeps you on your edge of your seat full of suspense as you go about the game with many tracks be darn right aerie and others being incredibly thrilling and excting.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it feels very similar to Hitman 2 but i am pleased to say that the AI isnt nearly as twitchy and hard to anticipate as in Hitman 2 which makes the gameplay smoother and makes more sense. While this game does not have as many missions as in Hitman 2 it does an incredible job of providing you with a massive amount of non linear style gameplay through the various missions alot of the maps are very large and you have so many ways to go about performing your hits and it can take a very long time trying to work out the best methods. So although the game isnt as long as Hitman 2 you still have plenty of replayability and things to explore in this game this game also has some of the most memorable missions in the Hitman series.\n\nTo sum up for this game i consider it to be everybit as good as Silent Assassin was which is impressive in itself given how its quite often hard to follow up a good game with a sequel that is as equally good the only real weakness i can say is that i wish it had as many missions as Hitman 2 but the missions it does have are fantastic and that really isnt a fatal flaw i just wanted to play more for longer. All in all my score for this game is the same as Hitman 2 a solid 7.5/10 and highly recommend it for the price a superb game indeed.","January 18","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I finished the game twice with full Silent Assassin which was very Satisfying. The Game on High Graphics Settings looks Fantastic for 2004.\n\nThe Atmosphere and settings are great. But one thing that wasnt so great was the Length of the Game. 12 Missions not including Turtorial, which is down from Silent assassin which had over 23 Missions. I would still recommend this game to any Hitman Fan who played the Original 2. I Give it a 7/10.

It's almost as good as Blood Money. The levels are a bit easier to get 'Silent Assassin' ratings with than other Hitman games, partly because missions are relatively more simple and there aren't quite as many ways to kill your targets in this game as Blood Money. There's still a variety of ways to complete each mission, and achieving 'Silent Assassin' is super satisfying. Contracts is also interesting because many of the levels are remakes of levels from the original Hitman game (which game I find near unplayable due to the controls).

After completing the game you can then use a level select to choose which level you want to play, and what you bring with you in it.\n\nHowever, if you want your "Highest Ranking" on the level select menu to change, you have to complete that level again AND the rest of the story so that it will create another Level Select "save" after the credits. At least, this is what my experience has been.\n\nThese peeves are small in my opinion, Contracts is a staple for any Hitman fan.","February 25, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Rather than being a sunny, bright, and world travelling game like Silent Assassin was, Contracts is a lonely, creepy, and almost claustrophobic experience. It perfectly suits the series in which you play a contract killer.\nAlmost every level is dark or rainy, with a slightly blurry filter for a hazey atmosphere.\n\nIt may not be the most replayable or the biggest game in the series, but as an experience, this game is by far my favourite.\n\nThe soundtrack is just perfect. Dark and creepy ambience in the most relaxing way, mixed with elements of breakbeat and operatic elements. Jespyr Kyd is a genius.","March 10","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It really captures the idea that these are flashbacks and we are playing through 47's nightmares as he is wounded in the present. The present missions are also really great, the last one is a blast to play through. The heavier theme of the game expands the plot and adds a little nice clliffhanger at the end that sets the events in Blood Money.\n\nIt maintains the quality of its predecessor while adding small improvements. It's a bit more fluid in regards to assassinations thanks to better AI and situational hints. The game emphasises its replayability factor with even more ways to complete your missions than the last game as well as rewarding players who achieve the Silent Assassin rank (non lethal approach, no alerts) with cool weapons for even more fun. All the missions are an absolute pleasure to play.\n\nAll and all, I am very glad this franchise is maintaining its quality. And I recommend Contracts if you want to get into Hitman.\n","September 8, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game takes place as a series of flashbacks 47 sees as he lies dying. During these flashbacks, players experience a wide range of action and stealth missions as they shoot their way across the world. The flashback missions 47 sees during his injury-induced visions include some of the missions from the original game and some new missions, although the original missions have all been upgraded and expanded, so returning players won't feel like they're repeating previous games. Missions include eliminating a pair of brother assassins, disrupting a Russian arms deal, and escaping an asylum as he moves across the globe. Characters tend to speak in their native languages, as well, adding to the international flavor. 47 has many different abilities and weapons available. He can move stealthily, steal clothing to disguise himself, and use a number of poisons in addition to guns to take out his enemies. In many places, players have the option of accomplishing a mission using stealth or attacking enemies head-on, depending on their playing style. There are three difficulty modes, as well, so novice and experienced players can both enjoy the game. Shooter fans will find HITMAN: CONTRACTS a fun, entertaining game with a distinct noir style to it. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, either, as 47 relives many of his most exciting and dangerous missions.","October 9, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I haven't found the solution and I've googled it, checked the manual, and the developers site has absolutely NO information on it. This is getting truly frustrating. Yet, from what I've played and seen the game looks amazing. I just suggest checking your computer to make sure it will run properly. If you know the answer to this problem please contact me.","February 1, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This is just kinda lazy in my opinion.\n\n- Short (5-6 hours with Pro/SA on most levels)\n\n- While the A.I. is much better than in Silent Assasin, the enimies are still quite unpredictable and can occasionally bug out and just start shooting you.\n\n- Weakest story in the Hitman series (47 gets shot, collapses in his hotel room and starts remembering previous missions, that's it)\n\n\nContracts is the best game in the series after Blood Money, and it really just feels like a stripped back version of that game. Though it's must play for fans of blood money and the hitman franchise.\n\nPersonally, I would say that the Hitman games are like this:\n\nBlood Money>Contracts>Absolution>Silent Assassin>Codename: 47","March 21, 2015","true","26.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Never again is now my motto as I come to accept my tastes in gaming have changed.\n\nI could not even bring myself to finish the first level of this game, the one where you are in a sanitarium. It was fun at first, venuring through the halls, looking down fondly at the cold, dead eyes of all the clones, listening to the squelch of blood as Agent 47 walked though puddles of blood and entrails. But it all felt too easy.\n\nGo here, pick this up. Go there, put this on. Don't run, you'll look suspicious! Are you forgetting that half the patients are running anyway? Let us be realistic, people! There are S.W.A.T teams with guns pointed at you! Half the patients are going to run around shrieking their lungs out, why the hell should one single one draw attention?\n\nI am so unhappy with this game that I am not going to bother finishing this review. I have more important things to do than review a game which I do not like. I will not say do not buy it, some people who are new to the world of gaming might.

If you played Blood Money and felt it was a little confusing (I don't blame you, there is quite a lot of stuff that's possible), then I recommend Absolution. Absolution is a bit more linear will hold your hand a bit so that it's clear what you can do (there's no shame in liking that sort of game).\n\nJust a quick heads up for anyone going to Contracts to Blood Money:\nContracts was made earlier in the series, so some elements from Blood Money (like hiding bodies in bins/closets and upgrading equipment/customising weapons) aren't in Contracts.\n\nBut if you don't have ANY games in the Hitman series, I would still recommend Blood Money above all the other ones.\n\nDang. that could have been quicker. TL;DR time!\nI would still recommend Hitman: Blood Money over Hitman: Contracts, but Hitman: Contracts is still pretty good.\n\nOh crap, one last thing.\nHitman: Contracts doesn't always install perfectly the first time. Make sure to validate the game files after installing it. If it says nothing is wrong, but the game is still having noticable problems (most notably not having the option to open doors), you're gonna have to uninstall the game, and then reinstall it.\n\nOkay, I'm gonna go aimlessly stare at the Steam store now.

The game plays like many hitman games, where stealth is encourraged over the run and gun aprroach. HOWEVER, on normal difficulty this game just doesn't care. You can complete an entire level with a simple tactics found in many third person shooters and only get scolded when the game calls you a 'mass muderer' which confuses me as this is the 3rd game in the franchise to which 47 kind of is a repeat offender when it comes to first degree pre-determined homicide BUT WHO AM I TO JUDGE?!

The traditional hitman structure is a positive quality but the flaws tend to stick out.\n\nThe A.I is borderline broken. At times the A.I. doesn't notice things that it should and at other times, it notices things that it shouldn't. I'll let this pass since this is an old title.\n\nAside from that setback, the story doesn't add much to the game's value. The story is...well...Horrid. I shouldn't explain myself for this one. You should find out yourself.\n\nLastly, the biggest issue I have is how short the game is. I could beat this within an hour or less.\n\n\n\nOverall, I STILL think this is a good game. It doesn't greatly deviate from the Hitman structure which gives it playability.

But behold, Contracts finally made its way onto steam and right into my library the instant I heard of it's arrival. and OH MY GAWD is it amazing.\n\nIn my opinion atleast, everything in this game just...works. The shooting, the sneaking, the missions, just everything seems to work. This game does share a bunch of positive similarities from Silent Assassin as you gain weapons for completeing missions on Silent Assassin rather than a lousy score bonus or an achievement. Also...the soundtrack in this is probably the best in any Hitman game. It's dark, and completely fits the whole tone that Hitman gives to players.\n\nLASTLY: I do see that most of the missions in this game are just redone from Agent 47...but they're redone so well to a point where those levels are completely remastered and looks like completely seperate levels compared to those in agent 47. (That, and you can actually have the benefits that this Hitman gives you that were not avaliable back in the first game IE saves >u>)\n\nAll in all, get this game. Hitman fan or newbie, get it.

No, the story and controls aren't much to brag about for this game.\n\nHowever, the immersion and feel of the game makes up for it, and the fact that some level maps are quite big but still controllable. At least I felt like I had control over the killings this time around, not like for instance the first game or some parts of the second game.\n\nI WOULD recommend this game whole heartedly IF it didn´t crash for me after the first play. I bought it here on steam just to replay this game, and see how it holds up today, and I had wanted to finish it at least one more time.\nHowever I will not recommend this game as it is today. But if STEAM would fix this problem I would love to recommend it. You CAN however fix this problem by yourself if you're at least a little skilled with computers, there are patches online and if you type in Hitman Contracts Crash on Google, you'll be able to fix this yourself, but it certainly WOULD help if Steam got around this problem and included a patch in this game.\n\nTherefore I recommend it, but not whole heartidly...","February 23, 2014","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really don't understand why theres haters saying that this isnt a real hitman game when it has all the aspects of a hitman game and possibly a bit more.\nAlthough I enjoyed the game, I found it quite short, especially because one of the missions took me less than 5 minutes to complete, and all the remastered missions from the first hitman had at least different ways of doing things that werent in the first hitman, and i'm not entirely sure you can do it the same way as the first game because some of the missions are severely tweeked with the design of the mission. so if you were excited fort the missions to be the same, be prepared for a difference.\nAlso, the only mission i felt that was detrimental to the main story of the series was the first and last missions, just words for thought.\n\nI enjoyed this game and the last two, and i'm excited to play blood money later on, but if you're getting this more so for the story, you might be better off just watching the beginning and end of the game on youtube, but thats just my opinion.

The Meat King's Party, the first mission, is the creepiest mission in the entire series. That just tells you how morbid this game is.\n+Funny executions (you actually have to put laxatives in a dude's soup then kill him on the toilet, as you need to use his uniform to peacefully reach your other target. You also have the option of killing another target by suffocating them with a pillow). There's also some darker executions as well (such as thrusting a poisoned sword through somebody.)\n+Graphics are well above average.\n+Incredible stealth mechanics, especially at the time it was released.\n+Lots of weapons, and weapons are rewarded by playing stealthily.\n+You have to complete a mission to use weapon select for that mission, which increases the replay value.\n+Provides a good deal of challenge.\n\n-AI can be terrible at times.

I didn't play the first game though, not sure how different they are.\n\nAfter this installment, the story writing and controls go downhill for Blood Money and Absolution. So Contracts and Silent Assassin are unfortunately the only two games I personally recommend playing.","December 28, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think this was even more refined than the second game. You revisit the first game's levels and they really are better designed. You have option to finish the mission with "Silent AssAssIn" rank. Overall very good gameplay wise and the feel is really great. This also translates to game being easier, which is a plus for me as sometimes you want to have fun.\n\nTechincal problems are widescreen support. Yeah, I had the option for FullHD but when it's with aspect ratio 4:3, then I might think this game is about a fat bald midget. Luckily there is some kind of solution, though it's not the best.\n\nMusic is better than the second game, but doesn't match the first game. Though There is a difference. They improved the sound system. So now if you are in a firefight then a action music plays which really adds to the athmosphere. I can't put my finger on it, but music has some kind of weird eeriness to it. It really fits to the whole game.","December 26, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
