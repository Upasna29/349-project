"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/12100/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","One of the first PC/Console cross platform games that I can remember and I'll be honest... it was great to finally getting around to actually playing it.\n\nI never had a PS2 as a child, or an amazing PC to play and experience GTA III when it was first released over 10 years ago. Instead like the pauper child I was, I had to go around a friend's house and 'play' the game. You might be surprised to find out that when I say 'Play' I actually mean mess about, such as the innocence of youth.\n\nSo visiting the game 10 years later, as an older, wiser, sillier man with the hindsight of GTA IV's version of Liberty City has been a great experience. There's actually a really good story within GTA III, something that I never appreciated or cared for back when playing at a friend's house (all I wanted to do was steal cars and shoot people). The story that is complimented well by some pretty fun missions and voice acting with one voice stealing the show - there aren't many games out there with Japanese American Accents with a strong double lisp.\n\nIn general GTA III has aged well, which I don't always find from those first wave of 3D games ~2000ish. The soundtrack has held up well, and it's nice to visit the early days of Lazlow on Chatterbox, and I'm sure some of the stations have even been remastered .\nGraphically the game looks pretty solid even if I did have a few issues, but I think that was more my fault than the games (I had installed the Xbox Mod). There is a generally known 'issue' with the Steam gtaIII.exe file which can be resolved with an easy to install TXD file on the official forums and Steam forums (it'll fix the dark coloured cars).\n\nThe one criticism I might have would be an improvement to the camera controls, but I can forgive the lack of control (and the frustration that can sometimes be caused). This issue really comes to head during the gun battles, which at times can be awkward to aim due to a general lack of free aim mode.\n\nGTA III might not be as vast or as epic as GTA V, but it captures the reality and craziness that I suspect GTA IV was attempting to offer. The blend of comedy within the serious tones and themes works well, most of which coming across in the now trademark radio stations, but also within Liberty City.\nThere are a ton of easy to miss signs and shops that hold double meaning and spoof popular icons and culture (most of which still relevant today). So while there aren't any real random encounters in GTA III, it's still worthwhile exploring Liberty City as the Sandbox Nature can still reward you with a few laughs due to ad-lib citizen remarks, billboards, shops, and funky AI.\n\nIn short...\n\nGTA III is a blast from the past that's still well worth checking out, especially if it's cheap during on the Steam Sales. As long as you realise this game is over 10 years old, and can appreciate the early attempts of a sandbox game I think you'll enjoy it. If nothing else it's nice to see the genesis of what we know as modern GTA.\n\nCheck the Steam Forums/Rockstar Forums for the fix for the Steam version before you play, and enjoy.","October 6, 2014","true","18.1"," 143 of 157 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","143","157","10","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/12100/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Another game that I am a more than a decade late playing...Grand Theft Auto 3 was released in mid 2002; and is actually the fifth game in the GTA series, however this game was the one which changed the franchise into the series we know today.\n\nThe game is set in the fictional city of Liberty City, which is actually loosely based on New York City. You play the role of a bank robber named Claude, and you become entrapped in a world of gangsters and corruption very quickly.  This was the first GTA game to change from the topdown view of the previous titles and move to a third person view - which combined the a new third-person and driving experience in a new game engine.\n\nIn GTA III we have the main story line, in which you can pick and choose which missions to complete for certain characters. Many of the missions are not mandatoy to move the story forward however. You can carry out smaller side activities such as being a taxi for the night, or hijacking an ambulance resucing people and dropping them off at the hospital.\n\nThe graphics are dated but it is over ten years old, what were you expecting? You can get graphically enhancing community made mods to increase the fidelity a bit too. I personally really like these dated looking graphics.\n\nGTA III will challenge you at points; more so that you will probably end up dying quite a bit. Some missions require a lot of shooting and evading police, while others involve a little bit of parkour and trying not to just kill yourself in a stupid manner. The re-spawn system is very good in GTA though; you loose all your weapons as well as having to pay a fee for the hospital having to patch you up.\n\nAs you can see, I have over a hundred hours in GTA III, this is through having multiple playthroughs, as well as completing the game 100% on a number of occasions; however this past week I did a full playthrough of the story and a couple of the side activities and this took me almost twelve hours to complete. There is a ton more content to play in that playthrough too, so you can easily get about fifteen plus hours out of one playthrough of GTA III if you desire.\n\nOddly enough I had no real game breaking technical issues with GTA III, the only one I did find is it is not recommended to play this game with more than one monitor activated at a time, as your mouse will sometimes wander out of the game window and you will end up minimizing your game all the time. To be honest though; just the one issue on a ten year old game is pretty good going if you ask me.\n\nIn conclusion, GTA III is a land mark in gaming history; it is the game which revolutionized the GTA series, sparked media controversy, and most of all, gave us one of the best games in history. Most will have already completed this game; however if you haven't - I strongly advise you dust your copy off and give it a weekend of your time to play.\n\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/recommended/12100/","daniel_faraday","Daniel Potter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daniel_faraday/","845 products in account","GTA III, a game created by Rockstar North (Edinburgh, Scotland), which was released in October 2001 for the PS2, and later ported to PC in May 2002.\nNow, i am sure that everybody are familiar with concept of GTA games. So i will cut to the chase.\n\nIt was the first game in the series to use a 3D engine. The game itself was based in a fictional place called Liberty City, which supposedly resembles New York. Thanks to the engine, the city is dynamic, having a 24 hour day cycle and weather changes.\n\nDuring the game you will be playing as Claude, who is either mute or developers just forgot to hire a voice actor for him. Nevertheless, the game starts off with your girlfriend betraying you during a bank robbery, leaving you to the cops. Thankfully, while getting transported, gangs attack the convoy, thus breaking you free. At first you will be working for the Mafia, helping them out with the rival family and the Triads. Then, after them betraying you, you will start working for the Yakuza (Japanese). Eventually, you do get revenge on your girlfriend, who is a member of the Colombian Cartel. But to do that, you will have to trigger a war between the Yakuza and the Cartel.\n\nBy the end of the game, 5 out of 7 gangs total, will be hostile towards you, attacking you on sight. This can become extremely annoying, considering that some gangs have shotguns which can blow up your car in 2 shots. For comparison, by the end of the game in GTA Vice City, you had only 1 gang that would be hostile towards you, and while in GTA San Andreas, you could completely wipe off all other gangs.\n\nUnlike other GTA's, most missions in GTA III involve using cars:\n-chasing someone\n-make someone's car burn by ramming it\n-racing\n-racing while passing through checkpoints under a time limit\n-trying to get to a destination under a time limit\n-trying not to damage the car while under a time limit\n-racing with a boat\n-find "insert car" and bring it to the garage\n-get to a destination while being chased by cops/gangs\n\nIn all honesty, there been like ~ 5 missions that involve genuine shootouts. And i kind of understand why. All GTA 3 era games were harsh, but the thing that set GTA 3 apart from the others, was that you weren't able to crouch. In other GTA's starting with Vice City, you could crouch behind any cover. Most objects would fully cover your buddy when crouched, and when you will start shooting, your character will rise a little bit above your cover.\n\nThe other thing that it was missing was a map. Only the minimap is present. The city is broken down into 3 islands, and each time you will reach a new one, the game will show you the icons for Pay'n'Spray, Ammunation, but only for the first few missions, then they are gone. So if you are gonna play it, you better memorize the necessary locations.\n\nAlso, you can't shoot tires or break windows of a car. You can't even damage a car with a baseball bat.\n\nFinally, i want to say how low on content it is, compared to other GTA's\nAmount of cars[gta.wikia.com] - 4 sport cars, 4 "2 door" cars, 4 "4 door" cars, 3 4WD cars, the rest are taxi, ambulance, police cars etc, or generic vans. No motorcycles or flying vehicles (ok, there is one, but it's unflyable)\nAmounts of songs in the radio - 8 radio channels, each having 6 songs.\nAmount of weapons - unlike other GTA's there is only 1 weapon per tier.\n\nThe PC port itself is quite bad. Mouse issues. FPS limited to 30 fps.\nI suggest using a SilentPatch. It fixes most of the bugs, but unfortunately, if you die or get caught by the police in the game, the game will crush.\n\nDo i recommend it?\nWell, if you are interested in the story, then you may buy it, cause all GTA 3 era games are connected. Chronologically, plot wise, the games are set this way:\n1986 - Vice City\n1992 - San Andreas\n2001 - GTA III\n\nOr in case you wanted to see how much the series has evolved (like me), then you can get it as well. This game has quite an impressive drawbridge for 2001.\n\nOr maybe you would prefer to play it in top down view? This is afterall, the last GTA that allowed you to set your camera view to top down.","December 5, 2014","true","15.9"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","37","39","3","2"

As most of the players know the GTA series, the only thing with GTA3 is the crude "PS2-like" GFX, as it was originally released for PS2 in 2001 but the disappointing part for the PS2 version is the lack of compatibility for the later revision model of the PS3 and PS4. The Steam version however may contain some GFX colour errors when you play in-game like the vehicles with a distinctive yellow glow; plus your saves from the PC Retail Version - that if you choose to transfer into the Steam Version may corrupt it.\n\nOverall this game is enjoyable, and it's generally for over 18s only, plus it does contain some racist stunts and footage: like the Italian Mafia going into Mob Wars with the Chinese Triads. And if you proceed after going into Mob Wars with the Triads and siding with the Diablos, then your chances of survival in the city will be reduced, due to the mobsters trying to take revenge against YOU! So, if you do want to make a 100% complete stats, then I recommend you stay away from other jobs except Luigi's. Because those Taxi/Police and Fire Engine jobs will be impossible if the mobsters start severely opposing you. And don't fail and save when you play on those "Kill Frenzy/Ramage" missions as those are a 1-way ticket.\n\nSpeaking of 1-way tickets: If you approach near Mission "Bomb Da Base - Act II", then be aware of Luigi's, Joey's and Toni's jobs, because if you not finished them all, you will never get the 100% completion. Same goes when you reach Staunton Island if you not finished the Jobs from Kenji when you get Donald Love's Jobs. And when you get a Mission from Shoreside Vale, except the PayPhone from Southside Hoods, DON'T buy anymore weapons. Trust me you need the cash for the final showdown.\n\nNow I believe this game appears to be the only game in the GTA 3D series onwards that don't reduce your Criminal Rating stats, so you can cause some cheating mayhem as you want. But don't use them for the newer versions of GTA as those Stats will be ruined.\n\nOne final thing, you can download some fixes like the Long Distance enhancement and some of Silent's DirectDraw fixes for this game. Try it! It should be safe:\n\nhttp://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=686\n\nhttp://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=779","December 21, 2013","true","3.9"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","39","45","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/12100/","snortcannon","Snort Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/","1320 products in account","Grand Theft Auto III is one of the most revolutionary games ever made, it changed the video game landscape forever, so let's get into it.\n\nWe play as Claude, a young bank robber who is trying to make it in Liberty City. After a bank heist his girlfriend Catalina shoots Claude and leaves him for dead. After a prison break Claude escapes and so begins his quest for revenge towards Catalina.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty identical to every other GTA game, but I'll explain if you want to know. The game is a sandbox title where you are free to explore at your own pace, you can travel by foot, by car or by boat. No air travel just yet. It's fun driving around and seeing the sights in Liberty City.\n\nThe gameplay is very stiff for this title. The driving is very hard to control and requires a lot of time getting used to it, but once you're used to it, it's not big of a problem.\n\nThe game also has a mission structure and every mission requires to do a lot of different stuff, ranging from racing, to hitman missions and a lot more stuff. A lot of the missions can be fun, but a lot of them are incredibly difficult and here is the biggest problem with the game.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, when a game is challenging that is not bad, but when it's so hard it's next to the point of being unfair is not good. GTA Vice City and San Andreas has a good mixture of difficulty where the missions where possible no matter what. GTA 3 however is incredibly difficult due to the very confusing objective placements and really punishing missions where a few good placed shots could blow up your car.\n\nThe soundtrack is also really lackluster. Every radio station only has 4 songs each ( at least from what I remember). But a lot of the songs are good, so I won't go too harsh on it.\n\nThe story is really great, while not the best thing of all time, it helps to push you to the conclusion and it really satisfies you after the end credits start rolling.\n\nWhile playing, I had zero issues with the game. No crashes, no game breaking bugs. Apart from minor AI glitches, I had no problems.\n\nThe game took me 13 hours to finish, after you're done, you also have races and packages you can collect all over Liberty City.\n\nOverall GTA 3 is a good game, but it has not aged well since 2001. It's a revolutionary game and I won't deny the impact it had on the world of gaming, but I highly suggest players to buy either Vice City or San Andreas.\n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10 - Worth Purchasing on Sale\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n","April 24","true","12.6"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/recommended/12100/","nullpointerx","nullPointer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/","467 products in account","Every legend begins somewhere, and Grand Theft Auto III is the game that laid the foundation not only for the entire GTA series as we know it today, but in many ways for the entire open-world sandbox structure of games that continue to enjoy popularity.  It's been said that this game pales in comparison to the games that would come later in the 'GTA III trilogy', namely Vice City and San Andreas.  While it's true that those games further refined and expanded upon the GTA experience in important ways, the essential building blocks for those changes were created here in GTA III.\n\nI've trumped up the historical importance of the game a bit but the question remains as to whether the gameplay in GTA III has held up, especially in relation to the later iterations in the series.  Thankfully I can answer that with a resounding, "Yes!"  So let's talk about some of the things that make this game tick.  First and foremost, we have the story.  In GTA III Rockstar was pinning down some of the aspects that would come to be regarded as the Rockstar style of storytelling.  The story here is basically a love letter to latter day crimeland movies like Goodfellas, Heat, Donnie Brasco, Reservoir Dogs, and the like.  In this capacity all the requisite pieces are in play, including the Italian mafia, Japanese yakuza, Chinese triads, as well a healthy assortment of street level thugs.  You are a mute protagonist (who we would later know as Claude thanks to GTA: San Andreas), making a name for himself on the back of jobs from all these various criminal factions.  Naturally there are betrayals, double-crosses, hits and feints between all of these organizations, and Rockstar handles its authorial pen deftly enough to keep the story moving at a good pace.  The whole story has the tone and feel of a pulp crime movie you might see as part of a matinee crime movie marathon; nothing of great substance, but a whole lot of fun nevertheless.\n\nIn GTA III we also see the beginnings of Rockstar's tendency to include well-known actors performing voice work in their games.  Here we have Michael Madsen, Joe Pantoliano, Michael Rappaport, Debi Mazar, Kyle MacLachlan, and gangster movie legend Frank Vincent all playing supporting roles in the game.  The caliber of voice acting in this game really does some great things for the conveyance of the story.  In the hands of lesser actors, certain aspects of this story might have come off as laughably cringe-worthy.  As it is we are treated to voice work performed by old pros, particularly where crime drama is concerned.\n\nHere we are also treated to the first GTA game to include an absolutely killer soundtrack complete with genre specific radio stations, distinct DJs for each radio station, and some great licensed music.  It had been quite a few years since I played this game, and these tunes (as well as spoken dialog) really filled me with a sense of nostalgia.  In truth it's the radio stations that give this game its comedic timing and fantastically dark sense of humor.  As an added bonus, the PC port of this game allows you create a custom playlist of mp3s which can be imported into the game.  I really had a great time importing my own tunes into the game.  Once you do so, the 'MP3 Player' becomes selectable in any vehicle just like a normal radio station which plays your tracks on random repeat.  Let me tell you that you haven't lived until you've gone on a drive-by rampage with Electric Wizard's Funeralopolis blaring from the sound system of your Patriot.  >=D\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are admittedly somewhat long in the tooth at this point, but even still they are pretty darned enjoyable.  The drifty, somewhat floaty driving mechanics that are a hallmark of 3D GTA games make their debut here.  At first the driving might seem a slightly off, being that I don't know of any other driving game that handles quite like the GTA games.  The handling is a bit loose, but once you get that part dialed in it's a real blast.  Of course the looseness of vehicle handling depends a lot on what vehicle you're in at any given time.  It does need to be said that there are no motorcycles in GTA III, which for me is perhaps one aspect of the later games that I missed the most here.  There are also no helicopters, and only one (notoriously difficult to control) aircraft.  That said, the variety of vehicles available here is suited well to the game, and I feel that the slightly limited selection of vehicles can be forgiven being that we are talking about the first GTAs first foray into full 3D.\n\nThis was my first play though of the Steam PC port of GTA III, and I will say that I found some relatively minor issues with the port.  First and foremost, the aiming mechanics were … problematic for me in this version.  In the 'Classic Control' scheme, the relatively responsive nature of the auto-targeting feature found in the console version of the game just doesn't carry over very well in the PC version.  It fails to reliably switch between targets, and in many cases it fails to find any targets at all (despite the fact that said targets are in the process of filling you with lead).  Furthermore, when you're using the Classic Control scheme the right thumb stick puts you in first person look perspective rather than adjusting the 3rd person camera as one might expect.  Others may have had a slightly different experience with Classic Mode controls, but for me the combination of the above factors made this option a non-starter.  The 'Standard Control' scheme makes some marked improvements to the above, but in this case you're stuck strictly with free aiming.  I tend to prefer keyboard & mouse controls for games that require free aiming, and indeed given that strafing features prominently into the Standard Control scheme in GTA III, one might assume that KB+M is what the developers had in mind here … except that KB+M makes driving nearly impossible (although not entirely impossible as I do know at least one person that beat this game entirely with KB+M).  Using the Standard Control scheme, I ultimately ended up ruling in favor of using a controller to better facilitate driving, although I did find a helpful mod that made this option a bit more feasible.  The GInput mod allows you to fully utilize an Xinput device in GTA III which makes using a controller in the game a bit more palatable, and has the added benefit of additional customizable settings.  It even swaps out correct button icons for onscreen prompts.  So there's that.\n\nOn my (Nvidia-based) gaming rig there were also a couple of graphical glitches present in this port.  Most noticeably I encountered the 'dark vehicles' glitch, in which all the vehicles appear to have a much darker tint than they should.  For this issue I applied a second light weight user-made patch to the game which resolved the issue promptly.  If you find yourself with the same problem, this fix is probably worth your time as well.\n\nAt the end of the day, the question is whether or not this game is still worth your time.  Given the popularity (and occasional notoriety) enjoyed by the GTA series, you probably already know whether the source material is your cup of tea.  Dark comedy, violence, and debauchery abound!  If you're already a fan of the series, or if you're looking to get into the 3D era of GTA games at the ground floor, I would say that this game still holds a lot of enjoyment even today.  It had been a number of years since I last played this game and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected I would especially given the historical perspective of subsequent GTA games.  This old jalopy has still got some life in 'er yet!","April 22, 2015","true","62.9"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","5"

You may ask, why it is still a must-play, when we have so many fine games of the same genre, with GTA V in the first place?\n\nAs usual, the point is in the impact this game made on the whole gaming world and all around it.\n\nFor example, when Ubisoft desired to make its own "ala GTA" product, they look namely on the GTA III as the base model. You can see the similarity with your own eyes: in the map, in the cars. Almost senseless vigilante Aiden Pierce is also not a big step from GTA3 protagonist Claude, even if he talks more, his behavior and usual activities are just about the same (except of ha-king, of course).\n\nSeriously, this game is not a history, it is fine to go even today. Camera and controls may be a bit tricky for start, but when you succeed with it - you'll get a nice trip into underground world, one of the best interpretations in the whole criminal stories cluster. It is just as playable now as any of GTA "clones", like Sleeping dogs, Watch dogs et cetera... but it is original.\n\nWell, for me this is one of those unforgettable things I'll carry in my life, with all tips, shortcuts and armor locations, which I remember, while not touching it for more than 10 years. But it is not about nostalgia. It is just a really strong stuff. Maybe not the best in line, maybe dated... But still pure and stout. Good taste.\n\nSolid 7.5 mark in my book, without any rebate for former experience.","February 9","true","44.5"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","38","50","7","0"

It only falls behind because the other GTA's improved on this one, but being the first 3D GTA, it was very impressive at the time and still today. The story is simple, being a mute guy that mostly just takes jobs from other Liberty City residents. Gameplay wise, the on-foot and shooting sections are a bit clunky, but it seems that Rockstar Games was aware of that, and most of the time you'll be driving, with simple but responsive gameplay. And the missions feel surprisingly varied, and aren't too hard with some exceptions. The music is good, but the soundtrack is a bit short. And of course, free roaming is as good as ever, especially while driving a tank! In the end, if this was the only GTA out there, it would stand the test of time for me, but the others put this on a bit on the shadows. But definitely a classic, especially because it's one of the roots for all sandbox games today.\n\nNote: Even if you don't like mods, there's 3 that i would probably recommend.\n1 - SilentPatch, an unofficial patch that fixes many bugs and issues.\n2 - Widescreen fix, for adjusting the image correctly for your widescreen.\n3 - GInput, if you want to play with a controller.","October 29, 2015","true","34.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Shooting feels solid, and satisfying to use, and the keyboard controls work well, although drive-by shootings are very difficult to perform, requiring you to drive using WASD, look out the side of your car with E or Q and press the left mouse button to shoot, while trying not to crash. But since you can get round most of the occasions where you may need to drive-by by running over people, it isn't an overwhelming problem.\n\nThose used to the new GTA's may be upset with the lack of the ever fun motorbikes and aircraft in the game (the one plane, a Dodo, is almost impossible to get into sustained flight, which it isn't intended to do). But it makes up for this with a good story, a  great New York-style world made of three island, and a enjoyable selection of cars, vans, lorries, supercars and a tank.\n\nAll in all, GTA III is worth a revisit, if only for a while and for it's story.","December 25, 2013","true","43.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Soon enough Rockstar North (then known as DMA Design) delivered. It was truly revolutional, one that put open world genre to the map. Interesting dialogs and story that was inspired by many gangster movies and characters voiced by actors such as Joe Pantoliano and Michael Madsen surely left an impact in the gaming industry.\n\nGame was phenomenal when I played it for the first time, and didn't lose its charm when replaying it many years later. You can blindly follow missions and slowly unravel story or you can choose to do one of many side activities that are present. Driving taxi, chasing criminals in police car, save wounded as paramedic or putting out fires are all an option. If you feel like discovering every corner of the Liberty City (loosely based on New York City) - there are 100 hidden packages to find. Want to unleash some anger - find rampage tokens and try to kill certain number of people for a given time. You like cars and driving - you can search the city for a rare models and big payoff in the end when you collect all of them. While doing that you won't be bored, radio stations with 3.5 hours of material are there to make sure of that. Choosing between big music hits and talk radio stations will often be a hard decision. Dark humor is omnipresent and is surely one of the series trademarks.\n\nCity is pretty small compared to ones in future instalments, but at the time it was more than enough. There is no map (except mini-map) and learning shortest route to some locations will be a must for certain missions. I always liked this aspect; no pausing all the time and carefully planning every turn. You play as silent protagonist and throughout game will encounter Italian Mafia, Yakuza and Colombian Cartel. Add to the mix corrupt police detective and weird multi-billionaire businessman and you have a full package.

For a while I was prepared to give in and call the system broken.  After working through it, I eventually began to find a work around.  I spent most of the game using a 360 controller because, as the title implies, much of the game is spent inside vehicles and the mouse/keyboard vehicle control is dire.  However the combat controls are much easier with mouse/keyboard, where you have the option to point directly at a target and move the camera at will.  When using a controller, one has to rely on the faulty targetting system which will rarely aim at who you wanted it to and is in general quite clunky.  I could also find no option to turn off inverted y-axis aiming for the controller.  The upshot of all this was that if I was using a first-person weapon, I would have to grab the mouse to aim, and if a particularly challenging foot-based mission cropped up, I would have to change the control scheme entirely.  Workable, but flawed.\n\nGameplay:  I thought this game was exceptionally well structured but first I should add that this is not a good sandbox by modern standards.  It was probably the archetype for the modern sandbox 'genre' but things have moved on a lot since then.  GTA III is just not able to compete with more recent games in terms of scale, scope or variety.  This does not mean however that the game cannot be enjoyed on its own terms.  One specific example from my experience was my initial frustration with the lack of any kind of overworld map - something that would be unthinkable in any modern-day open world game - but this merely led to me developing a more thorough knowledge of the city streets than possibly any other game I've played.  The areas are large enough to become immersed in, but never so large that you feel lost or overwhelmed and each street almost feels like it has its own unique personality of sorts, which aids navigability and adds to the charm of the experience.  If it had not been for the quality of the gameplay, I would not have had the patience to stick with the controls that I described in the previous paragraph.\n\nStory:  Behind a minimalistic mission-based story progression, there is actually quite an intriguing plot going on in the background.  Nothing particularly special, but more than I was expecting.  On a side note, I'm not sure if our protagonist is a soulless mercenary or just a bit dim, but either way he seems more than happy to go along with whatever maniacal schemes his employers hatch for him.\n\nGraphics:  This is not a pretty game.  I don't believe this to be particularly pertinent, but it's worth pointing out.  The best that can be said for them is that they are functional and I was able to tell what everything was.\n\nSound:  Very good.  There is no background music in the game besides the intro and credits sequences, but the soundtrack to the game is provided by radio stations which can be accessed while in a vehicle.  These cater to a diverse selection of musical tastes, and most players will find at least two favourites which they will keep coming back to.  The scripts for the DJs has also been artfully written and it's clear a lot of effort went into creating a cohesive aural environment that acts as a reflection of the city you drive in.  This applies tenfold to the talk radio station, Chatterbox, which bears several repeat listenings.  The sound effects are also of top quality and you can get a feel of the car you have just entered merely by the sound of its engine revving.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game to anyone with the patience to work around a poor control scheme and somewhat archaic design to see the unpolished gem that lies beneath them.  I do not think it still deserves the piles of praise that were heaped upon it on its initial release, but equally it is impossible to deny its merits, and the irrepressible charisma with which it flaunts them.","August 10, 2014","true","70.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

It is so fun without mods, the story is amazing and the characters are great too. You are in Liberty City (Based on New York) and you work for many gangs and even the police. You start off getting betrayed by Catalina (ex-girlfriend),  and are left for dead. You and some others are in a police convoy and soon are stopped. You are stopped by a gang (the gang your ex-girlfriend is apart of) and they take an old man who comes into play later.When they were going towards the cop car, they dropped a bomb on the bridge. You and a man named 8ball take down the police and soon the explosion happens. You are left with a car and you drive to a safehouse. You change clothes and go to a man named Luigi. Luigi is a pimp and ask you to do very simple task. The first is to pick up a girl named Misty. You bring her back and you are then asked to kill a man with a bat, take his car and give it to Luigi. Then you do some simple driving task and kill some pimps. You meet Joey and you do task against the Forelli's. You also help out a man named Toni, steal a van and do a bank robbery. Tony makes you help him with his beef with the Triads. The triads start to attack on sight now and you do your best to destroy there busniess and kill important people in their gang. You soon meet the Don. Salvatore asked you to do some task with his wife Maria. She grows a liking to Claude. Salavatore has you destroy some Colombians (Catalinas Gang). You also kill a snitch who feeds them information and soon Maria tells Salvatore about an affair of her and Claude. They try to kill you but you escape on a boat into the second part of the game. You now work for the Yakuza. They ask you to deal with the mafia by killing people out to kill Claude and murder Salvatore. Soon you get to meet Ray, a cop, who also introduces you to Donald Love. Ray ask you to murder his ex-partner and to help out Phil Cassidy (a character in Vice City and Vice City Stories). Ray at some point leaves Liberty City and leaves you weapons and a bullet-proof Patriot. You are introduced to Donald by Ray. Donald Love has you murder Kenji (Asukas Brother) to help prices in real estate. He also has you do task to get a package and help the Old man that was taken in the beginning of the game. At some point Donald leaves with no notice.  During one of Donalds missions you encounter Catalina. She is with Miguel (part of the beginning heist) and she betrays him, soon Asuka intergrates him thinking he killed her brother. Asuka gives Claude missions to try and destroy the Cartel. On the last mission Asuka gives you she ask you to destory a plane and when you go back, you find her dead and a note that ask you ti bring a ransom to get back Maria. You bring the ransom and they try to kill you. You shoot down a chopper and save Maria after killing the Cartel members. The game is now finished. Mods can make this game live longer like updating graphics, adding more missions and whole new storylines.","August 17, 2014","true","54.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

Perhaps You are faced with one of the first parts of the GTA. Even if not experienced, then now must face, because, finally, came the long-awaited third part. All series game wonderful total violence and aggression. In the new part, gamers are given complete freedom of action. Now you can smash, crush, kill, use any means at hand. The city is teeming with police cars, crime bosses.\n\nYou are a young offender, he found himself on the streets of liberty city. Yesterday You threw a friend. Anger boils inside, nobody wants to believe more. And then fate sends familiarity with well-known criminal authority, which sells explosives and engaged in other dark deeds. But, having worked with him a couple of dirty operations, you understand what it takes to start a business, and that working for a boss, it is hardly possible to achieve something in this life. After some deliberation You decide to go the private swimming, that is, to begin to do business on their own. In this way You will not be deprived by treachery, meanness, greed, and other human "virtues". But you chose this world this way, but because – "I want to live – learn to spin". The more that power is more than enough.\n\nLiberty city is a huge computer world. They can just enjoy wandering the streets and riding in cars – simply living in this world. And, of course, a lot of kinds of quests and missions will diversify the already entertaining life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/superjenius/recommended/12100/","superjenius","SuperJenius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/superjenius/","272 products in account","The game that started the phenomenon. There's a lot of fun to be had tearing through the city on  your own personal crime wave. Offensive, yes, but the game doesn't take itself seriously. It's fun precisely because you do stuff you would never do in real life. Arcade action.\n\nWhile fun, the game doesn't hold up well against modern open-world games. Some missions can be difficult, so be prepared to try and fail multiple times. Difficulty isn't a problem, though. I like a challenge. Poor controls on the PC, limited camera control, lack of in-game map, and overall fragility of your character/vehicles cause a lot of frustration. Half the time I feel like I'm fighting the game itself, rather than overcoming a challenge. The costs of failure is high, and you are more likely to just reload a previous save, meaning you'll need to visit your safe house to save between every mission. I may eventually finish this game, but I have to take it in doses. I'm hoping Vice City and San Andreas are less frustrating.\n\nAbout controls... I like to use keyboard/mouse on foot and an XBox 360 controller while driving. The game does support controllers, but it doesn't recognize all of the buttons. If you want to use a controller, save yourself some grief and spend an extra $10 on XPadder. It's still not great, but at least you'll be able to use all buttons. You'll need them.","May 6, 2013","true","13.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Too bad it didn’t age nearly as well as the next two games.\n\nLong version:When it came out, GTAIII was heralded as the first great step to a brand new era of Grand Theft Auto games. In retrospect, it is more of a mixture of new elements that later defined the series, and old ones left from the first three games. The location (Liberty City, an alternative New York), many characters, and things like the top-down driving camera, car crusher, bomb shop are all relics of the past, all forgotten in later instalments.\nThey fit nicely alongside the new additions though, like third-person gameplay, the cinematic mission briefings, the new car physics, and the weapon handling system. These all made GTAIII not only accessible to a wider audience, but did so without dumbing down the game too much for the plebs.\n\nExploration and running amok randomly were always part of GTA, and GTAIII is no exception. The return of the rampage challenges and the collectibles also support the free roam aspect, but the real strength lies in the missions. The loose collection of jobs is replaced by a massive storyline about a mute small-time gangster who has to work his way up in organised crime to take revenge on the woman who shot him in the back.\nThe plot is grim, but the execution isn’t so. The series always had a hefty dose of dark humour and liked to satirise the consumer-oriented society. This is even more apparent here, where human lives have no meaning, and you may cause mayhem for the silliest of reasons.\n\nThe gameplay and controls by today’s standards sadly lack a lot, and the engine isn’t really suited for post Windows XP systems.

I played this game back on the PS2, and repurchased the game for Steam so I could have it in perpetuity. All modern sandbox games owe everything to this series, and this game in particular.\n\nIn case you've never been exposed to a sandbox game before, you effectively are dropped into a city which "lives" - you can go around to various contacts looking for missions to accomplish (usually involving driving and shooting), explore the city looking for sights and items to collect, or even accomplish random missions like running a taxi or putting out fires with a fire engine. This game marks what was effectively the first time this sort of freedom was in a 3D game.\n\nThe game's story puts a low-down person fresh out of going to jail into a criminal underworld where he slowly climbs his way to the top to get revenge. I've played through this game multiple times and while it's ultimately the least of the trilogy, it is the giant whose shoulders the other two stands upon.\n\nI have not yet dabbled in the mod scene for this game, but searching around seems to imply there's a fairly healthy number of them to pick from, so if that's your thing, it's worth a look. At any rate, this is a classic which should be a part of anyone's collection.

I suggest that those of you who love the GTA franchise pick this one up if discounted and spend at least two weekends to see where the series came from.

It's a fantastic jump too. Being the first open world 3D GTA it has it's fantastic but not a perfect game. The City is Liberty City (Same City as GTA IV but more more different)  and is parody of New York, you play and Claude Speed (Who has no voice) after being betrayed by your now ex girlfriend and being put in prison you escape after your police van is attacked and now you're on a revenge trip. The City is large for being the first 3D GTA game and not as alive as Vice City (Vice City only came out not even a year after GTA 3). The Radio is decent having Push it to the Limit otherwise there is only a few recognizeable songs. The Story isn't too great. Your character doesn't talk all he does is go to a person and get a job and then execute it. Not much more than that just rinse and repeat. The jobs range from Assassinations to picking up hookers and driving them to the local Police Ball. The Combat is something I want to touch on too. Not too great. The camera can be wonky at times and the shooting seems clunky (Much more improved in Vice City). There is side content to do. Like Taxi driving and Vigilante Missions though both aren't too interesting but at least they are there for people who like to do that kind of stuff. The Driving is practally the same throughout all the 3D GTA's so theres not much to say except the driving is good but not like a racer and it feels arcadey but fun (Considering it lasted 3 games each being a little more refinded). All in all GTA 3 is still a fantastic experience. Does it still hold up today? Not really depending on your playstyle and if you can deal with not too refined game mechanics and bugs and werid controls. 7.3/10.","September 26, 2013","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

This misconception is: In GTA you can do whatever you want. Any fan of the GTA series will tell you that there really isn't that much to do in GTA, because it's meant to be an arcade styled open world driving game. And this is pretty obvious in GTA III, the main character doesn't speak, which honestly... I've come to really prefer over some of the other characters in this series. GTA III didn't try to be this game where the map was meant to be explored. But it did reach out for things like an open world, and a story. I love this game because of the driving, and the fast paced missions, but I won't sit here and act like this game excels in anything other than the driving. The setting is pretty dull, and uninspired. The map was just really lifeless, and the radio station didn't help that at all. I ♥♥♥♥ing hated the radio station to death, except for lazlo's station which made me laugh uncontrollably. The story was absolutely flimsy as is the case in most GTA games.\n\n1) two timed by your crew in a bank robbery\n\n2) broken out of prison\n\n3) in a city with no money but with a partner (8ball)who hooks you up with a connection to the mafia (it always seems to be the maifa)\n\n4) You work your way up in the mafia, and then they betray you, I forget why though.. Alot of betrayal in GTA.\n\n5) meet another gang in an unlocked part of the map (game basically restarts at this point)\n\n6) work your way up in that gang\n\n7) You do jobs for a bunch of shady people\n\n8) These shady people set up a gang war between your original crew who two timed you, and the crew you are two timing now.\n\n9) You do all the missions\n\n10)  Uhp, random girl is kidnapped.. I oughta go save her from my arch nemesis. I really had no idea Claude cared for revenge or justice until this point\n\n11) You end up killing all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the game\n\n12) game pretty much ends, except for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pay phone missions\n\nThis game is a 7/10 in my opinion","December 14, 2013","true","25.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The controls are easy to get a grips with and for a price of £2.99 you can't go wrong. This game is all about the nostalgia of being back in Liberty City with 2002 graphics. But to be honest, graphics on these old GTA's never matter if you are a true GTA fan. The story line is as gripping as ever, also I reccommend once completed that you try out different cheat codes and mods to give a little more fun because once this game is completed it can be a little tedious to play.

It simply smashes all those statements allowing you to kill anyone you see, destroy everything and have a good time too. It raised a lot of controversy that did nothing but help the sales, my guess is that it's the best card Rockstar has under their sleeve (and don't forget Jack Thompson). The series have seen a new life within 3D graphics, making Rockstar Games, become superstars. These days it's easy to see the faults of the game, but it's a very nice nostalgic feeling of returning to this world of crime and violence...

Of course it has its issues and annoyances, but in the end one has to remember when this game was made. Combat system is pretty much terrible, but that is weighted up by the story (all though not as deep as the other games in the 3D-GTA-series) and the amount and hours of fun you will experience in this game. This game drives you to explore the environment (all though not as much as VC and SA), but it is, in my opinion, way more fun than, for example, GTA IV, which was an epic fail. This GTA III, though, is the opposite!

When this game was first released it was revolutionary! The first 3D Grand Theft Auto! Amazing, truly amazing. The storyline is excellent (♥♥♥♥ YOU, CATALINA!) and the soundtrack is actually not that bad (listen to Rise, MSX, Flashback FM, Head Radio and last but not least Double Cleff FM). The only downfall to this game was not including the beautiful and talented Misty into more missions. What a shame. Anyways, if you are sitting here reading this review contemplating whether or not to buy Grand Theft Auto III I say buy it RIGHT NOW. It is a classic. Also like Vice City, this game was made when Rockstar actually cared about gameplay more than appearance. So if that doesn't make you want to buy this game I don't know what will.

Anybody who has played Vice City, San Andreas, or any of the PSP games (Except Chinatown Wars of course. We do not speak of Chinatown Wars.) will basically have already played this game.\n\nYou play as a convicted criminal, who's convoy was ambushed mid-transfer leading to his release, and ends up working for money. Fairly simplistic.\nYou can go anywhere in the bits of Liberty City that you've unlocked, drive along to music running over pedestrians or cruising through the subway tunnels like a nerd with a wedgie, use weapons, blahdynlah.\n\nThe game's definitely enjoyable, with quirky jokes and fun/dark/fun things to do, constantly. But I do have complaints as well.\nA lack of controller support is annoying, especially for those who first played GTA3 on the PS2/Xbox and want the same experience. The graphics aren't very good either, but I'll let it slip going by it's age. A lack of free camera movement in vehicles is hindering to say the least, and the fact that you can only run for a small amount of time before your character is 'tired', a sadly staple feature of the GTA games, is also less than ideal.\n\nAside from this, all I can say is, it's GTA. You do some missions, get a fire truck, kill everybody, get in a cop chase, get killed/arrested then repeat the cycle. If that's your thing, then £6.99 won't burn too big a hole in your pockets.\n\nThis game gets a 6.5/10. Good slab of entertainment there.\n\nQuote of the game: "Hey Joey, I'm bored.

Personally I think this is the best GTA. At least it is my favorite. To me, it beats San Andreas and Vice City. And unlike GTA IV (or mabye even GTA V which I haven't played) it doesn't aim to be super realistic.\n\nAnd now, onto a proper review:\nGrand Theft Auto III has a dark and cold atmosphere, the story is quite interesting and throughout the game you make yourself more and more enemies (Triads, Mafia, Columbian Cartel).\nThe dark atmopshere gets underlined by the amount of gangs cruising around Liberty City. The game itself is overly dark, Taxis are in a really dark tone of yellow, you can barely see colours of cars since they all seem almost black.\nLike I said, this game hasa really dark atmosphere, and this is what makes the game better than Vice City or San Andreas.\nFurthermore, this was the first "3D" GTA, so it was the beginning of a new era  the old top-down-camera is still available though).\n\nAll in all, the game is really worth its money, you should definitely pick it up, maybe wait for it to go on sale to do so.","October 6, 2013","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure I had seen it at the store and had even picked up the game to look at the artwork and screenshots but for some reason I never bought it. That is until a co-worker of mine, at the time, did a story on violence in video games. I worked at a TV News station at the time and the story was definately NOT pro game or pro GTA. After watching someone bring in their PS2 and played a bit so they could record some footage I was hooked and went and bought the game.\n\nGTA III is a sandbox game and very non-linear. Actually if you want to visit the rest of the areas in the game you do have to complete the threshold of missions to unlock those parts of the game but you can take your time and do other things in the mean time.\n\nToday the graphics look a bit dated but back in it's day the game was pretty cutting edge.  The controls were pretty easy to pick up though aiming the weapons needed some help. Driving the cars (which is the gist of the game) is straight forward too and all the cars have different capabilities. A sports car drives like a sports car while a truck drives like a truck.\n\nThe game has plenty of controversies to be sure. One of them is the ability to pick up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to "heal" you.  After you are done with your tryst you can, though are not required to, kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get your money back. Critics lambast the game for the ability to do this but realistically the game presents you with a moral choice and it's up to you to do, or not do, bad things in the game.\n\nI do enjoy this game though it's harder for me to play it now then it was over 10 years ago. I tend to be the player who only wants to unlock stuff to explore and when I do I get bored with the missions.  I guess in reality, I never did finish the game. I unlocked the last island and did a number of quests but I spent most of my time driving around in cool sports cars and exploring the game world.\n\nThis was a defining game and because of that it should be checked out. I have fond memories of my time spent in Liberty City.","December 25, 2012","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This ensures that the pacing will never bog down. The high difficulty of the latter missions is completely necessary to the game, as it brings out the greatest strengths of the open world genre - the player will often HAVE to get creative and find an alternative way to solve a mission, because the "standard" way is either too hard or outright impossible. Couple this with a ton of potential for utter chaos to occur, due to rather chaotic, "loose" mechanics, and you have possibly the greatest use of the free-roaming model ever.\nAn utterly brilliant game. It's not perfect - it could be larger, the story could be a bit more complex, and the shooting could be a little better, but don't get Vice City or San Andreas over this. They're good, but this is, even after all these years, still the best free-roaming action game that we have.","October 17, 2013","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Suggestive movements and moans when you recover health with a hooker in a car, sheer amount of violence and gore for the time, censored version in Australia to protect minors (though begs the question to why you would let them play in the first place), and one of many of Jack Thompson's "blame the game" defences.\n\nFor the game itself, it's not that much of a farcry from GTA IV and I'm sure you can pick it up easily. If you haven't tried any sort of freeroam game, then GTA III is a decent game to start.

The story is silly - why they decided for a silent protagonist is beyond me, but the missions past the initial tutorials are generally good and fun (and lucky don't bring "morality" or "film-like plots" into it much). Very tough end game and not a great deal to do outside of missions but there is a lot of gameplay, and in spite of dated graphics it holds up remarkably well, with just about every modern GTA's gameplay mechanics in plain sight - something to mull over when contemplating any future ones since most of it has been done before.","December 23, 2011","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The city feels real, alive, with different sections inhabited by different groups/gangs(Chinatown, the Mafia's turf, etc.). All of the radio channels are worth listening through. Sharp satire, much of which remains applicable. Cars, boats and a plane to use. A ton of stuff to do, keeping you playing long after you've completed the storyline. Cool story, with twists and backstabbings - a proper big city crime story. Great mission design.\n\nCons: Shooting is pretty bad(they did realize, and put more emphasis on car-missions, thankfully). The early-ish 3D graphics have really aged. Barely a personality to the protagonist.\n\nMy recommendation: a must for any fan of open-world gaming.","December 28, 2013","true","36.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You should really only buy it if you played it way back when on your PS2 or PC and you're looking for a trip down memory lane.

Besides the main missions there isn't much to do, and it has very limited graphics for today. It also has issues with modern systems.

I first played this on the Playstation 2 big change into the new 3D engine at the time. For the playstation 2 this was a big leap forward with plenty to explore, rich characters, fun weapons & making the star signs go up being in a mad city police chase. Other GTA titles have done well but never matched this titles story & urban city feel, Certainly one of the greatest games in history.","February 21, 2013","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Admittedly not very well done on the PC (very buggy, practically unplayable) but was AMAZING on the PS2. The game is visibly outdated by today's standards, but put yourself in the mindset of this games release day, and you will enjoy imminsely. For best effect, make sure vertical sync and frame lmiters are ON. If they are ON, you will see all cars as black due to a bug. But if they are OFF, especially on higher end PCs, the game will play in fast forward, and virtually every tiny little thing will take health from you (falling off the curb, etc). But aside from the cars looking weird, the game plays fine. Enjoy a classic!","June 19, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicB/recommended/12100/","EpicB","Blargman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicB/","150 products in account","The very first GTA game i played back in the day. Blew my mind that a game existed like this as early as 2001; the amount of attention to detail whether it be cars, npcs, or the fact that its a very open world amazed me. For anyone that hasn't played it yet, i highly recommend you do.\n\nStory: You play as Claude, a mute protagonist of the game. The story of GTA 3 tends to branch itself out with the various interesting characters you meet. I didnt really pay attention to the story too much until GTA IV but i can tell you that 3 does deliver some interesting story telling.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is in Thirdperson, but you can switch to first person while using certain weapons. You are able to run, sprint, jump and crouch. There are many cars to drive as well as boats and flyable vehicles.\n\nMusic/SFX/Voiceacting: The music to GTA 3 is usually heard via the radio, Rockstar knows how to pick out good songs; its on par with the music selection for Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. The sound effects are also really well made. The voiceacting is pretty good for its time as well.","April 4, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a very good port and actually features some improvements over its console counterparts (FPS style aiming ftw).  It's always nice to give respect to the classics, and this is definitely one that gets sweeter with age.  There's something timeless about the rythm and cadence of exploring and completing missions in a game like this.  Something that the newer games have sadly lacked.  If you've got the inclination, get back to your roots sometime with this classic.

Now, I say this because not only does it have an amazing storyline and great game play for its time, it also was a breakthrough, and historic point in gaming community. Without GTA III, we probably wouldnt have the other amazing games such as Call of Duty, BattleField, Left 4 Dead and others with amazing graphics. I would recommend this game to anyone I know.","July 27, 2014","true","64.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I remember playing it for hours and hours and having tons of fun. The same happened to me now. Here I am, almost 15 years later, enjoying the same awesome game.\nI must warn you that this game have compatibility problems. So, I recommend to launch in compatibility mode with Windows 98, as administrator and run at 640x480. I'm aware that is awful to run this game like that, but perhaps you will not be able to even launch it if you don't.\nIt would be great if Rockstar could release like a HD patch supporting better resolutions, though.\nBut, please, don't let that little problem convince you to not buying it.

Any title is awesome (besides GTA IV's PC port, but that's on a performance's POV) and GTA III is the first of three games that are set on III's universe, therefore Rockstar names it the GTA III trilogy. I mainly played the game again for nostalgia (remember, it's from 2002, I know right, time goes by so fast) and for the fact that I hadn't truly completed the game in the past. Setting that aside, GTA III's story is not original but it's only a pretense for the crazy missions you will be doing. You will always have some people (you get to work with the mafia, yakuza, etc) your character goes to, to receive a mission, then on and on until you complete all of them. Voice acting is pretty impressive considering the game's age, and there many bugs that irritated me (coming down the stairs and getting launched into the air...) but nonetheless it was a great experience. I don't know if I should really recommend GTA III because you will probably just be playing GTA V.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=429728538","April 26, 2015","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

But back to the game itself. / GTA 3 in my opinon gets very boring real quick the story is you 60% of time driving people around to point A to point B to me thats very annoying. But the other 40% of the time its you being a B?da?ss doing misson that sorta make up for the time driving people around. To me I think GTA 3 is one I will use cheat on start because it gets boring. If you never played a classic old school Gta, I would recommend GTA SA over 3 due to glitches and the way its played compared to SA. But still if you haven't tried 3 yet it is worth it if you can get past the boring missions and bugs.","March 2, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When I got tired from music I listened to him non stop. All other stations are worthless.\n\nSome characters have broken motivation for their actions. Plot is semi-non existent. It's told in little bits, just so that we can get the picture, but it fails at being a mosaic that we put together and ends up distant from the player. And the ending is anti-climactic.\n\nIn the end it's not enough. Playtime is decent, it took me 18 hours to complete, with exploration, side missions and package retrieving. But the plot could've used some more depth. Characters could've been drawn out better. They appear and dissapear and slip out of the mind.\n\nIt is a good game, but perhaps the worst GTA I've played.","December 4, 2015","true","18.9"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

The game is not very storydriven as many other games. Instead it's more focused on the adventure and action in the state of Libety City. You play as Claude, a man shot and left for dead by your girlfriend after a bank heist. You try to crawl back from the bottom of the criminal food chain in redemption for your girlfriend as you end up in a mafia war against the triads. The mafia then betrays you and are forced to go into hiding. There are some flaws with the game such as the El Burro racing mission. El Burro tells you he as a job oppurtunity for you and says you are getting alot of street cred. So then out of nowhere he says you have to race. No explanation, just race. And the whole race is just lag and frusration. Don't believe me, just try the game for yourself. Overall, the game is hella fun and deserves an 8/10!","February 17, 2014","true","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Leonem/recommended/12100/","Leonem","Leonem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Leonem/","818 products in account","The first GTA game made in 3D and it's living up to its name.\nThis is the game that made every other GTA games what they are today.\n\nYou play as Claude who got betrayed and shot by his girlfriend after a heist. Wounded but not dead, you find yourself arrested and transported to prison but you evade from your transport when the colombian cartel makes an attack on the patrol you are stuck into to help another prisonner to escape. You use this opportunity to beat a police officer, remove your handcuffs and evade from your transportation truck. You learn about 8-Ball and he helps you with his contacts.\nRoaming around Liberty City to do missions for the Mafia, the Yakuza and some independent names, you are thrown around to do the dirty jobs like the handyman you are.\n\nThe map is huge and the game looks good when you think about the games that came out around the same years.\nIt's in the veine of the GoldSrc Engine, Unreal Engine, id Tech 3 but with a big map made with free-roaming in mind. Driver 2 would be a better comparison. Restating that GTA3 was the first attempt from Rockstar to make a 3D game, They didn't miss their shot.\n\nThere's a lot of things to do.\nThe missions are non-linear, you always have the choice between a mission giver or another, there's the phone boot side-quests, you can do Taxi, Ambulance and Police missions when you get the specific car and you can always free-roam in Liberty City causing carnage for fun and giggles.\n\nThe sound effects are great, you always feel like you're in a real city with the car sounds and pedestrians talking.\nA gunshot disturbs the peace of the moment when everyone start screaming and running.\nThe game is immersive, you feel like you're there, walking/running around in Liberty City.\n\nThere's enough weapons to have fun the entire game. There's not three different sets like in San Andreas but the game isn't that long either. Everything is well balanced for its size and for it's date of creation.\n\nThe physic in the game is alright, not perfect but very good for what it needed to be.\nThe driving physic is sometimes weird, you feel like in a pinball machine when you start hitting everything around but otherwise, handbrakes, quick turns and donuts can be done easily. Depending on the car you have, controlling it is never that much of a pain unless it's a really bad car which was obviously a choice from the devs. Bad cars roll badly.\n\nThe shooting mecanics are archaic to say the least, it's kinda hard hard to deal with when you are in a fire fight, mostly when you are surrounded. The game was made to be unforgivable in some ways.\nWhen you try to play wisely, you get into cover and you try to step a little bit outside of your cover in a way that the AI doesn't really see you and then you shoot. ... or you try to stay in front of the enemies, hoping that you will kill everyone before you die. Good luck if they have decent weaponry. It's not impossible and it's still a lot of fun.\nYou can only shoot and walk with the UZI or pistol, every big weapons are used as if you were a turret which is kind of annoying sometimes but the bullet effects are eye candy though. It's always fun to make your own justice anyway.\n\nI don't have a lot of negative to say about this game.\nMost negative points would come from a comparison with the futur games which wouldn't be fair at all.\nEvery futur installments added stuff to what GTA3 was. GTA3 doesn't lack stuff, it's just the next games that are even better than what was this awesome game.\n\nThere's obviously some glitches and bugs since it's a first attempt at a 3D game but nothing gamebreaking.\nA problem I had was that the game version I have was censored for whatever reason.\nI'm not from a country renowned to ban such games and I bought the game in the official Rockstar Pack with every other GTA games directly on Steam. The problem is well known though so yeah, there's not a lot of things more to say about his.\n\nTo end this straight : GTA3 is a classic, it's a game that you must own if you understand what gaming is all about and if it's your kind of game to start with. Give it a try with an open mind! Feel the year 2001.","April 1, 2015","true","31.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Remastered from its birds eye view version, this game was a unique for its time. The controls are a bit finicky as the camera is automatic and makes it difficult to drive, however, after a few hours you do get used to it. A tip to people who want to use gamepads, you may wish to assign your buttons before you start playing as the controller support is very limited. the story is like any other GTA game, going to blips and talking to different mob bosses till you reach that final enemy. This game is particularly interesting after you play San Andreas as there a  lot of tie-ins with that  story. This games story is particularly short compared to other GTA games taking about 8-12 hours to complete for the average player. I would recommend this game for people who want to have the full franchise experience.\n6/10","February 22","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought it on steam just so i own another version of the game and to speedrun through it for the 100th time.\nPutting my biased opinion aside this game is nowhere near as good as vice city and san andreas. The story is not as good, the characters are not as memorable or interesting and the missions themselves are more varied and offer a lot more then gta 3.\nVice city and san andreas are easily 10/10 games to me, even though i want to i can't logically give gta 3 a 10 because there is no denying that the others are better. Its also a very short game if you are just focusing on the missions there isn't much to do outside of missions anyway. It will obviously take you longer to beat on your first playthrough the later missions can be very frustrating and difficult to new players.\n9/10 (Amazing)","February 11","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was a great game and still is.\n\nI don't recommend this game on steam because it is a terrible port and the controls are wonky. Also there are some pretty major graphical discrepancies between the PS2 version and the PC version. The PC version got a massive graphical downgrade compared to the PS2 version... I know it might be odd to some people in 2015 but PC gaming hardware back then (when the game was released) wasn't what it is today with the whole PC Master concept, back then PC gaming hardware was inferior to the consoles, so the developers downgraded the graphics and mechanics so that people's computers would not catch fire and blow up.\n\nSo unless they go back fix the terrible controls, and add features they had previously removed in the PC version to accommodate the new hardware, I wouldn't recommend this version of the game to anyone.\n\nI recommend GTA 3, just not this steam version.","August 29, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LazyAsFuq/recommended/12100/","LazyAsFuq","NoLimit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LazyAsFuq/","146 products in account","The game that shaped open-world games and gave us a standard for future upcoming third person shooters. From at modern look, yes this game is pretty limited, and probably doesn't show a whole lot, but back then it did. I couldn't believe this was the same game I played on PS1 (GTA 1&2). The world was absolutely huge and it felt like you could almost do anything without any limitations. You obviously have to complete the missions, but who did that? Keep in mind I was very young, and I could spend hours making up my own stories in the game, without the missions. Going back and playing this game is much different - in a good way. I don't play, just to play. I play for the missions.\n\nConsidering this game was their first 3D game, the controls are pretty sick. I mean it's so crisp, smooth and responsive that I wonder why they never went back to this. It's incredible how well it actually holds up. It's also aged very well compared to even newer games. I thought it was impressive back then but don't I really the think the city itself has aged well, simply because of the dull colors. Same story as GTA IV. It's so depressing to look at and there's just not much you can do. There are a few building you can go through, but it's mostly just shops and a toilet. (used for missions)\n\nMission wise I always thought they were a lot harder than Vice City and San Andreas. Maybe, it's because it's not my most played game. The game doesn't offer checkpoints, so if you fail the mission it's back to square one. I personally never really minded that, but I know it's a problem for some people.\n\nI love to go back this game now and then, just because of the nostalgia. It never really got its claws on me since I was always more a Vice City type of guy and Vice City is just more visual beautiful compared to this. I still think GTA 3 is fun, and if you can take your mind back 2001 you'll be satisfied.","April 22","true","13.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's no real variety to the way in which missions can be approached--you have to try and die and restart multiple times to discover the way in which the game wants you to complete a mission.\n\nThe mechanics are still relatively smooth and work well, save for some weapon gripes such as the grenades which can't be aimed accurately and only thrown blindly. The graphics and sound are dated but not terrible and the game's gritty atmosphere holds up.\n\nCertainly no longer as amazing as it once was, but it's a decent game.","April 23","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rossco1337/recommended/12100/","rossco1337","Rossco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rossco1337/","463 products in account","Open-world classic that inspired dozens of clones and made Rockstar one of the most successful developers of all time.\n\nHowever, the PC port of this game was poor on release and it's aged like milk. I've made a list of problems and solutions I had while getting it running:\n\nGame launch crashesI had a lot of trouble getting this game to launch in Win10. I had to use both SilentPatch and the DDraw patch  found here[www.gtagarage.com] to get past the Unhandled Exception c0000005 error and crash after the intro movie. EDIT: These patches also fix a bug where menu text is either invisible or very faded.\n\nPhysics tied to FPSThis is one of those old games where physics are tied to framerate. If you turn off the 30FPS limiter, car friction, jumping and running up stairs are totally broken. This is one of those things where someone at Rockstar could fix it in an afternoon but it's still broken after all these years. As far as I know, there's no mod or patch to fix this. You can limit the game to 60 with a graphics driver tool but the physics problems are still there.\n\nBroken HUDThe HUD doesn't scale well for widescreen. There's a "widescreen" option in the graphics menu but it doesn't work. You need to use a community fix  found here[thirteenag.github.io] to get the game to look as expected at resolutions like 1080p (or anything bigger than 1024x768).\n\nDark CarsThe Steam version of the game has a bug where lighting doesn't affect cars if you're running it on a modern version of Windows. The SilentPatch I linked earlier fixes this bug, but the widescreen patch I linked breaks it again. The best way to fix this bug is adding  this mod[gtaforums.com].\n\nController inputGTA3 has decent support for DirectInput controls and that's good enough for me. There's plenty of people with Xinput controllers though. San Andreas recently got a patch to support them but GTA3 hasn't had that patch yet despite using the same engine.  Here[www.gtagarage.com] is a mod that adds support along with the correct HUD buttons.\n\nY-axis sensitivity bugIf you change mouse sensitivity in game (which everyone would, since it's designed for monitors with like 8 DPI), it only changes the X sensitivity while leaving the Y axis to go wild.  Here[github.com] is a patch to fix that bug.\n\nRestore PS2 enhancementsThis one isn't a big issue (I don't use it) but this game was designed to take advantage of the PS2's hardware with stuff like real-time car reflections. They couldn't be bothered to port any of these enhancements to the PC version but there is a mod that restores PS2-like graphics to the game  here.[gtaforums.com] (Read the instructions though!)\n\n100% completion checklistIf you're a completionist, the in-game stats aren't useful at all. A member of the community made a 100% checklist that hooks the game (download here[www.dropbox.com]) and tells you what you still need to do if you're trying to complete the game 100%.\n\nNo in-game mapAnother not-huge issue but something to keep in mind before playing. As  Rockstar support[support.rockstargames.com] points out, their huge game with 3 different islands has no in-game map, so you either have to memorise where everything is or follow their suggestion and print out a map like it's 1999.\n\nIntro skippingJust a final tip to top everything off, once you've got the game running you can delete the "movies" directory from the install folder and it'll no longer play the intro movies. A little nugget that will save you a few seconds after spending 20 minutes or more getting the game running.\n\nI do love this game but I can't honestly recommend GTA3 to anyone until they fix some of these issues.","January 24","false","15.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","6","14","2","0"

But I do know the significance of this game which is why I gave it a go.\n\nShort version: I love it on the PS2!\n\nKinda long version:\nI couldn't play this game as it is on Steam. The control schemes are too wonky and rebinding them is way more difficult than it should be. I'm not completely new to PC gaming but I've only really been at it for a year or two, so maybe it's my own shortcomings. That said, the console version is way more managable as far as controls and movement, so much so that I stopped noticing how aged the game looks.\n\nIf you're trying III, Vice City & San Andreas for the first time, I'd recommond a console version first. They're a pioneer of open-world sandbox games as we know them and there's a ton of great little details in every game. But if you're like me and grew up with a controller instead of a computer, this is one of those game where it makes a huge difference.","January 4","false","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Good in every ways, it reminds me many great moments related to an amazing atmosphere/story, awesome soundtrack.\n\n\nBut frankly when you return to this one, it's horrible.\n\nSo many things are difficult to tolerate, like the lack of map to find important locations (many times i've been searching for hospital in vain... and it's an exemple), horrible physics where you can fail a job because you car turned upside-down due to a carton box. Missions without appropriate briefing (Exemple: the Mafia asks you to kills some Triad Warlords and at the end you have to find a fish van... the problem you have 2 or 3 types of fish vans...).\nOr, something weird, when you go to Liberty City down town (well in fact you stay there around 2/3 of the game), you see some Triad gangs in cleaner suits shooting at you on sight even if you drive a Firefighter truck... as if you wrote MAFIA THUG on your face/ vehicle.\n\n\nSo even if some games on Steam are very old, i still buy them to remember their uniq aspects they represented in their time.\nLike the first Quake games wich are still very cool and keep entertaining even today, or reworked oldies such as Strifer: Veteran edition, and many others.\n\nTo Conclude :\n\nMaybe i will finish GTA III when they will do some kind of "polishing" on it.\nBut frankly my First GTA experience in 3D was and will stay: GTA Vice City.\nBeautifull, Fun, Cool and just unforgettable.\n\nAnd the funny thing that nobody says about GTA III is that the hero never talks....\nContrary to Tommy Versetti  in Vice City, who is one of the best characters the franchise has.\nLike so many like Ken Rosenberg, Tommy's lawyer who appears in San-Andreas with Kent Paul.\n\n\nEven the soundtrack is boring, like Razlow on GTA III who works in a debate radio and in Vice City he is a crazy 80's Rock radio presenter !\n\nNostalgia can be painfull some times and GTA III is painfull...\ngo play Vice City instead !\n\n\nN.B: My play time doesn't show my experience because i played offline for quite a long time.\nAnd i think i will review Vice City after that.","April 26, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spartan132/recommended/12100/","spartan132","Ed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spartan132/","146 products in account","This game blew me away back when it was new, only because it was 3D. It was cool seeing the world in a new 3D perspective rather than a top-down 2D view. But my recent playthrough of this game made me realize that this game suffers from quite a few problems that makes the game almost unplayable past the 2nd half. The first thing you will notice is that you do not have a map. You actually have to look up a map on the internet if you need it. All you have to help you navigate is your minimap. Which would be fine, but nothing useful is marked on it (Like the gunstore and pay n spray). So with no overhead map, or markers on your minimap (Your safehouse and missions are marked). Navigating the city can be difficult, especially to new players. There is no GPS or anything else to help you here. All you can do is memorize your way around the old fashioned way.\n\nAnother issue is the AI. The enemy AI in this game is very unfair, especially on the later missions. You can be driving around minding your own business or on a mission. Then enemy gangs instantly open fire on you regardless of what car you're driving or if you're on a mission. How do they know where I am at all times and what car I'm in? I just stole a new car and they instantly know its me. They don't even have to be facing you, you just see their arms lock onto you and start shooting. That means your car will always take damage even if you don't crash into things. (They start to carry more heavy weaponary later game, so expect some cheap deaths while driving)\n\nLet's talk about the vehicles. They don't feel like metal cars, they feel like some paper mache creation my little brother made in 3rd grade. The cars are not durable. The cars in GTA and GTAII felt more solid than this. If you can't keep yourself on the road and not hit traffic (And not get shot at all the time) then you are going to have a huge problem keeping your vehicle, especially if it's a sports car. They handle okay for the most part, although some of the vehicles feel like you're driving on ice.\n\nThe weapons in this game are cool, but there's 1 gun in particular that made me almost throw my controller through my wall. It's the Carbine Rifle (M16) While this gun is probably the best in the game, it will be your death on the 2nd half of the game. Remember the unfair AI? Well, imagine several of them gunning down your little paper mache car with M16's while you're trying to beat a mission. It's a nightmare. The M16 shoots very fast. I was able to blow up a fully repaired sports car with only 16 bullets from the 60 round magazine. You can also be killed by about half a clip of ammo from it with full armor and health. Sometimes you can't even react fast enough. You just drop dead and have to reload your save. There's a reason why they changed this gun in the later games, because it's unbalanced and broken.\n\nThe missions can be very difficult at times. Especially the later ones. Most of the missions have either a time limit or a waypoint you have to travel to. SInce you have no map, it's hard to plot the best route to save time. Often times, you'll turn down a wrong turn or a alley with no exit costing you precious time. This game is not generous on mission time either. You can't mess around. You have to be quick to do what it wants. The missions on the first half of the game are not bad. A couple might be a little hard, but for the most part it's okay. But as soon as you start to work for Donald Love, that's when the ♥♥♥♥ starts to hit the fan.... And it stinks. I think his missions were the hardest in the game. His and Asuka's. *Shudders*\n\nThe soundtrack is also unimpressive. GTA is known for having pretty good soundtracks. When I first played this game, I didn't even know that the songs ingame were actually real. I thought they were just made for the game, if that can tell you anything.\n\nI think the metascore of 93/100 (Higher than GTA IV which got a score of 90) is a little too generous. I'd give it a 6/10.\n\nIf you're new to GTA and wanna start with the older ones, I do not recommend you start with this one. I recommend you start with either Vice City, or San Andreas. Both are excellent games. (And guess what! The main character actually talks in those games. Wow!)\n\n\n\nAlthough if you do actually decide to play this one, don't be afraid of using the cheat codes for those unfair later missions. Flip those unfair AI the bird with a rocket launcher. ┌∩┐(◣_◢)┌∩┐","January 21, 2014","false","25.2"," 18 of 44 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","18","44","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatguywiththegames/recommended/12100/","thatguywiththegames","Titanshark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatguywiththegames/","134 products in account","A solid start to an amazing franchise. However, this game does not hold up too well in 2014. Easily the shortest GTA game clocking in at 14 hrs with full mission completion. While it may have been revolutionary in 2001, it pales it comparison to later titles in the series. The characters can be best described as one note and underwritten. Claude is easily the least compelling protagonist not just in the GTA franchise, but in gaming in general. Having him silently take orders and essentially betraying anyone and everyone, the story leaves off with most gangs in Liberty City hating you. Rather than rise to the top of the criminal pyramid, Claude elects instead to kill and betray anyone at the slightest suggestion.\n\nThe controls for driving and shooting are solid, especially on PC. However, any mission involving AI can become frustrating very quickly. Some missions feel completely unrealistic and contrived, with fail states that can only be described as nonsensical. Most of this game's length can be accounted for by repeatedly failing some of the tougher missions. In almost all the firefights, the enemies simply camp around a corner and wait for their cheap shot. Death can come from myriad unfair game mechanics and can lead to some genuine frustration that is not to be found in later titles.\n\nIf you are interested in the GTA franchise, this is not the place to start. I would recommend Vice City, San Andreas, or GTA IV. These games boast far better AI as well as much MUCH better stories and characters.\n\n7/10","August 18, 2014","false","21.0"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","1"

If I consider how I felt when I first picked up the game when it was released, it was a total breath of fresh air to the gaming market and redefined the much taken for granted ‘sandbox’ genre. Graphically impressive with a fluid control system, the gaming world seemed huge with endless activities to do and a thrilling narrative populated by great characters. Although some of these aspects still remain true, I would honestly suggest remaining with fond memories of this game as opposed to trying to relive its glory, as out of the three PS2 GTA games (III, Vice City and SA) it has aged extremely badly (by far the worst) and is only just about playable.\n\nThe main issues are the controls and the targeting system. Much like other gamers, I am accustomed to using a controller for the GTA series. Although it can be difficult, it is possible to get your PS3/Xbox controller to work in sync with this game, however the thought of having to map the controls or download specific programmes yourself may put gamers off from the offset. If you get past this hurdle, you’ll notice that targeting in the game is extremely difficult. There is not an ‘auto-lock’ target option, which is highly inconvenient and makes missions that involved killing enemies who can target you very easily frustrating. Aiming with rifles is obviously manual, but to point a tiny aim reticule using the right analogue stick/mouse at a cartel enemy gunning you down from 5 yards is nearly impossible, meaning that you have to take out most enemies from range using the sniper rifle or grenades/rocket launcher. When the action is so fast paced and often in close proximity to the protagonist, it’s very easy to fail a mission because you couldn’t kill an enemy at point blank range.\n\nAlthough it is not apparent at first, the lack of a map is also a frustration. You do have a mini-map, but if you want a more global view of where you need to be, or where the closest ammunition store is, it really is a case of drive around and hope. During several missions, the enemy/location markers span all three islands and it can be confusing where to go, or at least, where the quickest route is (as many missions are timed), if you cannot get a global map view. If this happens during several missions, you will quickly get fed up with the experience and quit prematurely.\n\nThe graphics are still acceptable, especially since we consider that this game was released over a decade ago. The main aspect of the game that is never lost is the humour and pop culture satire, which may make the game playing in itself. The radio stations in particular are still hilarious to listen to, Chatterbox and the commercials specifically. If you can get the game cheap enough on a sale, perhaps just reliving some of Lazlo’s best lines would be enough to justify the purchase.\n\nThe gaming world compared with any game in the last five years is tiny. It should be noted however that I thought this was a huge game in scope when it was released, however the whole main storyline can be completed relatively swiftly, barring any mission fails based on the bad targeting/map system. The three main islands can be driven across in the matter of minutes, yet on a positive note the vehicles still seem varied enough to make the process fresh and enjoyable. However, it does of course seem limited in comparison to its sequels. Furthermore, vechiles that we may consider certainties in Vice City and SA such as bikes, flyable planes (the Dodo does not count) and fast boats are void here, and the lack of a mission ‘replay’ option that was so well received in later instalments is obviously non-existent in GTA III.\n\nIt is very difficult to click the ‘do not recommend’ option for this game as it offers so many good memories combined with great humour, however it is better to remember this game how it was. Other than for a quick nostalgia trip, the gameplay missions are tiresome since they have been done and done better since the newer instalments of GTA, so many of them have been done a hundred times before. That, combined with difficult controls and no larger map, means that this game has sadly not stood the test of time. It is important to remember of course that GTA III redefined these sorts of missions and gameplay style and should be celebrated as a landmark game, however I’m not sure if playing this game start to finish will give gamers much joy.\n\nThanks for reading this review and all comments are welcome.

However after getting a controller, the setup is really bad and takes hours to map the right buttons to the right directions.  Example, you can't turn and move forward.  Turning the camera is separate from turning the person.  This means in a fight, you are locked into one view of the action and then you have to aim from that view while the target can move all around you.  You end up shooting at stuff that is behind you.

Most of my problems are related to Windows 8 not properly running it, not the game itself.\n(TL;DR? go to the end)\n\nThe game starts you off as a silent criminal who just got free from a prisoner transport and looks for work. Eventually, a mob guy named Luigi helps you out and you work your way up. I won't get into the rest because I know most people have played it. I mean, it's even on phones. The story, though simple, is great.\n\nThe missions are a blast, some are super short driving tasks, others are all out adventures. None of them are too long and are great for killing time if you got 30-45 minutes to spare.\n\nSome of the best moments are when you're simply trying to end a mission, but manage to get stuck with 4+ stars on your wanted level. Can't end the job? Well, killing off cops and raming through their forces in hopes to lose them or hide is incredibly fun. Thrilling I would go as far as to say.\n\nWith the exception of the horrible looking people, this game actually doesn't look too bad. Even though it came out in the early 2000's.\n\nThe controls could be better, as could gamepad support, but some tweaking fixes it.\n\nAs for the soundtrack, it could be better. Vice City has a better one, and I'm saying that as someone that doesn't really like 80's music.\n\nAs for how this game runs, oh god, if you're on Windows 8... It is hell.\n\nWindows 8/8.1 users beware: The game will crash, with only about a 2 out of 10 chance of making it past the R* logo. Because the W8 developers had this "wonderful" idea of "out with the old, in with the new" games that were made from this era tend to not work. It could be worse, I mean at least it occasionally runs. But seriously microsoft, Windows 10 better run this game, or I'm buying the classics version on PS3. I already supported Rockstar and Valve by buying it here, and I'm going to support Sony next. But not you, MS. Fix windows and let me play my damn game. It's not like I'm buying this on Xbox, so if that was your plan with making Windows 8 without 16/32-bit program support, you guys are pretty freaking stupid. Hell, this game even runs on Mac and iPhones!  F***ing Mac and iPhones!\n\nTL;DR:  Buy this game if you're not using Windows 8.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamakei/recommended/12100/","hamakei","Hamakei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamakei/","1098 products in account","I played the first two games when they came out. The second was pretty much identical to the first except for the "loyalty" system and has been largely forgotten but never mind. They were fun games, and whilst they weren't the first to let you be the bad guy, it was somewhat satisfying the way the city seemed to work around you to clear up your mess and try to restore the status quo. Unfortunately however I never actually finished either of them because there didn't seem to be much progression. Yes, you'd get a new map to play on every now and then, and some of the missions could be done in different orders, but there wasn't much personality. The missions were just a means to an end - namely collecting enough cash to move on to the next level.\n\nUltimately I think they could have been largely forgotten in years to come, save for the "controversy" aspect.\n\nThen this gem came along. Rather than just moving the same games into a 3D environment, the game has been designed entirely from scratch. It might as well have been called something different for all the similarity it has to it's predecessors. Not only do we have full voice acting by many household names which flesh out the characters and add that much needed personality, but the city itself feels far more alive and real than ever before.\n\nCorners are no longer all at 90 degrees, there are literally hundreds of bonuses, secrets and extra missions you can do on the side whenever you want, you can backtrack at any point to visit previous areas of the game and see what's changed (although be careful of straying into the wrong neighbourhood if you've been upsetting people), full radio stations with a good selection of licensed music (and the ability to play your own MP3s on the PC version - nice touch), fully working public transit systems and a fascinating storyline of betrayal, loyalty and trust make this something that has to be played by everybody, no matter what your view on the violence aspect. Come on. Even if you don't want to complete the missions themselves you can spend hours just riding a taxi around town. Yes, this game even managed to make "Crazy Taxi" almost entirely redundant.\n\nWhilst many people could argue (and with good cause) that the later games in the series such as Vice City and 4 are better in nearly every way, for me this will always be my favourite simply because it was such a welcome surprise - were it not for 3 then GTA wouldn't be the multi-million dollar franchise it is today.","November 16, 2014","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll encounter ton of hilarious banter/dialogue as you build influence and respect in Liberty City. This game ranks a little higher in difficulty than some others in the series at times, and features a nice variety of missions.

Then spattering them on the sidewalk, hopping out of your car and taking your money back, plus whatever else she might have made that night? Hours of childhood-ending fun!\n\nThis friggin game is the reason I spent weekend after weekend at a friend’s house waiting my turn to see how long I could make my murderspree rampages last. After moving out of state, I managed to get my own PS2 and my very own copy of …Kingdom Hearts. That was the end of my GTA3 addiction until I saw the GTA collection on sale for 10 dollars. GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas, GTA4 and its expansions all for 10 dollars. TOO BAD I FRIGGIN MISSED THE SALE. But seeing that sale, and the release of GTA5, made me want to go back through the not top-down GTA games. So I paid $10 for GTA3 and I only kind of regret it, because, seriously, why is this ten dollars? It’s a fourteen year old game that has to be modded to work with widescreen resolutions. The damn crosshair that you see on the screen isn’t even where you’re going to actually shoot. You can find the mod here on the community forums, and it’s an easy fix, but really. The UI doesn’t even scale to the resolution that you set in-game. It’s like Rockstar said, “Hey, it works enough, so, well, ♥♥♥♥ ‘em. Mods.”\n\nBefore the real review, I think the most important thing to mention is that the system requirements don’t mention Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 8.1. It works for my Windows 7 Frankenstein-like machine, but as an indication of how seriously you should take that statement, Saints Row 2 ran like a champ for this computer. So, you know, if you buy this and you can’t get it to run, its right there on the store page. Same place as every other game on Steam.\n\nThe out of the box controls for this game are terrible. Sprint is the right shift key. Movement is WASD, and sprint is set to the right shift key. Think about that for a moment. The go faster button. It’s on the other side of the keyboard, and unless you have ♥♥♥♥ing E.T. fingers you’re only going to be briskly jogging from the cops and enemy gangsters. Shooting things feels weird, even after fixing the crosshair with a mod. It feels like I have to really concentrate to properly spray a Chinese stereotype/gangster with my rifle.\n\nDriving is pretty good in this game. Different cars handle in different ways, and maybe, when you first install the game, they’ll all be painted dark colors! But it’s okay, because there’s a mod for that, too! You’ll have you shiny, hooker-squishing car in no time at all! You can’t move the camera with the mouse though. I really wish I could swing the camera around with the mouse instead of using Q and E to look left and right, respectively.\n\nThe one thing I’ve noticed is how hard the game is. I have died a lot. Your guy is just a guy in this game. None of that bulletsponge crap here. You lose 10hp if you get punched, and you only have 100, unless you find armor somewhere, but even then if you get surrounded or find yourself in the open where you can’t funnel badguys towards you, you’re going to die quickly. I totally understand now why Young Me used cheats. But this makes for a challenge, and challenging games are satisfying games.\n\nAnd GTA3 is a satisfying game. Most of the missions in this game are presented in a “here’s whacha gotta do, now go do it” manner, letting you decide how to complete them. For example, one mission had me assassinating a gang boss. For the first assassination attempt, I waited outside the building in my car, intending to run into the guy’s car so much it would blow up. That worked poorly. My car was flipped over after the gangsters turned the tables and came after me, and since there’s no moving-car bail out in this game, I couldn’t get out in time before the car exploded. Round two consisted of me aiming a sniper rifle at the alleyway the boss would be coming out of. A bat-wielding rival gang member snuck up behind me and bashed my skull in. For the third attempt, I ended up standing on top of a car in a different, rival-free location, aiming at the same alleyway. This almost didn’t work out because some d-bag AI driver in a gray van decided to drive up on the sidewalk and slam into my car. I got into position only just in time to miss the first shot, then take the guy’s leg off, completing the mission. That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ satisfaction, right there.\n\nGTA3’s graphics, in my opinion have held up pretty good. They don’t have a zillion polygons and there aren’t any bare boobs (which is good, because characters don’t have a zillion polygons), but the game looks pretty damn decent after all these years. You’ll never be wondering what something is, and you can actually read a pretty good amount of the street signs, which is how I managed to find my way between the first and second islands during Yakuza missions. Because there’s no map. You can’t pause and go, “Oh, there I am!”\n\nIf you haven’t played GTA3 ever, then playing it now might be a strange experience, considering how much this genre has changed. I wouldn't say GTA3 is "dated," but the things I’ve taken for granted in the Saints Row games and later GTA titles aren’t present in GTA3, and this sometimes ruins the experience, like simply not being able to rotate the camera while in a vehicle. After a while I've gotten used to the "old ways," but you might not.\n\nIf there’s anything truly worth the absolutely insane $10 price tag, it’s the soundtrack. Chatterbox has been the soundtrack to so many people being murdered on the sidewalk, and even though I’ve heard that station repeat itself over and over, I can still listen to Lazlow interview Fernando about New Beginnings (Cinco-cinco-cinco, nueve-dos, nueve-dos), or that karate hippy break his hand.\n\nEven with all the old-game, crap-port issues, I’m having all sorts of fun going back through this game that sucked up so much of my time and absolutely annihilated what innocence was left when it was released.","April 23, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second was pretty much identical to the first except for the "loyalty" system and has been largely forgotten but never mind. They were fun games, and whilst they weren't the first to let you be the bad guy, it was somewhat satisfying the way the city seemed to work around you to clear up your mess and try to restore the status quo. Unfortunately however I never actually finished either of them because there didn't seem to be much progression. Yes, you'd get a new map to play on every now and then, and some of the missions could be done in different orders, but there wasn't much personality. The missions were just a means to an end - namely collecting enough cash to move on to the next level.\n\nUltimately I think they could have been largely forgotten in years to come, save for the "controversy" aspect.\n\nThen this gem came along. Rather than just moving the same games into a 3D environment, the game has been designed entirely from scratch. It might as well have been called something different for all the similarity it has to it's predecessors. Not only do we have full voice acting by many household names which flesh out the characters and add that much needed personality, but the city itself feels far more alive and real than ever before.\n\nCorners are no longer all at 90 degrees, there are literally hundreds of bonuses, secrets and extra missions you can do on the side whenever you want, you can backtrack at any point to visit previous areas of the game and see what's changed (although be careful of straying into the wrong neighbourhood if you've been upsetting people), full radio stations with a good selection of licensed music (and the ability to play your own MP3s on the PC version - nice touch), fully working public transit systems and a fascinating storyline of betrayal, loyalty and trust make this something that has to be played by everybody, no matter what your view on the violence aspect. Come on. Even if you don't want to complete the missions themselves you can spend hours just riding a taxi around town. Yes, this game even managed to make "Crazy Taxi" almost entirely redundant.\n\nWhilst many people could argue (and with good cause) that the later games in the series such as Vice City and 4 are better in nearly every way, for me this will always be my favourite simply because it was such a welcome surprise - were it not for 3 then GTA wouldn't be the multi-million dollar franchise it is today.","November 16, 2014","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of my problems are related to Windows 8 not properly running it, not the game itself.\n(TL;DR? go to the end)\n\nThe game starts you off as a silent criminal who just got free from a prisoner transport and looks for work. Eventually, a mob guy named Luigi helps you out and you work your way up. I won't get into the rest because I know most people have played it. I mean, it's even on phones. The story, though simple, is great.\n\nThe missions are a blast, some are super short driving tasks, others are all out adventures. None of them are too long and are great for killing time if you got 30-45 minutes to spare.\n\nSome of the best moments are when you're simply trying to end a mission, but manage to get stuck with 4+ stars on your wanted level. Can't end the job? Well, killing off cops and raming through their forces in hopes to lose them or hide is incredibly fun. Thrilling I would go as far as to say.\n\nWith the exception of the horrible looking people, this game actually doesn't look too bad. Even though it came out in the early 2000's.\n\nThe controls could be better, as could gamepad support, but some tweaking fixes it.\n\nAs for the soundtrack, it could be better. Vice City has a better one, and I'm saying that as someone that doesn't really like 80's music.\n\nAs for how this game runs, oh god, if you're on Windows 8... It is hell.\n\nWindows 8/8.1 users beware: The game will crash, with only about a 2 out of 10 chance of making it past the R* logo. Because the W8 developers had this "wonderful" idea of "out with the old, in with the new" games that were made from this era tend to not work. It could be worse, I mean at least it occasionally runs. But seriously microsoft, Windows 10 better run this game, or I'm buying the classics version on PS3. I already supported Rockstar and Valve by buying it here, and I'm going to support Sony next. But not you, MS. Fix windows and let me play my damn game. It's not like I'm buying this on Xbox, so if that was your plan with making Windows 8 without 16/32-bit program support, you guys are pretty freaking stupid. Hell, this game even runs on Mac and iPhones!  F***ing Mac and iPhones!\n\nTL;DR:  Buy this game if you're not using Windows 8.

You'll encounter ton of hilarious banter/dialogue as you build influence and respect in Liberty City.

So I will describe only the biggest advantage and disadvantage which can relate to today's gaming world as the up-to-date.\n\nThe best thing about this game? The radio stations! They are in my opinion the biggest pros of this game - based on real tracks and with humorous caller talks and adverts they create very immersive feeling of in-game world, which still in present times is the factor that allows us to overcome the harshness of the angular Liberty City. Sadly they are very short even if you sum up all stations. However K-Jah radio made me to love the Scientist's dubs before I even know that music genre even exists.\n\nThe biggest drawback even in those days was our nameless (or his name was Claude – I don't remember) and speechless character himself. Introductions to the missions weren't that big a thing years ago but now they feel tragically short and emotionless – as well as lack of noticeable repercussions of our actions other than some folks shooting at us when we pass by. The main story is very dull – if of course we can say there is any.\n\nVery clumsy nowadays this game however was one big step into 3D arcade world. After hours spent with GTA I and II it was really cool for the fans of Grand Theft Auto to finally see the sky or drive something more than flat pixel model which pretended to be a car. Each subsequent part of the GTA game series surpasses it in every aspect – but without this part there would not be GTA in the form we know today.","April 1, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second was pretty much identical to the first except for the "loyalty" system and has been largely forgotten but never mind. They were fun games, and whilst they weren't the first to let you be the bad guy, it was somewhat satisfying the way the city seemed to work around you to clear up your mess and try to restore the status quo. Unfortunately however I never actually finished either of them because there didn't seem to be much progression. Yes, you'd get a new map to play on every now and then, and some of the missions could be done in different orders, but there wasn't much personality. The missions were just a means to an end - namely collecting enough cash to move on to the next level.\n\nUltimately I think they could have been largely forgotten in years to come, save for the "controversy" aspect.\n\nThen this gem came along. Rather than just moving the same games into a 3D environment, the game has been designed entirely from scratch. It might as well have been called something different for all the similarity it has to it's predecessors. Not only do we have full voice acting by many household names which flesh out the characters and add that much needed personality, but the city itself feels far more alive and real than ever before.\n\nCorners are no longer all at 90 degrees, there are literally hundreds of bonuses, secrets and extra missions you can do on the side whenever you want, you can backtrack at any point to visit previous areas of the game and see what's changed (although be careful of straying into the wrong neighbourhood if you've been upsetting people), full radio stations with a good selection of licensed music (and the ability to play your own MP3s on the PC version - nice touch), fully working public transit systems and a fascinating storyline of betrayal, loyalty and trust make this something that has to be played by everybody, no matter what your view on the violence aspect. Come on. Even if you don't want to complete the missions themselves you can spend hours just riding a taxi around town. Yes, this game even managed to make "Crazy Taxi" almost entirely redundant.\n\nWhilst many people could argue (and with good cause) that the later games in the series such as Vice City and 4 are better in nearly every way, for me this will always be my favourite simply because it was such a welcome surprise - were it not for 3 then GTA wouldn't be the multi-million dollar franchise it is today.","November 16, 2014","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One fix I found, and this applies to GTA Vice City and San Andreas as well, is to ENABLE Vsync.  The games aren't really meant to be played at today's ridiculously high framerates, and as such, this can fix a lot of timing and control related issues.\n\nBut if you can get it to run, just, holy crap.  There is elegance in this game's design and relative simplicity compared to the later entries that makes it enthralling like few other games out there.  IMHO, it still holds up extremely well, even compared to it's sequels.\n\nEven if this game doesn't work, you can ask Steam for a refund, then use that money to get the PS2 version for like $2 new on Amazon or something.  It won't be AS good as this version, but it'll still be an amazing experience.  So yes, I recommend this game.","November 21, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmelvin/recommended/12100/","mmelvin","Jesus Crust!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmelvin/","101 products in account","Holy freaking God, Grand Theft Auto III. My favorite thing about this game was driving on the sidewalk. Picking up hookers and watching the car bounce as your health meter filled back up? Then spattering them on the sidewalk, hopping out of your car and taking your money back, plus whatever else she might have made that night? Hours of childhood-ending fun!\n\nThis friggin game is the reason I spent weekend after weekend at a friend’s house waiting my turn to see how long I could make my murderspree rampages last. After moving out of state, I managed to get my own PS2 and my very own copy of …Kingdom Hearts. That was the end of my GTA3 addiction until I saw the GTA collection on sale for 10 dollars. GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas, GTA4 and its expansions all for 10 dollars. TOO BAD I FRIGGIN MISSED THE SALE. But seeing that sale, and the release of GTA5, made me want to go back through the not top-down GTA games. So I paid $10 for GTA3 and I only kind of regret it, because, seriously, why is this ten dollars? It’s a fourteen year old game that has to be modded to work with widescreen resolutions. The damn crosshair that you see on the screen isn’t even where you’re going to actually shoot. You can find the mod here on the community forums, and it’s an easy fix, but really. The UI doesn’t even scale to the resolution that you set in-game. It’s like Rockstar said, “Hey, it works enough, so, well, ♥♥♥♥ ‘em. Mods.”\n\nBefore the real review, I think the most important thing to mention is that the system requirements don’t mention Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 8.1. It works for my Windows 7 Frankenstein-like machine, but as an indication of how seriously you should take that statement, Saints Row 2 ran like a champ for this computer. So, you know, if you buy this and you can’t get it to run, its right there on the store page. Same place as every other game on Steam.\n\nThe out of the box controls for this game are terrible. Sprint is the right shift key. Movement is WASD, and sprint is set to the right shift key. Think about that for a moment. The go faster button. It’s on the other side of the keyboard, and unless you have ♥♥♥♥ing E.T. fingers you’re only going to be briskly jogging from the cops and enemy gangsters. Shooting things feels weird, even after fixing the crosshair with a mod. It feels like I have to really concentrate to properly spray a Chinese stereotype/gangster with my rifle.\n\nDriving is pretty good in this game. Different cars handle in different ways, and maybe, when you first install the game, they’ll all be painted dark colors! But it’s okay, because there’s a mod for that, too! You’ll have you shiny, hooker-squishing car in no time at all! You can’t move the camera with the mouse though. I really wish I could swing the camera around with the mouse instead of using Q and E to look left and right, respectively.\n\nThe one thing I’ve noticed is how hard the game is. I have died a lot. Your guy is just a guy in this game. None of that bulletsponge crap here. You lose 10hp if you get punched, and you only have 100, unless you find armor somewhere, but even then if you get surrounded or find yourself in the open where you can’t funnel badguys towards you, you’re going to die quickly. I totally understand now why Young Me used cheats. But this makes for a challenge, and challenging games are satisfying games.\n\nAnd GTA3 is a satisfying game. Most of the missions in this game are presented in a “here’s whacha gotta do, now go do it” manner, letting you decide how to complete them. For example, one mission had me assassinating a gang boss. For the first assassination attempt, I waited outside the building in my car, intending to run into the guy’s car so much it would blow up. That worked poorly. My car was flipped over after the gangsters turned the tables and came after me, and since there’s no moving-car bail out in this game, I couldn’t get out in time before the car exploded. Round two consisted of me aiming a sniper rifle at the alleyway the boss would be coming out of. A bat-wielding rival gang member snuck up behind me and bashed my skull in. For the third attempt, I ended up standing on top of a car in a different, rival-free location, aiming at the same alleyway. This almost didn’t work out because some d-bag AI driver in a gray van decided to drive up on the sidewalk and slam into my car. I got into position only just in time to miss the first shot, then take the guy’s leg off, completing the mission. That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ satisfaction, right there.\n\nGTA3’s graphics, in my opinion have held up pretty good. They don’t have a zillion polygons and there aren’t any bare boobs (which is good, because characters don’t have a zillion polygons), but the game looks pretty damn decent after all these years. You’ll never be wondering what something is, and you can actually read a pretty good amount of the street signs, which is how I managed to find my way between the first and second islands during Yakuza missions. Because there’s no map. You can’t pause and go, “Oh, there I am!”\n\nIf you haven’t played GTA3 ever, then playing it now might be a strange experience, considering how much this genre has changed. I wouldn't say GTA3 is "dated," but the things I’ve taken for granted in the Saints Row games and later GTA titles aren’t present in GTA3, and this sometimes ruins the experience, like simply not being able to rotate the camera while in a vehicle. After a while I've gotten used to the "old ways," but you might not.\n\nIf there’s anything truly worth the absolutely insane $10 price tag, it’s the soundtrack. Chatterbox has been the soundtrack to so many people being murdered on the sidewalk, and even though I’ve heard that station repeat itself over and over, I can still listen to Lazlow interview Fernando about New Beginnings (Cinco-cinco-cinco, nueve-dos, nueve-dos), or that karate hippy break his hand.\n\nEven with all the old-game, crap-port issues, I’m having all sorts of fun going back through this game that sucked up so much of my time and absolutely annihilated what innocence was left when it was released.","April 23, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The more barebones plot may put off those coming straight in from narrative-heavy titles, but the plot's never in your face or repetitive. You'll encounter ton of hilarious banter/dialogue as you build influence and respect in Liberty City. This game ranks a little higher in difficulty than some others in the series at times, and features a nice variety of missions.

The 3D, the atmosphere, the A.I, it was all different compared to the first 3 GTA's on the PS1, GTA 1, GTA: London and GTA 2. It really was good for Grand Theft Auto.\nEven if it did originally come out for the PS2, it feels like a PS1 game. Up to San Andreas. But I can't say I have to review just the graphics, but whatever.\n\nThe PC version, however, tends to crash alot. and if you finally get it working, it's... a bit weird to play. The camera feels obnoxious, as it's always stuck to Claude's back, and if you hold the "Look Back" button, Claude looks behind himself, so it's almost impossible to see Claude's face when you're not watching scenes. The same goes for Vice City.\nAgain, along with Vice City. When you're in a vehicle, you cannot move the camera, and when you can you have to use the keyboard to look around; Q and E. To look back, you have to use both or press the mouse wheel.\n\nThe secondary problem is that when you have a keyboard that's as old as the game, you can't press two keys that are one key far away from eachother. So you'd have to use the numpad to look around and that feels awful, bad enough that some keyboards don't even have a numpad so you have to use that USB one, which is pretty hard to get by.\n\nIn conclusion, GTA III is great, just don't try to expect it won't glitch or be weird on the PC.","January 22","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both Vice City and S.A have solid gameplay and story that hold up to this day, this game however does not. Every single critique of this game I have is fixed in Vice City. The story is weak, it’s a revenge tale and yet the main character Claude shows no emotions nor speaks throughout the entire game. You feel empty at the end because it never seemed as if Claude ever cares about anything. You betray characters at a dime for no reason. There is no map, and the mini-map doesn’t tell you where the pay and spray and ammunition are so you have to literally learn the streets. You have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on nothing (except guns but good luck finding the ammunation). There are only 3 hideouts and they all look like ♥♥♥♥, for a millionaire Claude sleeps on the floor on the concrete. Every single gang in the game except one is out to kill you and have laser sharp aim. The camera is terrible and will get you killed. The crosshair is not correctly calibrated, bullets go outside of the circle and to the right in the exact same position always, so it is not a glitch but poor programing. The music is terrible, and theirs only about 3 1/2 hours of radio for a 20 hour game. A single station will only have about 20 minutes or about 5 songs each game so it gets extremely repetitive. The map is sectioned off by three bridges, each island is incredibly small. The reason why this is a problem is that there is no map and the game will have missions where you have to travel across islands against the clock. Since there is no map you will fail missions simply because you can’t find the bridge. Cars die in 5-8 hits. The best way to restore your health is to kill yourself because hookers take too long and finding health power-ups is at best random since there is no map and they are not labeled on the minimap. There is armor in the game but I never in 17 hours found it, not once! The handling of the cars is awful and will get you killed since cars can only take 6-8 hits. I played it to see the story and in all honesty it wasn’t worth it. Stick to Vice City, and SA, they are much better games by far. For 3.50 I feel robbed, maybye 0.99, MAYBYE.","June 25, 2015","false","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both Vice City and S.A have solid gameplay and story that hold up to this day, this game however does not. Every single critique of this game I have is fixed in Vice City. The story is weak, it’s a revenge tale and yet the main character Claude shows no emotions nor speaks throughout the entire game. You feel empty at the end because it never seemed as if Claude ever cares about anything. You betray characters at a dime for no reason. There is no map, and the mini-map doesn’t tell you where the pay and spray and ammunition are so you have to literally learn the streets. You have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on nothing (except guns but good luck finding the ammunation). There are only 3 hideouts and they all look like ♥♥♥♥, for a millionaire Claude sleeps on the floor on the concrete. Every single gang in the game except one is out to kill you and have laser sharp aim. The camera is terrible and will get you killed. The crosshair is not correctly calibrated, bullets go outside of the circle and to the right in the exact same position always, so it is not a glitch but poor programing. The music is terrible, and theirs only about 3 1/2 hours of radio for a 20 hour game. A single station will only have about 20 minutes or about 5 songs each game so it gets extremely repetitive.

Although this journey took a lot of effort, I had enough fun doing this. It gets pretty infuriating sometimes, like the Paramedic mission, but accomplishing nonsense and mafia style missions is what makes this and other GTA series titles so fun.\n\nThings that weren't so funny:\ngetting the collectibles takes a lot of effort, and you can't do this without looking on a map/reading a walktrough. There's no clue (and I think it will be like this on any GTA title) ingame of where said collectibles are. If you wouldn't use a map, you would have to just guess where the hell 100 hidden packages are. As a counterpoint to this negative point, collectibles aren't obligatory, but they make up the trouble you had collecting them by giving you a lot of weapons in your hideout, which makes having weapons easy.\nThe main character doesn't speak;\nyou will get a hell out of money as you play the game, and you don't have anything to do with it. At the advanced stages of the game, even if you didn't collect the hidden packages to have weapons on your hideout, you'll have enough money to buy as many weapons as you want, paint as many cars as you want, and that's it! Nothing else to spend your abundant money.\nWHAT THE HELL HAPPENS? DO WE REALLY SHOOT MARIA AT THE END? IS SHE DEAD? A doubt that we'll have beyond the eternity.\nI don't know if I didn't actually realize how to aim properly, but from my experience, aiming at this game is frustrating.\nThe pros are all the good points of any GTA title:\nopen world;\nkilling people on the street;\nmafia missions;\nit's easy to drive cars;\nbadass story;\nunique car jumps! Oh, the car jumps and stunts!\nGANGS!\nAlthough being old and the effort it takes, I had enough fun, so I recommend this game!
