Unfortunately you get what you pay for and this game was sadly not particularly good.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, as demonstrated in the trailer on Steam. But that's also all there's to it: a very light shoot 'em up.\n\nThe game is incredibly repetitive. Monsters come at you from the exact same angles every few seconds, making the game more of a pattern recognition exercise than anything. You have a basic attack that you can pretty much spam continuously and a whirlwind attack that needs to be charged but only kills certain enemies. The lack of a health bar, score meter or progress meter to the next boss is very annoying.\n\nGraphically there's really nothing to it. Playing it full screen is not recommended, as it makes all the ugly stand out.\n\nThere's also not much sound. Aside from the looping organ music, the sound assets seem limited to a whopping 3 sound bites.","October 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 59 of 73 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","59","73","3","6"

It reminds me of the old 1942 airplane game I played as a kid but in a halloween theme. It's kinda hard, still havent managed to kill the second boss, headless horseman.  Easy game to jump in and out of if you just have a few miniutes to kill.","October 27, 2015","true","0.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Being that the game is inexpensive, simple, and easy to learn. Complete with a scoreboard, Flight of the Paladin is a solid time sink that you can improve at your own pace and enjoy.","October 28, 2015","true","0.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Nice chill game.\n\n8/10","October 28, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

If you're looking for depth, look elsewhere.  But if you're down for a late 80s style Arcade shooter, this is the one.","November 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Sometimes you get punched straight in the face by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and are expected to stand right back up and keep moving. Other times you are extorted by greedy people that lack foresight beyond their own needs. But not here. This game does not knock you down, it does not steal from you! This game truly is a gem amongst gems, a beautiful woman lying by a cool stream, a freshly cleaned fedora sitting atop a plate of hotpockets. 11/10 made me experience feelings beyond comprehension.","June 3","true","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
