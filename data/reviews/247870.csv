At first you smirk at all the little references and sarcastic jokes and puns, but then after hours of shifting through menus you frown because that is really all the game has to it.   It is unfortunately a one trick pony, and ironically it essentially is the shallow facebook game that this game precisely intends to mock.  As an example of art imitates life, it works and I get it.  As a game that is an enjoyable time sink?  Not for $20.  It is a phone ap game at best for less than five.\n\nUpdate 1-19-15\n\nIt ain't worth 9.99 either.

Johansen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JSJohansen/","1978 products in account","DO NOT BUY\n\nThe price of this game is absurd, it started out being a funny satire of facebook; but after a few hours it became a really shallow micromanaging game, based entirely in menues. I thought I would be seeing around the station or something, but you just look at menus the entire time, eventually after you become better friends or have higher relationships with people, you can suddenly be sendt out in an "away team" (the only part of the game not in a menu, but you just sit there watching people, either die, or not die.) If you are unlucky enough to be on an away team with a friend/girlfriend/boyfriend and they die, your character goes into a -100 mood and use a couple of days buying items that make you happy, and doing activities with others (via menu...) to be happy again.\n\nIt was kinda fun at the beginning, I was smirking at the whole - mocking facebook - aspect, until I realized that was all the game was. The ending was the thing that made ME go to a -100 mood, it was as if nothing I had just done mattered, and I was introduced to a small summery of stats, and then directed right back to the main menu. It has no replay value, and for the price, I was expecting a LOT more.\n\nThis game should be priced under the $5 / 5€ mark. The graphics are lacking, the characters look horrible, eventually everyone looks similar, there are no decent faces - female characters seemed like the men just with added boobs. The only thing you see regarding the space station, is the actual space station viewed from the main menu and intro, and where you're character stands (in some kind of hall way?) so it's the same static image constantly - oh wait, you also get to see the same background every time you get sent out in the away team.\n\nThe sad thing is, this is still an improvement from their other games. I'm guessing just to stay away from anything made by Positech. After this, and the whole Kudos series, I'm officially giving up.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand how Positech hasn't gone bankrupt. The reviews from Rock Paper Shotgun, The Escapist and Softpedia, reflect exactly why no one should listen to them.

For those that like the idea of a social management game, there are java based phone games, android games and I'm sure IOS games that have more to offer in the free to $10 range, but on the PC, Positech's Kudos and this are it without counting the Sims, which is really a whole different experience.\n\nIt is a social life management game. You are given so many tme units a day to allocate your time and try to manage the life of your character, try to inch up the job ladder and anything beyond that is fed as backstory clues but the game itself is of a style more befitting a tablet than a PC interface.\n\nAs far as the style of game goes, it is pretty average in it's genre, and have seen cell-phone games that had more to offer. For those that like the genre of game (which I do, in some of my moods) it's worth getting, but unless you love the game style, not at $20. $5 to $10 would be a much more typical pricetag for what is being offered. If you don't already know and like the genre, there are much better games out there to experiment with the genre, starting with the game this one almost clones: Kudos 2, which you can usually pick up for $5.","November 26, 2013","false","13.8"," 102 of 124 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","102","124","0","1"

RAGE","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016207066/","128 products in account","I bought this back when it first came out because I thought the premise was intriguing. I've always been a fan of Star Trek, and I thought a game about how those poor, unfortunate redshirts and other nameless, unimportant crew members survived the insane situations that inevitably befell the crew would be neat. I thought a game about being an underapprciated but vital part of a team would be fun.\n\nThis game is not that game.\n\nLet's go through each of the claims this game makes any why I think most, if not all of them, are bogus.\n\n1: "Satirical, tongue-in-cheek social simulation, filled with humour and political intrigue." If by "political intrigue" you mean "boring, petty interpersonal drama that I get enough of in my daily life," then yes. This game has political intrigue coming out of its nostrils. I will say that it is at least mildly satirical, as the implication that social media is a poor substitute for actual interaction is a perfectly valid one. I will admit, though, that I didn't find too much about this game to be funny.\n\n2: "Detailed character creation: choose from 5 different species, from human to tentacled squid creature!" It isn't that detailed, I'm afraid. Additionally, it actually makes very little difference what species or even sexual orientation that you choose, except in very rare circumstances (such as being depressed because you don't have a significant other and everyone you can date is not interested in people of your gender, and the one person who is hates your guts; I don't need a repeat of my everyday life, thank you).\n\n3: "Each game is unique: Megalodon-9 is full of procedurally generated AI-driven characters, each with their own random personalities and profile pictures." Each game is unique, but the NPCs aren't sure the names and species and personalities might change, but they're all the same, vapid, uninteresting characters.\n\n4: "Customise station settings: define the kinds of personalities you'll encounter, from friendly chatterboxes to self-obsessed bigots." This bit is accurate, at least.\n\n5: "Update your Spacebook, strategically 'like' statuses, and send private messages to your fellow station citizens." This is also an accurate feature.\n\n6: "Arrange Spacebook 'events' with your friends, frenemies, and even higher-ranking officers, to influence your relationships and skills." Despite being accurate, I'm not sure how this and the prior item are even features.\n\n7: "Multiple routes to success through turn-based gameplay, from skills-based diligence, to romance, to charismatic schmoozing." This is accurate, to a degree. You cannot rely on just one to succeed, however; the best route always involves using everything at your disposal. And you'll need to: without romance, for example, your morale may drop .And if you're in a bad mood, your work will suffer. If your work suffers, say good-bye to that promotion. And before you know it, you're another soulless drone lamenting your lack of a love-life and your boring, dead-end job, anxiously awaiting the weekend so you can go to wine-tastings to get your mood back up for the coming week, only to repeat the cycle ad infinitum.\n\n8: "Navigate an extensive, non-linear career tree, by gaining the right skills... or just by making the right friends.\nMake friends and manage romantic relationships -- if you can handle the drama!" On a personal note, this is something I dislike about this game, especially when paired with the above item. Don't get me wrong, I love playing games where I get to be a manipulative schemer. But when the best run I ever had involved buddying up to my supervisors and discarding them when I'd gotten a promotion, that may say something about how viable a skill-based playthrough is.\n\n9: "Strategically manage your interests and skills." See the aforementioned bit about wine-tastings.\n\n10: "Buy items in the Self-Help Object Purveyor (S.H.O.P.) to increase your stats and skills, from RoboCats to illegal hoverbikes!" True, and also a requirement.\n\n11: "Away missions!" Also known as "which one of my friends is going to die miserably and send me into a self-destructive spiral?"\n\n12: "Humorous parody of social networking culture." A parody, perhaps. But I wouldn't say it's a particularly humorous one. I found most of the jokes to fall flat.\n\n13: "Puns! So many puns." Yes, but they're not particularly funny puns.\n\nNow that that's done with, here's my final conclusion. Redshirt was fun, for about 10 minutes. Then it became very, very tedious and very, very boring. And while that's fine to a degree, especially if your game is parodying something as boring as social media, the game itself has to be fun. Quite simply? Redshirt is not fun. I cannot suggest that anyone buy this game for anything more than $3.00.\n\nSeriously, wait for it to go on sale if you have to buy it.","November 20, 2014","false","0.7"," 75 of 88 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","75","88","2","0"

Your mission is to social engineer your way to the top of the space station hierarchy. Along the way, you can make friends, start (and end) relationships, and arrange events with your cohabitants.\n\nThe gameplay involves making a limited number of moves per day on "Spacebook". This includes liking posts, sending messages and friend invites, and inviting friends to events. These events not only bring you closer to your friends, but will also change your interests. You must balance your interests to make friends with whoever your desired target is (either a goal given to you by the game, or the hiring manager at the next job you want). During the day you will also have to work, which will give you money and have an effect on your relationships.\n\nRedshirt is one of those games where it's fun to tool around in for a few minutes, but after a bit you feel like you have seen everything that the game has to offer. I managed to get a really good promotion by dating the hiring manager, but the only reward I really got was that I could do the process all over again for an even better job. For those that enjoy that type of manipulation, maybe the fun can last for a few cycles. For me, I got bored rather quickly. The main feedback you get from your actions is your changing relationship status with other inhabitants of the space station. It comes in the form of the green and red bar that will be familiar to anyone that has played the Sims. The real issue I had with it was that there is not much separating one character from the next, besides a cartoon portait that looks a little bit the same from one character to the next. besides alien race of course. You never really feel like you are interacting with separate characters, like you would in the Sims for instance.\n\nI do not recommend playing Redshirt. I felt like I was just playing Facebook with generic robots, which I guess in the end was what I was really doing. From my time with it, I didn't feel the motivation needed to keep advancing.\n\nGrade: D","April 8, 2015","false","0.7"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","0"

This game feels like a job and it's not fun.  Just as an example, as you progress you are supposed to gain Spacebook friends in order to extend your influence.

The gameplay is reminiscent of other turn-based character sims such as Princess Maker and Long Live The Queen - you have a set number of actions and turns a day with which to improve your character and get to know people around the station. You earn money by going to work every weekday, and you have the weekends off with which to do whatever you want.\n\nWhile I recommend the game, I do so with a caveat - get it for cheap. It's good to see more character-based sims, but there are a lot of problems with Redshirt I found annoying. For instance, if you're in a relationship, your partner will repeatedly bug you every day, even if you spend every action in both weekdays with them, they'll still feel hurt and lonely and want more attention. Also, interests seem to be very difficult to sway back and forth, which is a vital part of getting more friends on Spacebook, towards the late game, especially since one of the best early ways to make friends is to take them to one of the healthy cheap lunch places - which jacks up your Fitness interest. I would have preferred a system where you gained levels in interests much as you did skills, instead of simply having 100% with which to split amongst the varied things you have to do in a day's time.\n\nI do enjoy the game's sarcastic tone of humor, and am glad to see more games of this style, so I can say it's worth at least a playthrough - as long as it's a playthrough that only costs one or two Karmacredits.","February 11, 2014","true","8.3"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","37","48","0","0"

I'm a big fan of the life sim genre and I own most of Positech's games. When I heard they had a new one out that looked like a satirical version of Kudos, I ignored all the bad reviews and jumped at the chance to buy it. What a mistake. This game is basically Kudos 2 with a space skin. But though it's lifted most of its gameplay mechanics from Kudos 2, it's a huge step backward. The interface is clunky and hard to manage (and for a game that is ALL interface that's a crying shame), the gameplay is a lot less fun, it's riddled with bugs, and the 'humour' is repetitive and gets wearing after just an hour of gameplay. And though it's been, what, six years since Kudos 2 was released, nothing has been improved - the gameplay is meandering with no meaningful objectives, there's no feeling of real characters to connect to, and there is endless, endless grinding. I am usually very patient with indie life sims, and will put up with bad writing, poor artwork and lots of grinding, but there has to be SOMETHING at the heart of it. But this life sim is absolutely lifeless. It's an amateur piece of garbage that's worth $5 at best.

For that reason I can not currently recommend this game to anyone, however if they ever issue an update that fixes these bugs then I would definitely change my review to reflect that as the game would be more playable.\n\nBug #1: Game can become unplayable due to a livelock.  To reproduce, wait until the start of a new day when you have one pre-work action available.  Bring up the Social Map, then click on any person to bring up their Spacebook profile on the left.  Click "Like" on any of their Spacebook posts and the game triggers "work mode" that pops up a dialogue box half on top of Spacebook on the left, and half underneath the Social Map on the right.  You have to ALT-F4 out of the game as input is no longer processed at all.\n\nBugs #2: This is a multitude of identical bugs.  Within the Skills & Inventory screen, if you go through each of the available Skills one at a time, then click on each of the "EVENTs" listed for them, it brings up the chosen event on the left hand side pane.  Many of these events are buggy however and the actual event that shows up on the left, does not match the name of the event you clicked on on the event list.\n\nI've made screenshots of these bugs in my public Steam profile:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/skeletonbow/screenshots/?appid=247870&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=grid\n\nThese bugs make the game frustrating and make various paths through the game impossible because you are unable to advance certain skills properly because the events to do so bring up the wrong actual event, so you do not gain the correct skill points.\n\nIf they fix these bugs, I will update my review and change my recommendation, but until then I caution people to pass on this game for now.","February 11","false","32.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Move over "The Sims," because this game gets it right.  This is how the real, modern world works so pay attention!\n\nCareers: No one cares about your skills, you education, or your talents.  No one is going to read your resumé or give two farts about what you studied in college.  All your potential bosses are ever going to do is immediately look you up on Facebook and look at your profile.  Do you share thier hobbies?  Their political views?  Dress the way they approve of?  Most importantly, do you know someone that they do?  Because these are things that decide if you get hired, fired, promoted or passed over.  Just like in real life.\n\nRelationships: Are you handsome?  Beautiful?  Rich?  Smart?  Athletic?  No one gives a crap.  Your Facebook page is your relationship application form.  How many friends do you have?  Do you follow the latest trends?  Do you watch the right shows, listen to the right music, misquote the right famous people?  Do you effect an air of false depth by shamelessly cutting & pasting mopey song lyrics without any semblence of context?  Ohmygosh, you are, like, so cool, then!  Relationship request accepted.  Just like in real life.\n\nFinance: In the future no one will ever truly own anything ever again.  The future is all subscription based, where "ownership" simply means that you'll be paying weekly and monthly upkeep fees on stuff until the sun burns out and the Universe freezes over.  Well guess what, kids?  The Future is Now!  Watch as every week your pitiful paycheck is immediately consumed just trying to keep the garbage that you bought four months ago from breaking down for another few days!  Get sucked into the competetive ego drive that is created by your lame, shallow friends constantly braggging about their personal treasure troves.  Piddle away your financial future on a pointless treadmill just to keep up with everyone else in a vain quest for popularity.  Just like in real life.\n\nLife: In the end whether you succede or fail, prosper or rot in misery, literally live or die all boils down to your dedication to sacrifice all your personal goals & aspirations upon the blood soaked altar of ephemeral on-line popularity.  Your own thoughts, opinions, ideals and very personality shall all be slowly morphed over time to match that of those that you need to suck up to and impress in order to get ahead.  Just like in real life.\n\nSummary: If ever there was a game that perfectly, unabashedly and honestly summed up this shallow, sick, cruel, twisted world we live in today... it is Redshirt.  No other game is so forthright about telling it like it is.  It's not what you know, it's who you know.  It's not what you think, it's what your boss thinks.  Relationships are just lateral career maneuvers.  Friends are just rungs on a ladder, aquired when above you and discarded once below.  I highly recomend buying this game (along with the complete DVD set of Geroge Carlin) to every naive, gullible middle-school student in America.  Because it's never too soon to start sharpening the knives.","September 27, 2015","true","12.0"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","72","21","29","11","0"

ALL of these other games are "casual simulation spreadsheet" games that playout different scenarios.\n\nTHIS game is basically "Kudos DeepSpace 9".

Where parties, life-events, relationships, and so forth, originated on facebook, and then  played out in life?  THIS is Redshirt, or as it is accurately called "Spacebook" the game.\n\nIts a fun twist on the Kudo's game style, set in a very star-trek themed universe, ran from a spacebook interface.  I highly recommend it.  I will see what kind of replay value it has, but for now, I can say, it has been a fun casual play, enjoyable, and creative.\n\nI think the developers should make a demo, but until they do, I suggest you download one of the Kudo's demos... and then just immagine the interface re-worked into a facebook style of menu-systems, with a clever set of space-themed events and opportunities.","January 28, 2014","true","10.0"," 46 of 77 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","46","77","0","0"

Turn based games.This game basically moves when you make a decision to do something, so you aren't in a race with a virtual clock.\n\n2. Life Simulations.Conceptually, I like seeing and playing games where the heart of the game is trying to simulate a cultural universe.

When I was reading the negative reviews, I noted that the ones I read disliked that concept.

The game gets boring and tedious rather quickly:\n- I reality not all of your friends are available all the time, and that can be implemented in the game, but beyond a certain level, it is purely annyoing.\n- Of the many actions one can take, most seem redundant and choices are arbitrary.\n- Relationships don't seem to mean anything, and there does not seem to be much in the way of building your character.\n- The user interface is ugly and (for me) confusing.

Work yourself up, from the security standard issue "Mop the Warp Conduits" - Worker up to high levels of social ranks on a large spaceship on a long term tour.\n\nOh, and don't forget the merrits of programming the replicators with 999 cat-food recipes, or learning how to use alien melee weaponry as meditative art form. Yes, the game is funny, it has a strong connection to Star Trek, and some other space opera. But I am quite torn if I should give the game a recommendation at all.

The price is too high for a casual game that might give you only a limited time of fun, and the time of wearing it out can come very, very suddenly...

It may seem convoluted at first, but actually is fairly simple. The player has to interact with different NPCs and climb up the career ladder for one of several endings. The interactions themselves tend to be quite funny, especially if you're familiar with particular works they often reference.\n\nSadly, the game has some issues. Mostly bugs, including gamebreaking ones. It's also quite random and inconsistent when it comes to events and other characters' daily actions. Not to mention, it has very simple aesthetic, which may put some people off.\n\nI'd only recommend getting Redshirt if you're into sci-fi and sim games, and if you can get it cheap.

Everything is literally done through a FB-type of menu where your character interacts with other NPCs through wall posts, Likes, PMs, and events. Sometimes a random away-mission will break-up the monotony, but this happens rarely and doesn't really add anything to the overall experience, unless your significant other gets killed, at which point you can just find another. There are parts of the game which are addicting such as climbing up the Career ladder. This is done through cultivating relationships with the right people or through upgrading skills and interests which are required for the job you want. Mostly, however, the only appeal seems to be geared towards achievement hunters as nothing accomplished in the game feels meaningful in any way otherwise. If text-based SIMS seems to be something you might be interested in, then this game is for you.\n\nValue: Picked this game up when it was on sale for 50% off, for which I am thankful, because even at $10 I cannot recommend this game. At best this is a $5 game which will last you, depending on how bored you are, anywhere from 30 minutes (if you're bored quickly) to several hours (actual completion). There doesn't seem to be a lot of replay value. Once you beat the game through one of several types of victories, there are not enough customization options to make subsequent replays interesting or new enough.\n\nOverall: 5/10.

Each ending seems to be based on a slight variation in focus, but the game will be essentially the same each time, so it's impossible to work up the motivation to play again after the end credits roll.\n\nThe game has a lot of great ideas, but the shallow implementation holds it back. It's too obviously gamey, with obvious player-controlled victory, to have the pointlessness make a bigger statement about disempowerment. But the game itself is shallow enough that you'll have it all figured out early on, and spend most of the actual gameplay performing boring, predictable actions to move counters and progress timers.

It has little to no replay value, sure you could replay it but once you understand the mechanics they're childishly easy to abuse, to the point where I manaaged to complete the game in less than an hour on my second go around, and due to the simplistic nature of the AI, all the characters feel the same. All the romantic intersts are just as naggy and annoying. And progression is only determined by how hard you make it for yourself via the sliding options, so you either make it realistic, in that the AI behaves remotely normal and it's overly easy, or make it completely off the wall where the AI behaves like no rational person, and it's unfair.\n\nIn short, if you can get it cheap (around $1) go for it.

I really do.\n\nIt has its fine points. I really enjoy the inspiration from Star Trek (oops - 'space opera') tropes combined with the triteness of Facebook. There's a clever social commentary hidden in how quickly you can make or break relationships, and how those relationships can help you climb the corporate ladder. The game allows you to tweak the difficulty or behaviours of your fellow crewmen, which can personalize the playthrough a little more. Animations, commentaries, tongue-in-cheek references and, frankly, the sheer amount of text makes everything fun to look over.\n\nBut I'll admit it: the game has a lot - a LOT - of flaws. Deep down, the game is a life or dating sim. You hook up with friends by inviting them to activities they'll like. You drop them as soon as they stop being useful, in favour of more profitable marks. What starts as a cute juggle between half a dozen friends balloons into 30+ names you can barely remember, and all of them clamouring for your attention. (Yes, that's supposed to be the point, I think.)\n\nHorrifically obvious is the grinding near the end. You'll rush to climb the ladder so fast, then realize you've got a month left of doing whatever it is you're doing. I gave up and tossed in the 'I WIN' card out of frustration. The graphics are mediocre, at best, and while by itself I'd overlook it, when you see the lack of change during the end sequence, you'll wonder why you spent all this time doing this.\n\nFor a one-man job, and at half off at $10, it's good.

The basic premise is that the player has 160 days to advance as far as they can within the space station. This is done by creating events, leveling up random skills / interests, then leveraging those skills and interests to make friends. Friends are then used to advance the players career, resulting in higher pay and the ability to level up more easily through supplementary items. All in all, it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoyed any of the Sims games or Jones in the Fast Lane you'll more then likely get a kick out of it.","February 3, 2014","true","6.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You only get so many actions unless you use in-game credits to buy more, and everything moves very quickly. Planning is important -- read your options before doing anything, but expect messages to pop up that spoil your plans as you necessarily respond to them.\nPros: Very immersive and addicting. There are lots of little jokes and genre-based humor. If you enjoy making fun of the structure of social media as we know it, you'll enjoy the nuances of Spacebook in much the same way any gamer can enjoy the tongue-in-cheek of games like DLC Quest. It's challenging no matter what level you're at within the game, so you can't fall into complacency and get bored with it. You have to work hard to keep progressing. Making a list of the meal specials each day can be entertaining, too.\nCons: Very immersive and addicting. Over an hour of my time vanished unexpectedly when I first started up the game. Not as bad as the Skyrim Disease, but can definitely take up a whole evening when you least expect it. The only other con I care to mention is that you can't always do precisely the reaction or response you would prefer when things happen or things are said. You are limited to the way Spacebook is designed and what your aspiration goals are in the game (they change every time you reach one). This can make the game slightly tedious.\nReplayable: Absolutely! You can make different profiles for yourself and play as different people with different interests. Change the game settings for each player profile to get different responses from other redshirts or frequency of away missions and medical visits. It's highly customizable that way (or increased randomization, depending on what you choose).","January 31, 2014","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Humor / writing: Sometimes absurd, sometimes satirical, sometimes cheesy. Probably where that "personality" comes from\n2.

Intuitive / Easy to get the hang of the interface\n\nI think you'll like this if you enjoy turn-based games, life sim games, space games, and social and/or time management games, but probably only if you do NOT hate using Facebook in real life, as this has a heavy Facebook-like simulation component.\n\nOverall it needs to be more challenging.

I completed the game via the “bribery” track, but got the achievement for the “tons o’ cash” track. I’ve noticed some minor visual glitches.\n- A lot of repetition.

To speak with anybody, you literally have to message them on Spacebook (which doesn't get responses either), 'like' their statuses, or invite them to events. The interface is convoluted and hard to understand at first, but you get the hang of it. I do feel they made it overly complex though.\n\nThe story is non-existent, you are on a space station in a disputed region of space. Near the beginning of the game, there are rumours about something happening to the station in the future, and you then have a countdown to how many days are left. It is safe to assume that if you are still on the station, you're not going to live much longer.\n\nEach interaction with people gets you either positive or negative friend points with them, the more positive you get, the more likely they'll accept your friend request. You can also request a relationship, and there are no boundaries here, male/male, female/female, gender neutral etc, though the characters there do have preferences.\n\nEach action you do, from liking a post, going to eat, buying something from the shop, takes up 'action points', and you have so few per day it gets annoying very quickly. Generally you get one before work, then 3 after work. On weekends, you get 6 points to spend. Big events need more time as expected.\n\nYou can also level up your skills to get a better job, or change your primary interests, which will get you the friends you need. In order to progress up the career ladder, you need to have a certain level in specific skills, or you can be great friends with the boss. In the end, I managed to request relationships with the bosses, so they overlooked my missing skills, and even if you break it off with them, you don't lose your work!\n\nYou do go on away missions, and though I have yet to die (even when I had very poor health) almost certainly people you know will die, which makes you sadder.\n\nYou learn of the few ways to get off the station, and soon you strive towards that. I think I may have finished it a little early, since I was on the final career level and have already bought a shuttle ticket, though I wanted to buy a second for a friend, but there was over 90 days left.\n\nThe art is basic, and nothing worth mentioning. The sound effects and music are average, but dull, perhaps Steam Music may help to alleviate it? No voice acting as well.\n\nWorst of all is the gameplay, there is none. Get friends, go to events, work, have a romance, all to get yourself away. It's all very cold and calculated, since you don't really feel closer to even your significant other in the end. Spacebook statuses are mostly duplicated dozens of times during the course of the game, ruining the immersion. While I understand having unique sentences for each of your friends to have through the numerous day is hard, it still annoys me reading the same thing.\n\nOverall, not worth a buy, unless you're like me and bought it in the Bemine 11 bundle.","February 10, 2014","false","6.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I do not recommend this game due to how there are broken achievements where only .04% of players have completed them mysteriously.  You can still safely complete 18/20, but they're not as rare as the broken ones. It also seems that the developers have completely abandoned this game, so don't hold any hope towards updates. I've tried scrolling through the game's programming in order to manually unlock the achievements, but I cannot find them.\n\nStory	You are an ....[Race] named ...[Name] sent to work for a big space station where there will be an extinction event pending xxx days. The game is about your journey to prevent, or accept your death aboard the doomed Station; however, you may die even before the extinction event on one of the legendary exploratory missions with comical & fatal consequences.\n\nYou will have two attributes to look after throughout the course of your journey: Health & Happiness. These two attributes are very important during surprise expeditions since they may decide whether you live or die.\n\nIn order to advance your career you have to do events/specific jobs in order advance skills. You will be given an option to escape through: Captain's Attendant[Career], Ambassador's lover[Romance], High Ranking Officer's Lover[Romance], Ted the black market[Bribery], and T'arg's overpriced ticket[Rich].\n\nFinal Decision	It's a completed, but broken game, so I would consider it a borderline cash grab since it's been abandoned by the developer.","June 1, 2015","false","12.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

And it's not all horrible. It just isn't good - even if you like Kudos type games. It's not really funny, it's not really that interesting or engaging, and it failed to get me in that mind-numbing yet weirdly satisfactory state of flow that sometimes seems to be the single appeal of games like this. The horribly cluttered and difficult to navigate interface is one major part of the problem - in this type of game the interface IS the game and making it so annoyingly unwieldy hurts gameplay. The other is what everyone's been saying: this game exposes how boring facebook is by being boring.\n\nThe developer tried, and it shows, so no trashing here. The game looks cute and the writing, while not really funny, is occasionally amusing. I liked the amount of complexity (again though, the interface hurts it), I liked the progression rhythm, it feels well balanced. And yet it just doesn't really work in the end. I can't say whether it's a missed opportunity or just an idea that wasn't meant to be, but I'm leaning towards the latter.\n\nEither way, get it only in a sale or a bundle, and only if you liked Kudos.","February 12, 2014","false","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And it's not all horrible. It just isn't good - even if you like Kudos type games. It's not really funny, it's not really that interesting or engaging, and it failed to get me in that mind-numbing yet weirdly satisfactory state of flow that sometimes seems to be the single appeal of games like this. The horribly cluttered and difficult to navigate interface is one major part of the problem - in this type of game the interface IS the game and making it so annoyingly unwieldy hurts gameplay. The other is what everyone's been saying: this game exposes how boring facebook is by being boring.\n\nThe developer tried, and it shows, so no trashing here. The game looks cute and the writing, while not really funny, is occasionally amusing. I liked the amount of complexity (again though, the interface hurts it), I liked the progression rhythm, it feels well balanced. And yet it just doesn't really work in the end. I can't say whether it's a missed opportunity or just an idea that wasn't meant to be, but I'm leaning towards the latter.\n\nEither way, get it only in a sale or a bundle, and only if you liked Kudos.","February 12, 2014","false","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also, being a satire, it might have been a funny experience! ...\nWell, it's not. At least it wasn't for me.\nThe satirical aspect of it was very minimal and superficial, I felt, using the same aspect of it way too much, making it old very, very fast.\n\nAlso, despite there being an end-game objective, nothing really points to what it might be, or what you should do to escape and then win the game. Barely even after you lose... which simply shows a game over screen.\nOverall, the game didn't present its objectives at all, which isn't all that great of an idea.\n\nGameplay is simply clicking boxes and doing the same "social" tasks over and over... and over again. For the whole game.\nYou essentially have different activities that increase/decrease interests, health, happiness, various skills, etc. which will be used in your career (in different jobs), relationships, etc.\nThis could have been good, but it's simply laborious to do it. You click the same boxes dozens of times, managing relationships isn't at all interesting or fun... There is no character to the different people of meet, it's... not very good, really.\n\nAlso, each run's length it way too high, boring the player out of the same playthrough.\n\nFrom what I've seen, there's only one random event, which makes it really boring. It just kills people randomly (I may or may not have had 2 girlfriends killed on those) and didn't seem to serve any practical purpose.\n\nSo, gameplay is very bland, repetitive leading to a boring experience, in my opinion.\n\nWhat about the satirical aspect?\nWell, everyone is a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. A superficial, self-centered, arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥. That's it. That's the game's society and apparent satire. People only care about Likes, Relationships and their Rank.\nEvery person I've met in the game seemed the same, and wasn't interesting at all. I don't know how someone could have thought this would be nice to play, to be honest.\n\n\nWell, I've also found a couple of bugs, but nothing too serious.\nThe interface wasn't very intuitive, sometimes even objectively bad, leading the player to misclick too often (specially in the missions section).\n\n\nSo, if you're interested in the game and have experience in similar games, maybe you'll have a different opinion than mine. Maybe there are aspects to this game that I simply "don't get". That's fine, but do it at your own risk.\n\nTo anyone else... this is a very shallow experience, taking a fairly interesting concept, and making it more boring than social media itself (which is a feat, let's be honest).\n\nI'm sorry for such a negative review, but this provided my with no joy at all. I might've done several playthroughs to see if it had any depth, but I had enough from the first try... Pass on this one.","February 11, 2014","false","4.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the first thirty minutes of playing Redshirt, you will be enchanted by the humour and the design of the game. But by pointing out the shallowness of the 'always-on' Facebook existence, Redshirt quickly shoots itself in the foot by making it impossible to care about any of the shallowly-presented characters - and the allure begins to pale. No cohesively directed story evolves, only the one that you've made with your Spacebook actions. While this makes the game replayable by using randomness, it also reduces meaning of what you're doing. There are no day-to-day challenges of Redshirt, the only way to lose the game is to play it out and hope you gain enough skills, relationships, or money to survive, after selecting where to spend your time.\n\nRedshirt could have been an amazing game with a deeper level of gameplay or daily tasks that engaged and challenged the player. As it is, it's a nice game for those who enjoy the genre.","January 1, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Gameplay is boring, you are given 6 actions every day and use them on Spacebook to  do typical social networking crap like send friend requests and go out to events. Romance is an arbitrary thing in space, people will randomly decide they love you if you hang out with them enough and suddenly send you relationship requests like total creepers.\n\nLet's put this simply.

The career part is pathetic, because you don't get meaningful choices. You just click the "Do Job" button when it tells you to and slowly build stats. I guess you can try to befriend a hiring officer to get promoted faster, but that's part of the social game. Even the away missions are just another glorified stats screen, just like any other day of work, except you get sadder because a random person died.\n\nThe social aspect is really all there is in the game, but it isn't fun. It's a game about building relationships, except those relationships have no value, and the only way to build them is to invite them to dinner, basically. Being in a romantic relationship increases your happiness stat, but it feels empty. You don't know anything about the randomly generated name and avater you're "In a relationship" with, they have no character, you don't care about them. It's the same with all the other friends, non-friends, coworkers, bosses etc that you have potential relationships with. They're just numbers with no compelling reason to care about them. The player's feelings and the avatar's stats are so disconnected that it's actually kind of insulting when the game tells you how happy or sad you are.\n\nOne might say that that's all just part of the satire of social networking, but it fails to be good satire because it doesn't feel like the thing it's mocking, because in real life, it's implied that other people actually exist. And besides, being satire doesn't excuse a game for being boring.\n\nThe game isn't funny, which is disappointing. I got a few chuckles from flavor text here an there, but nothing stood out. It was all cheap referential stuff, the kind of humor that forms the broth of a good parody, but there was no meat to it. Nothing actually funny ever took center stage, because the game was too focused on simulating a high-schooler's idea of self-worth, which would be dull even if I didn't have to enable it.\n\nThe UI is mucky. Lines of stats are overrepresented and none of your potential actions are organized in a way that does a good job of conveying what your options are or what their effects are. The art is low quality, and the sound design is shoddy. Beeps and voiceovers and loud music overlap without any real design. None of these are bad enough to sink the game on their own, but they're pretty good at quickly eroding my sense of curiosity, the only thing keeping me in the game.\n\nTL;DR: If you want to pretend to be a particularly shallow teenager, go for it. If you're looking for laughs, skip. If you're looking for a Sci Fi Roleplaying experience, run far far away.","December 26, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basic idea of the game is to get people to like you, so you can ...um...social climb away.  A very additive and intuitive simulation of social networking game nonetheless.   The game looks complex at first, but after a good half an hour of learning curve, you will know what to do.  And it will be like a constant clicking game, like any other simulation games.\n\nThe difficulty setting is based on the frequency of away missions.  The higher chance you are on an away mission, the higher chance you might die.  If you die from an away mission, you are dead.  And the game auto-save right away just to make sure you don't reload the game.  So, that could mean hours of hard work of pleasing your co-worker and boss in the game just go down the drain.\n\nThere is something that's not realistic enough for me though.  In the game, you can apply for jobs of higher ranking.  If the hiring manager deny your promotion, their relationship points will go down lower.  It almost seems like they dislike you more after they deny your promotion, and I don't see the logic in that.\n\nI think the game is somewhat buggy.  The game freeze once in a while, and some buttons become not clickable(I know I don't have top of the line gaming rig, but this is still just a text based game with 2d graphics, so I think the game should never froze). Well, the graphical interface is still good enough though, it seems very fluid when clicking buttons here and there most of the time.  But personally I don't like the artwork of the characters.\n\nI would almost recommend this, because of some funny Star Trek references, and the game is addictive enough.  I usually don't mind too much about minor bugs or flaws in the game, but this game has too many of these unsatisfying elements.  And ultimately, the unsatisfying one line text ending is what really kills the game for me.  I'll have to not recommend this.","March 18, 2014","false","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ever wanted to stop the addiction but don't know how. Well look no further because now you can play the social network game.\n\nStory\nThere is minimal story. You play as a new arrival to a space station.\n\nGameplay\nAs a social network simulator, majority of the game composes of developing connections with various other characters on the station. The aim of the game is to try to get off the station ASAP, but in order to do that you need to move up in 'status'. You do this by making friends, getting new jobs and promotions. To improve relationships with other characters you may invite them to eat, watch a movie, play sport or a wide variety of other activities or simply liking their posts and sending messages. Each character likes and dislikes certain activities. As your relationships with characters improve, so do their messages towards you, even going so far as flirting. The same can be said the other way round, if you offend them, in which they may un-friend you. Besides managing your connections you also have to go to work, which earns you money which you can spend to buy new items or to go to events. You also have to manage your health and happiness by spending time eating at restaurants and doing relaxing activities. Some people may find the game boring with the limited activity. I however found it amazingling addictive putting in several hours into it before calling it quits.\n\nAudio\nMusic isn't anything special. The sound effects serve their purpose. there is not voice acting, with all dialogue spoken via text.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are all presented via 2D pictures. They aren't amazingly detailed, but aren't an eye-sore either.\n\nI recommend this game to people who want to reap the benefits of social media, on steam or who have never experienced social media in their lives.","January 7, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started two playthroughs - one to get a "feel" for the game, the other I actually got around to finishing. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Will I be replaying it? Not going to be my first choice.\n\nFor the TL;DR: interesting little game if you want a distraction, but definitely wait for a sale to come along to buy this. Otherwise... no.\n\nBasically the game places you in a Facebook-like interface where you make friends, post statuses, organize events, and go to work. It's a juggling act to keep your stats up to get yourself off the spaceship before the "days" are up. There are some interesting concepts, like making friends, messaging the right people, the "etiquette" of making and meeting new friends, and at first there are a few stories to be told. In my playthroughs my character even had their significant other "stolen" from them by another "friend". The concept is a very novel one, and does a fairly good job parodying how social networking works.\n\nHowever, it gets very tedious by the time you start hitting the "endgame", and once you have secured yourself a way off the shuttle there really isn't a motivation to play anymore as the stories are limited and the jokes begin to wear thin, nor is there much new content. At the price right now ($9.99), it's not worth picking up, so be patient if you want to give this game a go.","January 10, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find it very replayable. Also a great drinking game (pick a friend, get two chairs and some wine, send rude & inflammatory messages to your exes, laugh a lot - it's like real drunk Facebook in safe mode). I come back to it now and then when I'm tired and just want to be entertained with very little effort.","August 2, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you got to see people doing things the game could of been so much better. If you can absorb its content though into real life it can give you some ideas about sending an email to women in real life in an online dating site so I guess its worth $20. Because this game is so boring to play I haven't taken away very much from it but I will give the developers credit for trying. They did a pretty good job with the script. The only entertainment you can get out of playing this game is reading the emails pick up lines social networking forum posts and the descriptions of the activities available and stuff like that but after a couple of hours for me I felt like it was beginning to look pretty much all the same so I got bored and stopped playing the game.","December 13, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay elements are fairly simple and it feels like a simple Flash game with a bunch of menus. This game needs much more complexity to justify its price point which is too high for something I have two words for - Bare bones. However if you enjoy casual games and loved Game Dev Tycoon, this is the game for you. You don't even require half a brain to complete this game as the hero of social networking...OR you can just mess around with your friends on Facebook and enjoy a much more realistic "gameplay" experience.","February 10, 2014","false","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started two playthroughs - one to get a "feel" for the game, the other I actually got around to finishing. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Will I be replaying it? Not going to be my first choice.\n\nFor the TL;DR: interesting little game if you want a distraction, but definitely wait for a sale to come along to buy this. Otherwise... no.\n\nBasically the game places you in a Facebook-like interface where you make friends, post statuses, organize events, and go to work. It's a juggling act to keep your stats up to get yourself off the spaceship before the "days" are up. There are some interesting concepts, like making friends, messaging the right people, the "etiquette" of making and meeting new friends, and at first there are a few stories to be told. In my playthroughs my character even had their significant other "stolen" from them by another "friend". The concept is a very novel one, and does a fairly good job parodying how social networking works.\n\nHowever, it gets very tedious by the time you start hitting the "endgame", and once you have secured yourself a way off the shuttle there really isn't a motivation to play anymore as the stories are limited and the jokes begin to wear thin, nor is there much new content. At the price right now ($9.99), it's not worth picking up, so be patient if you want to give this game a go.","January 10, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, it's just a janitorial position, but hey we all have to start somewhere.\n\nThe majority of this game is played interacting with 'Spacebook' making friend and inviting them to activities.  All this as a means to increase the abilities of the player character in order to take on higher ranking jobs and repeat the cycle.\n\nThis system is reminiscent of many visual novels but redshirts lacks any major plot thread to tie it all together which reduces the gameplay loop into watching numbers go up very slowly.","April 11","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
