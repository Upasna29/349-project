The premise is simple:  Man an MG nest and destroy everything that comes your way.  You have two weapons at your disposal--an MG and a rocket launcher--and numerous support abilities, ranging from supply drops to air strikes, that you can activate once you've attained enough kills.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is rather simplistic, it's also highly replayable.  There are several "hooks" to keep you coming back like persistent skill trees, unlockable levels, leaderboards, and end-level statistics that show how many enemies you've killed, vehicles you've destroyed, and whether or not you survived longer than your previous best time.\n\nGraphically, IS Defense is pretty impressive.  Thanks to epic explosions and ragdoll physics, blowing up incoming landing craft and technical trucks never gets old.  There are also lots of graphics options to tweak, including a much-needed FOV slider.  Best of all, the game performs quite well on my rig even in the later stages of invasions in which all hell is breaking loose (i7 4700, 8 GB RAM, GTX 970).\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a simple, yet fun shooter chock full of explosions and carnage, IS Defense is a no-brainer for 8 bucks.  If you enjoyed the Beach Head games, I'd go as far as to say it's a must-buy.","April 19","true","10.3"," 55 of 66 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","55","66","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/448370/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","An intensive shooter in stationary locales that takes current events into the realm of tomorrow’s newspapers; IS Defense is a mesmerizing bullet arcade. The music is fantastic and adrenaline charging. Add to that the sound effects and voices of enemy terrorists and you are sure to find this game something you will come back for more and more. The opening movie is laced with video & news shorts from today’s news, and weaves out the projected path of IS threat in the European world. It really makes you think about what is happening around you.\n\nI’ve only had the game a short time, but since many are interested in this game, I wanted to do the review now and lend support to this awesome game. The graphics are great. The premise is simple enough. And, the firepower is great! The card art is something worth collecting as well.\n\nI often say I’m not into fps games, though shooting is something that I can do fairly decently in games. I just normally don’t enjoy heavy combat elements. This one is intense, and you are stationary, making it probably more intensive, as far as fire power goes. You literally mow the waves of incoming enemies down as the suicide bombers attempt to reach you. With the perfect defensive position, your job is to shoot and reload. That’s it. The first level has you on the beach, as waves of pontoon boats are followed by ships with pickups. They all attempt to land a force on the beach and sweep past you. You hear the screams of the terrorists as they wage what they see as a “holy war.” And, you are reminded that war is not always a choice.\n\nThe game reminds me of the words of George Orwell, “People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.” If you are like me, you don’t like blaming a group of people nor a religion, nor other non-germane causes for the evil that takes place. But, the IS is not a religion. It is a terrorist group that is as much a problem for the Muslim community as for the rest of the world. If you don’t see the difference between IS and the Islamic faith, then this game may not be for you. Another word of caution; the shooting is intensive. I usually need frequent breaks when playing shooters like this.\n\nThe game is simple, straightforward, and offers many leveling up rewards for the gamer who likes “bullet-hell” type games. The main difference is you are behind the bullets for much of the game. I recommend IS Defense for teens and adults interested in current world events and defending their homeland from terrorists.","May 2","true","6.6"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

IS Defense is a rail-shooter. At one gig in size, it's a technical marvel. It's also pretty fun as long you don't consider that most IS cannon fodder are conscripts. But it's still a great game.\n\nFirst, it's hilarious because it's very realistic. Take your in-game abilities for example. Air strikes and helicopters are useless even though they cost the most to call. Press 2 to spam infantry for the win. BUT, infantry reinforcement will only come in small squads. Man, they must've consulted Obama or something on that. Hyper-realistic.\n\nSecondly, IS's most dangerous weapon is the humvee. 'Em buggers will overrun your position fast if you don't focus fire. The Toyota trucks are pretty easy to explode but the humvees are like freaking tanks. And there's a s**tload of them.\n\nThirdly, thanks Obama. No, I mean it.\n\nEDIT: This is an update to my review praising the game's realism. I've found yet another very realistic feature. Last night I killed thousands of terrorists, but when I logged in this morning they've been replaced by thousands of more terrorists.\n\nPRO TIP: For maximum effectiveness play the anthem of the Russian Federation in the background.","April 20","true","7.8"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","83","24","29","15","0"

North Africa is now under the control of IS, who is gathering a large army to launch the invasion of Europe via the Mediterranean Sea. NATO headquarters knows the exact locations of the launch, and is in need of courageous soldiers to stand against the invader until the end! Soldier, it is time to fight for the free world! Sign here to enrol!\n\nIS Defence is an action / rail shooter game where you take control of a NATO soldier who is stationed on a vantage point with his machine gun, and you have to kill as many invaders as possible until your glorious death.  This game has three maps available to you: The Sicilians Shores, The Spanish Harbour and The Croatian Mainland. You will have to beat the first map to unlock the second, and the second map to unlock the third.  To do so you will have to eliminate a specific number of terrorists and vehicles.\n\nAt the start of a game, you will be stationary with your machine-gun, a rocket launcher and a certain amount of ammunition. You will notice two gauges on your screen; on the left is the support gauge and on the right your health gauge. Each time you eliminate an enemy (soldier or vehicle) you will see the left gauge going up and each time you pass a certain level, you will be able to call on your support team for assistance, which includes: supplies, infantry, artillery, airstrikes and helicopters. On the other hand, each time you get shot, or a suicidal enemy soldier manages to blow himself up at your vantage point, your right gauge will decrease really quickly until you see a black screen, which will mean that it’s game over! Also, you will acquire skill points in each map and use them to either upgrade yourself, your machine gun, your rocket launcher or your support calls. I really like the progressive difficulty throughout each map of the game. You will find that the first couple of waves will be nice and simple to eliminate, but then you will need to know the right support combination to stay alive as long as you can. It will become a fast and furious game, and you will have plenty of fun.\n\nGraphically the game looks good, with great explosions here, there and everywhere. Good sound effects, too! In my opinion, however, the soldier’s animations could have been better.\n\nIt is a short game - you will probably unlock the other 2 maps within 3.5 hours but you will surely come back to it over and over. It is a fun game.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics\n-	Good skills tree\n-	Fast, fun and addictive gameplay\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Only 3 maps available\n-	Soldiers animation could have been better\n\nIS Defence is a fun and fast rail shooter, it will keep you shooting for hours!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Plus it will have modding support, which means more maps and user-made content.\n\nAs for the gameplay:\n-You play as a turret gunner, so you can't move around, just change which direction you are shooting at.  You have a machine gun and rocket launcher at your disposal.\n-Killing enemies fills up your Support XP bar, which allows you to call in supply crates (health & rocket ammo), infantry squads, artillery strikes, airstrikes and helicopters support.\n-The enemies never stop coming; at first there's few but the enemy assault builds up in intensity until they overwhelm you.  The objective is to survive as long as possible.  Eventually it get's very chaotic.\n-You can unlock permanent upgrades by killing enemies.  This ranges from more gun stability, to explosive rounds and eventually no need to reload.  These upgrades make surviving longer and completing the harder levels possible.\n\nThe game runs well, I get no lag spikes, tearing or anything I would complain about.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Irongear/recommended/448370/","Irongear","Prinz Eugen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Irongear/","181 products in account","Yes. Yes. And a million times: YES!\n\nDelivered by the developers of the probably most controversial game "Hatred" comes their newest work: IS Defense.\nSo what is it about? In case you haven't noticed already, the game is set in a unreal (yet scaringly possible) future where ISIS has taken over north Africa and is starting an offensive against Europe. Your job is to stop them, one Bullet at a time...\n\n(TL;DR in the end)\n\nFirst things first, I don't like rail shooters. I don't like them at all. But this game does not feel like a rail shooter, more like a first-person tower defense, and it's totally AWESOME!\n\nPLOT:\nYour only task in the game is to pop some Jihadists. How? It's up to you.\nUnlike other railshooters (even though I won't count IS Defense as one) you don't just click with your cursor across the screen, instead you're placed on a stationary fortificated hill with a Machine gun (unlimited ammo, but magazine size of 200 shots) and a Bazooka (you start with 6 shots, you get more via supply drops, I'll get to them later), which can turn around 360 degrees.\n\nAlong with your weapons, you are given a variety of point streaks (Supply drop, Infantry support, Artillery support, Air support and Helicopter support). They are all feeding from the same score pool, that means if you call in a support, you will maybe not be able to call in a different one.\n\nWhile you're mowing down the islamist invaders, you gain XP, which gives your character level ups. At each level up you get one point, which can be spent in your skill tree (4 branches: Player, Machine gun, Rockets, support), which works like most other skill trees (get the lower skills to unlock higher ones, the higher ones cost more points).\n\nMAPS:\nThe game is really hard in the beginning, but the more games you play, the stronger your character gets, the easier the game gets. Then you unlock the next map, which is harder and requires you to rank up higher to beat it etc.\nI've only played the first 2 maps yet and I have to say that the developers did great work with them. I was expecting the maps to be the same with just a different look, but they aren't. While the first map is an open beach, the second map is a harbor. Where the first map was feeling hard first because of the wide field the enemies were approaching from, you will miss this wide open field in the second map. The enemies rush out of several buildings, stand on the roofs and rush around the corner with their armored cars (yes, they don't just have Toyotas with Machine guns).\n\nENEMIES:\nThe enemies vary from regular infantry, infantry with rocket launchers, suicide bombers, Toyotas and armored cars (at least I have seen so far)\nWatch out for the suicide bombers tho. They're easy to spot (red clothing, suicide belt and running directly at you without a gun continously shouting in Arabic) as long as all is chilled, but when the whole screen is full of enemies, you suddenly see a Kebab infront of your face and the game is over. Regular infantry will also throw grenades when they come close to you and run away when they're on fire. The enemy vehicles try to (and WILL) run over your infantry, watch out for them. When you shoot the driver of a Toyota while the car is in motion, the car will go loose, may run over people, crash into a building, drive into the ocean and die or just turn in circles until it explodes from the fire.\nAll in all, the AI is perfect.\n\nPOINT STREAKS:\n\nSupply drops: A dropship will drop a crate with either health or rockets into the combat zone. Shoot the crate to get it. Upgrades increase the crate number or the contents itself (like 100% health regen).\nMy suggestion: stockpile your crates so you can shoot the health boxes when you need them instead of calling a drop when you're low at health and die.\n\nInfantry support: My favourite one so far. This steak calls in a group of friendly soldiers (marked with a blue diamond) to fight the enemies. Not only do they help you get more kills, they also distract the enimes from you, giving you more time to fight more enemies, reload, etc.\nMy suggestion: Use as much as possible.\n\nArtillery support: Covers the combat zone with Artillery. Impacts are random and they might (and WILL) hit your allies too. Also the standard one is really short.\nMy suggestion: Upgrade to the longer lasting artillery and when you use it, call in the infantry after the shelling is over.\n\nAir support: Call in jets that nuke (not really) the combat zone. More effective but more expensive than artillery.\nMy suggestion: Use it when you can affort it.\n\nHelicopter support: Calls in an attack helicopter that attacks anything hostile on the combat zone. Destroys Toyotas in the blink of a second and really takes some weight off your shoulders.\nMy suggestion: Use it when there's heavy enemy activity.\n\nGRAPHICS/AMBIENT\nThe graphics are great, as you would expect it from a 2016 game. The game is running great on High-Ultra settings for me, only having massive lags sometimes when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan but it only lasts a short moment and continues fluently afterwards.\nThe explosions are realistic, shells are flying across the screen, blood, gore and corpses everywhere (you can set the body count in the options, I suggest "unlimited" for the ultimae Kebab removal experience. The vehicles behave very realistic (like stated in the "enemies" section). The game is really packing and you wil feel the adrenaline rush through your body while you're defending Europe from the terrorist invaders.\n\nMODS\nI tested no mods so far because the mod support just came in, but I expect some great stuff from you guys.\n\n\nTL;DR\nThis is the ultimate fast-paced first-person kebab remover game in the world. Get it. GET IT NOW!","April 29","true","3.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/448370/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","Destructive Creations, no strangers to courting controversy, serve up another slice of interesting gaming that's almost certainly going to get Polygon foaming at the mouth. Funny thing is, there's a good game here too, and it's cheap!\nSo, IS Defence. Islamic State. Dieties bless you Destructive Creations. First you riff Postal with "Hatred" which was a decent enough attempt at Postal, it wasn't -great-, but it was good enough, and despite all the controversy, it was a good enough "shoot everyone" game much in the same vein as Postal. It was a bit clunky, it was definitely cheesy, and much like Postal, it is almost certainly going to be one of those interest pieces that lots of more progressive media pieces chew over and fill their virtual birdcages with down the line on slow news days.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, now you're going to riff Beach Head, another classic game, except this time for the controversy angle you're throwing Islamic State into the mix. I mean, fair play to you, you're based in Poland, so the chances of someone running at you with a suicide vest isn't exactly high, but this is a bit like throwing a red rag to the bull here. The people you're aiming this one at aren't exactly renowned for their sense of humour to put it lightly.\n\nThat aside, is the game actually good? Well the answer is "mostly very, and for what they're charging, absolutely"\n\nStrip away the political undercurrrent and what you have is an Unreal 4 version of Beach Head, very well executed and with a very high, almost Arcade difficulty\nPut this in an arcade cabinet with some appropriate controls, and this thing would eat your loose change like no tomorrow. Seriously, it's hard, really hard. The first map will take a good dozen attempts before you secure a good foothold and get the hang of what's going on, the second map will throw a whole new set of problems at you (such as your friendly Islamic State militants deciding that a sea only approach is a bit last year, they can now come at you over the road an on the roof of buildings), I'm working on unlocking the third map but there's a good likelihood that'll add even more verticality and yet more difficulty into the mix. This is not by any measure a game where you can autopilot your way to victory. You need to prioritise your targets, get rid of the most dangerous threats, and keep an eye on what's going on at all times, as well as call down your various cooldowns as they become available.\n\nOn top of this you have a simple meta levelling tree that offers a nice solid selection of useful upgrades (which in turn make the later levels much more viable), and the ability to fully rotate the turret on it's "rail", which is important for dealing with flanking actions. Graphically at max settings it looks pretty, not jaw dropping, but pretty, with everything represented well enough, and the enemy soldiers flying through the air when the explosions begin the light up the scenery (as well as the beach surf turning red once enough of them die on the first map, that was pleasant!).\n\nSound effects are passable, not amazing, but passable, in fact a lot of the game can be said to be much the same as Hatred, it's not going to win awards, it's not going to be the high watermark of any particular area, but this is good, solid entertainment, and as a remake of the original Beach Head, without any unnecessary frills or spills, it achieves what it's set out to do, and it does it with a solid level of competency. Most importantly, it's priced at a point which places it firmly in the "impulse buy" area, which means that if you're hesitant, you've really not got too much to lose in giving it a whirl.\n\nClosing thoughts\nDestructive Creations are getting a rep for taking old concepts and remaking them very competently, first Postal and now Beach Head, and controversial slants aside, both of these have been executed with decent skill. Neither have been exemplary in either case, but they've been solid entries in the catalog, if these are opening entries in what Destructive Creations can manage, and in time they come up with bigger and better things, then this is a good sign of things to come. As for this one? If you enjoyed Beach Head, well, for the price asked, it's a gimme. If this kind of game isn't your bag, you can safely skip it, it's not going to sell the unconverted.\n\nVerdict : Recommended to fans of the genre, pass if you're not up for shooting a lot of dudes from a fixed turret.","April 20","true","1.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Let me explain, on one side I consider a game good if it took me to complete it about 1 hour for every € I spent, and I finished this game and got all skills in about 4 hours  (and I am a mediocre shooter player at best), while the prize is about 7€...that being said, like all Destructive Creations games, it was a Cathartic experience that I will gladly come back to blow some Steam from time to time.\n\nComparissons to HATRED don't stop there, like in HATRED the controversy and "edgy" theme is actually more challenging than the gameplay, which is pretty safe, from gameplay standpoint the game is solid, if unoriginal. It is pretty difficult and the guys at Destructive Creations are very talented, which kinda doubles the frustration because I really want to see them experimenting and innovating gameplay. Oh and a Coop mode would have made wonders for this.\n\nTo close the review I have to say that I would have loved a couple more maps, maybe on Lesbos or other points in the Balkans other than Croatia, fortunately the game is very moddeable so we may see a lot more content from the users if it picks up enough Steam.\n\nNow it may have been just me, but while I liked the textures and models for the Daesh soldiers, the ones for the NATO troops seem kinda low res...it bugs me a little in between all the explosions and allahu akbars...","April 23","true","5.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You are part of NATO forces and you'll have to defend Europe from ISIS attacks. Will you survive?\n\nIntroduction\nFirst, I have to add some kind of disclaimer reading other reviews from gamers. This game is NOT islamophobic. ISIS is a terrorist faction as many others related or non-related with religion. Please don't say Muslims are terrorist, they are not and many of them are suffering because ISIS. Just look at the news, OK?\n\nAre you stressed? Just play IS defense and kill terrorists!\n\nI don't use to play shooter games but I liked this one. The setting is something attractive to play.\n\nIS Defense is a great "what if" for a third world war. If you like shooter war games this is a great option to try. Here you have to kill terrorists and vehicles,\n\nGraphics are awesome also the amazing sound of bullets and missiles. Launch a missile from your Barrett and you will see a great slow motion scene, also, if a bomb explodes near you, the sound will knock out you a little. That's an amazing and realistic thing I like in this game. Each map has is unique and you'll have a lot of fun.\n\nGameplay\nYou are sitting with your Barrett ready to kill terrorists. You'll have the chance of use bullets or missiles. Try to kill all vehicles and people before they kill you. Use E and Q to move to your flanks in case of attack and don't let them taking your position. Also, you'll have the chance sometimes to ask for infantry and of course supplies, wich means extra missiles and health.\n\nWhile playing you'll get some skill points to improve your health and your killer skills. Once you complete a 100% of the map you'll have the chance of continue with the rest.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIn my experience, this is a great game to passing time killing terrorists. It's funny how gets complicated with a lot of enemies and you have to use well your resources and don't waste missiles. The game worths it, buy it and play!","April 29","true","10.0"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","2"

Now this isnt going to be a bashing review. Im going to give both positives and negatives\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n-Simplicity, Its a simple game with a simple goal, kill everything that hates democracy\n\n-The guns and explosions- The gunplay is fun, its a stationary shooter where you get to mow down durkas with a big machine gun and a rocket launcher, the explosions are beautiful and very well animated\n\n-Repetitive, but a fun kind of repetitive.The goal is the same on every map, kill durkas. Each map has a level of difficulty and  I find myself dying after a short while but that doesnt stop me from trying again because its too damn fun.\n\n-The skill tree has very nice skills that will really help you out in the long run,\n\n-The help you get to call in ( Soldiers, air strikes, Helicopters) gives the game more life, its not just you versus the Isis horde, you get to call in soldiers to help fight and get to call in air strikes to annihilate everything arund you (Your soldiers included so be careful.\n\n\nTHE BAD:  theres gonna be a bit of stuff here so bare with me\n\n- The graphics look great but makes my coputer run a little hotter than I like.\n\n-The Soldiers skins arent so beautiful, youll notice that looking at your troops closely show that they look very bland and the skin quality is very low\n\n-AI can sometimes be very dumb, Ill have friendly troops all the way across the map shooting at durkas from a distance, Enemy cars tend to crash into other burnt cars or just plain crash into your MG nest.\n\n-The animations are a little wonky for enemies and friendlies alike, it seems as if they took the animation from the soldiers in hatred and just pasted it in there and said "Good enough"\n\n-Sounds are great but also have sound clips from the game hatred as well, in my opinion thats kind of lazy\n\n- The progression system is too fast for my taste. I get too many skillpoints too fast, kinda makes me feel less accomplished if I can 8 skill points in one game\n\n-Overall the game just seems rushed an unpolished, it looks like it needs some work\n\nThats my review, this is still a great game for the price tag and I deffinately recommend you give this game a try\n","May 2","true","3.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Runs pretty well while looking pretty good and comes with a decent amount of replayabilty even before the built in modding capabilties.\n\n\n\nWriting a review before the inevitable ♥♥♥♥♥torm some of the game media website are bound to stur up.\nIts obvious the dev team choose what on the outside looking in would be a 'controversial' topic. Thing is ISIS is a ♥♥♥♥ing abhorrent terrorist organization and perhaps the most pressing threat to the first world/western civilization making them an obvious antagonistic force not just off their own 'power' or ability but much of the sympathy they seem to be getting from people within the very nations they would sooner see burned to the ground. If media outlets are shilling this game out as racist or islamaphobic just remember that nearly 10 years back CoD4 did about the same thing over the course of its campaign and is still lauded as perhaps the last 'good' call of duty.\n\nThe game plays well, for a 5 dollar game on steam you could definitely get much worse, less polished, and typically perpetually stuck in 'early access' game. Compared to those IS defense is a godsend.\n\nIts a waved based survival "rail shooter" stressing the rail of course as you never actually move from your spot however you do pivot in a full 360 degree area most of the action dealing with the front line and usually needing the pivot for flanks within the game to deal with enemies behind you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/448370/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","It was with much trepidation that I decided to feature Destructive Creations second game on Steam IS Defense. My initial fear was that this was just going to be a trash game without  much thought  or effort put into the game. I was expecting a poorly executed political message and one that played on people’s fears and hatred of the Islamic State. I was expecting a game was almost designed to leave a bad taste in the mouths of non-radical Muslims around the world. After all, this is the same indie developer that developed and published Hatred – a game that is banned in Australia and obviously which I cannot purchase from Steam. Hatred has to have been one of the most controversial games released onto Steam in the past couple of years. That they followed with a game where the player’s task is to kill the Islamic State is surely one of the very few ways in which they could have found an even more troubled subject matter.\n\nHowever, I can say that after playing the game that I believe that my expectations were in fact wrong. IS Defense may in fact prove to be a controversial game and others may find the game to be offensive or in bad taste but I do not believe that this will prove to be overwhelmingly so especially when compared to Hatred. In fact I would go so far as to suggest that I found the game to be a pleasing back to the future type game of some of the games that I have vivid memories of enjoying when I was a youngster. Games such as Operation Wolf, Beach Head, Bad Dog McCree and Dynamite Duke. It is the type of on rails shooter experience that isn’t often made anymore because modern technologies has far surpassed the minimalistic style gameplay available to make games back in those days. In the past the level of controversy featuring such anti-western subject matter (e.g. the United States Vs. Russia, games based on the Vietnam War, etc.) have had some controversy but the majority have been able to ignore it. Therefore I surmise that the controversy here is that the subject matter is so fresh and in our face that some may find it offensive.\n\nBefore writing this feature I went so far as to approaching an Islamic friend that I have long had on Steam in regards to his opinion on the game. His opinion is much in the same way as many of the reviews are on the Steam game page. He claims that he is not offended by the material because IS is absolute extremist Islam and does not and will likely never represent true Islam. Therefore he claims that those who claim the game to be “Islamaphobic” are absolutely wrong. However, he does urge that those who consider playing the game to understand the cultural and religious differences between a common non-extremist Islamic person and an extremist. The gulf between the two, he argues, is just as significant as someone claiming to be Christian or Catholic and an Atheist.\n\nI believe that the opening video – which thankfully can be skipped entirely before launching the game – provides a very realistic and somewhat educated viewpoint of the potential IS has over the coming years.  It also does a very good job of setting the game up. Sadly, in my opinion, it is by far the best part of the game. For a full release game that is asking consumers $7.99 per copy you’re getting three maps and some repetitive shooting game play – fire IS troops with your weapon or use a rocket launcher to kill them. It’s very basic but so too were the same type of game decades ago. What is fresh, however, is the nice usage of special effects in the form of explosions and other visuals. The computer AI is hit and miss and not something that I expect will be memorable.  A bit more effort into the development of the game could have turned it into a memorable title but at the end of the day it is the subject matter that is the most memorable aspect of the game.\n\nIf you’re looking for a relatively short on rails shooter that deals with potential real world futurism then IS Defense is worth a look in.","May 2","true","7.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It is hard at first, this is a game where it's impossible not to die. You'll die, a lot starting out. You get endless waves of enemies until you die, but it gets easier or at least to where you can live longer without dieing as you unlock talent/skill point abilities. For instance, i only was able to kill 50 terrorists before being over run when starting out, about an hour later I was killing 200-300, right now i'm killing 700-1000s at a time without dieing.There are fully destructable environments, you can shoot anything and destroy it, vehicles, walls, everything. It's pretty amazing for the price, the graphics are pretty good, I give it a 10/10 for the price. Glad I picked this one up, it's really fun. I almost gave up on it in the first hour because like I said it was too hard and I felt like an idiot dying so easily, but I realize there's no way to really win, it's endless waves and you'll be over run eventually they dont run out of terrorists, but lasting longer made it fun, it gets utterly chaotic at about 6-7 minutes in, everything destroyed, you can't even tell what's going on hardly anymore how cluttered the screen is how many explosions are going on, it's amazing fun.

Germans, Russians, Koreans, whatever enemy the US has at any given moment are usually fair game in, uh, games.\n\nWhat we have here is basically an arcade shooter. It is a sort of tower defense where you act as a lone tower with a few abilities at your command, as well as an RPG element with a talent tree that will help health regeneration, give troops more health, and more rocket ammo. There’s a lot more but that’s just an example.\nYou start with a beach level where you have to kill 2,000 terrorists. Sounds like a lot, and I died only 300 enemies in… the first time. Turns out all the experience and talents you earn are cumulative. When I ‘failed’ the second time It added my ~700 kills to the previous 300 and then I was at ~1000 or so into unlocking the second map.\n\nYou have several weapons in your arsenal including five different active abilities that “Charge up” as you kill enemies. The level 1 is a supply drop and the level 2 summons a few ground troops that I find are actually extremely helpful. After summoning about three groups of them I pushed fairly far into one game.\n\nI will admit, the game feels good. I can understand how some people may find it boring but I find the explosions satisfying and I like watching the evolution from a peaceful beachfront to a horrifying warzone.\n\nThe game has more depth than readily apparent. There’s a sort of resource management to a degree. The skills you get work in tiers. For example, if I used the Tier 3 ability (Artillery bombardment), That bar would tank down to the first tier ability (The supply drop). The more you save, the more powerful supports you receive, culminating on an attack chopper that sticks around for a couple minutes to give you some much needed breathing room.\nAnd the supply drops don’t go away when they drop, you have to shoot the large boxes to benefit from them. So if the support drops a health, you can leave it there for emergencies. So you have to balance your support out; Sometimes I call for a supply drop but don’t do anything with the health boxes it drops until later on.\nYou also have to worry about suicide bombers so you can’t just ignore all the ground troopers and focus on vehicles.\n\nThe whole game is a unique balancing act of quick decision making “Should I do this… or this?” This is impressive for very simple mechanics.\nNot something you’d spend all day on but it’s a neat little sprint to see just how far you can get, and if you can beat your last high score (Which you probably can considering you probably have a couple new skills in your arsenal).","May 20","true","3.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","2"

This was my first time playing a rail shooter.  There is an elegance in it's simplicity but do not mistake simplicity for boring or trite.  This game is far from boring.  I even boosted up the sensetivity of my mouse.  The unlocking of perks and the desire to beat your best time keeps you coming back.\nI've never been able to meditate.  The closest I come is going to gun ranges.  It's just me and the target.  All the background noise of the day just vanishes.  A similar thing happens when playing IS Defense.  I'm not listening to conversations in Teamspeak or Mumble.  I'm stratagizing but almost autonomously.  Not as labor intensivley as I would while playing chess per say.  It's just me and the targets and in the middle of the chaos I am at peace.\n\nOh and there's the added bonus of the price being less than a modest tip at a restaurant.

They took over all of Northern Africa, spreading their genocidal understanding of the world’s order. Strongly armed, vast in numbers and prepared for everything, the Islamic State is launching the invasion upon Europe, over the entire Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe player takes the role of NATO’s stationary machine-gun operator, deployed to defend the shores of Europe. His task is to blast as many of the invaders as possible, until his glorious death. To do so, he has NATO support forces, his Machinegun and Rocket Launcher at his disposal. During the progress of this heroic defense, he gets the opportunities to upgrade his gear, his body and army rank – which affects the efficiency of the called support.\n\nThis game is our small side-project and is our personal veto against what is happening in the Middle East nowadays. As well as an attempt at resurrecting a pretty dead genre of games like „Operation Wolf” or „Beach Head” – in a state of the art, modern adaptation.\n\nRecommended?\nYes!","April 24","true","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If anyone remembers the old BeachHead series arcade games from way back you willrecognise this game. Its a Classic Turret Defense, mindless survival against waves of ever growing enemies, The more kills you get the more perks you can call in. You also have a skill tree allowing you to upgrade and cause even more carnage. This is an arcade classic with a bit of a new twist and pretty decent graphics.\n\nNow for the political part. If this game had unnamed terrorists then it would go unnoticed and not a single person would complain. They could be Soviets, Nazis, Chinese, Koreans, and absolutley noone would give a rats ♥♥♥. But so many people are afraid of this islamaphobia crap that they dont like this game, because they used a modern threat, A legitimate threat thats known throughout every household people have their panties in a bunch. This isnt kill all muslims, or Immigrant Slaughter Simulator. This is a game where you defend a beach from ISIS forces. No different than say if they made it defending new york from a nazi invasion or Red Dawn as a turret defense.\n\nIf you really want to ignore this fun game and rally for its removal because you think being against ISIS is racist or islamaphobic then you should also rally for the KKK and Nazi symbolism to be socially accepteptable.\n\nLong story short this is a fun game, no matter who the enemy is. The turret defence style game needed a comeback and I think this is the best attemptp to brong it back.

It quickly turned into a big chaotic battlefield.\nYou can see limbs flying off, IS soldiers crawling their last moments towards you, suicide bombers can be shot to explode their entire squad, machine gunners run out of their vehicles before the vehicle explodes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlyramon/recommended/448370/","deadlyramon","Deadly Ramon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadlyramon/","976 products in account","IS Defense is a first person shooting gallery in which the player defends various European areas against an endless supply of fanatical and militant Mohammedans.\n\nOccurring in the year 2020, it depicts an expanded and aggressive ISIS assuming control of the entire Middle East (including apparently Israel) and North Africa, after which it sets its sights across the Mediterranean Sea.  Not content with mere infiltration of Middle Eastern refugee groups, these undocumented immigrants invade Europe equipped with everything from their conventional armaments (small arms, technicals, skiffs) to military grade weaponry (humvees, armored troop transport ships, etc.).\n\nThe game is very similar to Beach Head 2000 and its sequels, but avoids many of Beach Head's shortcomings by including more contemporary game mechanics such as skill points (which unlock features like faster reload times, explosive ammunition, and increased health), the ability to summon power-ups (supply drops, allied infantry, and apparently airstrikes and mortar bombardments (the last two I haven't yet experienced in the game, though certain parts of the skill tree that I haven't yet unlocked indicate such elements)), and having more than one environment (the game starts the player defending the shores of Sicily, with other settings becoming accessible only after a certain number of enemy troops and vehicles are eliminated; the progress carries over into each new game), so IS Defense, while still easily accessible to the less than hardcore gamers, is also a lot more advanced than the more casual Beach Head games.\n\nAn extra touch I particularly enjoy about the game is the roaming camera that sweeps the area after death.  The oncoming hordes are still rushing and chanting their war cries, carcasses litter the scene (there's a feature under the advanced graphics options to have the corpse limit set to "unlimited"), any remaining allied troops still fight to the last man, and I've even seen enemy vehicles fatally run over their own jihadists!  Any supply drops requested just before death are also shown faithfully carrying out their last mission, so I wouldn't be surprised if I see enemy fighters get crushed by the dropped crates someday.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent effort from a gaming studio of modest means, and I hope to see some DLC for it in which the player must defend American shores from the Islamofascists.","April 20","true","6.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

Simple and very effective ( ADDICTIVE ) gameplay. Great graphics ( A bonus ). If you like beautiful explosions, gore, total destruction of your enemies AND MASS CHAOS, then do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this game. It supports mods and i can already see a WW2 mod for this game.  ( map editing, ect ect ) The price for this game is next to theft, considering the well executed gameplay this title boasts.\n\nAnother important factor is the controls are simple. If you are new to m/k, this game is a superb place to start and get intimate with your now found controls. If your looking to play FPS on PC and are worried about the frustrations of M/K, This game will train you on the basics of aiming and multi botton usage.\n\nI have no complaints based on what is represented.  An excellent game. My regards to Destructive Creations for bringing back an old game style long dead since the arcades. Thank you for making a bad ♥♥♥ game with good execution.  ONE REQUEST!!!!

I also might add it is a bit of challenge, espically when you start fresh with no upgrades, I have not gone past the first stage but even with a few upgrades I last maybe 7 minutes on average. All im saying is its not easy. I would say 8 USD is kind of stretching it but its not going to break the bank, this is something I would probably pay 5 USD for so maybe catch it on a sale. Ive only played a few rounds of the first level but I can tell I will be investing alot of time into the game.\n\nThe entire game is sitting stationary with a turret/missle launcher killing endless waves of ISIS terrorists. You can level up your weapons and speical abilities. After you reach a certain amount of points you can call in things like air strikes, ground support and care packages that heal you and give ammo. Its a fun game and has a ton of replay value if you want to earn all those achievements.

It's a tower defense rails shooter, so if you like that kind of game, this is great for the price.

Well, if the turret sections in shooters were anywhere near as good as this, maybe most people wouldn't hate them?  This is just mindless killing fun and what boils down to survival mode (you're eventually going to get overwhelmed, it's a matter of surviving as long as you can and killing as many enemies as possible), but it's executed really well.  You're in a motorized turret that can turn 360 degrees.  Wave after wave of terrorists are coming at you and you mow them down.  You have a machine gun and a rocket launcher.  you gain experience and can spend skill points for upgrades (faster moving bullets, incendiary rockets, more health, etc.)  You can call in supply drops, infantry help, artilery support, air strikes, an helicopter support.\n\nIt's a simple game that's well executed and a good bit of fun.

An on-rails wave survival  turret shooter.\n\n---- Plot ----\n\nIn a politically-fictional setting, the year is 2020, ISIS controls all of the Middle East and the North African region through their conquest of world domination. They're next major step? The invasion of Europe.\n\nYou are put into the boots of a NATO stationary machine-gun operator whose task is to stop the assault by any means given.\n\n---- Weapons and Skills ----\n\nYou're only given two weapons here, a M240 Bravo (at least I think it is) and a rocket launcher. At first starting out, your weapons are fairly weak. Over time, when you start leveling and gaining skill points, your two weapons can take out ememies and vehicles with ease with the upgrades you can earn.\n\nWith skills points you can make your MG shoot faster and deal damage harder, etc. Give your rockets the option to shoot incendiary rockets, bigger blast radius, reload faster, etc. Better support help like "Special Forces" which gives your infantry more health, make your chopper fire rockets. There are quite a bit of skills to put to use here.\n\n---- Enemies ----\n\nISIS, duh, but in three varieties. Basic rifleman that will shoot at you. Suiciders that will rush your pillbox in an attempt to kill you. Technicals and stolen Hummvees with LMGs on them that deal little damage if you tackle one. In pairs or more, they'll shred your health if you not careful.\n\n---- Support ----\n\nSupply Drops - refills your health or rockets\n\nInfantry - helps handle ground targets\n\nArtillery Shelling - handles ground and vehicle targets\n\nAirstrikes (my favorite) - drops bomb payloads onto ground targets and vehicle targets like artillery, but more damage\n\nand lastly, Chopper - does everything the others can do.\n\nEach one can be upgraded in some way with skill points earned.\n\n---- Overall ----\n\nThis game reminds me of Boom Beach, and other rail shooters. Great game to spend time playing to see how far you can last against wave upon wave of fighters. If you unlock all the skills and plan accordingly, you'll be almost unkillable. This game was a side project for the devs and lasts maybe 2-3 hours ..ish and for $8.

But the game looks pretty/runs great on my machine, the reinforcement/support system is nice, and blowing up the little boats is REALLY satisfying. My advice is upgrade your machine gun as it makes the game way more fun when you a) don't have to reload every five seconds and b) can actually blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of things instead of pouring ammo into a truck and waiting years for it to finally blow up.\n\n8/10, simple game without much variety but really, really fun.\n\nP.S. I guess some people could view this game as offensive. But it's not like you're mowing down innocent Muslims and the game is telling you that Muslims are bad or something. The game makes it very clear that you're fighting ISIS only and if you think it's offensive to make a game about mowing down ISIS terrorists I think you need to adjust your definition of "offensive." It's basically like if someone made a game where you just shot Nazis.

Worth more than a similarly priced fast food combo meal.\n\nIt's a simple yet challenging static defense game, which plays like it belongs in an old school arcade.  No, it's not a rail shooter.  This train ain't going anywhere unfortunately.\n\nPros:\n\nKill Islamic State.  'nuff said.\n\nPretty graphics, lots of fire and explosions.  The smoke, mist, and vegetation obscuring the battlefield give it a realistic feel that makes you question if the daeshbags are coming.  (get UAV skill to end this problem)\n\nGets challenging and strategic.  You have to deal with flanking attacks, and balance your supply, infantry, artillery, airstrike, and chopper support.  Decisions have to be made very quickly.\n\nThe real time leaders board that updates as you play.  Good call.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCons:\n\nToo short.  There's only three levels.\n\nAI is stooopid, even considering that they're daeshbags.  Drivers will run over their own infantry, and crash into things.  Vehicles don't move intelligently, they seem to just follow a set path and smash through anything in the way.  Enemy and friendly infantry make no use of cover and concealment or even keeping one's head down.\n\nThere's only a few enemy types I've seen so far.  Infantry, suicide bombers, trucks, humvees, and the three different landing boats.  When you play your first game you'll see all of them.  Nothing new to see through game progression except the two other maps.\n\nDebris piles up and clutters the battlefield pretty badly.  This is a good feature sometimes, but annoying when an enemy truck parks behind a pile of blown up vehicles and can't be hit.  Also messes with enemy vehicle pathing.  It looks silly when infantry are standing on top of a wrecked truck engulfed in flames and don't even notice.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWishlist:\n\nMore maps.\n\nMore enemy types.  Tanks, rocketeers, car bombs, armored personnel carriers, etc.  Make advanced infantry that throw grenades if they get too close.\n\nMake it an actual rail shooter.  Do convoy security.  Have to protect the friendly vehicles in the convoy until they get to their destination.  You could string along the missions and incorporate a light storyline instead of making them all a fight to the death.  Ideally this entire game would be just an added survival mode feature while a campaign mode made the bulk of the game.\n\nI hope you incorporate such into sequels/expansions.","April 19","true","4.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

There isn't a lot to it, structure-wise: you have three levels and four skill trees, and you use a machine gun, rocket launcher, and five different support abilities to destroy waves of attacking soldiers and vehicles. It's very reminiscent of classic arcade games, both in its structure and in its difficulty.\n\nIts simplicity works in its favor, given how the game progresses. You aren't just completing a stage by defeating X waves of enemies and moving on to the next; your objective is to last as long as possible against an increasingly intense assault, with your eventual score ranked according to both your number of kills and the length of time you spent alive. At the beginning of the game, you're going to die early and often, but as you play, you rack up skill points which you can invest into persistent upgrades across attempts.\n\nAs you unlock increasingly powerful abilities, you find yourself able to last just a little bit longer each time, and there's a real element of challenge involved in learning how and when to use your support abilities as well as what to prioritize and when. The real challenge of the game is not to finish all three maps (which will happen pretty much no matter what, as "finishing" a map is as simple as racking up a certain number of kills across your playthroughs), but to push yourself to see how long you can last. And you will eventually lose: like the recently released Devil Daggers, "winning" just means getting further than anyone else before you bite it.\n\nMy main criticism is a lack of enemy variety: there are normal old soldiers, suicide bombers, technicals, humvees, and three types of landing craft (pontoons, and small and large troop carriers). I'd have liked to see more, different types of soldiers (engineers, grenadiers, machinegunners) or enemy air units. But for the price, and the amount of visual spectacle going on, this is an easy recommendation for a few hours of relaxing rat-a-tat.","April 20","true","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's just an obsolete genre. Uninventive, boring, lazy. But somehow... Destructive Creations is trying to sell us one. This one is with a twist! Defend Europe from terrorism. A bit of controversy, to fuel the sales. It won't help. IS Defense is plain boring. Game developers didn't even bothered with designing proper levels. Every stage is just a survival with inevitable death at some point. You can't win. You just unlock next stage when you kill designated number of Islamist terrorists. Great design, no skill needed. You can just play the level over and over again... Eventually, you'll stack up the necessary kill numbers.... And next level. Same thing. Wow, you need to be such lazy to design such a bland mechanic...\n\nOn The top of that - shooting can be fun. For... Few moments. Explosions, overall mayhem - it's cool. For 15 minutes. Mostly after few minutes of gameplay the screen is filled with wrecks ., flames and dead bodies - it's hard to see something.Then suddenly you just die. Enemies just overwhelm you. Enormous fun.\n\nDon't bother. Rail shooters are dead. IS Defense maybe is technically a decent product. But content-wise? Gameplay-wise? Lacking. Hollow.

This is not an excellent game. It's a mediocre one. Do you like games where you stay in one spot and fight off endless waves of enemies until you ultimately die and get your score tallied up? Then you'll probably be okay with this one. Otherwise, you should probably pass. Even for people who enjoy the gameplay, they might find it somewhat stale after a while. In my case, I played it for about three hours. Two of those hours were spent dying over and over again until I finally unlocked all the perks. The entire third hour was spent on the "desert" level, gunning down the same waves ad nauseam and realizing, holy ♥♥♥♥, I'm effectively invincible. This is as hard as it's going to get. I won't lose unless I actively sabotage myself and self-impose challenges (i.e. conveniently missing all the supply boxes, forgetting to call in infantry, etc.)\n\nI look forward to seeing what kind of new life is infused into this game through its mod support, but the vanilla game, as it stands, is ultimately bland and forgettable. Get it if it's on sale, but at full price, you're better off elsewhere.","May 4","false","5.0"," 15 of 54 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","15","54","2","1"
