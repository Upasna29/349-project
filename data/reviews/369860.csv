The visuals are of fine commercial quality and the controls are acceptable as long as you don't go crazy with them. With some tinkering this could be a winner.","May 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I say the price reflects what you get. About 90 minutes of game time, but considering it is 2 dubloons, thats a steal. Pretty much the store page says everything, with all the comic relief included. If you are looking for a casual inexpensive snake game this is it. Do I think it should be on steam? No, but I got my dollars worth so I give it my thumbs up.","November 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Ugh.\n\nBut worse yet, this game has some of the absolute WORST responsiveness to your keyboard presses trying to control the snake then any snake game I have every played.\n\nI was generous in my scoring to give this game a 29% score, even with it's low $2.99 USD price tag.\n\nAs I noted to the developer in the above video, if the developer fixes the responsiveness of this game to be immediate and really responsive over what it's at now, I'll be more then happy to re-review this game.  But right now, this game is lucky to get a 29% score from me.  It fails at by far the most important facet of any snake game, game control!  Ugh.\n\n","May 14, 2015","false","0.2"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","11","21","2","2"
