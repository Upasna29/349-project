I'm sitting in front of my Pentium II PC and I've just finished installing Baldur's Gate. I've crafted my perfect character, and I'm now adventuring through a gorgeous world. I've fallen headfirst into the game reading novels worth of text and not noticing as hours melt away.\n\nIt's 17 years later. I'm 34 years old. I'm doing it all over again and it's like I'm travelling through time.\n\nEvery aspect of this game is perfect. I wouldn't change it even if I could. I find myself wondering how in-game mechanics work and I'm tempted to alt+tab and google what spell is best. Instead I just keep playing and figure it out myself. I can't even *remember* the last time I didn't look up this sort of info in a game. Who cares if this sword does a little more damage than that spear? My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.\n\nThis is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.","March 28, 2015","true","38.7"," 2,653 of 2,757 people (96%) found this review helpful 168 people found this review funny","96","653","2","168","46"

I don't have much experience with CRPG'S at all, thats why I thought my view of the game can give another perspective on things. That means I have not played games like Dungeons & Dragons, Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale or Neverwinter Nights before playing this game.\n\nPillars of Eternity starts of with a character creation. The amount of options that you have here is absolutely crazy. You can probably spend hours here, changing every little detail. You pick your sex, race, class, attributes, culture, appearance and finally voice.\n\nThis game have many difficult settings and are obviously made for replayability. Pillars recommend that you start on easy difficulty, so I did. I most say that easy in this game isn't that simple!\n\nLoadscreens while you rest are pretty and some other environments in the game, like dungeons and forests. I like the details on the characters, it's very sharp, even when you zoom in. The only complaint I have is that some backgrounds are a little blurry and low res, which looks a little bit silly when it's next to a very detailed character. I get that they went for an "old-school look" but I still think that doesnt really match. But when you zoom out that won't really bother you.\n\nI recommend that you crank the volume up for this title, because background noise and sounds, in the dialogue and in combat, are great. It will help you get into the story and atmosphere better.\n\nVentors in the cities and villages will buy all the trash you loot from enemies. You can buy camping tools, weapons and potions from them. If you have many followers you can carry more items, and all items can be transfered over between anybody in your party, which is great. So if I find a staff as barbarian I can simply open up the inventory and equip in on my mage.\n\nYou will have to read most of the dialogue yourself, although some story related things are read for you. I still wouldn't recommend this game if you hate reading, because there's a lot of it. You can right click on items and spells to read everything about them as well. Some are just lore stuff, others are actually useful information.\n\nThe story is dark and mysterious. Combat in done with real time and pause. You can also use slow motion in fights to make things more manageable and easy. As you level up your character and possible followers, you gain points which you can spend on things like sneak, survival, etc. You also get to pick spells.\n\nYou can create really silly partys if you want. You can combine all the races and even have animal followers like bears. It's entirely up to you who you bring along the quests and you can choose how they will look like, what weapon they will use and what role they will have in combat.\n\nOptions menu is very good. You can customize everything they way you like it in terms of controls. The graphics options are not as good, but for this type of game I wouldn't say its needed.\n\nThe replayability is obviously insane when you think about how many races, followers and difficulty levels this game has. You can play the entire game solo, or you can choose to bring mages, dwarfs, godlikes, wizards, humans...and so on, with you. You can also create different kinds of humans, elfs, etc. It's fantastic.\n\nObsidian Entertainment has created a great game overall, that even new CRPG players like me can enjoy. I have barely scratched the surface of this game, but I can already see that amount of work put into this title.\nIt's fun, dark and mysterious and im having so much fun playing and learning new things everyday.\nHighly recommended title, if you don't mind reading of course.","March 29, 2015","true","83.9"," 1,089 of 1,145 people (95%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","95","089","1","19","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/291650/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Pillars of EternityDeveloper: Obsidian Entertainment\nPublisher: Paradox Interactive\n\nNote: I will try to be as spoiler-free as possible.\nNote #2: I don't think I can do this game justice, but I'll try anyway.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nQuite possibly the best isometric CRPG to be released in recent years, Pillars of Eternity is an entirely new world expertly crafted and filled with lore created in the style of the classic Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale games. Any fan of these games will instantly fall in love with Pillars of Eternity and it's similar design.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nPlayed from an isometric top-down view, Pillars is packed with things to do. You play the game entirely by mouse, pointing and clicking to navigate each area, converse with NPCs, battle enemies, and more. One of the best things about this game is that it is extremely detailed and immersive with it's superb storytelling. Pretty much exactly like the titles mentioned above. There is a literal TON of reading, as everything is presented to you in much the same way a dungeonmaster or storyteller in a tabletop game would. Every detail is spelled out for you, and you get to make you own choices in each dialogue. Most of these choices have a profound impact on the outcome of whatever quest you are on (people can and will die!), and even the main storyline.\n\nYou start out by creating a character from a huge list of options. There are a small handful of races, several classes, and you can even choose some regional differences for each race. You could easily spend and hour or more creating your first character. Along with your "main" character, there are 8 (10 with The White March Part I add-on) unique companions you can recruit. You can also create more characters to join your party after a certain point. Each character can be customized the way you see fit from an extensive list of spells, abilities, auras, talents, and equipment.\n\nOne of the big features of Pillars is the Stronghold. Shortly into the game you come into ownership of a stronghold called Caed Nua. Caed Nua, once owned, can be upgraded and repaired to offer you a variety of new features, goods, and services. For example, you can build an Inn that will allow you to rest. Another example is you can construct a barracks which unlocks the character creator. Also found underneath Caed Nua is an extensive maze-like dungeon, which can be explored throughout the game, with each floor getting more difficult.\n\nThere are many options in battle, and probably the most helpful (but sometimes annoying) of which is the Auto-Pause feature. This can be set to activate when any number of events occur, such as a character's Endurance dropping too low. Pausing allows you to survey the battlefield and make the best decision possible to turn the tide back into your favor.\n\nAn important part of any RPG is inventory management. With a game of this scope, there are naturally a ton of different items: weapons, armor, accessories, food, potions, scrolls, crafting ingredients, and more. With all of these items, you need a way to store and manage everything. Thankfully, each character has their own inventory, and you can freely move items between them at anytime. But the biggest boon to item management is the Stash. On your inventory screen, you will see a large button with a Treasure Chest on it. This is your Stash, which can be accessed from nearly anywhere, at anytime, and is seemingly infinite in capacity. If it has a limit, I never found it!\n\nMost RPGs are packed full of quests and tasks, and with this comes th eneed to manage them. The quest log in Pillars is pretty detailed, giving a sort of summary of any actions taken during a quest. This is extremely helpful, in that if you take a break from the game you can easily come back and jump right back to what you left off on. This is a common complaint of some of the larger RPGs, that when picking the game back up after awhile players have no idea what they were last doing, so they start over. Pillars eliminates that problem entirely.\n\nWhen you reach the edge of a map, you are able to leave the area and return to the World Map. From here, you can travel to any previously visited location no matter how far across the map it is. This fast travel is extremely helpful in navigating the world and completing objectives.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nIf you liked the graphics of Baldur's Gate, then you'll love the updated style Pillars of Eternity offers. You can zoom in and out at anytime, and the closer you zoom in, the more detail you will see on nearly everything. The characters in particular are very well done, as are the environments and maps of each area. They all look superb.\n\nI simply cannot say enough about how good this game looks. All of it is very well-made and designed, and really draws your eye to the details. It's just so detailed and beautiful as a result. The only downside is that there isn't too much variety. The entire base game map is mostly woodlands and forests, and all of the dungeons look really similar...stone and darkness. It isn't until you get the White March Part 1 add-on that you start to see more varied environments (SNOW!).\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nAbsolutely amazing. The soundtrack is wonderfully immersive, and extremely well-done. Making the soundtrack available in the store was a great move. Once I'm able to afford the Champion Edition upgrade, I'll definitely get it JUST for the soundtrack alone. I'm a huge fan of video game music anyway. I found no problems with any of it. Every track was expertly paired with the right situations in-game for full immersion.\n\nThe sound effects are extremely well done too, even footsteps. This is a game I play with my sound up full blast, there's a lot of details in each area that's conveyed via the sound. Each area has a lot of ambient effects, like crickets in a woodland setting or stones shifting as you traverse a dungeon.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThis game ran flawlessly on my low mid-tier rig. No hiccups whatsosver. No framerate drops, lag, stuttering, or random crashes. The framerate did appear to be capped at 30 though, as I never saw it go over that. I'll need to pay attention next time I play and make a note about it.\n\nOne of the main complaints (well, only complaint) I have with this game is that inbetween every single area you will run into a loading screen that takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds to clear off. Thankfully, these screens feature some beautiful artwork and often helpful tips about the game, so it's not too big of an issue.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nPillars of Eternity is a MUST PLAY for fans of the CRPG genre. A truly immersive and expansive adventure that you can play your way. If you enjoyed any of the games mentioned at the top of this review, you *need* to have this game in your library. And with the recently released White March Part 1 add-on and accompanying patch that added some much needed features to the game (Party AI), it's gotten even better! Don't pass this up, it's well worth the price of admission.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er-cSs-L_Hg\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 30, 2015","true","44.5"," 388 of 444 people (87%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","87","388","444","22","9"

It's more than good, it's great. It's not only one of the best RPGs of all times, it's also one of the best games I've ever played. It has great story, beautiful graphics, sound and music, deep mechanics and everything what good RPG game needs. But don't expect revolution, this is just step ahead in comparison to best classics like Baldur's Gate.\nSo what you may expect? Pillars of Eternity is pure old-school RPG in modern times. Engine is very classic, but modern in the same time. So you have 2D view, but with zoom. Combat is in real time with active pause. There is a lot of reading and dialogues. You will spend a lot of time to manage your party stats, skills and inventory. I played in hard difficulty and it was necessary to survive.\nWhat about world and mechanics? There is new world and RPG mechanics made by Obsidian, but it has a lot in common with Dungeons and Dragons. It's heroic fantasy with many races (there are elves and dwarves too) and classes (like paladins, warriors and clerics), which combines elements we all know and love, with some new ideas, which is great. One word about spellcasters. I love the way how each magic class is different to each other, they use totally different spells and strategy, there are many fresh ideas here.\nAlso other thing is great. Best dialog system I've ever seen. Here you may feel your how your reputation and stats affects your dialog options.\nBut not everything is perfect. There are some things in that game, that would be improved, like your castle for example. This is clear that potential of this idea isn't fully exploited. Sometimes I felt like this part of the game was done in a rush.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you're an old-school RPG fan, this is must have for you. With this game you will feel the same magic as you felt playing Baldur's Gate.\nIf you're younger player, I'm not sure you will be so delighted as I am. I can recommend this game to everybody but I know there are many people which expect more intense RPGs in modern style. So if you like to read a lot and think what to do, try this game and find the ancient magic.\n\nLike this review?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekator/recommended/291650/","nekator","☠✠☩ Nekator ☩✠☠","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekator/","3326 products in account","Pillars of Eternity, one more try to make the "sucessor of Baldurs Gate", one of the biggest Kickstarter projects made by rpg veterans Obsidian Entertainment.\n\nSo, after nearly 50 hours playtime (i´m around the last third of the game) what can i say to the big promises?\nFirst off, the world of PoE is very detailed for a newly made one, the history, races and classes are partly innovative, partly good old fantasy genre like.\n\nThe gameplay itself naturally orientates itself on the old masters, you create your character, who can alter the fate of the world in an epic storyline, while finding allies for his group on the way through the story (which can alternatively be filled with custom made characters.. or you can even try to go through it alone).\nRegarding classes there are new ones like the cipher and many known ones from barbarian to priests to the different gods (a nice extra for these is, that the way how they act throughout the game influences how "satisfied" their deity is with them).\n\nRegarding classes and "improvements" here also shows one of the main changes of PoE, there are rather less skills, then usually known in old time rpgs. Also the classes are not limited as how they advance in them. For me, i honestly preferred the old way a bit, when not everyone could learn anything but to each his own. Also it seems to me that especially the rogue class suffers from that choice, as everyone can learn about traps etc. now.. so the only thing really special about them is backstabbing. Stealing isn´t possible anyways.\nWhen advancing in levels the classes differentiate again a bit more through perks, which can be aquired on selected levels (some general, some bound to different requirements).\n\nGraphic and music are top level for this kind of game, only the camera possibilities/movements could be improved, especially during battles or while in towns etc.\n\nRegarding quests, dialogue and story in general there are few things to complain about, the main storyline is branching and quite interesting, the happenings on the way have mostly more then one way to complete them. Furthermore there are different factions you encounter and can ally with them and in general the way you behave throughout the game affects every location/faction. Last but not least you also have the possibility to get your own stronghold, which is to be restored as well as cared about.. and even has an own multiple level dungeon. Personally i would have wished for some more class specific dialogue options (especially the cipher class), but that´s a minor complain.\nYour companions are well made and have their own personalities as well as quests, though could use some more banter.\n\nOn a further note regarding Obsidian and their reputation for delivering bug plagued games, i think the self management through Kickstarter helped them, as i had few problems in that regard. Also the game keeps getting improved after release.\nThe downside of the Kickstarter, if you want to call it one, are many KS characters, who stand around throughout towns mostly and some little sh*tstorm made once more by some extremists who were to dumb and fanatic to understand irony.\n\nConclusio: If you are a fan of (old) isometric, group related rpgs on an epic scale then you can´t do anything wrong with this game.\n\n","May 31, 2015","true","60.9"," 358 of 420 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","358","420","6","8"

Overall though, the world that has been crafted in Pillars of Eternity is absolutely beautiful, and calls you to explore every damp dungeon, and every overgrown ruin. Combat animations, especially spells, are extremely satisfying to watch, as each spell has very unique and detailed animations.    Gameplay  9  A revival of the classic Infinity Engine style of gameplay, Pillars of Eternity is true to its roots. With pausable real-time combat, a maximum of 6 characters to control (12, if you choose all rangers with pets...if that's your thing), and plenty of spells and playstyles to choose from, you are bound to find a playstyle that fits you and that you enjoy. Choose between 11 different classes, 6 different races, and several more sub-races, and customize your characters look to start crafting the story you want to experience. With wonderful voice acting, fanstastic story-telling, a vast world with tons of content, and even your own Stronghold to upgrade and maintain, Pillars of Eternity welcomes both old and new players to the genre with open arms.    Story  10  The world in which Pillars of Eternity takes place has been lovingly crafted, with hours upon hours of lore to sift through and explore. Usually in games, I quickly open and close the books you pick up, and skip through dialogue rather quickly, simply wanting to get to the point (looking at you Skyrim, Dragon Age, etc). However, in Pillars of Eternity, I have found myself spending hours reading all the books available that explain the world of Eora, and talking to every NPC I can find, following every branch of dialogue. I have come to actually care about my companions that tag along with me, and want to know more about them and their background. The wonderful voice acting (though sometimes strangely absent) only helps to further create depth in this incredibly imagined world.    Multiplayer  N/A  This game is all about the single-player. Enjoy it.    Replayability  3  The drawback of such story heavy games, is there isn't often a reason to go back and play them, other than to experience the game through a different class. However, since you are able to have 6 companions at a time in Pillars of Eternity, you can experience each character class through a single play-through. Really the only reason I find to go back for another round at the game is to make some different choices, try a harder difficulty, or achievement hunt.     Overall  9.1/10  I was, personally, not a fan of the Baldur's Gate series, much less any games like it. But Pillars of Eternity has enthralled me enough with its story that I have come to love it dearly, and it has opened the door to similar games for me. If you enjoy story-rich games, Pillars of Eternity is easily near the top of the list and is the game for you. If you want to lose yourself in another world for hours on end, Pillars of Eternity is the game for you. If you want to experience an epic journey in a living, thriving world that is beautifully crafted, Pillars of Eternity is the game for you. All in all, Pillars of Eternity is a game that every gamer should take the time to experience, even if only to remember how incredible a game with a good story is.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:\n\nThe Tipster","April 6, 2015","true","43.0"," 282 of 334 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","282","334","7","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Radaney/recommended/291650/","Radaney","Radaney","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Radaney/","376 products in account","Hi, just completed this on the hardest difficulty and going to write a few things.\n\nPillars of Eternity is a great spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate II.\n\nPillars of Eternity takes place in Eora, which quickly establishes its own identity as you discover that you can see and interact with souls. The game has a deep universe in which you must use cunning, diplomacy and brute force to stand a chance. With various different political factions you must muscle with, to views on religion this game covers quite a lot. The story offers a lot of options open to your own interpretation with many choices / choose your own adventure cut scenes forcing sometimes difficult choices on you; these choices factor into a disposition system with 10 different personality types which change based on your choices throughout the game, the personality your character has allow for additional role playing through out the game by affecting how npc's respond to you. There's a lot of well written dialogue and every situation and character I've encountered has been described in detail. Dialogue options are plentiful, with frequent skill and stat checks that do a great job of tying the RPG system into the conversations.\n\nBoth the classes of which there are 11 and mechanics are basically modernisations of the D&D archetypes and rules. With spells only being able to cast a certain amount of times in encounters and without resting to the abiltiy to conquer quests and scenes in a variety of different ways. Although the game does have several additions; you have an infinite inventory for junk, craftable food, potions, enchantments and scrolls giving various benefits. You also have Endurance which is basically your combat health, alongside your actual health which when reaches zero you die, and can only be regained by resting. You also get a stronghold fairly early in the game which with some investment offers various buildings which provide bonuses on resting there alongside NPCs and a recurring supply of gold (if well defended).\n\nPillars like various D&D rulesets has a lot of variety in character design which strays away from the MMO trinity, whilst you will have your frontline, damage dealer, support classes there is no weapon or armor type limits, which allows your characters to be more customisable. If you want a Wizard in heavy armour and a pistol go for it, everything will still have its advantages and disadvantages however with armour types still playing a huge role in your defence and recovery and weapon types having their various different niches, some causing different types of damage such as crushing and slicing. Levelling up allows your character to spend skills point alongside ability and perk points which ultimately improve your character, I felt like the characters progressed very well alongside the game and my characters never felt too powerful at any point whilst the improvement was still noticeable although I can't comment on how lower difficulties will be affected.\n\nPlaying this game on the hardest difficulty, I found the combat was extremely difficult right from the get-go. Combat in this game has a lot of tactics involved, the rules of engagement in this game are very important as a glass cannon character can not simply run and kite enemies as then enemies will get a free disengagement attack which usually results in that characters untimely demise, frontline tanky characters will always want to engage first as to grab enemy mobs attention as this game does not use a threat system people may be familiar with in MMOs such as WoW. These rules make positioning and entry into combat extremely important and have a lot of tactical value, if you run into a fight unprepared enemy mobs will destroy your squishy damage dealing classes and ultimately wreck your remaining party members. The game does have several tools to help you with this such as the ability to create custom formations in which your party will walk around in alongside a scouting ability for your more stealthy classes to scout ahead and into rooms. Due to how this works this means that the general pace of the game can be very slow with your more stealthy classes constantly scouting ahead so you can prepare for upcoming battles especially in higher difficulties, as if your not careful battles can be quickly decided against you.\n\nThe large variety of classes, races, backstories and cultures should offer plenty of replayability when combined with the vast amount of different choices you can cause every conversation to go.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous with great painterly backgrounds and several improvements to the Infinite Engine of years ago such as dynamic water and great particle effects. The 3D character models mold into the backgrounds and scenes incredibly well and also have great animation quality. I was equally impressed by the audio quality, everything sounds fitting from simple footsteps to arrows striking their mark, I personally loved hearing casters chant they're various incantations. The soundtrack is something you would expect out of a fantasy game with nothing standing out but nothing dissapointing either and there are plenty of breaks from the music for ambience meaning that the music never became repetitive. The games interface is great, it's easy to use and pretty modern, visually being of a fantasy RPG style it avoids being clunky and hard to manage with the font being very easy to read and also adjustable in size in the options.\n\n\nOverall, I think the game is great and I do recommend it but this doesn't mean that the game is faultless. The game has various bugs which stopped me from progressing in some quests by having certain npcs and objects key to advancing the quests be uninteractable although I did not encounter this in the main questline hence not stopping me from completing the main game it did affect a few side quests making me miss out on story, stunting character exp and rewards making the game slightly harder on my difficulty and reducing my overall experience. I had an issue where Steam Overlay would not work if I ran the game as Administrator. I also found some parts of the game to be lacking in variety towards the end of the game, I realised that there honestly isn't that many different types of enemies visually and your armour doesn't change your character much visually which is something I have come expect naturally from modern RPGs.\n\n\nI feel I've potentially missed quite a lot out and this is the first proper review I have done so feel free to ask anything in the comments your unsure about if you are considering buying this game. :)","March 29, 2015","true","43.2"," 233 of 276 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","233","276","8","14"

Where Infinity games were all based on Dungeons & Dragons, a system designed for turn-based combat, Pillars of Eternity maintains that same depth and feel, however built from the ground up for real time with pause combat.\n\nPillars allows the player a choice of 11 character classes, each are a very unique experience much like the Dungeons & Dragons classes they're inspired by.  Unlike a lot of modern games that follow the MMO-inspired holy trinity design (tank, support and healer classes), Pillars, like early Dungeons & Dragons ruleset have a lot more variety in their class design.  Sure, when you go into combat, you will still have your frontline, damage, support and healing characters, but it is not quite as cut and dry.  Additionally, there is no weapon or armor type limits on your character because of your character class, so a character could be a wizard in heavy armor and a blunderbuss, whether that is a good idea or not is up for debate but it is possible.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements to me over Infinity series as well as most RPG designs is the engagement system.  In most games, if a glass cannon character gets engaged by an enemy, their initial thought is to run and kite the enemy until a frontline character can reestablish engagement with the enemy.  However, if you attempt to run and kite in Pillars, you will suffer an automatic disengagement attack.  This system forces the combat to have more tactical value than what you see in most games with enemies just being kited around.\n\nOf course, that is a lot of talk about combat, Pillars also has very deep and reactive story telling through conversations and choose your own adventure style cut scenes.  In both, you will have a variety of choices based on your characters attributes and skills.  Additionally, in conversations, there is a disposition system which tracks your character in 10 different personality types such as cleverness, cruelty, honesty, and more.  These will allow for some additional role-playing through the game as you develop your character.\n\nWith an unnamed expansion already announced, Pillars should have a lot of run time and with the variety of character classes and choices in the story, a lot of replayability as well.","March 26, 2015","true","114.8"," 162 of 189 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","162","189","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/291650/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Pillars of Eternity is a RPG game developed by Obsidian Entertainment, releasing on Steam in March 2015. This game is a spiritual successor to the game series Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale. The game was kick-started in September 2012, with the highest ever funding at the time of over $4 million.\n\nGame play in POE is very much like the other games in the series, the tactical combat with your party of adventures, and an overwhelming amount of choices in terms of stats, equipment, skill points and attacks.  The game play does get easier the further into the game you get, as you characters grow in strength and you just become more tactically aware of your surroundings and you will work out how to get the most out of all of your characters. The game is has a heavy amount of dialog, if you don’t like reading then this game is definitely not for you. The game starts off very slowly and for the first three or four hours, you will spend the majority of that time reading text and getting started with the story. Throughout all of the dialog choices, you also get plenty of important decision that can change the outcome of certain events as you progressively get further in the game, such as siding with different factions etc. Whilst the outcome of your choice is not always very clear, the game does a very good job of masking those decisions without you realising how important they actually are.\n\nRight from the character creation screen, you will see how in-depth this game goes, there is an abundance of choice and options for you to make whilst creating your character. I was a little disappointed to see that I actually reached a level cap towards the end of act three, so almost half way through the game, I couldn’t progress my character any more. This in turn made the rest of the game seem somewhat imbalanced as I was able to just waltz through the enemies without batting an eyelid.\n\nPOE whilst it doesn’t have super amazing graphics, the environment and locations that you find yourself in still look gorgeous. The way the world is presented makes you want to explore it inch by inch. The UI is the most important part of this game graphically; it is smooth and functions perfectly. You are able to find all the information you need within a click or two – believe me, there is a lot of information in this game you are going to need!\n\nThis game is basically a novel inside of a game. The story is often criticized by some people, but I for one was completely intrigued and loved following it right from the start. The story is deep and moving, with plenty of cliff hangers, twists and turns as you progress.  On top of the main story line, you can follow plenty of optional side quests which add so much more immersion to the world you are in, it allows for extra character development and more choices. I actually really cared so much about my characters at the end due to what they have gone through, I spent more time than I would like to admit pondering over dialog choices. Like I said above, there is a lot of text in this game, whilst a good portion is voice acted, another good portion is not. So you better be prepared for some reading. Normally I much prefer my games to be completely voice acted; it helps me get more immersed in the story and I am probably a bit lazy, but I was completely happy to read everything this game had to offer. I honestly thought I was reading a book at times.\n\nWhen you begin the game, the difficulty level is fairly challenging. You have to really think about your adventures’ next actions and movement, but as with most games, as you become more familiar with how the mechanics actually work, you become more and more Intune with it, allowing you to breeze through the game at points. The end boss is somewhat of a challenge, which required me to retry a couple of times. Once you get a few bits of high quality equipment, and your characters become over levelled due to the amount of experience awards in the game, you won’t find any point to be impossible to conquer though.\n\nI finished my play through of POE in just under 60 hours (not sure why Steam says I only have 45?); this was doing the majority of side quests and exploring the world quit sufficiently whilst also taking the time to enjoy the dialog in the game too. I have seen some people put well over 100 hours into this game, and I suspect that is because of the game’s high replay ability factor.  One of the main elements which makes the game replay able, would have to be the in-depth character creation, you can create a brand new character that plays completely different to your last one, making your gameplay experience different too. Personally I don’t think I would do a second play through of the game because I feel I have got all I can out of the game right now, but those that really want to drill down this game for every inch, there is definitely a high amount of replay ability on offer.\n\nThe game runs like a dream too; I was able to play on 4k resolutions with the graphics turned right up. At times I did attempt to use the Steam controller, but the mouse and keyboard is the much prefer method for this type of game. The game did release with a few bugs and glitches, but after the first patch, these have all been cleaned up so I was able to play without any problems.\n\nPillars of Eternity is any classic RPG fan’s dream. If enjoyed Baldur’s gate, or want a completely immersive in depth role playing experience, then you need to be picking this game up. Steam’s price of £34, 99 to me seems a bit excessive, but you can pick this game up for almost half that on external websites if you shop around.  For me this is a stunningly good game, that I would consider a must play.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's a 6/10 for me.\n\nHere's what makes the game for me.\n\nPROs:\n\n- the game is beatiful to look at\n- the worldbuilding, I think the non-DND world setting came out just fine\n\nCONs:\n\n- When I think Pillars, I think loading screens. Lots of them. All the time. Getting longer and longer as you progress in the game. For 2015, a 2D game, with the amount of memory our computers have these days. No.\n\n- The character system is designed to yield "sensible" characters, regardless of your choices. That's an explicit design goal. It's trying to save newcomers from thinking/planning out their parties, making sure they can be successful no matter what. I understand the attempt at minimizing frustration and catering to non-min-maxers first, concentrating on the narrative instead. But barring extreme scenarios like solo runs and speed runs, the end result is that no matter how you design your character(s), there's likely be very little difference in how you play most of the game. Your choices do not really imply a play style.\n\n- Character progression. There is little that makes a difference. The stats making a difference are defined by the level alone. That's following the "anything should be a sensible choice" philosophy, which translates to "anything is an equally uninteresting choice". So you outlevel every encounter eventually, you can't often outsmart it. There's just no speicalization choices that would make enough of a difference.\n\n- The game consists mostly of combat. Mostly of pointles combat against trash mobs. It's becomes repetetive and boring 1/3 into the game. Combat is not what I find most exciting about RPGs. I understand that combat is a very important aspect, but reducing the game to just that...\n\n- In general there is little choice and variety in how you tackle quests. In ACT I there *is* a single quest involving Raedric's Hold where you actually do have choices and options. Different points of access. Different decisions on the outcome. Different paths through the levels. Different *alliances* you can make on the way. The rest of the game: not so much. Linear "kill everything on this map before going to the next" design most of the time.\n\n- Buffs generally not practical\nSo you're walking into the lair of a dangerous monster and you can't pre-buff your party to be more resistant to its particular attacks. You have to do this when combat starts. Which is to say, you'll not do it, because in combat it is much more beneficial to cast something offensive bringing the enemy down as quickly as possible, or debuffing him. That decision was to make sure the game did not have to be balanced around your party being pre-buffed in battles all the time, pre-buffing being considered a tedious repetitive activity. Well, in practice it results in the party not getting much of buffs at all, and the priest being a mostly useless character in or before battle, also reducing on the complexity of the game. The game could very well be balanced around having certain buffs on major fights.\n\n- Engagement mechanics\nEngagement mechanics penalize movement with an almost guaranteed auto-hit (painful, since it would often crit) when trying to disengage from an opponent. That means, once you've 'crossed swords' with someone, you stay there. This was invented to prevent kiting enemies around, having them owned effortlessly by ranged party members. Again an understandable proposition. In practice, that means you play PoE much like you play an MMORPG: have 1-2 high defense units take "aggro" and finish them off with some high DPS units lurking in the back. Rinse repeat. It also means most fights are static and not tactical at all. Your tanks go first, your damage dealers and crowd control units go in the back. The enemy AI is mostly limited to "rush closest enemy". So they engage with the tanks and wait to be killed. Only exception being some caster enemies which are scripted to attack/dominate party members most susceptible to their attacks.\n\n- No innovation in RPG mechanics/character behaviour beyond what what was already there in IE games. For example: getting in combat mode. Consider this situation: some random unnamed NPC peasant catches your armed-to-the-teeth 6 man party stealing his rice bowl out of his cupboard. Most likely he'll turn hostile and try to kill you. Because that's what peasants armed with a wooden spoon generally do when defending their rice bowl against 6 hardened warriors ready for battle, waving swords around that are covered in magical flames. Even bodyguards at a brothel should run away if outnumbered 3 to 1. Oh, and nobody takes offence at the carnage if you 'legitimately' kill half a village, and two factions because 'the gods' demanded it as part of a quest to 'gain favor'... You're being a murderous villain and nobody even seems to care. That's not RPG. Even as far back as Gothic I you could beat somebody down, rob them blind with all the consequences for faction status etc, and yet not kill them. I expected something beyond "killing everyone is the best and most straight forward solution to every quest" in PoE. Where are some smarter choices like locking enemies in a trap for example?\n\n- The Stronghold mechanics are a joke. Its benefits are obscured by load screens. The investments you make you'll never recoup from the taxes you get across the entire duration of the game. It is mostly devoid of any life, and not the hub of operations at all. The benefits are not better than going to the next best city/village hub. And mostly, it's a bunch of annoyances waiting to happen: You have to keep coming back to defend the keep, you have to watch all your captives flee eventually, you have to micro-manage some chars to 'escort' visitors lest they cause trouble, you have to micro-manage some chars to go on '#prestige-modifier'-Adventure, to come back with some copper and no rewards to speak of, much less even a summary of what they were supposedly doing. There's not a single plot option open to you if you have invested in your keep, as opposed to not investing in it and letting it rot. So it's an annoyance that costs micromanagement effort and money. I expected better.\n\ninstead of time-based mechanics for stronghold taxes everything hinges on 'stronghold turns' which are artificial units that tick away as you solve quests and tasks (of which there are only so many). That is to prevent rest-spamming and getting filthy rich from the tax income. Same for stronghold "adventures". So here you have it, you'll invest all that money into your stronghold to then not be able to "role-play", by just roaming the land for a bit, and wait for the next tax day to upgrade your kit with. Nope, you'll have to keep playing quests exactly like you would if the stronghold was not even there. And then eventually you'll get a pittance of a tax while you've just resolved a quest somewhere.\n\n- Crafting is uninspired. Yes you can do it. But you can do it anywhere, with pre-defined recipes that you know from the outset and hardly learn additions to. Apparently every brainless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ can just pop out a flower, some bat ears, a ruby and 300 coppers to 'enchant' their favorite pair of pants to be #{damage-type}-proof on the spot. No probs. Oh, but only of they are at least level 4.\n\n- The story itself. I liked the world and writing. I did not like the pacing/presentation at all. To me it made no sense that the main character is chasing the villian so relentlessly. Aside from problems with player character motivation, it's just not original to have the story be an uninspired chase of an ever elusive villian from hub to hub. The motivations of the villain itself are not clear most of the time, so there isn't even a 'cause' to attach to.\n\nIf you like BG1 as it is, you're going to like PoE. But unless you've spent the last 10 years under a rock, you'll feel the flaws most keenly as well. You've likely played better.","May 7, 2015","false","108.9"," 1,520 of 2,085 people (73%) found this review helpful 88 people found this review funny","73","520","2","88","135"

But if you have played e.g. Baldurs Gate (and so on...) it's like a warm welcome home.\n\nAll characteristics of good and old fashioned roleplaying are fully included in Pillars of Eternity. On top of that comes a wonderfully detailed painted world, a great and lovely written Story along with very fine dialogues and character interaction.\n\nI highly recommend it to every fan of Infinity Engine Games, as well as to everybody who is looking for a challenge along roleplaying and to those who are not thrown back by slightly outdated graphical styles and the absence of a Coop- or Multiplayermode.\n\nTo be honest, there are not that many overly outstanding features - I like the Keep Building and the way of character development very much, the fights are nice and tactical challenging sometimes (!). There are also some nice hints and referers to other games and stories. All I expected from PE was a solid RPG in the Style of Baldurs Gate - and yes, that's what I got.\n\nWith that I want to adress the pricing, which seems to be a problem for many people out there at the moment. Judging about the worth of a game is pretty subjective, of course. But I'll try to approach it from an almost neutral point of view; in Germany it's at 41,99€ at the moment what makes it a fullpriced title. Does it contain playtime and replayabilty worth that price? Yes! But does it contain a mindblowing new experience to RPGamers? No! If you're looking for new and innovative games, better search elsewhere. This is an all-classic experience, polished to glow these days, but not to brightly shine.\nSo the price may be a bit to high at the moment. People who either don't really care or are into the genre anyways should buy it. Those who just want to test and give it a quick look better shouldn't at the moment, instead they better wait for a steam sale or online-distributor deal.\n\nThe point and the grounding of this choice is; Are you aware of what you get? Get informed - The Internet offers so many ways these days.\n\nPersonally I have a great load of fun with it. And when I play I find myself spending almost 4+ hours a session afterwards, which is a mark for a good game to me.\n\nThanks for reading!","March 31, 2015","true","25.3"," 167 of 203 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","167","203","4","9"

Hell, she was far from civilization. The nearest town was a day's walk, and she needed medical attention. Ever since that storm she hadn't felt herself. She stared for a while at the clearing ahead, a quiet meadow painted purple by wildflowers in bloom. Birds chirped, flitted and fluttered. Bugs droned, bumbled and buzzed. A symphony orchestra was blasting all around her, which was more than a little jarring. Finally she was jerked from her daze by her antelope companion, Gary. “We have to get to Gilded Vale,” she said, breaking the silence. “MRRABLURGHHBLURGH,” agreed Gary the antelope (that is an approximate onomatopoeia of antelope noises).\n\nThey set off to find the road when two young wolves, truants probably, attacked. Gorglax raised her arbalest, wound it, and loosed a bolt into one wolf. It whined and bled out on the soft blanket of wildflowers as the other closed in, bearing its canines. Gorglax was done for, she couldn't wind her arbalest fast enough. She shut her eyes and had all but accepted her fate when Gary the ♥♥♥♥ing antelope butted the beast, causing it to explode in a gory geyser. After acknowledging how metal that just was, the pair continued on their adventure.\n\nI liken video games to baking. Yes, the recipes are frequently rigid and mostly unforgiving of experimental deviation (one such deviation I made while baking resulted in what I've coined as “bread soup”); but even the most structured recipe allots for the 'dash,' the mysterious magic that often defines the finished product.\n\n“Oh, this is simply DELICIOUS. What did you put in this?”\n\n“Oh, this old thing? It's pretty standard: egg, milk, flour... and just a dash of magic.”\n\n“MAGIC ISN'T AN INGREDIENT, TED.”\n\nAnd yet that douchey non-response best describes what makes Pillars of Eternity so excellent:  it's an original CRPG with the combined minds, bodies, and souls of its classic predecessors. It is, perhaps, greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nSo for the mildly spoiler sensitive crowd, let's revisit at the last paragraph. Everyone else keep your hands and feet inside the review at all times.\n\nPillars of Eternity has you, the hero, traveling the land of Dyrwood, a mystical realm filled with beings, creatures, ruins, and adra – a sort of organic rock jutting from the earth like jade claws from the depths. You are (shockingly!) the chosen one of sorts, a Watcher – beings capable of seeing the previous lives of the inhabitants of Dyrwood, speaking to the dead. Most that claim to be Watchers are hucksters, charlatans, and the rest are often driven positively batty by all of the intrusive soul fragmented former lives (theirs included).\n\nThere's mystery, intrigue, ancient civilizations and arcane magics, unique party members to drag along... pretty standard RPG fare. There are troubled hamlets, a large city, a ruined fortress, and natural wonders to gawk at, all lovingly prerendered. The world and those settled there feel alive, and for the first time in a while I felt compelled to listen to every bit of dialogue, read every bit of codex, flavor text, all just to familiarize myself with this fascinating new world.\n\nOf course you'll have to do some killing, it is an RPG after all. And you'll kill 'em all: wolves, giant spiders, lizard men, ghosts, bandits, trolls, wizards, spooky skeletons, mushroom men and dragons... Pillars of Eternity doesn't exactly break the mold when it comes to mythical beasties and foes, but the combat does. When an enemy is spotted your party will pause and you'll be able to select a general attack or take the time to individually select special actions for each party member.\n\nWhen you do engage you'll see their various defenses, strengths, and weaknesses of your foe – dependent on factors like weapon type, flanking, status effects, etc. It's thoroughly tactical and engaging, and even on lower difficulty settings I watched my entire party succumb to one or two enemies because I just tossed them into the fray all willy nilly. After dispatching enemies your bestiary will be updated with pertinent information. There's also often sweet, sweet corpse loot; loot can be equipped, used for crafting, or sold to vendors.\n\nI'll also touch briefly on the travel/sleepy time mechanics. See, the Eastern Reach is pretty expansive, and you'll be hoofing it from the get go. Day and night cycles, and characters will become fatigued from travel (not to mention bogged down by negative status effects after lots of fights). You have one of two options: camping out “in it” while adventuring, or shacking up at a number of permanent locations. Camping should only be used as is necessary, since you only have so many supplies to set up camp with, and some of the longer adventures will require your party to get that much needed refreshing between combat.\n\nThe minor-est of complaints! Here they come, ready yourselves. Because the world is prerendered and mostly static, fights will sometimes break out behind solid objects, which is a little frustrating (if you zoom in on a solid object obscuring a character it will become semi-translucent, but it's still a pain). And when you have a full party attacking enemies the notifications fly by in a flurry of text, which can make optimizing attacks difficult on the fly. Other than these quibbles the game is great. I've encountered no bugs, no glitches, and it's just overall a delight to play. Anyone familiar with classic BioWare fare and CRPGs will find themselves very much at home.\n\nPillars of Eternity is, simply put, really really good. The scope of it is dizzying, your first hour ingame may very well be in the character creation menu (but in a good way!), the combat is deeply satisfying, the score is GoT/LotR/Souls Series/Elder Scrolls Series all wrapped up in one, and  the story is thoroughly captivating. I haven't completed this game (it looks like the first of many playthroughs may well take 60+ hours), but short of it ending with an about-face “it was all a dream” or an elaborate song and dance number my sentiment will remain unmoved: Pillars of Eternity is a spectacular game, proof that old-school done right is timeless... it certainly helps that I'm playing as a dwarf/elf with a wisecracking antelope sidekick that explodes wolves.\n\nThat's always a plus.\n","March 26, 2015","true","20.1"," 336 of 450 people (75%) found this review helpful 95 people found this review funny","75","336","450","95","7"

One night you are travelling with a caravan through an area north of the Gilded Vale. The caravan stops for everyone to rest and you go out to get water for the group, you return to find a group of mercenaries who have killed all but one member of the caravan, a strange phenomenon occurs and you are forced to flee through a cave. When you reach the other side you find a strange ritual taking place and when it is complete, something about you is different. In Pillars of Eternity you must venture through Eora to find out what this change is and how you can reverse it.\n\nPoE is set in the fictional realm of Eora. Eora is full of different factions and races and as you play the game you will discover how they link to each other and why as well as discovering the rest of Eora's deep and incredibly well thought out lore.\n\nA couple of things to note before you carry on reading my review. Firstly I have not finished this game at the time of writing my review, I'd say I'm about a fifth of the way in but I feel like I've experienced enough of it to write a detailed review. Secondly this is the first time I have properly played a CRPG and so I'm inexperienced with this type of game so some of my opinions may differ from CRPG veterans.\n\nThe Game Itself\n+Great graphics and well designed emvironments though the character models aren't the best\n+A reasonably detailed character creator with a number of different races, classes and backgrounds to choose from\n+An interesting main plot as well as some interesting side quests\n+There's a hell of a lot to do, as mentioned previously at 16 hours playtime I'm only around a fifth of the way through all of the content on offer\n+Due to the game's reputation system and side quests with different possible endings you can create your own story when playing PoE even though the outcome is the same\n+Fantastic writing, in particular the interaction of different characters who feel real due to how good the writing is, e.g. how they respond to what is being said\n+Some great voice acting\n+As mentioned before Eora has very deep lore and finding out about it over the course of the game and through the Digital Collector's book is fascinating\n+The combat is simple yet rewarding and you really have to think about who should attack who and with what so that you are successful, especially when fighting large groups\n+Eight different companions to find and team up with over the course of the game, each of a different class with unique abilities to help you in a fight\n+All eight companions have interesting backstories and all have a reason for being where you found them which is good to see\n+Relatively early in the game you get possesion of a rundown stronghold and you can restore it to its former glory, I absolutely love that kind of thing in games so I thoroughly enjoyed building it back up\n+The different locations in the game are rather large and each one either has or is linked to a fair few sidequest though the map looks a bit empty as there aren't too many different locations\n+Outstanding soundtrack and great sound effects throughout\n+The game's difficulty can be changed throughout\n+Big heads mode, thanks Josh!\n\n-Voice acting is used sporadically, the main characters all have their own voice actors yet most of their dialogue is unvoiced and you have to read it, I felt that it often broke the flow of dialogue as one section would be voiced and the next wouldn't be with seemingly no method behind it\n-As mentioned previously the character models don't look great\n-Frequent loading screens which take a long time\n-There's a Kickstarter backer only achievement so unless you backed it you can't get 100%\n\nSpecial Edition Content\nThis covers the Royal Edition of the game, the first five are also available in the Champion edition. I will cover them in the order that they appear on the store page.\n\n+The OST is, as mentioned, fantastic\n+/-The Campaign Almanac is interesting but the font is difficult to read\n+The Digital Game Map is very nice and has a good amount of detail though it has a bit of a strange resolution\n+/-The Making Of Documentary isn't available yet\n-The Wallpapers are all very nice but they all have strange resolutions and aren't available in 1920x1080\n-The ringtones are nice little sound clips but I don't think you'd want them set as your phone's ringtone, most of them are soundclips of a character speaking\n+/-The Digital Novella isn't available yet\n+The Digital Collector's Book is very good and goes into great detail when explaining the game's lore\n+The Concept art is absolutely fantastic and very high quality, I thoroughly enjoyed looking through it\n+The Digital Strategy guide is very helpful and well written\n\nVerdict:\n9.5\n\nA truly outstanding isometric CRPG with great graphics, an extremely well-written story, good combat and rich lore to back it all up.

But whoa...    This game should be up for literary awards.  Only the written word can so easily, and completely, convey meaningful emotion and nuance.  Perfected along with the vibrant backgrounds, subtle yet solid soundtrack, and actually legible at high resolution text (adjustable font size in menu), this game will hold to be the test amongst all story based rpgs.  What little I have played of the combat engine has been intuitive.  Infinity engine perfected.  This game plays like a MUCH better written Baldur's Gate, except buttery as well, ...butter!   The extremely competent game mechanics hide away nicely, so that the immersion in environment and story stands unbroken for hours.  There have already been some large mood shifts and some mouth open gasps within the first 2 hours of gameplay.  I admit that I am already a huge fan of Obsidian, but it is with great reason.  I do not game for victory.  I do not game for competition.  I game to be entertained.  A 50-100 hour interactive book or movie is an immesurably better option than scrolling endlessly thru Facebook, or watching "reality" advervision.\n\nMr Sawyer, Avellone, Cain, Brennecke, Urquhart, and the rest of that team deserve an award.  Not an award given to shooters because of realistic ballistics.  No.  I am talking Pulitzer prize level descriptive writing..(in my opinion obviously).  Kickstarter gave them the freedom to be as flowery as they wanna be, and boy oh boy did it pay off.  AAA publishers and  mindless console drones, screw you and your multiplayer gib shot twitch muscle "e-sports".  No, not really, as that stuff has merit to you if you enjoy it.

Bring your imagination and ENJOY!!\n\n>>>>UPDATE<<<<\n\n56 hours in and I love this game even more!  I have played thru some bad (mechanically) games just to see a decent story.  Not a worry here!  This story seems layered and rich, and even the game mechanics are amazing.  Anybody who doesn't like the way it plays are either looking for something specific (it does NOT play exactly like Baldur's Gate, despite similar appearance and mechanics), or they just haven't taken the time to learn the system.  If you choose to pass up an amazing artistic Tour de Force due to "mages not being as OP as in BG" or something along these lines, then you are very hard to please and I believe it to be a mistake.

After playing Divinity Original Sin last year, I didn't think it could get any better but this gem has proven me wrong. The story and writing is absolutely incredible, the lore is very rich, and best of all the game is HARD. In just my 7 hours of playing so far, I have had to redo many fights, planning out new strategies, trying out new spells and weapons, all in the goal of bashing those pesky monsters to bits. Did I mention the bits, or rather giblets? Yeah, many times when an enemy is crittically injured by a blow and dies, he will explode in a shower of blood and fleshly bits, and it's always a fun sight.\n\nIn the graphics department, this is a very debatable topic, but I think these lovely hand drawn backgrounds surpass many modern games in their simplistic beauty. Music and sound is also very well done, and I've taken a special interest in the great way ranged weapons sound and feel in this game.\n\nThe two companions that I have come across my travels so far have been very well written, and their backstories very diverse. My only complaint on their regard is that at the moment the game has no rogue, barbarian or monk companions, so you will most likely end up filling those roles with custom adventurers or your own player character, but that is a minor gripe.\n\nIn regards to equipment, scrolls, potions and a plethora of other goodies, this game has them in spades. Hundreds of common and magical weapons and armor are just waiting to be discovered, many of them very unique in both name and appearance. Thankfully, the game has a stash mechanic to store your massive hoard of items, so you can gather to your heart's content.\n\nAll in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The one very minor bug I've ran across so far was restricted to the tutorial popups and a very odd sound loop, but disabling those easily rectified the issue so in no way does it hamper the game for me. If you are one of the many avid baldurs gate, icewind dale, or neverwinter nights fans that yearn to revist the glory days of old, look no farther because Pillars of Eternity is the perfect choice for you.\n","March 26, 2015","true","45.9"," 89 of 105 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","89","105","3","0"

[Review]\n\nWell, at 46 hours, that was one, long and fun ride.  I haven't felt so involved in a roleplaying game since Planescape : Tormet and it speaks volumes of the writing here.  There were a couple bugs and I'll get to them in an instant but the major ones were swiftly corrected, leaving some minor ones with very little impact in game.\n\nFirst, let's start with the obvious.  This game was obviously developped by gamers who know what they like in a game.  Everything about the interface screams convenience.  At first I was surprised to only find sixteen equipment slots in the inventory, until I noticed a well organised, infinite "stash" box.  Every quest item and ingredient (and there's a LOT of them) instantly goes to your stash, leaving you to select only what you want to keep.  New weapon that you don't plan to use?  Stash.  Crapload of stuff on the ground?  Stash.  You can also dump equipment from your inventory to your stash if you like.  There's also an option to be able to access it anywhere, otherwise you are limited to inns and during campings.  I preferred keep it like that but it's really up to the player.\n\nSpeaking of convenience and options, there's one to enlarge the looting radius.  Basically that means that whenever you loot something from the dead, every other corpse nearby will be looted.  I definately recommend you put the radius to the maximum.  There's the usual meta-infos, what you want displayed, when the auto pause begins, there's a lot to check out.\n\nThere's also a limited number of "resting" available, which for those abusing it in other games might come off as annoying but you get 4 on "normal" and less on harder difficulties.  You find "camping supplies" in a lot of crates and most merchants sell them as well.  By level 7, I hardly noticed the supplies since you get a lot of spells to throw to your enemies and it becomes an issue only if you're dangerously low on health.\n\nYes, low on health.  This is both a good and a bad thing so I won't hold the developpers for this interesting and new concept.  You have two "life" totals.  One is the stamina and the other, your actual health.  Your health is always far higher than your stamina, sometimes as much as three or four times the total and both lower at the same time.  However, since your stamina's much lower, you will fall unconscious before dying at least for a while.  After the fight, your unsconscious characters will get up and the endurance will refill quickly, up to the current health.  So when your health is low, your endurance bar will be capped and that's when you risk dying.  I thought that was an interesting idea but my issue is that the only way to raise your health is to rest.  Mind you, it does make sense in a way But there are times when you wish you didn't need to use your supplies just because one character nears death.  Even the highest priest spells do nothing to raise the health at all.  There's an option to change the final death to injuries but I left it off, I preferred the perma deaths.  Again, great work on making sure the game's tailored to a player's preferences.\n\nOn another note, I hope you love reading.  This isn't Diablo 3 here and again, I'm bringing Planescape Torment as a comparison.  The writers did a stellar job, when you can talk to a NPC, the dialogs are expansive and there's a lot of body language added for immersion.  There's also this fun idea of letting Kickstarter backers write their own NPCs.  Now and then, you'll meet people whose nameplates are golden instead of tan.  When you click on them, you can "Reach out for their souls" and get to experience, from that NPC's point of view, an important moment in their life.  They have no impact at all ingame except to give you a better immersion and let you read something fun.  I read every one I came across, some are pretty gory, others are light hearted and sweet, others just bittersweet.  It's definately an awesome way for Developpers to reward the backers and I'm pretty sure all of them bought the game just to be able to see their own NPC.  The fact that they are entirely optional is also well thought, someone who don't really like reading (and why would they play a game like that is beyond me) can just ignore them.\n\n\nNow, as far as party creation goes, I can already tell some people might feel put off by the fact you can only create one character at the start.  When you enter an Inn (and it happens within the first hour) You can hire mercenaries up to your own level, at a cost.  I found out what thanks to the generous loot, I could have a full party of six very quickly with very little impact on levels.  You also meet scripted NPCs, who are all very interesting but since my first character was a mage and the first hireable NPC you meet is also one, I went with creating my own party.  You get the standard stuff, warrior, monk, druid etc with new stuff like a chanter, which is basically a bard that can take actions while chanting and once a song is complete, you get a strong effect or a cipher who gains "mana" by damaging enemies.\n\nI pretty much completely neglected the scripted NPCs, meaning my party never intervened or commented during conversations which was a bit sad but I did not regret it, my own party was rock solid with far better stats than the scripted ones.  By the end, I did promise myself to use the scripted ones in my next playthrought since they do offer a very lively interaction with the world.\n\nVery early in the game you gain a stronghold, which offers you a major questline as there's a VERY large dungeon in your own basement (actually under your own dungeon, which I thought was clever).  You can build structures to add minor bonuses when you rest at home as well as get cosmetic changes.  Overall it's a fun addition, it adds little to the overall story but again, the massive dungeon alone is worth it.  At fifteen levels, it's by far the largest in game and also by far the most interesting, each level has it's own "theme" and distinct look.\n\nThe enemies were for the most part varied but I admit I'd have wished to see less of these damn "shade" monsters, you see them from start to finish and by level 8, pose no serious threat.  The enemy AI is very good too, I was often surprised by flanking moves and concentrated attacks on vulnerable party members.\n\nSpeaking of AI, there is one, for your party, kinda.  I wish it would show a bit more initiative but once the fight begins, the party members mostly find a new target by themselves but at the start, won't do anything unless you order them to.  They also don't seek new targets if they are too far either.  Personally I like to micromanage my party so I hadn't noticed this until well into the game, as I issued my orders right from the first active pause of combat.\n\nThe game is capped at level 12.  While I understand that at this point you can easily steamroll most fights by just asking everyone to rush in, I hit that limit very early, at the start of act 3.  There's a "bounty" quest system from your fortress' lodge that are basically "go there and kill this person" and they are challenging fights but gives a LOT of XP.  Capping at 15 might have given more of an incentive to finish all quests.  The spells stop at level 6 but there's room for 3-4 more levels in the list, I figure that if the game sells well (and it sure did) they could consider that in the sequel.\n\nNow for the auditory review...  you normally don't expect a game like that to look so good but I've paused at several times in game just to look around and admire the scenery.  Most dungeons are a feast for the eye and the music is really good.  It has a very "Obsidian" theme to it.\n\nVerdict : 92%.  STRONGLY recommended.","April 13, 2015","true","46.2"," 76 of 92 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","76","92","2","1"

The same is true now for Pillars of Eternity. The quality of the game is superlative, it's just an inaccessable format to some people.  I think this is probably the game for you if you can enjoy a fantasy novel or have ever read up on the lore of a videogame outside of the game.\n\nThe thing this type of game does best is world building. The characters you meet have weight, everything matters, and the universe feels unique. It's not a cheap knockoff fantasy world where they just switch around the names of familiar tropes. There's a holistic personality to the world you're in and you just want to get to know it. And the best part is that getting to know the world doesn't mean reading through the codexes in a menu somewhere. The game teases bits of lore and it's up to you to find out more. You learn about a war and you have to meet a veteran to find out what happened. You find the name of a god and you seek out a priest to learn their beliefs. You'll hear someone tell a myth and you'll actually seek out the book in game so you can get the full story. And even then, no one source is definitive, so you're delighted if you ever stumble upon a new tidbit.","March 31, 2015","true","97.3"," 76 of 95 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","76","95","5","0"

Jesus, just when I was getting my life on track...\n\nPillars of Eternity is, hands-down, the best game in its genre since Baldur's Gate II.\n\nSo, yeah. Anyone who ever played any Infinity RPGs for fifty hours straight knows what I'm talking about. Huge, isometric, story-driven games which emphasized immersion in worlds where your choices mattered, your mistakes were painful and the story was engaging. Sure, you had to read giant blocks of text and fight uphill battles that you could lose at the roll of a die, but both of these activities were immensely rewarding in themselves, because the writing was top-notch and the tactics you had to employ against your enemies had to be both creative and abide by Gygax's Tome of Neverending Rules to succeed. This was obviously before they slapped the RPG label to streamlined generic space operas or sandbox Bethesda countryside crawlers with bad writing and worse design.\n\nPillars of Eternity takes place in Eora, which might seem as a garden variety fantasy world at first, but quickly establishes its own identity as you discover that souls can be seen and interacted with and are considerably more palpable than the metaphysical malarkey you normally use to pick up drunk hippy chicks at pretentious parties. Add the political intrigue of separatist colonies and the invention of gunpowder into the mix and you get a uniquely deep universe in which you will have to use cunning, diplomacy and brute force in equal measure to stand a chance.\n\nWhile both the classes and mechanics are basically modernisations of the D&D archetypes and rulesets, enough has been built on top of them to improve the overall experience: you have an infinite inventory for junk, craftable food, potions and enchantments provide secondary activities that enrich your arsenal and there's a really clever compromise between streamlined gameplay and the typical Dungeons and Dragons downtime which separates your encounter health pool (called Endurance) from the general health pool (which you can only regenerate by resting). The cherry on top is the stronghold you get to conquer and own fairly early in the game, and investing into its various buildings not only beautifies the initially decrepit keep, but also provides bonuses, NPCs and a recurring supply of gold.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, giving a painterly feel to the backgrounds and overcoming the technical limitations the Infinity engine had 17 years ago (dynamic water, convincing particle effects and modern resolutions being just the obligatory minimums), while retaining the general feeling gamers had exploring Faerûn. Even the classes and spells are pretty much the same, with occasional renames (presumably to avoid copyright infringement), though their efficiency has been tampered with and itemization is much less restrictive than it used to be.\n\nIf what you read appeals to you, then, by all means, buy this game. It's worth every penny and you'll get your money's worth in gametime, guaranteed. If you're like me, which is to say an absolute loser with no future and zero qualifications, you'll probably have the time to run through it within a week, but if you spread your doses responsably enough you'll probably be playing this a few months from now. Regardless of how immersive and brilliant this game will seem three hours in, don't forget to walk your dog, hang out with your friends and bang your girlfriend 'til she smiles.\n","March 28, 2015","true","75.4"," 107 of 143 people (75%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","75","107","143","25","1"

A true isometric RPG in Baldur's Gate style. Fantastic gameplay where tactical combat is more important than fast clicking. For example, the old/new stats system really make you question and forces you to think seriously when it comes to choosing your weapon or armour that grants specific attribute bonuses, or, for that matter, when you are creating you character.\n\nThe endurance - health system is also one of the factors you must consider when you enter a battle, because, when you lose all the endurance in the battle you get knocked out. When the battle is over you regain your senses, but you lose health. The only way to regain your health is by sleeping in the Inn, using the camping supplies, and, of course, keeping an eye out on the endurance levels all together, because, when your character health is depleted, he/she will die.\n\nThere are so many things you can do in the game and you can easily be side-tracked, but, as it happens, the main story doesn't get lost in the mix.

So if you're interested in the mechanics featured in Pillars of Eternity, this might be for you.\n\nCharacter Attributes and StatsAttributes as you might know them, have been repurposed, and some of their effects put into their own sub categories. Every main Attribute has it's base purpose now. Like Intelligence for example affects the size of the AoE and how long spells/buffs/skills last, and Might affects the strength of physical attacks, spells and also healing.\n\nThe reason for this change is to throw away the old min/maxing of stats in favor of viability and sandbox character creation. Other effects that are usually tied to these attributes or classes have their own categories now, which can be adjusted through equipment or during a lvl up. One example of this is Lore. Where Intelligence is used in other games to determine what scrolls you can read, Lore takes it's place in PoE.\n\nEven though this might sound intimidating or confusing at first, it honestly isn't. Not only is it easier to understand than the "old" way, where the same attributes affect different classes in different ways, but it also prevents hitting a wall in late game because you chose the wrong attributes for your class in the beginning. In PoE this problem is (almost) nonexistant because the system is made so your character will still be viable. Maybe not the way you planned it originally, but still viable. Even messing up deliberately is very hard to do. The basic idea is: create your character the way you want it. And the tooltips explain very clearly what each stat does and how it affects your character, making it very easy to build the one you want to play.\n\nCombat systemCombat in PoE is real time with the option to pause it anytime you want. And you definitely want to pause, because the combat is generally pretty fast in this game. Most fights against regular mobs are over after the first couple of seconds if you have a strong opening(The Cipher's 'Mind Blades' followed up by crippling melee skills for example.) I've played two characters on normal and hard so far, and most basic encounters are relatively easy when using the right strategy. But a strong opening, combined with tactical positioning is the key to handle most encounters quickly. This game rewards the thinking person, and the combat is no exception.\n\nThe combat system is quite deep and has a lot of room for tactical adjustments. I'll just cover the basics here. As you might suspect, dice play a large role in combat. If you hit your enemy or not, is determined by a D100. 1-50 is a grazed hit and 50-100 a regular hit. -0 is a miss, and +100 a critical hit. Grazed hits do -50% DMG, crits do +50%, and a miss makes you look like an idiot. Here's an example of an attack as you'll see it in the combat log:\n\nAcc:40 - Def:26 = 14. Roll:70 + 14 = 84(Hit). 13.5 - (DR:6.0 - 3.0) = 10.5 Pierce\n\nSo, what's happening here? First you have your Accuracy which is compared to the Defense of the defender. In this case the difference is 14 in my favor(40-26=14.) Next is my dice roll to which the previous result is added(or subtracted if your Acc is lower than the defender's Def.) I rolled a 70 plus the 14 from my Acc bonus, meaning 84 = a Hit!\nThen, there's the DMG my weapon does(13.5) and after that the ]Damage Reduction from the defender, which is subtracted from my attack's DMG. Normally this would reduce my damage to 7.5(13.5-6.0), but since my Dagger has the effect to bypass 3.0 Damage Reduction, I only get a 3.0 penalty and do 10.5 Pierce type damage.\n\nWhew! Not so complicated after all is it? However, there are 4 different types of Defense for each character and multiple types of Damage Reduction, which give this system quite a lot of depth to work with.\n\nAnother basic mechanic is Engagement. Once two characters are engaged in combat, they are "locked" to each other. Breaking this lock(to escape or attack a different character) gives the other combatant a free attack. This is a fundamental system, that some people have trouble working with. It also means that the character making the most DMG or aggro doesn't necessarily pull all your enemies. This is where clever positioning and the usage of skills comes into play. (You're going to hate enemies that tunnel or warp their way around your carefully aligned defense. Stop them with spells and skills before they get a chance to do so. See: strong opening.)\n\nVitality & EndurancePillars of Eternity has basically two versions of Health: Vitality and Endurance. Endurance is your resistance to short-term injury, or how much damage a character can withstand before they are knocked unconscious in battle. Vitality represents long-term injury or how much damage a character can sustain before they are maimed or die permanently. A character's Vitality is based on his Endurance and multiplied according to his class. A Druid with an End. of 50 will have Vit. of 200, since his class multiplicator is 4.\n\nEvery hit you take in battle reduces End. & Vit. If your character takes 10DMG, you'll lose 10 End. & 10 Vit. End. is de facto your combat health, and if it's totally depleted, you're knocked out for the rest of the battle. Therefore the healing spells/skills in the game affect the End. The only way to replenish your Vitality however is by resting. Either by camping or sleeping in taverns. Also, your End. will sink with your Vit. once it reaches it's value. Meaning that with a Vit. of 36, you'll also have an End. of 36.\n\nIf your Vitality reaches 0, you'll be maimed. Maimed is a serious condition that inflicts grave combat penalties. Once a character has been maimed, further reduction of Vit. will always result in death, and it can only be healed through resting.\n\nSpell castingAs in old Infinity Engine games, spells have limited use and need resting to replenish said uses. But Pillars of Eternity also features skills that replenish after each battle. The key is to balance these two, so you'll not find yourself without spells in the middle of a dungeon. The amount of camping supplies you have also varies with each difficulty. On hard, you may find yourself run out of spells and without camping supplies right before a major battle. But this is a good example of how Pillars of Eternity handles difficulty. It not simply determines the health and strength of enemies, but the amount of management and tactics required by the player.\n\nThe WritingThere's not much to say here, other than that it's some of the best writing I've experienced in some time. It's not only the story of the game, and the lore(which is almost mandatory for a setting like this), no it's the syntax that makes it so great. Even though you have walls of text in front of you, it almost never feels bothersome to read. Language and sentences are formed so reading remains fluid at all times. Party members are full of character and always fun to interact with, and even regular NPCs are interesting, since even the most basic Q&A session is tied to a bigger story.\n\nBugsAs it is tradition with Obsidian games, Pillars of Eternity suffers from some release bugs. Some common bugs are that you can't leave areas, crashes when entering a certain area, that the cursor stops working etc. All these are already confirmed to be fixed by next week though.\n\nPillars of Eternity is not simply Baldur's Gate 3, and I thank Obsidian for breaking through the wall of overused mechanics, which not only enhances the game to a great deal, but also makes it truly stand out as a CRPG. Read the tooltips and get familiar with the mechanics early on, before you hit the "real" part of the game, and you won't have any trouble with frustration :^)","March 28, 2015","true","28.7"," 84 of 110 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","84","110","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/recommended/291650/","BloodCultist","Creeping Flesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/","645 products in account","Summary:\n\nBeautiful visuals, brilliant art direction, great sound, fun combat, excellent characters and NPC's, lots of choices and consequences, elaborate dialogue, comparable to that of Planescape, fairly challenging, great writing, great atmosphere.\n\nSome frustrating bugs in combat, especially during chaotic battles, hard to keep track of your party among large enemies and amongst tons of visual effects, some god awful pathfinding in some battles.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nPillars of Eternity has not only taken the task of bringing back life into a genre that has laid dormant for years, it did it damn well, and by damn well I mean ♥♥♥♥ing amazingly! It brings me joy beyond expression to finally play a game in this era, an RPG in particular, that offers a fully rounded experience. A game that breaks the mold of what gaming has become, Pillars of Eternity has laid the myth of there being no talent left in the gaming industry to a relieving rest. I have yet to complete the game so this review should be considered a place holder and is subject to change.\n\nIn Pillars of Eternity, you play as what is known in this world as a 'Watcher', this grants you the powers to tap into peoples souls and relive important events in their lives, whether this is a blessing or a curse is unclear but what you find out soon enough is that some people don't take too kindly to their presence and it is best to keep it under the ropes. The world in this game is brutal and shows little room for mercy. Madmen as leaders and false prophets, power, greed and deceit paint the picture this game portays and how you deal with it is up to you.\n\nPillars of Eternity takes place on a sprawling, absolutely beautiful world for you to explore at your own peril. It is setout with similarities relating to the map seen in Baldur's Gate where you traverse through individual points of interest plotted out on the map. The areas for you to explore are varied and a pleasure to explore thanks to the extreme amount of attention to detail poured into this game. They weren't pulling our scarf when saying that this game was crafted with love and care as this game oozes those from every pore.\n\nAs with traditional RPGs, you're given a main quest along with smaller side quests on the side. This game has no single point of attraction, the whole game itself is the attraction. The quests are diverse making seeking them out a pleasure rather than a chore. Each with often with very entertaining outcomes, gone is that feeling of go there fetch/kill that this era of RPGs sunk into, there is a true feeling of responsibility behind the actions you partake in and many questioning you on an ethical level as there are often choices to make and consequences which follow.\n\nIt is with content that I can say that Pillars of Eternity has brilliant writing that helps you delve into and understand the lore, characters, circumstances and events around you. The writing is non-pretentious and explains in extreme detail, painting a vivid picture of your surroundings, going as deep as you're likely to handle, many of the characters you interact with have an insane amount of dialogue pinned to them, you can have elaborate discussions that have a mind numbingly amount of content to them. This adds an incredible amount of life to this already buzzing world. The writing in dialogue is consistent, it never feels as though their hands got tired of typing so lazied off with the sloppy, uninspired writing that plagues gaming these days.\n\nThe audio/visual style of game is breathtaking, a work of art. From the sounds of your sword slicing an enemy to the ground, to the trance inducing, stunning sountrack to the beautifully created backdrops. Everything here is meticulously designed and put together extremely well which is a massive challenge by itself. The atmosphere this game oozes, gives off one of the best fantasy vibes I've ever felt in gaming and this is coming from someone who is a massive fan of the original IE games.\n\nPillars of Eternity features a handful of companions that will aid you through your quest, each masterfully well written, they all have their quirks, background, likes and dislikes and you're able to engage in deep and meaningful conversation with them, learning of their past, giving them advice or agreeing and disagreeing with them. This breathes a lot of life into the game as you feel as though you know the people you're adventuring with rather well as opposed to having that generic, soulless band of companions that offer nothing more than snide comments, empty, worthless dialogue and so on.\n\nThe combat featured in this game is incredibly fun, if you're familiar with games such as Baldur's Gate and IWD, you're likely to hop in and have an understanding off the bat of how things operate. The combat in this game is in real-time, allowing you to pause to issue out commands to your character as well as those in your party, this is of importance, especially when playing on higher difficulties where your tactics need to be as sharp as your blade and one small error could lose you the battle. Each character has their strengths in the form of endurance, accuracy, spell casting and so on from what you'd expect from a traditional Western RPG and utilizing them strategically is key to your success. I am currently playing on hard and while it isn't as brutal and merciless as the games it takes it's inspiration from, there are still quite a few challenging encounters that are bound to warrant a reload.\n\nBrowsing discussions on the Steam thread, I came across numerous posts saying that this game is dumbed down and streamlined when compared to Baldur's Gate, people need to stop the comparisons and play this as it's own game. Sure it takes a lot of influence from the likes of Baldur's Gate, IWD and Planescape (in terms of elaborate writing and story telling), but it strives off it's own merits and mends together it's influences in a unique way.\n\nA few problems I currently have in this game is the AI in combat, while these don't happen very often thankfully but when they do they're bound to make your blood pressure rise, such as your units not always reacting to orders, pathfinding issues, attacking when you want them to retreat and a few other small annoyances.\n\nIt is with a pleasure that I can say Pillars of Eternity is trully worth your money and time, I haven't been this impressed with an RPG since 2000, this takes the genre right back to the standard which it should be today. Offering a deep experience, good role playing, great mechanics and so forth. Thank you Obsidian and the people who made this game possible by backing it. Trully a modern classic.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=415292542\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=415327735\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=415231747","March 28, 2015","true","50.4"," 87 of 115 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","87","115","0","9"

Will keep updating as I play more.\n\nPillars is Obsidian's best game to date, and a genuine masterpiece.\n\nVisually stunning: incredibly detailed backgrounds, with plenty of environmental particle effects that add a lot of life to the scenery. The 3D character models fit perfectly into the scenes, and have smooth, weighty animations (far improved from the backer beta, from what I remember).\n\nThe audio is equally impressive. Everything sounds 'right', from footsteps to arrows hitting their mark. Music seems to be fairly standard fantasy stuff, with lots of flutes and such (Not a music expert, sorry.) Being 'fairly standard' is by no means bad. All the pieces I've heard have been very nice, and fit the scene and situation perfectly. The music is also not on a continuous loop: there are moments where all you'll hear are the ambient noises. Makes me appreciate the music even more, and has (thus far) prevented it from being overly repetitive.\n\nThe game's interface is great. It's modern and easy to use, but not minimalist. Wood and paper textures ties it to the world, but it avoids being old school clunky brilliantly. Fonts are clear, and the size can be adjusted in the settings. There's also a colourblind setting, for those who  need that.\n\nOften in games like this, the story starts off very, very slow. Not the case in Pillars. In the 11 hours I played, the world has me absolutely hooked. The main storyline seems very interesting and highly personal. Side quests are mostly tied to the main story, and all offer a variety of choices along the way. I especially enjoyed a quest where the party is tasked with killing a lord. I figured out three distinct ways of disposing him:\n\n1. Enter through the sewers and sneak into his throne room.\n2. Scale the castle ramparts, enter through the top floor, disguise the party as priests and just walk to the throne room.\n3. Storm the gates and murder everyone.\n\nThis specific quest also had an added layer of complexity, but I won't go into detail here; too many spoilers as it is.\n\nAs you would expect from Obsidian, there's a lot of well-written dialogue and every situation and character I've encountered has been described in great detail (made even better by the fact that the descriptions match the visuals, unlike in, say, Shadowrun Returns or Wasteland 2) Dialogue options are plentiful, with frequent skill / stat checks that do a great job of tying the RPG system into the conversations. Most characters also have at least one line of voiced dialogue, to give the player a better feel of the person. A nice touch.\n\nThe combat is solid, and reasonably challenging even on Normal difficulty. 11 hours in, my party consists of two fighters, two spellcasters and an archer. Even at low levels (2-4) my party composition offers great tactical depth. The casters both have ~12 extremely varied spells available, and the rest have 2 or 3 abilities each. Battles are quick and very dangerous; I find myself pausing after most actions.\n\nArmour seems to play a huge role: my fighters wearing brigandine take significantly less damage than my archer, clad in padded cloth. The differences between weapon types are fairly noticeable as well (especially short vs. long weapons). As a whole, the combat is very fun and the interface for it is highly intuitive.\n\nCharacter progression feels a tad slow, but every level up offers plenty of skill points to distribute, one or two abilities to pick and sometimes a perk as well. Leveling up feels meaningful, and it's immediately noticeable in the characters' performance.\n\nThe large variety of classes, races, backstories and cultures should offer plenty of replayability, when combined with the absolutely vast amount of different directions every conversation can go.","March 26, 2015","true","102.2"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","45","52","4","2"

Kotaku had an article where it said: "You know you have a good game when you reroll after a few hours just to test another class". I rerolled, and I think I might just do another shortly to test the Cipher and/or Druid.\n\nThe story and writing sucks you in and holds you to it's bosom from the minute you start in the caravan camp. And unlike other games you are given clues to what is happening, but nothing else. Which gets your head going. And this part, in addition to the beautiful graphics is what makes it occupy far too much of my time (even when I turn it off).\n\nColorful NPCs with a story to tell makes the game even more engrossing. The same goes for the game world PoE is set in. It's something completely new and alot less black and white than you find in other games. Being the good guy isn't always the same thing as helping people by completing quests. Sure, some of the NPCs are pretty stereotypical, like the animancer early in the first act, but others are not so obvious. It makes it more fun. And because your choices in the dialogues have a direct impact on your own power (turn off the information on what choices give what reputation for extra fun) you really have to think your way through things.\n\nAnother thing I love is the size and lenght of the game. This game will occupy tens of hours of your time if you let it. Some of the side quests are bigger than other games' main storyline!\n\nI'm an oldschool table-top RPGer and have been addicted to D&D for 30 years. Pillars of Eternity makes me want to play the game system ingame, and game world, with my friends in a table-top RPG. I never thought I'd find a game system which is as easy to learn and as hard to master as this is. The possibilities are endless, and the continent can be expanded without having to explain it away. Which makes this my nr. 1 game in my "needs expansions and a sequel" list.\n\nThe game truly pays homage to the old IE games, and would be perfect if not for the, at times, horrible pathing of your party when in combat. That, and the Chanter's high need for micromanagement are the only negative things I can think of when it comes to this game. It's just as awesome as the hype made it up to be.

I really, really wanted to like it but after two dozen hours I long for BG2. Rather than a spiritual successor, it feels like a rushed homage to its predecessor. Here's what I didn't like:\nThe world feels quite small,\ncharacter development choices are not particularly meaningful,\nmelee combat is woefully ineffective (the more armor you have, the slower you hit,  The bigger your shield, the less accurate you are).  Forget about playing a DPS fighter, you're SOL.\nreally found it hard to care about the PC, the world, or any of the companions.\nloading screens EVERYWHERE. Inability to turn off autosave (seriously?) - every screen transition has a 10 second loading screen - it doesn't matter if you're going from a city map to the world map, or just upstairs to the 2nd floor of the inn.  This made me dread indoor environments.\nthe Watcher's Keep -alike, Od Nua, was very disappointing - it almost felt like a series of procedural dungeons.  No puzzles, a very basic story and disappointing treasure.\nbuffing outside combat is impossible as certain skills/spells cannot be activated or cast outside combat.  Again, seriously?  A backwards design choice that really detracts from immersion.\nrelated to the above, since buffing is impossible, the best strategy for any encounter is to front load as much damage as possible, which makes the slow loading firearms almost a default choice for ranged combat.\nthe loot in this game is so underwhelming I ended up not caring.\nexposition overload - almost every character will drop an exposition bomb on you, about the world, their motivations etc.  Instead of telling me, show me - in the way the world is designed, the placement of NPCs like beggars, refugees or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s etc.\nIt LOOKS like BG2, but doesn't have much of a soul.

Here I'll post a few examples to prove my point. Pretty much all of my criticism concerns features that are much better thought through and implemented properly in BG/IWD - so there should be no opportunity to make such a list:\n\nClasses:\n- the thief has no benefits at all in regards of sneaking, unlocking stuff and disarming traps compared to any other class?!\n- no pickpocketing\n- you can only place one trap in total, which makes the underwhelming traps even more useless\n- chanters are boring to play. You can only use their special power once, somethimes twice in a fight\n- choosing solely defensive abilities on a fighters makes him pretty much invulnerable (on hard difficulty my tank never got in any trouble although he always drew aggro from the majority of enemies)\n- due to the lack of special abilities and ammunition the ranger is boring to play and the companion (I only tested the wolf) is downright useless and gets knocked out every fight\n- a paladin with no anti-undead abilities?!\n\nInventory/items:\n- I don't get why you would implement the stash the way the developers did. It totally eradicates inventory management and you get to collect and sell all the loot you come across. The entire game I had more money than I could spend, even purchasing the useless upgrades for my castle. Does my party drag a 10 ton freight container around all the time or how the heck does this work.\n- why does a food vendor buy 200 weapons and armors from me?\n- no need to identify found items. Do they all come with instruction manuals and product descriptions?\n- the inventory of vendors never changes and the majority don't sell anything that could be considered a remarkable upgrade (oh the times when you crawled out of Irenicus' dungeon and stumbled into Adventurer's Mart)\n\nCombat mechanics:\n- you have no possibility of preparation for a battle whatsoever. This not only reduces tactics to a nostalgic wish, it also makes combat unnecessarily boring. Therefore scouting out enemies is useless and, thanks to the broken stealth mechanic, not possible at all most of the time\n- You can't drink certain potions, use certain abilities or spells while not in combat. What?! Why?\n- I got bitten by a spider as large as a house and got poisoned. Yet there are no anti-venom potions or spells and after killing the beast a few seconds later, the poison was gone and the character rehealed instantly back to full endurance. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and would make being prepared for such situations needless, even if it were possible\n- no ammunition for ranged weapons. This would've been soo easy to implement and boost the tactical aspect of combat a lot!\n- not a single battle where I had to stack e.g. all the fire defense I can get to survive\n\nMagic:\n- the spell system is a joke compared to it's predecessors\n- the available buffs are so weak, short timed and limited, they're not worth the time clicking through the unergonomic menus to cast (some buffs only last 3 seconds - are you kidding me, it uses more time to cast)\n- the range on AoE spells is a joke, why can't I cover the screen in exploding fireballs and clouds of deathly gas?\n- the game can't decide if it wants to use friendly fire or not, some spells affect companions, some don't, why not just provide the option to toggle all friendly fire on or off\n\nExperience system:\n- why do NPCs have the same exp when I meet them regardless whether I am level 1 or 12?! Do they live in a magical training dimension?\n- I don't like how every character has the exact same exp levels independent of his class and everyone levels up at the same instant\n- I like how I only get exp from killing enemies until I've finished my bestiary. But why doesn't this provide me with a combat bonus against these enemies?\n\nCrafting:\n- crafting doesn't make sense at all. Why can I do it anywhere and anytime? At least make me carry a mortar and pestle or limit it to doing it when resting\n- why does mixing a few herbs to create a potion cost hundreds of copper? Do my characters just throw the money on the ground to calm the gods of potion mixing??\n- why is the minimum 2 potions, costing 2 of every ingredient?\n\nA lot more:\n- no boss fights that would be worthy of that name\n- no epic loot that would make a difference, just combinations of the same boring properties I can craft myself\n- no thinking challenges or riddles\n- no random events like ambushes when traveling or attacks while resting in a dungeon\n- no humor or funny/silly side stories or quests that would lighten up the continuously dark and gritty atmosphere\n- no deceptions, at least none that I can recall. Everyone in this world seems to be honest, no one tries to trick you\n- the castle is, apart from the dungeon below which could be anywhere else, useless and doesn't provide any benefit to the game\n- companions don't have an alignment, so nobody cares much whether you do good or bad\n\nTo conclude this 'review' (it's more of a rant, I know) I have to admit that I liked the game just as much to make me finish the main story and invest 60 hours into it. Sadly there's not much else out there recently in this genre. Maybe this will provide some input to build upon in the sequel.","May 16, 2015","false","60.5"," 480 of 754 people (64%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","64","480","754","57","24"

Widely acclaimed as a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. While I do not doubt the truth of such claims, I would like to offer my perspective as someone who's never played Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, and thus approach PoE with fresh eyes.\n\nFor a start games in the fantasy genre which PoE sits in are plenty on Steam. Indeed I have an earlier review of Spellforce, a game which was somewhat forgettable for me despite brave attempts to capture the spirit of fantasy RPG. As I hadn't played Baldur's Gate nor Icewind Dale, PoE's first job as to sell itself to me on the steam store page. I approached it with some skepticism initially and wasn't entirely sold on the top down isometric view. The game's content, gameplay, mechanics, lore etc however, reminded me of my evenings of pen and paper RPG games I've had with friends, and that convinced me to give it a try.\n\nIt was a decision I would not regret. Character creation is one of the biggest parts of any good P&P fantasy RPG game, be it Dungeons and Dragons or Warhammer. The character creation of PoE made me feel exactly like I was starting a P&P RPG game. It wasn't so much as customising my character's look as it was fleshing out my backstory, allocating stats etc. I spent almost 3 hours alone in character creation.\n\nThe story is well written, well paced. The lore is rich, you feel like you are in a wonderful fantasy world to be explored. While having individual maps instead of a massive world like any of the Elder Scrolls games makes exploration less of a focus, nonetheless it's still good fun discovering new places. The combat system takes a while to learn and master, and having a game manual would really help, but by and large the mechanics of the game aren't too difficult to pick up. When playing it I had a sense I was playing a game with Elder Scroll's rich lore and setting with Diablo's graphics and interface, both franchises I absolutely adore. As a setting for individual role playing in, it's right up there with Elder Scroll games.\n\nThere aren't many games which have made me think "I really love the fantasy genre". Fable was the first that got me started. Warcraft, especially WoW, got me deep into it. Elder Scrolls cemented my love for the genre, and I didn't think it was possible to take my love for fantasy to a new level, but Pillars of Eternity has somehow managed to do that. Playing it brings back the sort of emotions I experienced the first time I played Fable, WoW, Elder Scrolls. All the more amazing given the isometric top down projection and fixed maps PoE utilises instead of first person or over the shoulder views in an open world those other games share.\n\nWith the rich amazing lore as its foundations, I can see PoE being the beginning of something great. A grand new fantasy franchise to go alongside giants such as Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, Warhammer etc. PoE has recently released its first DLC, I am sure the first of many. This is a game franchise with a great future to come, and I am not only glad I am a part of it from the first game, I hope to bring along as many of you on this adventure as I can.\n\nEdit: already PoE is being held up as the new benchmark. Issue 283 of PC Gamer has a review for a similiar isometric view RPG game called Kyn with this exact phrase: "The more I played, the less it reminded me of Pillars of Eternity..."\n\nAlso I wrote this review before I read the PC Gamer's review of PoE. Here's part of the opening paragraph: "Almost an hour had passed, and I was still on the character creation screen. That’s how I knew, before I’d even started, that this homage to classic computer role-playing games like Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment was authentic...."\n\nAnd here's another part of the next: "It’s the most captivating, rewarding RPG I’ve played on a PC in years, and I’ve fallen in love with the intricate, richly painted world they’ve crafted."\n\nSeems familiar? Those were exactly the same things I've said about PoE that's made me fall in love with. This game is a must try for RPG fans. Get it, you won't regret it!","September 7, 2015","true","111.7"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","40","48","0","6"

My previous experience has been with games like Skyrim, the Mass Effect series,  various shooters and an assortments of strategy games.  With that in mind, I was a little concerned that the pacing of this game would be an issue (having to pause repeatedly in combat, reading through a lot of text, the lack of flashy special effects and cutscenes, etc...).  Not only is it not an issue, I found that it was quite relaxing!  This game makes me want to play it while drinking a cup of hot tea while sitting in front of a crackling fire.  It's an experience to be taken slowly and savored.  I spent about 30 minutes in the character creation alone and loved all the various options that went into crafting the perfect hero.\n\nI read some copmplaints here about the graphics quality, but it was a non-issue to me.  In fact, I have found that to be one of the things working in its favor.  In a weird way, not being bombarded with flashy special effects and cutscenes is one of the things that has helped make the game more immersive and relaxing to me.\n\nI highly recommend this game.  It's deep, immersive and the story and world is charming and interesting.

Loads of tedious combat encounters and binary quest solutions. Unable to get all achievements since one is exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\n\nUPDATE: Finally made it to the end boss on Ironman Path of the Damned and the game has glitched rendering me unable to complete it and invalidating ALL of my progress. I have spent nearly 150 hours trying to find something other than the main story to redeem this game but I have nothing.\n\nI have played Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, Fallout, Torment, as well as Neverwinter Nights 1&2. I have played just about every obsidian game that has come out as well, with my favorites by and far being NWN2 Storm of Zheir, and Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nHowever when I play this game, it is (to my surprise) boring. The problem is a vast majority of the game is combat, tedious number rolling save-scumming low damage limited spells combat. There are no instant-kill abilities or vibrant graphic spells to break up the monotony such as Torment, it is largely just putting a tank or two at a bottleneck and picking apart packs of monsters. It almost feels that most enemies exist of the sake of existing. There are other things I dislike about the combat (especially the engagement system) but I will save my figurative breath.\n\nAs with any Obsidian game the dialogue is well-written, although I find that a majority of  dialogue choices loop to the same outcome. Most quests end up with you fighting the person regardless if you want to or not, a vast majority of people are more than willing to just charge in and die to a group of random strangers for no discernible reason instead of going to jail or opting to run away. It seems most "persuasive" options involve threatening people until they tell you what you probably already know.\n\nThat being said I don't really enjoy this game, it holds a lot of potential that just isn't realized and ends up executing ideas poorly. Obsidian has an undeniable talent for writing, but they are just not up to balancing a game. The leveling system is a mess of must-have or don't-touch abilities, and even with a 6 person party it just feels completely underwhelming.","June 30, 2015","false","148.6"," 117 of 180 people (65%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","65","117","180","14","1"

The gameplay is analogous to sitting down to play a D&D campaign by one of those insane DMs who obsess over pointless minutiae and devote countless hours to "fixing" the game.\n\nThe resting system is a good example of this type of crazy DM-style wasted effort: supposedly you could "exploit" the rest system in the old IE games to render entire dungeons easy because you faced every encounter at full strength. Now, to begin with, this wasn't even true unless you modded the game, and even then nobody actually did it. But as people do, some loud people on the internet whined about it and for some reason Obsidian listened. So in Pillars you can only rest outside of inns by spending limited camping supplies. You can only carry a small amount, depending on the difficulty setting. These camping supplies have some pretty powerful magic, though, seeing as you can whip them out in the middle of a dungeon full of hostile enemies and not have to worry about them attacking you while you rest. However, it is a completely pointless little mechanic. If you really want to there's nothing stopping you from wandering out of the dungeon, resting at the nearest inn, and coming back to pick up where you left off.\n\nAnother new mechanic added to the IE game formula is engagement, which is fundamentally broken as of the time I'm writing this. Essentially, it's the cumbersome attack of opportunity system from D&D 3rd Edition edited to make even less sense. In practice it locks your characters into standing around if an enemy closes into melee range; if you dare try to run away you instantly eat an infinite number of attacks and die. Enemies, on the other hand, rarely have reason to care about engagement unless the AI is programmed to respect it--which is all they did in the old IE games. It's a system that is annoying, doesn't work properly, and ultimately does not contribute anything to the gameplay. A lot of the work that went into Pillars falls into this category because it was done with the crazy DM mindset mentioned above, which is funny because I would imagine at least some of the folks at Obsidian remember what was said when Fallout 2 was in development: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."\n\nSo the gameplay is a bit of a mess, and dungeons are a tedious slog if you can't find a way to avoid combat (the game doesn't reward combat anyway, so the shortcuts consisting of clever little cutscenes and skill checks are much appreciated). Some classes are (as of this writing) far from ideal, such as the Monk (their central mechanic involves taking damage to power their abilities, but player characters generally die almost immediately if enemies' attacks are actually landing on them). Many design decisions are just strange: a lot of classes get their best abilities up front, in the first three levels, so leveling up rarely feels like a significant improvement. Higher-level abilities actually tend to be weaker or otherwise less ideal than lower-level ones. Much of this is just poor balance and could be adjusted with patches. Others feel inexcusable: a lot of people get frustrated by the ghost-type enemies, who have extremely high defenses, teleport, duplicate themselves, come in mobs, can spam a powerful ranged attack, and in melee easily stunlock your party to death.\n\nThe new original setting is a disappointment. A lot of creatures get new Welsh or Celtic names but are otherwise the same as their D&D equivalent. The story ultimately is more concerned with demystifying their own world and laying out an existentialist "science vs. religion" allegory. Every mystery in the setting is explained in detail before the end, and the world ends up feeling like a tiny, wretched sort of place. It's an interesting contrast to the big and wondrous settings of Planescape or Numenera, both of which Obsidian is intimately familiar with. The story is slow and ponderous and pretentious and, after a major misstep at the end of Act 2, squanders any sense of momentum or player investment it might have developed up to that point before rushing to an unsatisfying conclusion. The primary antagonist is petty, uncharismatic, and doesn't end up making much of an impact or even a whole lot of sense (I'm not entirely sure why he does anything he does, unless he's supposed to be nothing more than some kind of strawman religious zealot). Even Isair & Madae from Icewind Dale 2, as two-dimensional as they were, were more interesting and memorable villains. An effort is made to give the custom protagonist more personality than what was on display in the older IE games but it doesn't amount to much, especially compared to pretty much every other RPG Obsidian has ever made. Notably, there is no way to talk the final boss to death, which in this extremely longwinded game feels like an oversight.\n\nIn the end, Pillars of Eternity was always a project fueled entirely by nostalgia. The fact that it fails to meet the level of quality of the games that it's modeled after on pretty much every conceivable level (I do think it's better than the first Baldur's Gate, but that's not saying much coming from me) means that there's no compelling reason to play it when you could just (re)play Baldur's Gate or Planescape: Torment or Icewind Dale.","May 8, 2015","false","59.8"," 261 of 422 people (62%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","62","261","422","23","9"

I let the hype train, and the 3.9 million budget (on kickstarter) isometric rpg game, make me think it was going to be an epic that would allow me to relive Baldur's Gate. And I was wrong.\n\nI'll start off with a few things I liked. Inventory management is much easier. You can place the majority of loot in a huge container. The Prologue I found to be extraordinarily fun, and I felt everything about that part of the game was well fleshed out. The fast forward that allows you to quickly walk around is a dream come true. The stronghold mechanics were extremely fun and well done.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to update the news on this review, the devs caved into SJWs to remove a limerick that was pathetically not offensive. In addition to that, the devs have stated modding on the Baldur's Gate scale is unlikely. So yeah, enjoy this objectively worse game. Funnily enough, they largely stated they would "support" mods. By support, they must have meant "allow" mods, supporting them in a metaphorical sense rather than an actual implementation sense.\n\nI'd also like to mention the absolute shameless moneygrab the upgrade packs are. It makes EA look generous.\n\nBut sadly, for a story rich rpg, if you find the story and characters uninteresting and the combat unfun, you will not like this game.\n\nI found myself fairly uninterested in the story. In Baldur's Gate you were the spawn of a dead God, in planescape Torment you were an amnesiac immortal who can die, in this game you're a ghost whisperer.\n\nThe prologue was fun until the end, and the game kinda felt like it just kept rolling downhill.\n\nFirst, like most obsidian games, it's been released with numerous bugs, though you wont notice them at first (loading game with some stat boosting armor stacks the effect, saving and reloading enough will make you invincible.)\n\nCombat is terribly unbalanced. There are SEVERAL situations where my backline (the damage on the team) is simply rushed by most persons of the enemy group. In order to stop them, I use tank-warriors, whom are immediately ignored and practically walked through. Warriors in general don't do very much damage so you HAVE to rely on your backline. But if you can't peel the enemies off, GG better reload.\n\nThen you can form a party of max/min rangers. 4 rangers, a cleric, and a tank/rogue are unbelieveably strong because they each get an animal companion. The hardest difficulty with this group is relatively easy.\n\nMages and Clerics cannot cast buffs before battle. So no preperations can be used save for just "winging it." In battle tactics often involve simply having your backline hope the front line can prevent the fast moving rush monsters from touching the backline. In baldur's Gate, this wasn't nearly as bad an issue, as you could summon monsters or even buff characters before a battle, in this game u kinda just hope and pray.\n\nMages have been SEVERELY weakened relative to what you probably expect. Many of the spells you'd expect them to have have been split up between roles, such as chanter, and chanters can't learn mage---excuse me, wizard spells. In Baldur's Gate you'd use all your mage spells in a battle early on. But it wasn't too big an issue, you could rest all you needed, though it would risk combat. In this game, you CAN'T rest without supplies, and you can only bring 4 rests worth in normal difficulty, plus they're relatively hard to come by.\n\nThen there's the skirmishes. They only programmed party ai to auto-attack. A very lazy way to go about things considering just about every iso game in the infinity engine allows your party to auto-battle with more developed ai.\n\nThe game's built in characters "tag along" with your party without any real reason to do so. The only character that actually seems to have a reason to tag along is the Grieving Mother and Sagani. The others are just risking their lives for you and doing chores around your keep because "it seems less boring than waiting around." The writers make little effort to conect the characters to you at a personal level in any way. They barely even seem to notice each other, and while they do banter, the banter will likely remind you of Dragon Age rather than Baldur's Gate, they say a few voiced lines, instead of arguing or having something meaningful to say, they just feel like they're making minor comments. In Planescape: Torment, the characters could all connect to the main character because they were all suffering torment and at one point or another, dealt with experiencing their nature jurassically change. And the reoccurring question: "What can change the nature of a man." Was pure icing on the cake. I could analyze that game and its merit all day.\n\nIn this game: Many of the characters aren't particularly interesting to begin with, and are shockingly low in number. BG1 had 25 companions available and 5 temporary companions. This game has 8 companions and 2 temporary. Something is amiss if the amount is a THIRD of available in game party members of a 1998 game it tries to succeed that have much less dialogue than Planescape: Torment despite much better technology not to mention recieving 4 times their asking budget. None of the in-game characters seem nearly as special or interesting.\n\nThere's a LOT of writing in this game, but quantity doesn't necesarily mean quality. There's *some* great immersive dialogue, but there's just moments where I can't help but not care. The characters' motivations are poorly constructed, the quests are immersively flawed, ex: a certain paladin: ("I have to go to this location that is currently unavailable at this point in the story, so I'll just ignore my meager existence because my plotline isn't important enough to give an explanation as to why I can't guide you to this location on the map yet.")\n\nOh and the FAN CREATIONS EVERYWHERE. Oh God. At first I was reading the various tombstones wondering why this was all over the place. Turns out if u paid 500-1000$ you got to add some of ur own fanfiction to the game. The npcs created from this are mostly hardcore Mary Sues. Thankfully, holding tab allows you to determine who's real and who isn't. But if you want, you can "reach out for the soul" to read about the fanfiction character that semi-cannononically made it into the game.\n\nThere's also a Kickstarter only achievement if you're a completionist.\n\nAs another reviewer said:  "For 34.99, it's a been one huge and, frankly unacceptable disappointment. It piggy backs on the reputation of much older and far superior games, without ever matching their achievements. Baldur's Gate will be remembered in another fifteen years. Barring bargain basement sales, POE will have been forgotten"\n\n\nHaving said that, maybe I'm being unfair? I keep wanting a game to top Baldur's Gate and Torment, but I have yet to see a fraction of what this game could and should have been.\n\nTLDR; If you hate yourself and your money, purchase this game.","March 30, 2015","false","43.8"," 445 of 739 people (60%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","60","445","739","39","51"

This is almost certainly true, but not everyone has played those, so if you are just looking for another good RPG. If this is the case, get it, let me tell you why! Just keep in mind this the continuation of an older and much different kind of RPG, one that you read much more than you see visually. Some might see the 2D backgrounds and relatively unimpressive 3D models and think "why play this when I can play the much sexier new Dragon Age?" Well, if Dragon Age is akin to an interactive movie, Pillars is like an interactive book. It's brimming with excellent writing and interesting characters, not to mention some fascinating lore. It can seem a bit like standard fantasy with dwarves and elves running around, but after only 7 or so hours it's got me hooked. I don't want to go into too much detail about mechanics and things, other reviews have surely covered that.\n\nTL;DR: This a thinking man's RPG, it may not have had a huge budget, but the folks at Obsidian are (in my opinion) some of the best in the business, and this an excellent game.

Obsidian really set the bar for CRPG's. Beyond that, I think Avellone and company really elevated their game further as far as their story writing goes as well. Just flat out superb, seamless, and fairly well flawless IMO.\n\nThere has been a lot written about this game already, obviously, but I will say that with all the hype and all the funding that went into this, the potential for a let down was great, so to have the game not only deliver, but deliver in such grand fashion was amazing.\n\nThe character development was deep and fulfilling and the quests actually made sense....rather than just simple fetch and escort quests with no rhyme or reason, everything had an actual reason in this game, and even where they didnt serve to advance the main story, they still had a very real role in filling out the depth of the world itself.\n\nThe actual story line itself was pretty gripping. The end of Act 1 gave you the sense of a journey really just beginning, the end of Act 2 was a "holy ♥♥♥♥!" moment, and the end of Act 3 let you know there was no turning back and that everything was about to get all too real as you approached the end of the game. That doesnt even factor in some of the other, non main quests story lines that develop throughout the game, which are also stellar.\n\nThe journey itself was filled with pretty much any emotion you can imagine. The moral choices were often difficult due to the realistic consequences that come with every decision.\nSpeaking of decisions, quite a few of them factor into the ending...and speaking of endings, I cant remember another game that had such a well thought out one. There also seems to be potential for a lot of variations to the ending depending on what choices you made at pivotal moments throughout. My ending was a fair mix of incredibly good and depressingly bad consequences to what I had done during my extensive playthrough. I loved that fact.\n\nI am thoroughly impressed with this game, and I have to give it the edge over Baldurs Gate 2 as maybe the best CRPG of all time, and a top 5 all time great game from any genre.\n\nI have a lot more to say, but so vast was the story and so deep the experience, that I think maybe it's better if I leave the rest unsaid and let you form your own opinion instead.\n\nPlay this.\n\nCan there be a 15 out of 10?

I played for a good 10 hours or so on hard but switched down to normal to experience the game over the engine issues that need fixing. No doubt various balance patches will come out for this. Obsidian are hardly known for their clean bugless games on launch..historically their QA department are a bunch of clowns, which is a shame considering how good their game design can be.\nI would say the only flaw (albeit a subjective one) is that Obsidian did make some progressive choices with NWN2 with regards to game performance (faster loading or no loading when moving upstairs in a building etc. For some reason they have regressed to having a loading screen for every map change similar to Baldurs and Icewind Dale engines.

For the fans of the genre, this is a must-have. The old school feel, dialogue boxes, the hud and the isometric landscape will bring tears to your eyes if you were around for the first BGs like me.\n\nBUT, as you progress you'll start seeing through the nostalgia and noticing the flaws. And there are a few;\n\n1- Spell menu designs; horrible! Spells only appear when you hover your mouse over the spell level slot, which is frustrating because you keep missing it by an inch and it goes to the next slot, or worse cast the wrong one just to realize turns later. Sounds like a small thing, but considering the hours you spend casting them I would have expected something better.\n\n2- auto leveled companions; yeah, you start your game, hang around for a couple of levels then meet this great guy, priest or something; you should be happy, but you can't. Because their level always matches yours and as usual they are complete idiots when it comes to picking talents. Don't be surprised to find your exact build (happened to me with a paladin) and stupid worthless crap like extra level 1 spell slot?!.\n\n3- very inconsistent difficulty curve; won't be a problem for a some of you but I have friends giving up on the game just because the first few levels were near impossible to beat. this game starts really tough but once you reach level 8, you'll start butchering people like crazy. The problem is the dungeon below your castle which you can use as a grinding area and get a few levels without advancing in the story. So from that point on you'll breeze through the dungeons, stopping only for a few occasions like a few bosses (the master below!).\n\n4- And finally, subplots. I have to say the story is great here, but all of us oldschoolers expected funny sidequests, really wacky npcs with stupid motives, the occasional wondering idiot and so on. Also everything kinda ties into the main arc, which is great in a way, but what about stuff like the knights of solamnia in BG2, vampires and such? I miss those.\n\nApart from all that, this is a very good game, and I was hooked.

So.  Many.  Loading screens.\n- Spotty voice acting\n- Combat pathfinding can be kinda stupid\n- Immersion-breaking backer content\n- Extremely text-reliant\n\nOverall: Pillars is a great game that's extremely immersive and fun.  If you are a fan of isometric games like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, but can't get into them due to their age, this is a perfect game to try.  Obsidian did everything right.  The game is streamlined and their original system works wonderfully.  The text is beautifully written, and if you can ignore the backer content (any tombstones or yellow-name characters) the game is one of the most immersive you'll find.  Voice acting gets choppy (one frame is narrated, the next is not, then another narrated, etc), and there are a lot of loading screens.  These are minor issues in an otherwise perfect game.  Every choice matters in this game, and if Bioware pays attention, maybe they can take a few notes on how to properly end a Mass Effect game.\n\nBottom Line: You probably already know if you want this game or not.  But if you're on the fence, wait for a solid sale and buy it.  It's a blast to play, and whatever problems the game may have fade away in the face of the final package.

I've played Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, including the expansion throne of Bhaal. Yes I've played Icewind Dale 1 and 2 and even Neverwinter nights 1 and 2.\n\nPillars of Eternity just doesn't measure up, in large part due to the laziness of the developers and an overall lack of innovation. This is the first time I've played through a Bioware/Obsidian rooted game and skipped through the text conversations out of the shear dreariness/tediousness of the story in PoE. The combat is dull and a step backwards from the scripted companion AI in the infinity engine games. If the idea of micromanaging every action of your party members sounds appetizing, then you might very well enjoy this game, that is if the bugged AI and invisible walls don't ruin your experience, as quite regularly you will find that your party members will twitch or stand around aimlessly while you attempt to slog through the game's ever boring world. I should also mention the fact that your party stops getting xp from battles after getting enough kills of certain mobs and completing that mob's beastiary, making battles an annoyance and borefest later in the game).\n\nI paid $38 for this and regret doing so, for those infinity engine fans wishing to purchase this game, I would suggest waiting for a price drop and paying no more than $8.

Fast forward to a man in his 30s returning to that special, hopelessly immersed, "yes I know what time it is!", place with the absolute gem that is Pillars of Eternity.\n\nThe game is not so much a return to old glory, as much as it is old glory catching up to those of us who thought it past and gone.  The plot is VERY dark, gritty, and grown up.  There are volumes worth of lore, history, and politics written in detail, yours for the reading, which flesh out the setting and pivotal time in which you enter the story. The world is beautifully drawn.  The character and combat system, while not D&D rules and conventions, feels more like an evolutionary step forward for D&D e.g. Do you like your wizard to fire the same old magic missiles all of the time?

But newbies be warned - this is a slow-burner of a game.

About the "bland" combat - it isn't bland. It changes as you progress in much the same way as it has in EVERY DnD type game in history. If you want shallow hack n slash look elsewhere kiddies.\n\nWhich brings us to the story. And, to my mind at least, storylines in RPGs are ALWAYS the most important aspect. This one is original and the new setting and weirdness of the developing situation (which is really quite dark in parts) create a great sense of intrigue and immersion AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE PATIENCE NOT TO WANT TO BE FIGHTING HORDES FROM DAY ONE.\n\nFor me, then, this is nigh on the perfect game.

Where character sheets and making actual dialogue decisions (coinciding with some stat checks, I don't believe there are dice rolls) were par for the course.\n\nAn only slightly more modern take on Balders Gate or Icewind Dale.\n\nThe game pretty quickly drops you into the action and tells you you're very important. Its up to you what to do with that or how to react. Combat takes place in real time. With each action using a cooldown to activate in order to avoid an interrupt, aside from movement. A sort of active turn based variety of combat.\n\nCharacter creation is extremely in depth perhaps lacking in physical customization but the character traits, stats, class and narrative background are all available for customization.\n\nThere are many many many classes to choose from to fill out your 6 person party.\n- Barbarian – pretty self explanatory\n- Fighter – Most well rounded class\n- Chanter – magic user (units – 'lines chanted' during battle)\n- Druid – Shapeshifter (DPS)\n- Cipher – magic user (units – 'Focus' earned from doing damage with regular weapon)\n- Monk – Special abilities earned from 'Wounds' or damage taken\n- Paladin – Can be tankish, healer\n- Priest – magic user, healer, pos+ neg- buff, debuff dealer\n- Ranger – has pet, (slightly useless rogue in my opinion)\n- Rogue – charismatic, DPS, scouts, disarms and detects traps\n- Wizard – magic user (most effective use of Grimoire)\n\nPerma Death is a real thing on higher difficulties. The green bar on the character portrait is Heath, the overall status of that character. The portrait itself, when taking damage fills in red, this is endurance and when depleted is what will knock someone out of battle. If someones Health is depleted entirely. Bad News Bears I'm afraid. You'll run into characters that have quests associated with them and require you to take them on your journey. These characters are also voice acted as well as some important NPC's. Though not every line has a voice over as this was a kickstarter game (as the loading screen is very apt to point out) That's simply not a realistic goal for something with as much text and dialogue. I should mention that though another character can interact with NPC's you are making the dialogue choices based on your base character for any stat checks that may occur in conversation.\n\nYou can re-spec any character at any inn for a relatively inexpensive price if you've made a terrible judgment in choosing traits or some other facet that would otherwise make your current quest more difficult. You can 'hire' a new recruit at any inn, by which I mean you can just make the exact type of character you are missing from your party. More money equals higher starting level.\n\nFairly early on, you arrive at a place called Caed Nua, which becomes your own stronghold and fairly integral part of the game. You can upgrade it, repair it and use it as a place to rest and receive bonuses from. Depending on how much prestige you and your party have as well as the overall status of your stronghold it can be attacked by bandits (or by other groups) in which you are given the option between hiring some mercenaries and auto-resolving from afar (they can help in a manual resolve as well) if your travels have taken you too far away to make it back in time before they strike or you can travel back yourself and manual resolve to defend your keep. There is also a rather extensive side mission available here among other things.\n\nTHE GIST\nA true delight for the days of old when RPG's were more than 'press button for sarcastic response'. One can only hope that games of this depth and caliber remain popular enough to be feasible for proper development in the future.","December 25, 2015","true","44.4"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","31","41","0","1"

Everyone loves this game, and if you buy the game, you probably will too. But I feel like I am the only one who sees all the problems with this game.\n\nWe need to move forward. The old crpg's were great, but they were not to be idolized. We need to understand why we loved them, and let the genre grow with us and become better.\n\nThis game feels like it was made by a team of writers who felt that combat was an interruption. Far too much emphasis is placed on words words words. Dear god the reading. I'm even a huge reader myself, but I do not turn on the computer to read a novel.\n\nThe addition of write-your-own-story style vignettes was a great idea, but honestly they were never that shocking or a real decision. If you took a risk you gained an item and usually just lost some hit points (overall not a huge detriment).\n\nI want to go off-track and rant for a bit. Can we please not make any more ultra-generic fantasy games? Nothing about this world was remotely interesting until the 3rd act. It was the same, "the mayors daughter's is lost" stories that I have seen so many times I'm over it. But everyone gobbles it up and I don't know why.\n\nThe game demanded I do their textbook reading. They had people speak, and the dialogue written so you could read along, but they always added in their little descriptive sentences so they could make sure you knew what happened. So often I had to struggle to picture scenes told entirely through text. If only they had some way to use characters and voiced dialogue to make me understand what happened. Oh wait, they can, but they spent all their @#$@% effort figuring out which adjective should describe a leaf.\n\n*spoiler* After I beat the game, you would think that my character was a baby ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a gambling problem. Every damn story-line they wrapped up was some horrendous or heart-breaking event. Keep in mind that I did not help some characters with their problems because they were annoying and I did not know where to go. I worked my ♥♥♥ off to try and clear one district of undead people and turn off the device to recover it. What does the epilogue tell me? That I somehow messed up my choice and now it is overrun again after some people moved in.\n\nThe WORST part of the epilogue was the story about me taking back a keep from a cliche insane king (I'm glad the writers stayed up all night developing him) that really any human with a shred of decency would try to eradicate. They said the crazy king came back as a lich or something, killed his nephew, and now reigns over the dead region because he killed everyone. Wait wait, that is cool as ♥♥♥♥. I WISH I could have had to deal with that. I wishan entire act was fighting an undead king and determining how to keep him in the ground. This is awful because they had an awesome idea that they just relegated to a paragraph, then threw the cliche mountain at me instead.\n*End Spoiler*\n\nIn the end, I just wanted to get through the game. The combat is incredibly overcomplicated. There are 10 or so status effects, and none of them are intuitive or seem to matter besides stun and knockdown (which apparently are the same). Sometimes your weapons would be ineffective, and there would be a character saying it, but the combat log was so dense I had to hire an accountant to find it. When I considered the amount of real life time I spent in combat, it was actually faster to not use many abilities, and instead just give my characters passive abilities so they auto-attack harder.\n\nLet's also talk about there being no party AI. Baldur's Gate had AI. That was over a decade ago. Computers have octupled in power, and ducking obsidian can't get together to write simple AI.\n\nCombat encounters were slapped together. There was no actual encounter design, they just had groups and open areas.\n\nWhen you leveled up characters, there were very few meaningful choices. There are 6 different weapon specialization talents that all do the same thing, but you know, if you want to choose them and not really care that is good too.\n\nFinally, combat difficulty could go from tutorial level to final scene of Ender's Game difficulty. The final boss was sooooooooooo hard. Why? Their defenses were so high that everything was a graze, doing 1-3 damage versus full damage of 30-40. I basically had to exploit to win.\n\nSo yeah, everyone loves it, and I feel like this game will become the dances with wolves of video games: enjoyed at the time it came out, but a decade later nodbody knows why they liked it.","June 27, 2015","false","33.2"," 113 of 184 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","113","184","8","1"

I loved BG1. And BG2. But not so much Throne of Baal. And Planescape: Torment is one of the best games I've ever played. However, Pillars of Eternity just feels like it was cobbled together by some diehard fans who couldn't let go. They're writing fan fiction to relieve the "glory days".\n\nThe story itself is so so, and it can't decide if it wants to take itself seriously or wants to be a tongue in cheek fantasy parody. For example, there's an endless dungeon filled with vampires and mages and monsters right underneath your home, called the Endless Paths of Od Nua. Seriously? And the game takes pains to remind you in every town and forest you go to that it was crowdfunded, with little in-jokes and even name lists of sponsors plastered everywhere.  The big reveal at the end is predictable and underwhelming, especially since it basically begs the questions: "okay, so what?" and "so what exactly am I supposed to do about it? if anything?"\n\nAs for the system itself, it's a D&D pastiche. Unlike Dragon Age: Origins, ShadowRun or even Risen, there's no reason for why the character classes are in the setting. It's just a grab bag of D&D tropes. Let's get the monk, the psychic, the barbarian, the druid, etc. etc. and copy paste them into our take on Forgotten Realms. You've got your elves and half-orcs (sorry, Aumaua), and dwarves. Whatever race and class you pick, don't worry. It has virtually no impact. The only thing the game tries to do for originality is that it combines attributes together in new and crazy ways, to pretend it's fresh and creative. However, why a fireball-hurling wizard needs to be a mountain of muscle to do real damage doesn't make any logical sense to me!\n\nAll in all, this game will appeal to two types of gamers. The old-school Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate fans who can't move on, and think modern games are rubbish. And secondly, for people new to the genre who want to be old school without having to deal with the dated graphics and hardcore difficulties of the really old games.\n\nMe? I thought the game was alright. A weak 3 out of 5. But I prefer to both replay my old favorites AND enjoying the new, cutting edge RPGs, rather than get lost in fan-fiction recreations of old legends. YMMV.","August 26, 2015","false","68.5"," 110 of 179 people (61%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","61","110","179","12","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ideal_insomnia/recommended/291650/","ideal_insomnia","Ideal Insomnia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ideal_insomnia/","54 products in account","Having finished my first and more or less thorough walkthrough I think I'm ready to write a little something about this game. Short version: this game is beautiful and I enjoyed playing it immensely. And now for details.\nI didn't back this game on Kickstarter. I must say I had my doubts, even when the beta was out I wasn't sure I liked what I saw.  Gladly, I was wrong, but nonetheless let me start with negative criticism:\n- Bugs. Yes, there are bugs. Back when the game was released there were quite a lot of them, some of them rather nasty. However, bugs are only a temporary issue as long as developers work hard at fixing them and right now Obsidian is doing fine. You can see a lot of communication between gamers and developers going on at the forums, most issues are already reported and will be addressed at some time. Which is why I don't think that bugs are that much of a problem.\n- Bad/weird design decisions. Those are much worse than bugs because those are a part of the game. The interface, for one, is far from being perfect. Pathfinding is terrible, especially in battle. Battles themselves are separated from the peaceful exploration which means that pre-buffing or pre-summoning or other things like that are not possible. So there are things like that, but not that many of them. Not enough to spoil the pleasure of playing but for some players probably enough to wince once in a while.\n- Backer content. I have deepest respect for Kickstarter backers, but all that backer content is better off somewhere... well, not in the game itself. The tombstones can be ignored, but I would trade all those 'special' NPCs for just one real NPC of Obsidian's design, or, better still, for a little quest.\n- Role-playing system. The game utilizes an original role-playing system that was designed to kind of remind you of D&D while not being D&D, which benefited the game and harmed it at the same time. Some things work nicely: combat mechanics work, original classes like Chanters and Ciphers are awesome, ability and skill checks function properly. However, such classes as priests, wizards or druids seem (to me) like they were just copied from D&D without much thought. Also I have a real problem with attributes, skills and abilities. Why don't they influence each other? And why are the skills so odd? Outside of dialogue interaction, each skill has exactly one use. Then there are attributes. For example, in this game Might represents both physical and spiritual power, which means that virtually every class needs Might to be able to do damage. At the same time, Intellect only affects the duration of effects and such, so a Wizard might fare better with high Might and low Intelligence. Interesting, but doesn't make much sense if you compare it to how attributes are treated in dialogue options. In textual interactions Might is just plain physical Strength and Intelligence is, well, how smart you are. This means that attributes fail to describe your character. So do I make a mighty wizard to be effective in battle or do I make an intelligent wizard to actually roleplay in dialogues? Anyway, chances are you won't even pay attention to all this while you're playing. However, in the long run, in case there are sequels, not having a coherent and thought-through role-playing system might do some harm.\n- White text on dark background. Had to note that specifically. My eyesight is not perfect, I know, but this bright white  font against dark background is killing meeeee. And there's a lot of reading to be done in this game...\n\nBut enough with the negative. The good things! There are actually a lot of them so I'll only mention what comes to mind immediately.\n- The game is very rich in content. It isn't some linear sham that gets shorter and plainer the longer you play. The game is very consistent with lots of quests, NPCs, fractions and locations to explore.\n- Exploration is pure joy in this game. Actually, I believe that PoE has the best dungeon-crawl gameplay ever. Dungeons are so beautiful, so lovingly crafted, so interesting to explore that I wouldn't probably mind if the whole game was one big mega-dungeon. And I have never been a big fan of dungeon-delving before!\n- Options. There are a lot of options in the game. A lot of different ways to finish quests, but also a lot of plain game options. Fast mode, slow mode, bigger fonts, smaller fonts, color-blind mode, auto-pause, languages, subtitles - everything is adjustable and this is awesome.\n- Most importantly, this game has that elusive charm that BG2 or IWD had. The feeling that makes you explore map after map until it's morning and your eyes can't read the dialogues anymore. It is immersive, it is thrilling, it is intriguing. Obsidian put their hearts and souls into this game, they genuinely care about it and it really shows. Which is the main reason I have to call this game a major success. Everything that is wrong with this game can be corrected, it isn't such a big deal.\nThe only thing that you cannot patch is the absense of the soul. This game deals with the problem of human souls and of so called Hollowborn - children born soulless. Today, there are a lot of games that seem to be Hollowborn too, but not this one. I hope Obsidian makes many more games like this and next time I'll try my best to support them early on!\nP.S. Something I forgot to mention. Doing a complete playthrough took me 70+ hours, but for some time I had to play offline due to a very odd bug that several other people encountered too. So don't mind the 'hours on record' thing too much.","April 26, 2015","true","215.1"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","34","47","0","0"

It feels and appears to be a worthy disciple of the classic RPGs (Baldur's Gate, Nox, D&D, Icewind Dale, ...).\n\nHowever, there are some nasty "buts" which spoil the pleasure of playing.\n\nFor example the loadingsscreens appear to last for ever after some hours of gaming. Especially the first load of every session takes sometimes several minutes (It's not my system!) Also the leveling is kind of expendable, because except of the athletic skill for every character, and the mechanics and lore skill for one of your character you can't really increase useful skills. Why raise survival if you never really have to eat something?\nFurthermore a level cap of 12 is kind of low and you need forever to get there (isn't ascending levels step by step the essence of RPG?).\n\nAnother big nasty "BUT" for me is, that you can't see boots, belts and gloves on you character and that unenchanted helmets do not protect your character against weapons...Yeah there's no difference between wearing no helmet and a big, heavy steal helmet!\n\nAll in all, a great game, but the Pillars of eternity have some cracks and won't last for the promised eternity...\n\n\nUpdate: Big plus, great story and many, many side-quest!\n\nUpdate: Maaaaaaan, there are really a whole lot of side-quests...nearly too much! :-D Only thing bothering after some time: too much reading --> some of the main quest story lines should be narrated via videos or drawings...\nP.S.: The loading screens are shorter now, maybe the the patch 1.05 solved the problem!!\n\nAnd another update: The pathfinding of all characters is sometimes very crappy.\n\nAnd my last Update:Really?! okay, so I'm Level 12 (Last Level) and playing on hard. I killed every enemy without any problems and was kind of overpowering everyone. This was a bit lame...\nSo the end fight against Thaos came. I thought: "Okay this will be challenging..." But he and his living statues were totally invincible!! I tried for hours until I caved in and played the fight on easy... A very ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating end: at first easy and lame, then unfair and infuriating...Pity!\n\nAnd really my last Update:So I heard that many of the cons of this game have now been fixed!!

From war swept wastes. I've been fighting there for my entire life. I've seen strong men perish in a blink of an eye. Young men brutally murdered and their corpses desecrated.\nI've cheated death many times but the last time was too close. I could feel the Grim Reapers ice cold hands on me. No more!\n\nI hear stories that a town, Gilded Vale, is accepting settlers. All are welcome! A nice, quiet and a friendly town. Sounds too good to be true ? Sure. But it's something.\nSo i joined a caravan that's heading towards the Gilded Vale. I'm mostly accompanied by small families: Women and children. Refugees looking for a better life.\nI feel as if i was accepted just because they needed someone to guard the people.. For the road ahead is long and dangerous.\n\nWe've been on a road for a week now. I've been feeling strange for a couple of days. A sickness...unlike i've never experienced before. The Grim Reaper doesn't want me to leave. I can feel his presence. He's following me and something is about to happen.\nWe stop for the night and i decide to go look for some berries for a curing tea. I wonder into the woods. Not too far from the camp but far enough to lose visual of the people. I finally find some berries and i'm about to head back when i hear a scream...It's coming from the campsite!\nI rush back! Running as fast as i can in my condition. I slip a couple of times but manage to keep balance.\nI reach the campsite...Everyone has been murdered! Bandits?!\nI see a man standing in middle of corpses. He's about 10 meters away from me. He's pulling his sword out of his last victim: A single mother who was looking for a better life for herself and her son.\nI notice two more men sneaking out behind tents. Swords drawn. They think i don't see them.\n\nThe man in the middle says something about desecrating old ruins and tells me to drop my weapons. I can tell they've never fought a warrior. These bandits, cultists...whoever they are, they've never seen a real fight. A real challenge.\nI quickly draw my bow and put an arrow right between his two eyes.\nThe men from the sides are running towards me. I grab another arrow, shoot one of them in the knee. He screams and falls.\nThe third guy is now reaching me. About a meter away from me. I drop my bow, quickly draw my sword, take a step back and slash his right arm off right before i behead him.\nThe second guy is trying to stand up and reach for his sword. I calmly walk up to him. Kick his sword away and push him on his back.\nHe screams out of pain as i slowly push my sword through his chest.\nI take a deep breath and look up to the sky but just when i think it's all over...A Bîaŵac!!!\nNoone has escaped a Bîaŵac alive. NEVER! I see a small crack in a mountain about 20 meters from me. I run towards it!\nI'm about to reach the cap when i feel a kick and fly through the crack, fall flat on the ground and feel a trumble. I look back and see that the mountain crack has collapsed behind me.\nWHEW! I escaped!...But how ? Actually nevermind that right now. Important things first! I scout the cavern and it seems to be empty. I make a fireplace and tend to my wounds. I didn't notice in my adrenaline packed haze that i've dislocated my left foot. The last fall also hurt my right shoulder and elbow quite badly.\nI lay down on the hard rocky ground and fall asleep.\n\nIt's morning. I wake and struggle to stand up. Still ill. Now wounded and my entire body is aching from sleeping on this rocky ground.\nI spend the next hour looking for a way out. Finally i see sunlight. *Sigh* "Freedom"\nI walk out but i hear yelling. I quickly hide in the bushes at an edge of a cliff and look down. Seems like somekind of cult. A cloaked man is turning people into ash by using somekind of a machinery!\nI have no time to figure this out tho. I'm ill and badly wounded. I'm lucky to be alive. I can't risk to be seen so i decide to sneak around and look for a path that leads to the Gilded Vale.\n\n8 hours pass. I'm hungry. Starving even! I'm ill and sweating all over the place but i see the city gates. I keep groaning as i limp towards it.\nI finally reach the gates. "Ahhh finally a safe haven!...Wait, what the hell..." I see a gigantic tree full of hanged people. At least 20 corpses hang there. Men and women of all ages. Some corpses are mighty fresh. Feels like the most recent one was hanged no more than couple of hours ago.\nI hear loud laughing and footsteps of at least 4 men coming towards me...\n\nI am Metsakurat. A ranger.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stokes79/recommended/291650/","Stokes79","Stokes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stokes79/","401 products in account","This review is based on a 99% done playthrough on Hard difficulty.\n\nLet's start with the story and the eight NPC recruits first.  While it's hard to top 'You are immune to death, but your memories are gone. Have fun out there.' and 'Remember when you almost died to that wolf? Ok now go kill a god', Pillars of Eternity's main plot is very engaging and weaves itself well into the set pieces and characters you meet throughout your journey.  You are a random person in a caravan that approaches some weird cult and it's leader fiddling with an ancient machine. You're knocked out and wake up with the ability to peer into other people's souls.  Meanwhile sometime before the events of the game started Everyone's Favorite Benevolent God starts punishing heretics before finally being destroyed by a big F-off weapon and has not been seen since.  The main plot involves chasing down this cult leader while either dodging or supporting the influence of the many more gods present in the world. Many of the NPCs you can recruit have their own struggles with their own gods, and if you stick with them long enough, you can help them resolve their issues as well.  The game's reputation system, where you get 'points' towards the different attitudes you present while speaking with others (benevolent, cruel, rational, honest, etc.) is very well done and is sure to result in repeat playthroughs. Conversations can also depend on what class and backstory you picked during character creation. During one particular quest in Act 2, I found myself wishing I was a Priest of Skaen (evil jerks) just to see how it would have played out differently.\n\nThe recruitable NPCs are written very well, have good party banter, and help you understand the quite wordy backstory of the world, however many of their pre-selected combat talents are either very poor or don't make any sense at all.  This has been known to cause players to rush to them before gaining too many levels so that they can build them how they see fit.  Min-maxers are going to do what they do in this regard, but I believe this to be justified until they are tweaked a bit to more accurately reflect what the game expects from you while in combat.\n\nThe combat is what you can expect from the 'real-time with pause' games that it emulates such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale but with a few major changes.  The first major change deals with stealth.  When you go into stealth mode, your whole party goes into stealth mode. When one person is caught, everyone is caught.  This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and renders a rogue's major class talent, backstab, completely and utterly useless.  It's such a terrible, incomprehensible combat mechanic that I have to wonder if we, the players, are doing something wrong, and the developers intended it for some other use that we haven't thought of yet.\n\nAnother quite jarring combat mechanic is 'engagement.'  Once you engage with an enemy, you are basically rooted to that spot. Any attempt to even move an inch will open you up to a huge free hit to your character.  While there are both items and talents that help with your defense while breaking engagement, it is still not enough for me to consider it a fun, worthwile addition to combat.  The AI pathing isn't good enough, especially when fighting in hallways and doors. I find myself tolerating engagement rather than enjoying it as a challenge to overcome.\n\nWith all that said I am greatly enjoying my time with the game and can't wait to start another character.  It truly is a successor to the great Baldur's Gate games and it is one I will be playing for a long, long time.\n","April 14, 2015","true","244.9"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","29","39","0","2"

Weirdly gratifying combat, challenging gameplay*. Lots of classes, specs, and gear to choose from, huge number of viable playstyles.\n\nCon:\nMicromanagement can be hard if you aren't used to it, and combat overwhelming* (controlling six characters at once is hard until you master the "pause" function). Player may have to choose between more immersive roleplay (voice-acted, scripted NPC companions) and a better chance in combat (character-made, optional companions).\n\n*Higher difficulties are only for veterans of squad-combat games. Don't be a hero, start on Normal if you aren't sure.\n\n\nThe Long:\n\nExtremely well-executed fantasy squad-combat game. Game has something for everybody; if your like exploration, the map is sprawling. If you like character development, the game's core companions have some of the backgrounds and personalities I've found in gaming, and their dialog is greatly altered and nuanced by the player's background and actions. If you're into the RP part of RPGs, your experience will be greatly improved by the running NPC commentary on your exploits, and the game's wrting is so good it could've been moderately successful as a text-based game or novella.\n\nThe gameplay itself is intuitive and satisfying, though there are some mechanics players might not be used to. Experience can't be grinded, for example, because the game gives exp rewards by the quest/encounter, not by the body count. In other words, if confronted by highwaymen, the player can get experience from killing them all, yes, but also from talking them down. Hunting down random bandits in the woods, however, nets no experience unless they were part of a quest or encounter. This system is great for players who might be interested in more diplomatic or pacifistic characters.\n\nIf you've played Wasteland II (which was developed with the help of Obsidian, who made Pillars of Eternity), you're somewhat familiar with the gameplay of Pillars of Eternity (they both use the Unity Engine). There are a lot of gameplay differences, since one's setting is post-apocalyptic and the other's is Tolkienic fantasy, but the feel is roughly the same, although Pillars seems much more fleshed-out in terms of story, writing, and artwork. Don't expect Wasteland II when you buy this game, though. There are key differences in party and combat mechanics that might change the game for you.\n\nMainly, Wasteland focused on four main, player-designed characters and a few NPC companions you could invite to tag along. Personally, I really just used my main 4 characters, so mine was a manageable party. Pillars of Eternity begins with one player character and up to five companions that the player will rapidly accumulate, to the point where several of these masterfully-written, convincing, and engaging companions will have to sit out because there's no more room for them in the party. It's hard to choose which NPCs you want, and you can choose to have none, if you're suicidal.\n\n(The player can also buy (with the game's currency, relax) custom-made companions, created in the same way the main character was, with all the same options. These companions have no conversation options or anything, so they're not for the roleplayer.)\n\nSo, Wasteland could support 7 characters and Pillars supports 6, but Pillars of Eternity's combat is much, much more difficult than Wasteland's, and that's due in no small part to the learning curve of playing 6 characters at once. Wasteland didn't have this problem because of the one massive difference between these two games: Pillars of Eternity is not turn-based.\n\nBecause Pillars isn't turn-based, there's a "pause" feature that lets the player stop combat and issue commands (common feature in squad-combat games, notably Dragon Age). The level of micromanagement demanded from the higher difficulties is not to be underestimated. You will have to make sure your party members are actually attacking, instead of staring into space. You will have to manually click each of your part members, then click the skills or spells you want them to use, every time you want them to use them (you can queue actions with SHIFT, as in Starcraft, which helps a little). You'll worry often whether your healer will have time to cast his big heal before he gets knocked flat by a huge wolf, and there's no real way to know the timing without just unpausing and letting it happen.\n\nAlso, equipping your characters, individually, with up-to-date gear, enchanted and selected to suit their role, will take up time. Be prepared for micromanagement.\n\nMicromanagement in all things. Especially combat.\n\nYou will have to find ways to block enemies from reaching your squishier party members, and you will have to find these formations on the fly, in every conceivable type of terrain, against enemies that can surprise you by, say, teleporting behind your healer, who you left too far away to be saved by your tank.\n\nYou will have to use weapons appropriate for the enemy's resistances, alternating between slashing, crushing, and piercing (and the elemental damage types, of course). This means keeping different weapon sets equipped (in combat, you can only change weapons if you equipped alternate weapons in the dedicated slots for them beforehand), and being prepared to command your characters to switch weapons on the fly. Thus, you might have to pick out multiple weapons for each character, and keep each set updated.\n\nArmor is a gradient between Damage Reduction and action speed. Heavy armor makes everything slower, from melee attacks to spellcasting to potion-drinking.\n\nYou'll have to fight groups of small enemies several times more numerous than your party, and you will have to figure out what to do with your single-target attackers in these cases. You'll have to decide whether it's worth going for the enemy's healer, and you'll have to load when you choose wrongly. You'll have to change your party's armor sets regularly depending on the encounter.\n\nDon't let this dissuade you. The game is hard, but that only makes it so much more satisfying when you flawlessly dismantle a squad of high-level enemies despite having weaker and fewer characters. It's also incredibly gratifying to mow down mobs with hopelessly lower stats than yours, fair fight or no.\n\nIt's always worth it when you get the loot.\n\n\n","May 12, 2015","true","97.4"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","34","48","2","0"

Objects would intersect with one another so many times, that I barely knew what was going on.\n3. My guys would wiggle left and right behind one another in a futile attempt to find a way towards the enemy. And even when there is actually space for them to occupy, they would not. Unless I click. Seriously?!\n4. My guys will absolutely leave the positions i have carefully put them in to expose my weak rear line. There goes Aloth... Again!\n5.

Breaking my space key cause, honestly, that is where your left or right hand should be all the time, based on your orientation.\n\nTo continue, although I was a teenager during the dawn of the crpgs, I never ever played one - I was way too busy with games like Might and Magic 6-9, Heroes of MIght and Magic 1-4, Starcraft, Caesar 3-4, Pharaoh & Cleopatra, Zeus - Master of Olympus & Poseidon, etc. I never got into that genre.

The companion interactions that made me sit, listen, smile and laugh.\n4. The little side stories which were making me connect even to the npcs that I had nothing to do with.\n5. The gorgeous handdrawn maps.\n6. The approach to combat. I have never ever prepared so painstakingly for my battles. Feels really good.\n7. The exploration, looking under every nook and cranny. Spending half a minute carefully moving your mouse over the screen in search for hidden stuff has never been more satisfying.\n\nAND FINALLY, that damn crpg's tons-of-math-and-formulae combat system. At one point I found myself looking into every equation and every calculation and trying to improve my odds.\n\nHoly hell, what has become of me... From a guy flagging PoE as "Not Interested" to a person who delves into its mechanics, busying himself making plans for future playthroughs and builds and whatnot.\n\nTo conclude - buy this game, even if you hate the stuff I hated before it appeared. It has this weird way of drawing you in as the game progresses. I played a good part of it with clenched teeth, sometimes even shouted at my monitor - while waiting for the next time my guys will ♥♥♥♥ me off in combat by doing the very exact thing I dont expect of them. And I still went on and enjoyed everything it threw at me, and boy was it worth it.

First of all there is WAY too much dialogue and lore to sift through. Instead of adding to the immersion it really becomes a chore. I can't imagine doing another play through primarily for this reason.\n\nWith the exception of the Roderic's Hold quest the game is relatively linear and there are few choices you can make that materially effect the world. The castle upgrades seem tacked on and pointless. The skill system is very basic and doesn't allow for much specialization. Characters will often end up with similar stats and the only ones that seem to really matter are lore, lockpick and traps.\n\nThey've updated some basic party AI for this game but it is woefully insufficient. Programmable AI was a feature in IE games 15 years ago. So there really is no excuse for the lack of its inclusion originally.\n\nAs it is the system they have doesn't work effectively on the higher dificulty levels. Be prepared to click hundreds of times in a tough battle rather than have your party follow a simple script. There is SO much combat in this game it really does become a grind and I don't understand why people defend the massive amount of micromangement it requires.\n\nThe load times in POE simply take way too long. I have an average system but I've heard that even players with good rigs still suffer from bad load times. This shouldn't be an issue for a 2D game running an old engine.\n\nThe plot is meh and the characters aren't particularly memorable. This game is a dungeon crawler first and foremost and more like Icewind Dale than BG1 or 2.\n\nThe party AI and dialogue just kill it for me but if you're a fan of this genre it might be worth a play through if it's on sale.\n\nRPG masterpiece it certainly is not.","October 2, 2015","false","87.8"," 139 of 235 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","139","235","7","9"

Probably my favorite game of the CRPG kickstarter revival so far.\n\nA good story, although sometimes too wrapped up in its own lore for its own good. There are times when the NPCs will be using words that aren't defined, and you sort of have to use context clues to figure it out. There's also a lot of talk of different gods, regions, etc, and with no prior knowledge of the setting it can be a bit overwhelming. Still, the story was good and the world created was interesting.\n\nMechanically, the game is basically a modernization of the old infinity engine games. The interface looks the same, the combat works the same, and it's all pretty great. My only complaint might be that the underlying game system is basically just a rip of D&D (which is to be expected), but to the point where you might wonder why they bothered to differenciate in terms between the systems. Might vs strength, deflection vs armor, etc.\n\nI encounted a couple of bugs, but nothing too serious. I had to use a third party program to fix a characters run speed at some point, but i'm sure that will be fixed in a patch.\n\nThe kickstarter stuff is, thankfully, easily avoided.

This just feels like a lazy attempt to pretend POE is somehow a new experience wrapped in a nostalgic bubble. By either description, it falls way short.\n\n3 - Wow the items are dull. Looting your local grocery store would result in more interesting items than you'll generally find at the end of a dungeon in this game. You'll grind your way through generic mob after generic mob, just to find a chest full of crap. So then, you're left with crafting, which while available, feels half hearted and ill thought out. They added crafting as a tick box exercise, rather than make the effort to make it rewarding.\n\n4 - Combat. Okay.....open You Tube and find the Benny Hill theme. Then start a combat. Play the theme as your enemies target your spell caster. Watch the spell caster flee around the screen, followed by the enemy, followed by your tank hopelessly trying to reacquire the enemy.\n\n5- Combat. It's so bad it deserves more mentions. Combat will go like this. Fire off the spell you always fire off. Switch to your standard attack. Go downstairs. Make some dinner. Ring a friend. Come back to find the party still trading boring blows with boring enemies. This is if you're lucky.\n\n6 - Combat - If you're unlucky, you'll fire off a spell and set your tank(s) fighting, only to find that your ranged attackers have bizarrely ceased to attack and are now stood around doing nothing. That or they've been killed by the super teleporting shadow monsters that appear on top of them. In this case, you have the choice to either try and run, dying immediately due to the absurd game mechanics, or stand and die anyway. Your spells are mostly useless, so you'll be presented with a big list of crap to choose from each time you level, rather than spells that feel useful. In 30 hours, I have never found an item with any kind of wow factor. Nothing that I equipped gave me any sense that the effort of slogging my way through the generic, uninspiring dungeon was actually worth it.\n\n7 - The NPCs. Talking to strangers at the bus stop is more rewarding than engaging these generic, dull characters in conversation. They have as much life when they've been killed as they do alive. They have no reason to follow you and nothing much to say when they do. Baldur's Gate etc are old games now, but they managed to produce real characters. Fifteen years later and POE has undone this. I didn't care if they lived. I didn't care if they died. In an RPG of this price in 2015, that's just not good enough. I didn't expect Mass Effect character development, but I certainly hoped for more than walking cliches, that largely dissolved into taciturn automatons after their initial, uninvolving dialogue.\n\n8 - The Lore/World - Lots of lore can be a good thing. It's been done well in other games. It's not done well here. It's like a commitee pulled together a load of standard fantasy fiction and slung it together to create a world notable only by it's staggering blandness. Blah, blah, elves, dwarves, blah, blah, ancient ruins, blah, blah dungeons. It's all so lazy and predictable.\n\n9 - Having to rest to somehow regain your ability to use magic is a mechanic that was crap fifteen years ago. It belongs in table top roleplaying gaming, and that is the type of player attracted to POE. They want to play D&D again, but no one does anymore, so they wax lyrical about POE instead. That kind of limiting, tedious mechanic doesn't appear in computer RPGs anymore for a reason. Unless you're an old school roleplaying gamer, with the accompanying problems with OCD, this kind of mechanic has no place in computer RPGs.\n\n10 - Price - If you loved BG and BG2, then maybe you'll like this. I didn't, but you might. Wait for a sale though. To price this in a similar band to Witcher 3 or DAI is ridiculous. What you're getting is a  facsimile of games that are 15 years old. There's nothing new here and certainly not one iota of innovation. I would argue that POE is in fact a huge step back from the old games it seeks to emulate. Don't pay full price for this. It's not worth it when you can pay a fraction of the price and pick up the original and vastly superior genre games from the early 2000s, like Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights.\n\nConclusion- For the price, this just isn't good enough. POE is bogged down by a bland world, uninvolving characters and a dull, bugged combat system. I spent hour after hour hoping it would get better. That somehow the world would come to life. It never did. For 5.99 this game would be okay. For 34.99, it's a been one huge and, frankly unacceptable disappointment. It piggy backs on the reputation of much older and far superior games, without ever matching their achievements. Baldur's Gate will be remembered in another fifteen years. Barring bargain basement sales, POE will have been forgotten in fifteen months.","August 30, 2015","false","30.3"," 149 of 254 people (59%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","59","149","254","27","10"

But there are few that take so long to load. And it get's far worse the longer you play. And for a game with such a nostalgic look the perfomance is horrible(low framrate and freezing). This game just is badly optimised in many ways.\n\n\n- The game just gives the illusion of choices. Nothing what you do and say matters.\nE.g. Godlikes are decribed as beeing hated on - you will never see any reaction on beeing a godlike.\n\nOr you can be a mass murder and people still react friendly to you. There are almost no quests where any of your choices change something. There are a few where a person dies or not accourding to your actions - but thats the most you get. Normally you can kill everyone involved or try to solve everyting peaceful - the outcome is the same. Your party members wont leave no matter what ♥♥♥♥ you do, even if you sacrifice one person from your party.\n\n- The game is full of Kickstarter "comercials"\n1/4 of all Characters you see in the game are from kickstarter funders - that do nothing, say nothing and often have totally unfitting names. They are just there so you can read the little stories the funders wrote.\nEven worse are the Kickstarter-tombstones. In every dungeon you see tombstones that are filled with funder texts - often nonsense ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The loading screen advise is even to not read them because they break the 4th wall.\n\n- Content was cut and put into the Expansion - it feels like an unfinished game without.\nWithout the addon you don't even have a character for every class. Yet those Expansion characters where put on the cover of PoE. The items in the base game are very bland - all interesting weapons, especially the souldbound ones are expansion only. It feels like this content has been cut out and put in the expansion to sell these. Which wouln't even be that much  of a problem if we wouldn't be talking about more than 40€ for the base version amd 24€ for the DLC.\n\n- The game feels low-budgeted or rushed at many parts.\n* I have seen few crpgs with so few spoken text lines. There are many NPCs which don't even have one sentence which features voice acting. Yet for many NPCs it's exactly one spoken line and nothing more.  Oh other languages don't even get that 1 sentence spoken - voices stay english.\n* You are the only character contributing to the story. You followers don't matter. In conversations only your skills matter - even if one of your followers boosts a much higher skill than you. You are the only person involved in talking - the best you get is some meaningless comments from followers but these are quite rare.\n* Most uniques are not unique, they are just crafted with the same stats that you can craft by yourself. There are like 5 helmets with stats, and normal headwear doesn't gives any stats(why is so much of it even there?). Even full helmets don't give armor(=deflection).\n* You will come accros bugs that make you feel you play a beta game. Items that don't work and show code-blocks, quests that you can't finish because you took a path that the devs didn't saw, save games going corrupt, very odd balance choices.\n\n- The game is at an awkward spot regarding story vs. gameplay\nThe story followers are built to bad that you feel punished for playing with them. Custom Characters are FAR stronger.\nCustom Characters don't talk.\nEven if they don't talk that much the story followers add much to the gameplay. Without them PoE feels more like reading trough a "choose your own adventure" book. Especially on the higher difficulties you are forced to play with custom Characters which reduces the amount of fluff and story you experience.\n\nSo what do you want: A party with talking characters or a good party?\n\n- There are LOTS of informations missing.\nIt begins with the lacking informations on weapon speed and other stats. You need to look up how everything works like you want to write a min maxing guide on some MMORPG to understand basic combat math - and you better look that up.\n\n- Minor nitpickings\n* You can't pickpocket.\n* Looting/stealing stuff reduces your reputations - unless you kill all bystanders. But the slaughter doens't affects your reputation most of the time. You can even play a "rightous" Paladin and don't suffer for killing & looting unimportant NPCs.\n* Combat is best solved in the cheesiest way possible 90% of the time - putting a tank in a chokepoint and the damage dealers behind him.\n* Often you can't loot the items that charaters obviously got.\n* Balance patches can make your party obsolete. I can understand that you can't play a character in the beta and expect that he will be as good as when you started. But PoE got a few heavy balance patches that made good characters nigh unplayable. One of these is coming soon, heavily nerfing one class (cipher).\n* The guide from the Royal Edition is wrong in many points because of changes after the release.\n\n\nIn the end this game is not horrible. But there are so many odd design choices, lacking parts and bugs that this game is not that enjoyable. I would only advice to buy on 75% sale or in a bundle with the 2 DLCs.","January 23","false","66.5"," 36 of 53 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","36","53","4","0"

He also knew that I loved the Baldur's Gate games and Pillars of Eternity was being hailed as a spiritual successor. I bought in the hype myself, and was very excited to play it.\n\nI'll overlook the glaring bugs that I encountered initially (having to do with Unity's network management [including Hamachi and wired ethernet adapters], which isn't even used for the game) because those don't have anything to do with the story, writing, shoddy combat system, or massive class imbalances.\n\nI started with a rogue, which I quickly learned was a mistake. Any character can use rogue skills like stealth and lockpicking, and the backstab bonuses are negligible. The game's monsters ranged from easy one-shot skills to groups of Shadows that will ignore your warrior and pick off your party by swarming the weakest character first.\n\nI don't have any problem with this type of mob, but when they occur within the first hour or so of the game without any learning curve, it's a bit imbalanced. I really wonder if people who aren't used to CPRGs even enjoy it.\n\nThe writing is cumbersome and extremely difficult to suffer through. There's just too much of it. Which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't mediocre to start with. That's nothing new in games, but the writing borders on shakespearean levels of twisted, confusing wording without any of the art or cleverness. I find myself either re-reading passages to figure out exactly why they're over-describing some scene or I just read a few words and skim through.\n\nThis game is not unplayably difficult but the combat is extremely imbalanced and random. It just saps out the fun.\n\nThis is just not a good game. And it's frustrating that since this is a Kickstarter-backed game, there is nothing but insane hype and blind support. People who gave money to the development of this game will support it unconditionally. Even when I seek help for some difficult parts, forums are filled with "maybe you shouldn't suck so much" instead of acknowledgements that *MAYBE* Oblivion's custom combat mechanics are s***.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying this game, read the negative reviews first.

I backed this game for $160, that was not a poor decision, because so far PoE is really fun.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the old D&D WRPGs, personally I think they're convoluted messes and I only really played through Planescape because the writing, atmosphere, and roleplaying made up for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat, and they really, really did, Planescape is one of my favorite games. I backed PoE because Obsidian are pretty much head and shoulders above almost every other dev team when it comes to writing, atmosphere, and actual roleplaying and I always want to see more games from them. (I’m also happy to have saved Obsidian from bankruptcy too) PoE being a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate, still feels a tad bit grognardy to me compared to something like Shadownrun’s more streamlined and accessible combat but I'm getting the hang of it and having fun with it and the game does a good game explaning itself for the most part such as telling you exactly what stats you should be dumping into for each class you roll. It still does has a few dumb grognardy mechanics that it doesn't explain very well though, they're not dealbreakers but they can be annoying at times, such as seprate equipment not being able to buff  the same stats and no way to aggro enemies. Playing on Easy helps, but I still can’t play too stupidly so it’s not braindead easy. If you want a challenge though this game is very happy to oblige. The three reasons I backed this game for are all definitely here. The game can get pretty expostiony with its world building but its interesting worldbuilding so it’s cool. As said still too early to make a true final verdict but if this game keeps it up it will be a really good game and a must play for all the old D&D RPG and normal RPG fans alike.","March 27, 2015","true","69.4"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","29","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pinwang/recommended/291650/","pinwang","Pin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pinwang/","238 products in account","Pillars of Eternity is a well-written and strongly executed spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate II. No RPG in the last decade can hold a candle to its immersive role-playing experience or engrossing, highly believable world. This modernized take on the classic CRPG is a must-buy for any fan of the genre.\n\nBut how does it measure up to it's predecessor?\n\nBelow I will list a few points from the perspective of a veteran gamer who values immersion in his RPGs above all else, and will attempt to measure it against one of the greatest RPGs of all time.\n\nYou must gather your party before venturing forth…Pillars is much easier to play than the Baldur's Gate trilogy, doing away with several annoyances Infinity Engine veterans won’t miss:\n\n++ Flawless path-finding\n++ Sexy as ♥♥♥♥\n++ Excellent UI design\n++ Level design plus “fast mode” saves a ton of time\n++ Tutorial, though heavy, is very informative\n+ Tooltips!\n+ New stash system for painless inventory management\n+ Flags for stat-qualifying conversation options\n+ Quest notifiers\n+ …and much more!\n\n++ Options to turn off most of the above if you feel it interferes with your role-playing\n++ Does all of this while retaining the feel of classic CRPGs (major nostalgia bonus)\n\nCharacter BuildingAt the systems level, Pillars biggest departure from classic CRPGs lies in its new attribute and skills system. To me this has been a mixed bag:\n\n+++ Every attribute and skill has a place in conversations and scripted sequences\n++ A ton of options for each class, much more customization than classic CRPGs\n++ Updated reputation system is excellent and works as intended\n++ Very challenging early game– hallmark of the classic RPG\n++ Every attribute influences combat, no dead-weight attributes\n+ Skill system allows more freedom for customization\n+ Mastering new attributes is a fresh challenge for RPG vets\n+ Can build custom NPC adventurers whenever you want\n\n- - - Classes are not nearly as unique as in classic CRPGs\n- - No multi-class / dual-class, classes all have same XP chart for leveling\n- - Leveling up doesn’t have the occasional power spike that was so satisfying in BG\n- - No alignments! This affects companions most, more on that below\n\nSo to sum up there is a big tradeoff here: much deeper customization at the cost of much weaker character identity / personality on each character sheet. Is this modernization worth it? Depends on the player.\n\nModernized CombatIn general, combat in Pillars is much more enjoyable, though Baldur’s Gate still does some things better:\n\n+++ More combat, challenging combat –closer to Icewind Dale than Baldur’s Gate\n+++ Limited resting plus “per rest” and “per encounter”  system rounds out encounters!\n++ Melee engagement completes the positional party-based combat feature-set\n++ New damage-type and defense-type systems are excellently executed\n+ New friend/foe AoE mechanics add a bit more depth\n+ Modernized combat UI with AoE overlays decrease yolo-ness of spell-casting\n+ Item enchanting adds customization to combat style\n\n+/- In general, more abilities and options, less impact of each individual ability\n\n- - - Spells and abilities feel nerfed compared to classic CRPGs\n- - Not as many crazy encounters as in BG.\n- - Challenge is more in mastering the system than in new encounters.\n- AoEs everywhere, not enough single-target spells\n\nCharacters, Story & WritingFirst off: good effort by the new narrator, but not even close to the narrator of Baldur’s Gate!\n\nObsidian’s writing may be its greatest strength as a studio, and I would say that several of their sequel projects exceeded the writing quality of the original (Fallout: New Vegas, KOTOR2, Mask of the Betrayer).\n\nIn my opinion:\n+++ Better high-level concept, deals with religion, philosophy and identity better\n++ Original world, characters, etc. are extremely fleshed out\n+ Main player arc is basically same story as BG, but written better\n\n- - - BG still tells the small stories better, with more detail and broader range of outcome\n- - Writing feels rushed sometimes\n\nThe companions, though, are where Pillars loses clearly to Baldur’s Gate:\n\n- - - - - - - - - - Nothing close to a Minsc :(\n- - - Less personality range of companions. Companions are not differentiated strongly\n- - - Weaker classes and no alignments means companion identity and opinions are not as convincing\n- - Companions rarely interact directly with other NPCs and events. When they do, feels forced.\n- Less companions\n\nAside from my extreme Minsc bias (shared by many), Pillars has significant weaknesses in its systems-level representation of characters, and therefore clearly falls short of Baldur’s Gate in storytelling.\n\nContent Design & Parameter DesignThe obvious complaint here is that Baldurs Gate is bigger, takes the player to more places, and exposes the player to a wider variety of characters and factions. No comparison can be made until Obsidian is done with the Pillars franchise– which hopefully will not be anytime soon.\n\nHowever, in many cases, Pillars is too balanced and too accessible, leading to some significant drawbacks:\n\n- - - In BG, you can walk into a random house and start a huge quest, not the case here\n- - - Very few chances to permanently gain (or lose) stats\n- - - Related to above: less consequences for decisions and therefore less interesting choices\n- - - Conversation and NPC interaction in general is not as varied as in Baldur’s Gate\n- - Only one stronghold type, less replayability with different classes / characters\n- - In general, items feel less unique– especially when compared to Baldur’s Gate\n- Curve of item acquisition is more linear, so no dramatic item-based power spikes\n- Effect suppression system is healthy for game systems but disappointing for player\n\nPillars is not Torment, and was not designed to be, but its choices above make it modern at the expense of the “anything can happen” feel of Baldur’s Gate. As a role-playing game, the balance feels more like a smooth and guided experience– cleverly giving you the trappings of choice and freedom, while remaining very accessible.\n\nThe result is a game with strengths that most players will experience, but lacking in the varied details and unbalance that made Baldur’s Gate so special. I would submit that those small details: silly side-quests, ridiculously unfair interactions, huge amounts of content almost completely hidden, etc. They are the quintessence of the open-world RPG experience.\n\nAnd still…There have been many advances to systems design since BG2, and Pillars exploits them to its full advantage. However, in many cases it does so at the expense of immersion. In the end, Obsidian has made conscious choices to make an experience that carries the torch of classic CRPGs in a new, accessible package. As they have said, Pillars does not replace the Infinity Engine games.\n\nPillars of Eternity is a great RPG, and the best RPG of the last decade. With updates, expansions and sequels it may become the greatest of all time.\n\nBut for now, and in my humble opinion, Baldur’s Gate retains its seat as the king of CRPGs.","April 5, 2015","true","80.2"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","26","36","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kamenecki/recommended/291650/","kamenecki","Kamen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kamenecki/","451 products in account","First of all I have to say I'm a huge fan of computer role playing games, some of my favorite ones being Planescape Torment, Baldur's Gate series, Icewind dale series, Arcanum and Fallout 1 and 2 which I've re-played a number of time over the years. I'm also a pen and paper player of D&D. I have been waiting for years and years for a true successor to Baldur's Gate to come, and sadly, I've fell to the hype and foolishly believed this is finally it.\n\nIn few short points I will try to describe why I'm disappointed with this game.\n\n- It was widely advertised as a spiritual successor to Baldur's gate series so I was naturally expecting an epic storyline similar to a "child of Lord of Murder" and addictive combat mechanics similar to AD&D ruleset. Both are missing from this game.\n\nObsidian tried to invent their own ruleset which just doesn't work as well and in the end makes every class too similar to each other. I rolled a rogue and was surprised to see my only rogue skill was mechanics, which every other character in the game could also level up, so why have the rogue class at all? There's no hide is shadows skill, only hide in shadows combat ability which can be used only 2 times per rest (which are very limited in this game), so in the end I outfitted him in plate and went full melee ignoring my rogue skills completely. Even though there's perception attribute, you have to use stealth mode to actually find hidden caches and since there's a lot of hidden items in the areas you visit, you'll be stealthy (and thus slow) almost all the time. No wonder this game brags with 100 hours of gameplay.\n\nEvery class or race can use every item in the game, the only penalty being the reaction time (speed) of the character influencing casting or weapon attack time. Everyone can also use scrolls, all potions, etc.\n\nSpellcasting is also very bad and limited in this game, as almost every spell is combat only, meaning there are no pre-battle buffs, and taking into account that many useful spells are area of effect, and that there is friendly fire - nothing bad with that per se, but since your spellcaster has to get real close to cast them, it's virtually impossible to use them effectively.  There's no traditional spellbook but a grimoire which can hold infinite amount of spells but only 4 per level can be selected for use at a time, and then again you have a limited per rest usage of them. And since they are combat only, expect generic boring spells, different by damage type only (fire, ice, poison, etc.). Transcribing the spell from another caster's grimoire costs money, depending of the level of the spell. Why? I guess the grimoire you carry has a slot that says "insert coin here" or something. There are no actual materials used in the process, so... A lot of these immersion breaking and irritating little things in the game.\n\nThere's also a infinite shared item stash which is carried by you all the time, there's no encumbrance, so strength makes no impact on how much you can wear or carry, you get the picture.\n\n- The story.\nIt started interesting but very quickly went to "visit this guy, oh he's dead, visit that guy, oh's he's dead also - let's visit another guy and hope he gives us some answers". I'm 25 hours in the game and don't know crap about what's going on except I'm some kind of Watcher that can see the person's soul. There's a skill you get early on which let's you reach into someone's soul and read about that person's past life. There's a ton of those people around and it's not interactive in any way or integrated into a story, just walls and walls of texts. I started fearing visiting new locations because of it, just how much pointless stories I will have to read in this tavern? In the end I beat my OCD and just skipped those.\n\nThe game just bombards you with lore, names and history from the get go, even on the character creation screen. It's very hard to process all that information, the names are not memorable, and I'm not even familiar yet with the layout of the world, so dumping all that information all of the sudden can be overwhelming. Races, provinces, wars, deities, cities, islands... OK, OK... let me care about something at least a bit before you hit me with info over the head. I had like 50 books on me in the first 5 hours of the game.\n\n- Crafting and loot\nThere's crafting in the game and it's available to every character, you do it from your inventory screen. Some items can be enhanced, some can not. You can put some properties on your gear and increase it's damage potential or defense. It' very generic and uninspired and I guess it's there only to serve as a money sink. In 25 hours playing or normal (which people say it's hard compared to similar games), I haven't used one consumable or a scroll. I don't see a situation where I'm spending thousands of coins to make a single scroll.\n\nLoot is also very generic, there are some named items in the game, but nothing special, nothing that lets you feel really powerful. In the end you can make your own stuff by crafting, I had everyone dual wield flaming weapons, which I made myself. If there's no good and interesting loot, there's NO REASON to explore. take into consideration there's also no XP from killing stuff, and you lose interest in exploration completely.\n\nSkyrim and Dragon Age Origins made the same mistake. RPG's are all about risk and reward. You risk your party to overcome an obstacle to get riches, items, artifacts, experience and with it new skills that again make you feel more powerful. The game should ideally throw increasingly difficult obstacles onto you, and in return giving you nicer things, it's a very simple process, really. Makes you feel satisfied. Do I feel satisfied with PoE when after a fight I find just same old vendor trash I found 20 hours before? No, I don't.\n\nI did not feel compelled to explore in PoE, at all. You literally explore the whole map, and find nothing except for a few crafting herbs.\n\n- Quests\nNothing special or original, at all. Fetch quests. A guy in the woods I've never seen before asks me to overthrow a local noble. I accept and go to the keep of that lord, only to be attacked on sight. Why? Is that standard practice to attack everyone who comes to the door? I guess the interactivity lies in the 3 different entrances into the keep (main gate, sewer, over the wall). OK, so I kill them all, the crazy lord included and the first guy reappears and just takes the throne and keep over. That's it. No more conversation with the guy. NPC 1 changed by NPC 2. I actually still enjoyed that part of the game, the art of the keep was very nice but was surprised how shallow the writing was. Is that really the best what you could do with that story?\n\nPerhaps it get's better later on, but in 25h I've yet to see a memorable NPC or an enemy who has something interesting to say. Think of first level of BG2, I'm sure you remember the genie you encounter. That genie has a lot more personality than any NPC I've seen in this game so far.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nThe Pillars of Eternity is not a terrible game, it's OK, I guess. In fact, I liked it considerably more that the Wasteland 2. What PoE is missing is addictive gameplay, and better writing. I wish they bought the D&D license and went with Forgotten Realms setting and ruleset. This way it feels more like Drakensang: The Dark Eye than Baldur's Gate. A missed opportunity.\nWhen my honeymoon period with the game ended, about at 15h, I had to force myself to start the game again, and that's not a good sign. You know that feeling when you can't put your finger on a specific thing that's wrong but you feel it just isn't it. I'm not sure I will finish it at all, in fact it reminded me how Arcanum was great and I got a craving for that game, over this one.\n\nDon't believe the hype, it's not the best thing ever and can't measure up to 15+ yo games. Buy it, but only when heavily discounted.","April 1, 2015","false","23.4"," 507 of 899 people (56%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","56","507","899","51","42"

Whilst it did much to modernise the genre, in many areas it failed to live up to the nostalgia.\n\nGraphics - The game kept true to the art style whilst bringing it forwards into the modern era of gaming, the backdrops were breathtakingly beautiful and it played smoothly without any issues.\n\nSound/Voice Acting - The sound/voice acting wasn't particularly noteworthy, it wasn't terrible yet it wasnt great either, it didn't really stand out much.\n\nStory-telling/narrative - The story was a bit vague and didn't really have much direction during the first act but it quickly picked up during the second act before slowly tapering off towards the end. There weren't any really exciting revelations or twists that made it wow me. The villain, their motivations and relationship to the protagonist were somewhat interesting but it wasn't anything that stood out. Often at times to convey just how filled out the world and backstory was you're presented with a wall of text which probably wasn't necessary and felt like it detracted from the story at times.\n\nGameplay Mechanics/Combat - This is probably the most disappointing aspect of the game. The game feels like it's more of a stealth crpg because they limited the experience gained from combat to just the first few initial run ins with each foe type and kept the overall experience gained from combat to a very minimal amount, along with the plethora of items that dropped from enemies being utterly useless, it often felt like the better choice was to sneak/avoid enemy encounters which just slows down the pace of the game. Avoiding combat entirely was also made more desirable by the fact that you were heavily penalised for trying to escape combat or run around or disengage with an enemy during combat which often resulted in the character dying quicker than had you just stayed in place and tried to (but likely fail to do so anyway) tank it.\n\nSpell casting also felt more burdensome and tiring than in the older IE titles because of the resting mechanics of the game whereby you had to carry supplies to rest and were limited to only carry a certain amount of supplies with you, so if you ran out of supplies you were forced to return to a store to purchase more or not rest and not be able to heal, or restore spells for combat.\n\nItemisation - The difference between a normal, un-enchanted item and a unique item felt lacking. The difference in damage was minimal, I played as a barbarian and would do 80s with normal items and as high as 96 using a unique item of the same type. Another problem with the itemisation is that so many items gave boosts to player stats, but conflicting stat boosts (ie. gloves that give +1 might and boots that give +2 might) would be nullified meant that gearing most slots felt like a waste of time and forced players down the route of jack of all trades, master of none.\n\nOverall I would rate this game as a 6/10, or in terms of similarities to the old IE games it has the combat of Planescape Torment with the story of Icewind Dale, it tries to relive the nostalgia but focuses on the wrong aspects of what made them great games.","May 30, 2015","true","28.8"," 38 of 58 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","38","58","0","0"

The story telling and writing is spectacular; I'm actually reading all the dialogue, While this doesn't call itself D&D (licensing issues with 3.5, apparently), it's got the feel perfectly down; fighters fight, paladins lay hands, and wizards cast a magic missle-esque spell.\n\nGood god, if you're not playing this game, something is seriously wrong with you.","March 28, 2015","true","31.7"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","30","44","4","1"

If not, you might have some poorly informed opinion-hate for me by the end, anyway. For safety's sake, if you still defend -- say, the D&D alignment system, assume you will hate this review, and me. Oh well.\n\nBUCKLE UP AND BRANDISH YOUR D20'S!\n\nThis will come as a strange response, from a player of older cRPGs, such as the Baldur's Gate series, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape Torment, but, after playing Pillars of Eternity through to its resolution, I suddenly come to realize that the Infinity engine has not aged well.\n\nThe entire game is plagued by cliches of Tabletop gaming, and does little, either to adapt them for PC gaming beyond what Baldur's Gate and its successors already did, or to turn the conventions harshly on their head, the way Planescape: Torment's story was able. Even most of the enemies are ripped remorselessly from your Saturday night campaign, and given mildly gaelic redubs; Ghouls are Guls, Vampires are Fampyrs, Banshees are Cean Gwla, but it's blatantly transparent. The variety of enemies is even drastically down, from say, Baldur's Gate II. (You've got your typical 'horrible' living dead, bad-mouthed bandits and fanatical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zealots, some slimes, some beasties, trolls, dryads, and dragons. Yay. I probably missed something and will be narked at about it. Bring me back killing my own mortality.)\n\nWorse yet, I never felt the story came to any decent level of 'resolution', for my character--one needling plague of open-ended gameplay that eternally haunts.\n\nFor perspective for current gamers who are some five paragraphs in, and have never heard of Gary Gygax--if you felt like, say--the ending to Fallout 3 was stupid (having an anticlimactic final battle, being guilted to martyr yourself needlessly to someone else's morality, or suffering a lousy ending because you weren't a completionist when it came to sidequests), you'll feel cheated by the end of PoE, even when you think you're heading toward the ending you want--simply by the system of flags and scripts that determines what disappointing exposition scene you get. (No, Fawkes. You're not denying me my destiny, now get in the '♥♥♥♥ing' GECK chamber. I have a dog to walk away with while the narrator smugly talks about War. No, I am not buying the expansion DLC!)\n\nWhile the end boss to PoE is wholeheartedly on the opposite end of the difficulty spectrum to Fallout 3's ending, you can bet that the outcome doesn't justify the effort.\n\nAgain for perspective, Torment's boss can be killed in dialogue, but provides a massively more satisfying resolution, that resonates with the overall 'message' of the game. The big bad of this game, by contrast, utterly refutes every line you throw, regardless of stats or what you've accomplished, to the point that you may as well fast-forward to immediate combat (--and past that, just turn on cheats, mouse over him and hit the key to shut him up.) Afterward, the game gives you the ending it has mathed out that you maybe could want, if Obsidian didn't have to spread itself thin covering all the bases (and you'd best bet they had to, the title was nearly their swan song.)\n\nEven these things weren't dealbreakers, alone. What truly threw me out of the experience was simply reaching the end stretch of the game, and realizing just how little has changed from older cRPGs in the engine--in fact, in terms of gameplay, things have taken a backslide, in the sense that the descriptions for the function of many of PoE's items are vague at best, and the merits of many of the different stat tweaks and perks pale in comparison to just exploiting the shoddy AI of the Infinity engine. Many encounters I won simply by targetting a single difficult enemy and having a character run around in circles to distract it, or spamming summons and pinning the enemies in corners, while my expendable characters took their time shooting. And if I feel like I'm coming up with tricks to outsmart bits and bytes, and doing complex math before battles, rather than winning out of a sense of skill... welp... Screw math, I'll save that for making stock investments. Back to games that make me care, rather than teabagging my corpse over algebra.\n\nMY BURNING QUESTION: IS +10 WILL more valuable than HITTING THINGS FOR 1.2x more DAMAGE?! I HAVE NO IDEA.\n\nWhat made sense as a general guideline for pen-and-paper get togethers over chips and Mountain Dew has never worked particularly well as filler for functional gameplay, on Infinity's part. Hearing the same statistical song and dance try to dress up as something new and improved over twenty years later just makes me groan.\n\nPoint in Case: Borderlands 2 has a jumbled mess of statistics handed to me to sort out, for its guns--but I can tell what 'fire rate' or 'pellet count' or 'reload speed' are, without a glossary. If I get an amazing weapon, I can tell it's amazing at a glance, and it feels like an event. I know what elements on weapons are effective against what kinds of threats, at a glance, without a monster encylopedia. More to the point, the struggles of Roland and the Crimson Raiders, and the humour of characters like Hammerlock and Claptrap, keep me going in spite of needless number crunches that the devs may as well have handled. Pillars of Eternity gets as far as 'telling' me to care, and then 'literally' sets all my efforts on fire to advance its shallow tale, within the second act.\n\nOne particularly egregious example: I kill a raving mad local lord who is driving his village into extinction, and appoint his idealistic cousin as successor. By the end of my overly arduous final boss-fight, hidden numbers assigned with dealing out the game's ending montage have determined that my old foe gets up from being dead, goes even crazier, and wipes out everyone in said village before the end credits can even roll. And I have no say in it--how was I supposed to forecast that?  ♥♥♥♥ move, game. Imagine if Handsome Jack got away with nuking Sanctuary despite your best efforts defeating the Warrior, in Borderlands 2. How lame would that be?\n\nBut since I'm not twinking out six me's with optimum gear and stats, maybe I'm not doing something right. I'll never know--I'll be playing other things. Tip for you geniuses of metagaming preparing to flame me: none of the enemies provide combat exp, and the level of encounters scales with your level. Fighting trash mobs produces equivalent results to running to the far end of the room. Have fun with your grind.\n\nIn summary: Pillars of Eternity neither renews the Infinity engine's myriad wrinkles, nor does it tell a particularly fresh or engaging tale. It's not particularly horrible either--just woefully over-promising, mediocrity on all counts. It was a lukewarm reminder that old things can get a second chance to show how well they've festered, and that's all a good little twink can ask for: spoilt milk and stale cookies with a great big fat +10 to some stat I'll have to look up the applications for, on the end.\n\nThere's always Torment: Tides of Numenara, coming Q4, right?","April 6, 2015","false","208.2"," 120 of 206 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","120","206","12","27"

(Thoughts On The Game)\n\nFirst off a big thank you to Obsidian for such a wonderful game and second, thanks to all the kickstarter backers. I was only able to back the amount for the game (25 or 35) and I also added on the addition for the beta backer later on, so a huge thank you to the backers who put in the big money! Now onto my thoughts on the game!\n\nThe things I loved:\n\n- Writing was fantastic, from the dialogue to the story to the characters, wonderful writing once again Obsidian\n\n- Art Design is so beautiful, seriously... so seriously, love it\n\n- Combat is fun, at first I wasn't to sure about it but I have grown to love it. While not 100% perfect, it is a well done combat system.\n\n- Soundtrack is fantastic, really sets the atmosphere for me as I am exploring or going along my adventures\n\n- The Stronghold is a cool idea and i like it, but it was def not perfect, alot could be added to this aspect in an expansion pack\n\n- Had zero crashes, no fps issues, no gamebreaking bugs and no broken quests.\n\n- Some of the decisions I had to make had me really thinking about it\n\n- Atmosphere is very well done\n\n- Enjoyable final fight!\n\n- The character creation and classes I feel are all well done\n\n\nThings I didn't like or that I think can be improved:\n\n- The Pathfinding was honestly my biggest issue. There was times when I would tell guys to go attack this game and they would either try and go the long way or try and go through another player. Some other times moving around cities one would get stuck on something. Nothing gamebreaking but this was the biggest thing that annoyed me during my time with the game.\n\n- The Stronghold could be alot better, while I enjoyed it and think its improved over Inquisition and Dragon Age Awakening, it could still use some improvements. Maybe more things to build? A type of trial aspect where you decide on issues people have? Give us more options as to what we can do with prisoners and allow more random people to come and live in your stronghold.\n\n\n\nThings That could be added for expansion pack:\n\n- A coop mode like Divinity Original Sin for an expansion pack? As much as I loved this game, I think it would be even more fun if I could play the campaign with ONE friend (as long as it didn't effect the singleplayer)\n\n- More character Portraits next time. I love that we can import our own, but in future expansion packs maybe get the artists to do a handful more with more variety for difference races,etc..\n\nLove the game! I enjoyed Divinity Original Sin, Wasteland 2 and Shadowrun Dragonfall last year but this is even better imo. So wonderful to see this revival of a genre that was my favorite for so many years. Here is to more Pillars Of Eternity, more CRPG's in general in gaming and more Obsidian magic.\n\nSomeone asked me for a score, I don't usually give out scores, I prefer just writing thoughts on the game. But, I can appreciate any review score from 8 to 10. If you had a gun to my head and asked for a score though? I would say its a 9.5/10 for me personally. Not perfect but a hell of a wonderful experience! I have liked so many Black Isle and Obsidian games over the years, but you really didn't fool around with this game did you!\n\nI know there is a tank game coming from Obsidian and another unannounced game and two expansion packs for Pillars in the future, hope to see many more rpg's from Obsidian in the future, keep up the wonderful work! I have to deal with chronic pain every day so when a nice rpg like this comes around (or a good foreign movie or book/tv show,etc..) and has the ability to pull me into its world so well with and take my mind off of things it is a wonderful thing.

You can also use a mod to disable auto-saving, but remember to quick save/manual save occasionally.\n\nPillars of Eternity, a beautifully crafted crpg filled to the brim with content, will hold your attention for a long time. A single playthrough can easily take over 70+ hours depending on how much of the world and quests you to decide to explore. I spent hours reading as many in-game books as I could and even spent some time reading the bestiary. There's even a character journal that'll summarize the things you've done in the game. You can also expect your choices to affect outcomes and your reputation with people and factions. This game is extremely dense and I suggest not rushing through it. Take your time and enjoy yourself. At this point in time, the game is also much more stable than when it first released. They supported the game with patches that solved many issues and squashed interfering bugs. They’ll continue to support with version 2.0 in the future which will add more functionality.\n\nFreedom of Choice\n\nThis game’s degree of freedom and consequences lends itself well to roleplaying and being the character you want to be whether that’s a vengeful barbarian, a monk that’s just trying to set things right, or even a gigantic jerkface. Most of quests have multiple outcomes depending on your actions. Dialogue choices are abundant too and your character stats/background can also affect what you might be able to say. Sometimes the extra responses are for flavor or can result in a fight being completely avoided. Keep that in mind should you decide to have a smooth-talking intelligent character or a mighty sort of person who intimidates. All of the main stats can influence conversations, but some do so much more often than others such as Intelligence and Resolve. If you really wanted to, you could just fly through the game solo, though I’d expect more talking and sneaking around if you chose that kind of path.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game's art assets look fantastic for the most part. I only noticed a building or two and maybe some walls that appeared to be in a low resolution compared to the rest of the game. Just don't zoom in all the way and keep the camera at an appropriate distance, things become blurry if you go in all the way. Every place in the game is a work of art. I especially like the leaves on trees. The trees are gorgeous as are the big, scary spells in the game. It’s quite the sight when a druid calls down a thunderstorm. It’s a beautiful game. Hmm, I suppose I should mention the character models are a bit funny looking since they’re usually seen from an isometric view until you’re in the inventory screen. Also, please try big head mode at least once.\n\nStory\n\nI thought the story was fine for the most part, but my efforts and interests focused on everything else since I wanted to do as much as possible. I’ll be unspecific to avoid spoilers. The world is a dark place filled with murder, vengeance, and betrayal. The side-quests benefit from the settings by doing interesting things with it. It felt good to vanquish foes that I thought were deserving since my monk didn’t like liars or murderers in general. I thought the main villain’s motivations were interesting and how far he went to accomplish his goals went beyond insanity. The companion storylines/quests might be a mixed bag for some people, but I did end up liking most of them all except for Kana and Pallegina. Pallegina was definitely underutilized and should have had a more fleshed out companion quest. Kana was an interesting person, but his quest seemed underwhelming. On the other hand, Durance and Grieving Mother had some fantastic storylines. I highly recommend seeing the quests of those two to the end. There’s plenty of story to find and read. Even the unique items have different legends associated with them. Some of them function like tragic short stories and are told well.\n\nCombat\n\nThe combat is a mixture of real-time and turn-based in the sense that you can pause the game mid-combat and issue orders to your party. You can also change the settings to have the game auto-pause when certain conditions are met like low Endurance or when someone is knocked out. I found normal to be somewhat easy for the most part after I had a full party of six members. The game’s difficult encounters still had me pausing and considering my movement and orders very carefully. “Okay, I need a damage reduction buff here. You’ll make it rain thunderbolts, you two try and knock the big guy down, and I’ll have you summon some shades.” The combat has a nice amount of complexity to it when you come across a worthy challenge. If you decide to not have such a large party, then you can expect the game to become harder if combat is your primary way of handling situations. Pause often and succeed, this is not meant to be a 100% real-time experience.\n\nHopefully Pillars entertains you for a long time if it’s your type of game. It has much to offer unless you hate reading, but if you play, you’ll have the added benefit of an increased reading stat. Hooray.","July 12, 2015","true","77.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I could easily write a review singing it's praises and proclaiming it to be a work of genius, and I could also make a review attacking it as a charleton, unacceptably flawed RPG, and neither one would require me to stretch the truth very much.\n\nIt's a pretty good game. It deserves, at the very least, a 7.5/10, just for the concentrated effort to the self-contained world-building alone. The combat could be robots fornicating and I would still probably think the game was worth a look because of how rare it is that a project takes world creation professionally. There's enough "vanilla fantasy" to understand what's happening without navigating encylcopedia entries, but enough subtle changes to make it interesting. It feels like a Bioware game, and I mean that in the most positive sense that could possibly be conveyed: small story setpieces, tasks, nonessential conversations...lots of little things that don't really mean anything but do make you feel at home. Player agency exists, but only through a filter, much like in Baldur's Gate, so don't expect a choice & consequences game along the glory of Fallout, or even New Vegas.\n\nThe UI is absolutely fantastic, the inventory and map screens are totally flawless. Despite all the huballoo about the graphics I found the game to be among the best looking RPGs I have ever played, with even the apparently "low detail" character models looking pretty good to me. Most of the clothes and armor look great and the minis are awesome. The soundtrack is a bit too Baldur's Gate for me, but it can easily be ignored except in cases were it loops improperly (which it unfortunately does quite a bit). Engine-wise my only criticism are the loading times, which are far too long even considering my aged laptop.\n\nThe "guidance" of Baldur's Gate seems to be both a blessing and a curse. Nearly all of the major problems in PoE are things that were major problems for the Baldur's Gate games, so it's a wonder why these problems exist at all. As many of the more negative critics have said, why bother making a spiritual successor to the IE engine games if you're not even going to improve on them? Probably my biggest problem with Baldur's Gate was the D&D system, which is pretty much total ♥♥♥, But what PoE provides instead is somehow worse, which I didn't even know was possible. Perhaps this is secretely a Pathfinder CRPG? This is unmistakably a game that Josh Sawyer directed, seeing how there are "no hard counters" which is basically code for "nothing can be stopped and nothing is fun".\n\n99% of the loot you get is terrible because special weapons have barely any unique attributes besides "do more better damage". Eder's armor is the best armor in the entire game because it means you revive yourself on KO about 50% of the time, which is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, and you get that about 2% into the game. I put it on my main character immediately and was still wearing it at the end of the game. Nothing else you get even comes close, even the game's equivilant of Excalibur. Maybe this Pillars of Eternity wanted to be like that other game with a PoE acronym on this. Thankfully I don't really much care for item progression in my RPGs.\n\nThere are only two types of maps: way too ♥♥♥♥ing big and way too ♥♥♥♥ing small. The big maps are actually really cool when you first get to them. Probably my favorite part of the game, and most likely the thing I'll look forward to on replays, was navigating through the big areas like Defiance Bay and Twin Elms and discovering what everyone's deal was. The problem is that these maps are usually the ones with key resources like vendors and inns and you have to walk 500 ♥♥♥♥ing miles to get there, then go through a loading screen, do your thing, then go back to a loading screen again, and then do it all over again if you have two trips to make. It takes way too long to get anywhere, probably longer than those MMORPGs that artificially lengthen travel time so you're eager to purchase mounts. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous but I don't want to stop and smell the flowers all the time, I want to ♥♥♥♥ing progress. The small maps are usually almost pointless wilderness maps, which was another one of my big problems with Baldur's Gate.\n\nAnd then there's the combat. Here's where things really get ugly. Despite the massive hate for it, I found that engagement barely effected me at all, though I do agree with the critics that it is 100% punitive to the players, so the game would lose little retiring the mechanic. The real problem here is the encounter design, which is astronomically terrible. In PoE, there are really only two combat scenarios in the entire game:\n-You're in a wide open area with many enemies. Send one melee or a ranger pet to help out your backliners and have your tanks engage as many enemies as possible to allow someone to get some AOE spells off.\nYou're in a closed area with a single chokepoint. Send a tank to block off the choke and have your ranged attacks shoot the hell out of the closest enemy.\n\nThat's seriously it. Even as someone who regularly struggles with enemy placement in tabletop RPGs, it's a very poor effort. There are no flying enemies that soar over your melee attackers and force the hand of magic and arrows, no archers placed in sniper spots, no poison-inflcting venomancers that slowly drag down your party, no battles inside infernal traps, nothing. There is only a single mechanic which forces you to switch up your tactics, and that is charm/domination, which many people hate and get protection against just because it's the only thing you'll ever have to really worry about.\n\nBad combat in RPGs really isn't a surprise, in fact, one of my favorite games, Arcanum, had far worse combat. But there is just SO MUCH OF IT. On my first playthrough I ended up killing 1502 enemies, 302 more than the number required for the "Super Murderer" achievement, and I only ended up killing maybe 20 NPCs that didn't go hostile on me first. I've always been one to hate the diplomacy-is-god style of RPGs where you can literally get away with murder by being a lovable scamp (see New Vegas) but this is ridiculous. I can't understate this: I probably fought more enemies in this playthrough of PoE than I did in my last 5 playthroughs of other CRPGs, including Dragonfall, which is a tactics RPG. So much combat and so little variety.\n\nI enjoyed my experience, and probably even agree with my purchase ($45, far more than I am willing to spend on most games), but it was a gruelling effort and I am kind of glad it's over. It's a good game made with a lot of love and care, with some occasional dips in quality, both combat-wise and narrative-wise. There's room for huge improvements with patches, and I would love to see a sequel so long as they don't double dip on kickstarter. But I won't be replaying it anytime soon.","April 7, 2015","true","92.2"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","29","44","0","0"

A new and exciting world to explore, a deep and intruiging story, oodles of customization and everything else that no doubt already has you feeling nostalgic about the good old days and how RPG's used to be. You should be playing this game, or at the very least be watching someone else play it.

While it obviously cannot nearly keep up to the amount of content of a Baldur's Gate II, (lenght of the campaign, amount of optional quests, interesting storylines), it yet does some things better than its predecessors.\n\nIt is in every sense indeed a game for adults. Dialogues are very well-conceived and sophisticated, and so is the whole background of the story and this new world. Prepare yourself for a LOT of careful reading, if you want to really understand what's going on and take some insights from this game. If you don't, there is still a very good tactical fighting system to explore, but that's obviously not the major purpose here.\n\nYou find yourself confronted with truly hard moral decisions, where you really have to think about what's right and what's wrong. That is so because the game gives you absolutely no hints where things might lead you or what is now the "good character"-choice. Sometimes I found myself staring for five minutes on some dialogue options before i chose one, thinking really hard what to answer. The game, in its way, rewards you for the effort, building plausible consequences even on the nuances of how your character behaves and what he says.\n\nThere is no black and white and grey like we are used to from the fantasy genre. Every situation is unique, and sometimes several or even all options lead to consequences that you can't morally justify, but yet you have to come to a decision!\n\nIt's just like in the real world.\n\nThat's why i liked this game.","January 15","true","52.9"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eurolooney/recommended/291650/","eurolooney","Drone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eurolooney/","374 products in account","So let me start by saying that this is A Very Good Game (tm).\n\nI was a bit pessimistic about it -- after all, how many times has Obsidian come so close to releasing a truly great game, yet failed to completely deliver (granted, often through no fault of their own). I got to play a bit of Pillars at Gamescom last summer and was left feeling pretty meh about it. In hindsight this was probably more because the limited time I had to play it wasn't enough to really properly "get" the game from the very beginning.\n\nThe writing is very Obsidian, and the worldbuilding is deep and complex. After a few hours in, I can already see Obsidian's trademark moral choices everywhere, and they definitely appreciate the shades of grey that they always have. Some of the choices you're forced to make leave you seriously wondering if you're -actually- supporting the good/bad guys, and I think that's honestly really great. Pretty much exactly what you'd come to expect from Obsidian.\n\nNow for some gameplay stuff: I'm playing on Normal difficulty, and as a vet of Infinity Engine games, I'm finding it quite challenging... though that could be my party composition. Being able to create adventurers to fill in gaps in your party is a great feature, but the writing on the companions is good enough that you'll definitely be missing something by using the cookie-cutter custom adventurers. That being said, one thing I'm definitely going to say now is HAVE A ROGUE in your party. The first hour or two of the game you can get by fairly easily without one, but I'm now running into a lot of areas that are laden with traps/lockpickable doors, and I really don't have anyone in my party that is adept at 1.) seeing traps before triggering them, and 2.) deactivating them when necessary. You can probably get away with a Ranger instead of a Rogue, with a bunch of points dumped into Mechanics/Stealth, but nothing is as good as the real deal.\n\nAll in all, I do not regret paying full price for this game. It's really great, and simultaneously scratches that nostalgic itch for a Baldur's Gate-type game while at the same time offering many current features that make it stand apart on its own as well.\n\nI hope Obsidian makes bucketloads of money with this and then goes on to make spiritual successors to some other Infinity Engine-era CRPGs.

Do you like micromanaging obtuse and obsolete game mechanics? Do you want a game that throws all its potential out a window in favour of being 'safe'? Then boy do I have a game for you!\n\nPillars of Eternity presents itself as a throwback to the classic CRPGs, like Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment. However, it actually comes across as a game made by people who liked those games but did not understand why they were good. Pillars throws at you the trappings of choice, of an interactive world, of interactive design, but does not actually include these in any meaningful way.\nAs an example, let's look at character creation. You're presented with a half-dozen options for races, all with different stats and backstory, then a handful of different class options based on the traditional DnD classes (fighter, wizard, rogue, bard, etc.) and then finish up with options for personalising the character's backstory, appearance, etc. Sounds great, right? Just what you'd expect. But when you come to actually play the game, you'll find that none of it really matters. The classes really just resolve into "ranged" and "not ranged", and everything else is just fluff. Your actual playstyle will be exactly the same whether you play a big, tough warrior or a small, sneaky rogue. The character options present different possibilities for interacting with the world, but these almost never actually come up in the story. If you play as a goblin (I don't care what you actually call them, they're still goblins), the game will tell you that your race is hated and discriminated against. This came up ONCE, in the 20-odd hours I wasted on this game. In a single option, hidden behind another conversation option, while talking with a single minor character.\n\nQuests and storylines may have multiple ways of approaching them, and multiple ways of progressing, but almost all that I played ultimately had only one single outcome, which had nothing at all to do with what I did. You can spend hours at a time working carefully on choosing which faction you're going to support, choosing which quests to do for that faction, deciding how you're going to accomplish your quests from the several options presented to you, weighing the pros and cons of each possible outcome, only for all of this to be rendered pointless when the storyline progresses with absolutely no impact from you or your actions. The writers are determined to tell you their story, despite what you do, without you being involved in that story. There is no real choice, no actual 'multiple paths' as advertised, there is just "well, that's nice, now here's what is ACTUALLY going to happen."\n\nUltimately my problem with this game is that there is no real choice in anything. It is a crude imitation of what came before, with nothing new to add or innovations to include. 20 years ago, this game would have been a brilliant new addition to the CRPG library. It would have stood up against the best of its genre. Unfortunately, it's not 20 years ago. But I don't think the developers know that.","October 3, 2015","false","21.1"," 93 of 162 people (57%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","57","93","162","11","3"

He is a priest talking about his own goddess Magran in whose name he helped kill Waidwen (who claimed to be the living vessel of the god Eothas) during the Saint’s War. Such is the relationship between gods and people in Pillars of Eternity. Gods are not abstract terms used only in blind faith, they are among us every step of the way providing blessing and punishment as they see fit. They are deeply woven within the very fabric of society, with everyone opting for a god to serve and follow. As you start your journey, you learn of Waidwen’s Legacy, a horrible plague beset upon the people of Dyrwood which sees their newborn come into the world soulless. It is definitely true that faith and religion are overarching themes in Pillars of Eternity, but it’s the liberty to create a personal touch provided by Obsidian that makes it so compelling.\n\nYou witness a strange ritual at the beginning of the game and something strange happens to you. From there, your motivations are up to you. Nobody designates you as the would-be savior of the world, nobody even tasks you to look into Waidwen’s Legacy. You are simply a person making his way through the world designing your own motivations and choosing your own actions. It was this aspect of the game that I found most liberating and compelling. Too often in games you are simply tasked and/or commanded what to do with clear goals set before you. Pillars of Eternity removes all that which makes the whole journey very organic and natural. It’s devoid of that silly feeling of clearly knowing you have something grand to do, but you simply opt to do a lot of things on the side despite everyone constantly reminding you how the world’s fate rests in your hands. This may be a subtle effect, but I found it extremely refreshing and compelling.\n\nObsidian was clear on what it set out to do with Pillars of Eternity, it is definitely a throwback to classic Infinity engine games most notably Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale. It even looks the part with its rather simplistic 2D graphics that will instantly remind anyone of those glory days of computer RPGs. However, even though Obsidian didn’t really push any big new ideas, Pillars of Eternity is still very much imbued with many modern takes on what we’ve seen and played a long time ago. The visuals aren’t going to blow anyone away, but the 3D character models, some very nice effects and a strong art style go a long way to make it visually appealing, even gorgeous at times.\n\nThe combat is real-time with pause, very reminiscent of the first Dragon Age. It is highly tactical with plenty of abilities, spells and traps to choose from. The only problem regarding the combat is the atrociously bad pathfinding. Outside of combat, it works perfectly fine, but during combat, characters will very often get stuck on walls, obstacles and each other requiring you to very closely monitor everything that is going on and manually select each character to get them out of a bind, particularly in confined areas. This can be alleviated to a degree by smart group formation and a bit of micromanagement, but that shouldn’t be necessary. What’s different about the combat is its emphasis on endurance over health. Monitoring health is a long-term affair in each battle, but a far more pressing matter is each character’s endurance level. As they receive damage, their endurance decreases, if it reaches zero, they get knocked out. There are ways to get fallen members back up again and certain classes specialize in such abilities. However, if any character’s health should reach zero, it’s game over for that particular character. So it is possible to lose designed party members for good. However, you can create your own party members at taverns for a fee. There is a large number of character classes and races to choose from, some of which are rather unique such as the cipher class or the godlike race. The downside is the extremely low level cap (12).\n\nThe game world is very big, there are quite a lot of different and interesting locations to visit from your map view whereas each location is spacious yet not overwhelming. You will also get your own stronghold ruin at one point which you will be able to build up again and receive various benefits. The best thing about the stronghold is that it hides a massive dungeon consisting of 15 levels and a nasty boss fight at the end. What is overwhelming at times is the lore and dialogue which sometimes goes on for too long. Also, the writing, while generally very good, can get a bit opaque. The main story is interesting, it raises many questions, but leaves the conclusions up to the player. There is a great number of choices to be made throughout the game and a lot of them will be addressed at the very end.\n\nThere’s a lot to love about Pillars of Eternity. The way it liberates players by letting them play their own way at their own pace through the story, by letting them decide on both their motivations and actions, the interesting game world and lore, memorable characters and a very tactical combat system. By liberating themselves from existing worlds and publisher demands, Obsidian had complete control to create their best game to date and one of the best RPGs in recent years.\n\n9 OUT OF 10 (SUPERB)","April 29, 2015","true","98.0"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

It allows you idle NPC to join the adventure and get items/exp. The shops inside your stronghold sell normal stuffs that can be bought from any NPC sellers you find in the game. To travel all the way (very long hours/days) to get the a free rest bonus is redundant, you could get a better rest bonus at very cheap rate in any Inn.\n\nDungeons:\nBasically you just hold  5-6 prisoners of the game. That's it. You mihght get rare items in exchange the prisoners but is entirely unnecesary in this game.\n\nCaed Nua Levels:\nBasically is designated for the player who likes to grind the game to prolong the game play hours.\n\nGodlike Race:\nThe only race that is stood-out in this game. The rest are just the replica of the typical elves, dwarfs, halflings race with different names.\n\n<Cons>\nBad combat system:\nThere is no tactical position neceasary for your NPC. The easiest way to win the combat is group your teamates all togather and wait for the enemy to come to attack you. All you need to do is slow mode or pause the game to spam your spells and skills.\n\nBuggy combat system: The characters always got stucked or take the longer/danger route to reach enemy.\n\nBoring Side Quests: The side quests are easy, boring and insignificant. It does not really impact too much on the storyline but only the epilodges. The only side quest that capture my attention is the Undying Heritage.\n\nUnmotivated Main Quest:\nBasically you are just chasing an old man who did 'something' on you. There is no 'A MUST' reason to motivate you to continue the main quest. You could just live at your stronghold for the rest of your life.","July 25, 2015","false","64.4"," 31 of 49 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","31","49","3","0"

But what made games like Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape so special was more than just an aesthetic: they were vast, sprawling settings with epic stories that delivered engaging tactical encounters.  And when judged by those criteria, I feel that Pillars of Eternity is a worthy successor to carry on the legacy of the Infinity Engine.  Though the loss of the AD&D engine and settings does take some getting used to, the mechanics are solid and the world is compelling and fun to discover.  It’s an easy recommendation for fans of of the Infinity Engine and I’d also recommend it for anyone interested in an engrossing quest through a fantastic land.","November 25, 2015","true","91.7"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","20","29","0","0"

If you enjoyed those games, Pillars is a must buy. If you didn't, Pillars probably won't change your find and it stays pretty true to that formula. Pillars is a party based RPG with a strong sense of story. It's personalized to your character by incorporating your character's traits into conversations with NPCs - for example, your knowledge of the wilderness or a reputation of being kind may open new options. The sheer number of ways Obsidian  accomplished this was one of the highlights of the game. Of course playing out the tactical battles is another large aspect to the game. While they are well done, too many of them were easy on hard difficulty while a smaller number were challenging. The game would have benefited from a better balancing of battles to provide a more uniform challenge. Quibbles aside, I recommend Pillars for fans of this type of game.

Obsidian has made good on it's promise to bring you a fantastic and unforgiving isometric RPG.\n\nIf you've played games like Baldurs Gate, or Planescape: Torment, then you know what you're getting into, but for the uninitiated, this is a text heavy roleplaying game. Instead of the constant grinding of enemies to level up associated with most similar games currently on the market, your experience will largely be rewarded from exploring new areas and completing quests, of which you'll find plenty.\n\nThis is not to say that the combat system was neglected, it is both engaging and relentless. You'll need to take control of your entire party (unless you choose to go solo) and plan your attacks and formations accordingly. A host of spells, abilities and talents help you maintain control of the battlefield in real time as you dispatch your foes and progress through an compelling and well written story. Definitely a contender for Game of the Year.","March 30, 2015","true","43.9"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","17","24","3","0"

It doesn't have the story depth of the characters of those classics, and it doesn't quite match up to the immersion of Planescape: Torment, but when it comes to isometric cRPGs this is one that stands out. You won't have the, "Squeak SQUEAK" of the "Boo" that is Minsc's hamster or the haughty judgementalism that is Jaheira in the character interactions, and you certainly won't get the gender-changing possibilities of your companions, but . . . it's not bad for a crowd-funded game.\n\nIf you're expecting that level of depth and that's what you're looking for, you're not going to find it with this game. There is, however, interaction and some degree of character growth of the NPCs that can join your party. All NPCs have personal quests - not as rewarding as BG2, for instance - but it's there.\n\nHaving said that, this is an isometric cRPG that allows you to create a character of your choice and choose, at your leisure, a party of either pre-built NPCs you meet in-game or recruit and define for youself. Your party grows in strength and experience, you stylistically decide how to develop yourself and your NPCs to suit your expectations, and you go through the game playing these decisions against the battle encounters you face.\n\nAnd that's kind of where it breaks down. The story - the plot - is interesting, but what you will find is that you approach all conflicts and battle in pretty much the same way. "I put my 'tanks' or 'warriors' here, and everyone else destroys the enemies from afar." is not an unfair description of how most fights go. If you're in it for the story, then great - it's like playing any RPG, such a Dragon Age: Inquisition, on casual mode. If you're in it for hardcore combat challenge, then you're just going to end up with larger groups of enemies against whom you already have effective strategies and tactics to defeat.\n\nPoint is, the battles get repetitive. The story is there between the battles, but the story doesn't progress without the battles. Looking back, all those years ago at Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment, it probably wasn't much different. But at least at that time it was novel ideas and made me a captive audience. In this re-incarnation, it's the same thing except I know what to expect, and that diminishes the overall experience.\n\nI recommend the game, however, because of the story. That is, ultimately, why we play RPGs. I want to know what happens next; I am the protagonist and get to make choices that may affect future consequences, and I have a BIG ♥♥♥ DAMN SWORD that can cut you in two. As a revisitation on older cRPG games, it's nothing less than awesome. Graphics are decent, soundtrack is great, voice-acting is okay - there's just enough to bring those memories back from the 90's. And since I'm sentimental, I'll run with that.\n","October 30, 2015","true","265.8"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

They rather had a list of thing they wanted to show that they had, for the fans, and rushed them into the game.\n\nYou can't make a game good because on paper its features look good. A good game is something that is crafted and tested iterativelly. Here the different ideas don't hold together properly.\n\nOn paper you have for example :\n\nGood graphics\nLots of lore\n'Innovative' class and combat system\n'Innovative' xp system (combats give no xp)\n\nIn pratice:\n\nLoading times between tiny maps are embarrassingly long. Unacceptable for a 2015 game that pretends to emulates a 2000 one.\nI couldn't care less about the story, the characters. As it was said everywhere else, it looks like a collection of fan fictions.\nClass system is dull, characters feel all the same.\nCombats are a joke. You can't prepare for the combat before you engage the enemy (can't use spells and so on). Enemies are overpowered and even though there are lots of different lloking enemies in the game they don't feel very different. Abilities are boring and their effects interchangeable.\n\nThe xp system is an absolute joke. This game as 10 monsters per square meter and combats give absolutely no xp ??!!\nBasically the entire game feels like a ripoff (I have barelly played it but I can imagine it is consistent trough the entire game).\nIs it supposed to be more realistic? So gaining levels and improving your combat skill by doing stupid quests is more realistic than doing so by winning fights?\nI will rephrase it : The entire purpose of experience points in this game is to improve combat related skills, but then combats give no experience?\nThis game drifts too far away from what normally makes a good game.  That idea of having to go back to town almost every fights because you need to sleep to regain your spells... In baldur's gate it was ok because you could outsmart/outpower your enemies with well thought tactics and items, but this game suffers from the tall poppy syndrome and there isn't much you can do to feel clever/good. You feel like you're playing the same way everyone is playing, like on a rail.\nApparently helmets in this game are purely decorative, give no stats. You can have an iron helm or a simple hat on your magician, it makes no difference. Is it for more realism, like the xp system?\n\nIn this game everything feels so generic, watered down. What a waste of crowdfunding money! They could have just copied baldur's gates mechanics with better graphics and made an awesome game but no, they had to 'dust it off'.\n\nWhat worries me the most about this game is all the positive critiques it managed to get. It is neither an old school game nor a modern one, so what is it? What do people find in it ?\n\n","August 31, 2015","false","12.2"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","42","72","3","0"

Primarily emphasizes preparation, using narrow doorways to your advantage, and generally positioning your folks properly. This leads to delightfully varied and challenging encounters. Do note, however, that micromanagement is also an important part of combat (they even tell you that when you're choosing a difficulty level), so if you don't like that sorta stuff, this game might not be your cup of tea.\n\nWhen it comes to story and such, I almost don't know where to begin. The world in this game is really creative and unique (just the fact that it's more of a fantasy version of the Age of Discovery rather than medieval Europe is refreshing), your companions are all interesting characters (really felt like I was friends with most of them, rather than being their leader), and since it's an Obsidian game, there are some really delicious philosophical ponderings here and there.\n\nSpecial mention goes to all the different dialogue choices you can make, though. Instead of just being different solutions to quests and such, there are also plenty of options that exist solely for the sake of roleplaying, to further flesh out your character's motivations and so on. That's really neat.\n\nIf there's one major gripe I have with this game, though, it's that pathfinding can be really rubbish sometimes. Seeing folks politely waiting behind their allies because they don't realise they could go around that guy in order to bludgeon someone is something that happens too often.\n\nOh yeah, and you can get at least three cats and a piglet in this game (but you can't give them little hats or armors, which I hope will be remedied in a future expansion).","April 10, 2015","true","92.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Not Kreia's level of awesomeness, but Avellone did a damn fine job on that priest), gorgeous writing, a few great twists on the classical D&D setting, a vivid world full of lore and gods, but ultimately, the storytelling fell flat.\n\nPlaying this game felt like watching the landscape through a train's window: the scenery was beautiful but the emotional engagement was nonexistent. I never cared about the characters I met. I felt like a stranger in a strange land, and though the plot was increasingly unsatisfying, I powered through, hoping for a wonderful resolution which never came.\n\nSince the dev dream team had complete creative freedom and a great starting concept, it's a shame to accept that this ambitious game ended up being "just a solid 7/10 if you're a fan of the genre".\n\n\nThis game is fan service for veterans of Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. If you know all these games inside out and are a completionist, you will enjoy Pillars of Eternity.\n\nIf you discovered Obsidian through newer games such as NWN 2, KotoR 2, or Fallout New Vegas or got used to fast-paced RPGs such as Dragon Age Origins, The Witcher, The Elder Scrolls or the Mass Effect series, don't be surprised if Pillars of Eternity leans heavily towards the old school:\n\n- there are a few huge difficulty spikes coming out of the blue,\n- you will spend a lot of time running back and forth between areas,\n- you will spend a lot of time reading the quest journal and bestiary to figure things out,\n- you will spend a lot of time reading dialogues (the prose is magnificent, but you'll stop reading the golden characters backstories soon enough),\n- you will spend a lot of time getting your guys unstuck from the terrain,\n- you will spend a lot of time staring at loading screens (about ~3 hours out of my 50 hours playtime).","May 11","false","58.4"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","25","41","0","2"

For my first playthrough I decided to give "Hard" mode a try, with the "Expert Mode" toggled on. I'm glad I did, because it has made some encounters much more exciting.\n\nAt times the combat feels slightly dated, however this small annoyance is far outweighed by the fact the story is so well written. There are many paths and choices the player can make, and that is half the fun of the game. At the time of this writing, I've played for 29 hours and I've really taken my time and only have cleared approximately 25% of the game's content. I'm sure it would be easy to rush through and clear the content much quicker, but I'm enjoying the opportunity to soak up all the sights, dynamic characters, and amazing story instead. I often find myself reading every little in-game book that my party uncovers, which adds another layer to the game in much the same way that Skyrim books did.\n\nIf you are looking for an action rpg along the same vein as Diablo 3, Torclight 2, etc., you may find the combat in Pillars of Eternity to be too slow-paced for your liking. However, if you appreciate tactical combat, and don't mind pausing to issue individual commands for your party of 6 adventurers, you will have plenty of fun.\n\nI've already gotten my money's worth, and look forward to finishing the game (I may even restart with a new class!).\n\nI only wish Co-Op was available, playing this with a buddy would be great!","April 1, 2015","true","46.8"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

Though the writing quality is uneven, with some names feeling as though they came out of a fantasy name generator and some plotlines being disappointingly anticlimactic, the narrative as a whole and most of the major side quests are extraordinarily well designed. This, paired with the game's beuatiful, painterly art style and the amount of freedom granted to the player in terms of narrative choices are what makes the game worth playing.\n\nThe game is not without its faults: the level of cap of 12 is too low for a game with so much to do, and if you're the sort of player who likes to complete all side quests, you'll find yourself reaching it long before the final dungeon. The megadungeon which forms a major side quest in the game is irritatingly grindy, with interesting points popping up so rarely in between frequently redundant battles as to make the trek through the entirety of it rather infuriating. Finally, and perhaps most problematically, the game's mechanics are a mess: skills, attributes, the array of 8 different damages, and a confused jumble of traits intertwined together just feel incongruous and make no intuitive sense.\n\nDespite all of that, however, the excellent storytelling and fascinating lore of the world are what make this game shine. All in all: a fantastic throwback.","May 21","true","66.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark_raven13/recommended/291650/","dark_raven13","Raven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dark_raven13/","309 products in account","First of all, I have put around 45 hours on this game, most of the time on the offline mode. And I'm planning to halt my gameplay with this game until I get my hands on The White March. I'm on the middle of Act II as of now, but since the constantly stellar experience that I have since I start my journey, I have a clear picture of what I think about this amazing game.\n\nPillars of Eternity is an isometric CRPG, devveloped by Obsidian, the same studio who made Fallout New Vegas, Knights of  the Old Republic 2, and Neverwinter Nights 2 (among others). If you have played, one of their game, you already know what to expect. Yes, a deep RPG mechanic, with excellent writing, reactive world, and freedom of action to bend the world as you will. Give Obsidian freedom, free from the existing storyline, gameplay mechanic from previous game (since they usually make sequels), and "pushy" publisher, and what do you get? It's Pillars of Eternity, an excellent game, made from scratch, with no "restriction" whatsoever, It feels like a game that Obsidian was itching to make from the start, a well realized, polished, ambitious, and nostalgia-fueled (for the better). It's Obsidian's best work so far, at least for me. Let's get more in depth to the individual aspect of this game.\n\nStory\n\nRich, engaging, moving, and intriquing lore with believable characters. Coupled with a brilliantly written texts and dialogues. A very well paced story where the mystery, back story, and overall lore are slowly revealed over time. Every thing is revealed in the right place, right time, and right amount of it, making the story progression feels ever so intriguing and natural.  A ton of equally superb side quest, that adds even more interesting story behind the land of Eora, and especially Dyrwood, with twist and turns along the way, making it a really great read.\n\nGameplay\n\nIt's an isometric CRPG, akin to Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, if you're into those kind of games, you will be feel right at home. It's a deep modern RPG, something that has been lost for a decade. An RPG where the number matters, every aspect of the stats matters, and when you're trying to be a jack-of-all-trades, the game will punish you. Not that it's not achieveable though, in fact PoE offers a myriad of different ways to solve a quest. Stealth, frontal assault, backdoor assault, sweet talking, being diplomatc, deceit, it's your choice. And no, you don't get XP from combat, that shows that Obsidian wants you to know that combat can be avoided.\n\nOne of the most praise-worthy thing to note on PoE is how it can streamline a complex RPG rule set and mechanic by giving a more straightforward explanation and neat, customizable UI. Both a simplified information of each aspect of the game and an extensive, more detailed manual are there for you to read and learn, in addition of a very customizable difficulty settings.\n\nThe depth of this game can be seen even right on the character creation. You get to choose the race, class, birth place, background, and belief/motivation. Each with their own play style, advantage-disadvantage, and special abilties that you can mix and match ranging from the tried and true formula to the experimental one. My first character only lasts 2 hours because I underestimate the importance of those, and ended in an unsatisfying note, the second time (my current one), I  spent around 1 hour, reading back and forth the manual. and learning all those stats, so I can create a character that fits my play style.\n\nThe combat is a blend between real time and "turn-based". Well, technically it's a real time one where you can pause anytime to issue command to your party. It's the perfect gameplay mechanic for this game where it can show both the complexity and chaotic nature of PoE. Use trap, ambush, sneak attack, and pretty much everything, PoE has multiple ways to deal with your foes. Dealing multiple effects to the enemy even before combat, you can paralyze, sicken, burn, stuck, frightened a single target, yes, poor lad. It has a flexible rule, and doesn't hold back as long as it's still in the realm of it's rule set.\n\nAnd then there's the party system. The mechanic itself is your standard party system, up to 6 party members where you can recruit and dismiss. One thing that set it apart is the amazing back story, and personal side quest for each character, and the fact that they are so well crafted, that no one is overpowering anyone, they're diverse, but equal.. Add unique personality, funny banter every once in a while, you'll get a set of memorable and entertaining party system. Oh, and you can customize your own party, like Icewind Dale, where you can fully determine how they looks, their background, role, and their set of skills. They are not as interesting as the pre determined ones, but still a very nice addition if you want to have a complete freedom of how you play the game.\n\nStronghold is a great feature, though underdeveloped. There's nothing better than seeing your stronghold grow from a haunted ruin to a place where you can rest, hire adventurers, trading outpost, and a safe haven for travellers. But it's nothing more than that, except the mysterious mega dungeon below it. By the time I write this review, the 3.0 patch is released, and it contains improvement on the Stronghold mechanic. This is one of the section where I will revise in the future, So yeah, there's that for the momen.\n\nGraphic\n\nArt direction, art style, atmosphere, and level design over polycount and how detailed the grass looks, anytime, any day. Graphically, if you mean graphic by the latter, Pillars of Eternity looks dated, OK-ish, IF you do a close up to the character, so does the animation. But, who plays this game on close ups? Pillars of Eternity (and traditional RPG in general) is meant to be played in a farther camera position, widen your field of view, and seeing the beautiful scenery that Obsidian has created. Ah yes, I can't get enough of the scenery, it's an excellently made interactive painting. Every place has their own feels, atmosphere, and personality, strong enough that you know what's going on in that particular place. Creating a world, that is both beautiful when it described on text with a visual representation that can match, and complment it.\n\nSound\n\nIt's one of those games that  has an OST which are so great that I care to listen it on YT or through the game files afterwards. The voice acting is also top notch, when there is one. And the effect sounds are great too. It's all around a fine one.\n\nOverall\n\nPillars of Eternity is a  must have for anyone looking for a "traditional", 90's RPG, that is modernized and streamlined in all the right way. It's deep, unforgiving, rewarding, immersive, and intense. A brilliant writing, solid mechanic, an art style that has a lot of personality on it, reactive world where your choice really matters, even if it's just a minor one, side quests that has variety, quality, and quantity, and flexible mechanic that give the player a lot of play style choices, in which you can find a lot of replay value in this one.","February 16","true","5.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Now it is finally released.\nPoE is a trip down the memory lane. I am an old guy and have been waiting 15 years for something like this to happen.\nI am a big rpg fan, have been playing tabletop and lots of crpg's.\nSo should you get this game. Did you ever play Baldur's Gate? Did you like it? Then get this!!\n\nObsidian pitched this game as a spiritual successor of the old IE games (Baldur's Gate) and it is. The rules are different, as this is NOT D&D. But the feel, the mood, the sound and even the graphics (though very updated, it's been 15 years) reminds me so much of the good old days.\n\nThat beeing said the game is not flawless. But I have been playing 15 hours with no major bugs.\nThere are many small bugs though, but compared to other releases. it is running quite smooth... Even on my old machine (but I do have problems on the big maps, and with loading screen time)\n\nIf I should warn ppl about anything, it would be the differences from the old IE games. Yes there are many.\nThe things that I personally find a little strange:\n*The game is build with Unity, I would have preferred Obsidians own engine. Unity have ALOT of performance issues...\n*No ammunition. I miss this from IE.\n*Can't costumize your char in-game. Very bad. Not even change the portrait or voice!! (fixed in patch1.05)\n*Stash (like your bag of holding) can't be sorted... (also fixed)\n*Some npc's that join you are REALLY weak\n*False options in dialogue.\n*Un-necessary hand-holding\n*Most chars you can build, are perhaps too similair. I have to play more, though\n\nI am waiting for Obsidian to release their first patch, and that will hopefully take care of most of the problems. It is certainly their best release ever ...\n\nADDED: So, now that I've played through this, I must also warn about a mediacroe story, and this is not very replayable... There is still some issues with UNITY, that engine is really hard on your CPU, and I guess I am dissappointed in the minimum specs, that kept going up, my PC was brandnew when I bought this (pre) and I can hardly make it run smooth...","March 30, 2015","true","228.8"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

I can't make heads nor tails of the spells (most of them seem to buff some ability I've never read of by 0.5%) nor of the combat system in general. Which is a pity cause everything looks so great. But now, almost 10 hours into the game I don't think I've progressed further than discovering the first hints of what the plot would have been about. I mean, I can live with a low power level. But I'd far prefer my wizard to have a magic missile and my cleric to have a simple healing spell instead of just some obscure buffs or offensive debuffs. In my days the only buff we had was the Bless spell (and, seriously, who ever really used that one?)...\n\nI'll be deinstalling the game to free up HD space again, but I feel sorry that I'm missing out on what appears to be a great game for others.

I love this game.  I'm gonna start with the negatives, but mind you these are critiques coming from a caring family member, not a nagging spouse.  And the source for a lot of this is me being Baldur's Gate #1 fan, so... yeah.\n\nThe :(\nAt times it feels a little combat-heavy, but that might be because I obsessively explore every little cranny and categorically slay anything with a red circle underneath it.\nThings are streamlined quite a bit compared to BG (much like Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition was compared to previous versions).  It's also a positive, but the negative is, well, as awesome as it is to magically throw a battalion's worth of equipment into your stash throughout a long day of wholesale slaughter, and as convenient as it is to sleep off 500+ damage around what must be one magic campfire, it does tap a little bit on the fourth wall. And the 4th Edition style Per Encounter abilities are a little silly :\ (This is really about me not liking 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons).  And the ranger's animal companion can't die (only get knocked out), so I have to roleplay him off as a crazy dog whose nickname is Lucky.\nThe biggest one: PoE doesn't *quite* reach the level of character inspiration that Baldur's Gate had.  I think the voice acting is almost as good, for the most part (and still far, far, far above average), but there's not much of the miniature-giant-space-hamster, Ned (forgot his name) repeatedly talking to you and thanking you for not throwing rocks at him, Jaheira's "Yyess, oh omni-present authority figure?", Jan Jonson's "Don't forget to raaise meee" sense of humor that BG had.  It also has the misfortune of trying to follow Jon Irenicus from BG II, who was an extremely class villain.  Though this villain does have his moments.  And I do have a man-crush on Eder.\nThe :)\nIt has that immersive, deep, playing-a-good-book feel that Baldur's Gate (and all great RPG's) have.  I haven't reached the end yet, but it's all satisfyingly epic so far (just started Act III), and there are a few dialogue choices I find legitimately hard to choose between.\nYour actions have a little more effect on the world and how people treat you than most games of this type, which is really nice and further helps the immersion.\nThe keep is really fun to have.  Even though I make a tremendous amount more on selling equipment than collecting taxes, and it's largely aesthetic, I really like having it.\nThough mostly a negative for me, I suppose there are benefits to the changes made for simplicity's sake (4th Edition stuff), such as not having to spend time prioritizing inventory space.\nIt gets kinda dark at times, in a good way.\nThere are a lot of neat-looking places.  I miss BG II's aesthetic a bit, but still, there are lots of areas and they all look nice.\nSoundtrack's pretty good, which is very important to me.\nAlready thinking about the next playthrough.\nJust to fit in one more BG comment (take a drink): I think Pillars of Eternity would be my favorite RPG if it weren't for Baldur's Gate II.\nHave fun!

Whilst this game attempts to harken back to the "good ole days" of Baldur's Gate and other isometric crpgs, Pillars of Eternity feels bland and suffers from some major game breaking bugs cropping up in each patch cycle.\n\nWith each patch cycle Obsidian makes changes to the stat, ability and buff/debuff mechanics in what is an already convoluted system, not to mention the myriad of bugs that such a cycle brings.   Having to thoroughly read through patch notes to understand what over-the-top changes have been made can be frustrating.  Obsidian also seems to make changes to mechanics and systems that work fine whilst seemingly ignoring broken classes and abilties.\n\nThe combat becomes tedious very quickly, usually involving bottling up your adversaries in a choke point and autoattacking them until dead.  When you do decide to use spells or abilities you will quickly find that a majority of them are completely useless, whilst those that cause stun or knockdowns to be king.\n\nAt those times that you are unable to keep your enemy hemmed in, you will find those carefully crafted tank characters will be next to useless in keeping the enemies of your squishy damage dealers.  The fault here is with the poorly implemented engagement system.  A tank has the ability to 'engage' an enemy and should that enemy leave the area from the tank they will take a hit.  Of course this hit does nothing to actually stop an enemy from casually walking over and making paste of your rogue or wizard.   I won't detail the number of enemy creatures in this game that can just bypass the engagement system by teleporting straight into your group's back ranks and perma-stunning or killing them in two or three hits.  This problem has only gotten worse with the new expansion.\n\nThe itemization for character equipment is dull.  After a lengthy dungeon crawl of tedious fights to find items that are mostly yawn worthy was very disappointing.\n\nThe writing in the game seems to peak and trough.  The companions and their storylines seem to vary from interesting to just mind numbling boring.  The lore itself comes at your thick and fast with exposition upon exposition though with the latter it takes too many liberties by assuming you already know some hidden but integral world lore.  This can affect your conversation choices, though admittedly that is not a big deal as your choices in the end really mean nothing.  The authors are telling a story and be damned if you are going to have really influence on how that is going to be told.\n\nOn a few positive notes the graphics are very good and I absolutely adore the music.

So I believe I've got a great idea of a good game and this is a brilliant game!\n\nFirst off, the customisation of your character at the start is immense.\n\nSecond, much like fable, Mass effect and other RPGs. Your words and choices mean something. But I believe PoE takes the choices to another level!\n\nThirdly I am new to CRPG I have played other ones but found them rather unexcitable. I found for example Baldurs Gate Dark Allience far better then it's PC CRPG older version. Generally due to the PC CRPG version being rather confusing. But PoE is very simple! Also very difficult! It all depends on the difficulty you play the game on and if you enjoy reading the hints/explanations.\n\nPros\n\nGraphics are brilliant, kind of old school with a more recent HD and flair touch\n\nSimple, but can, is challenging and complex 'abit contradictory but you will understand once you play the game\n\nMusic and voices implimented are imersive and brilliant\n\nStorys throughout, even in side quests are amazing 'as far as I've played they have been'\n\nCons\n\nI don't know if this will change but I'm finding the areas we can free roam to be medium sized rather than big? I might just be being picky here, but wanting a little more stuff to do within the roaming areas. But remember in this review I've only been playing for so many hours. So may change later on!\n\nOverall an amazing game! One of my best buys in such a long time!

There, I said it.\n\nFirst of all, let me say that I've been anticipating this game for about 2 years, having been a huge fan of the Baldur's Gate series for many years before that. This isn't a case of the concept being new to me, or that I was expecting an action game. It's not even a bad game. If you're genuinely enjoying this game I'm not here to tell you that you shouldn't. I will share with you, however, why I'm not thrilled.\n\nI have probably spent half of my entire gaming life in the BG series. After playing it so much, and having watched it age, it has become apparent that there are many aspects of the game that could be improved upon. When I think "spiritual succesor to Baldur's Gate released in 2015" I get certain expectations. Expectations I feel were not met.\n\nForemost of all, is that the game is flat out boring. The game fails to create an interesting or immersive world. Too much of the game is presented in written form (i.e. prepare to read a LOT.) I can't say I have a problem with reading, but I found myself being bored often while reading what the game was serving up. I always felt like I was playing a game; it never took me to another place in my mind. All the lore was standard and uninspired. I'd rather it were set in a classic world we know and love as opposed to this hollow one.\n\nIt doesn't help that in Dialogue, you can't tell how much longer the latest uninteresting NPC is going to babble on for.\nToo much of the written content is either wholly unnecessary or could have been presented in a more interesting and visual way. Instead of giving me a mini essay to read on the appearance of the huge sharkwoman warrior, how about making the character models more interesting and expressive? i.e. SHOW me.\n\n**MINOR SPOILER: Another example, when Raedric was offering me the chance to join him, I had lost all interest in the "story" of the quest. All I had to go on was two characters giving speeches. I just wanted him to shut up and for this boring quest to be over. **\n\nWhy did I travel all the way across to the other side of this room just to click on a magnifying glass and read "Rats scurry in between the cracks of the stairs." or something banal like that. The game is littered with these useless nothings.\n\nThe look of the in-game world is bland and uninteresting to me. It reminds me of a cross between Diablo 2 and Icewind Dale 2 in terms of atmosphere. I was never a fan of those games, precisely because they felt "lifeless" to me. Character appearance customization is something RPG gamers typically enjoy. Too many games fail to give us the fun we seek in this regard. The Infinity engine games failed, and so does Pillars.\n\nSpeaking of a lack of improvements: All my old frustrations are still there. Namely characters getting in each other's way during combat, small and claustrophobic areas making for messy gameplay, poor selection of roleplaying options, etc.\n\nIn a visually appealing sense, there is very little upgrade from the old Infinity Engine games. Yes, the graphics are "better." More advanced, smoother. Water looks nice. But there's nothing that's done really well. In a lot of ways, Pillars of Eternity feels like an old game. That's not necessarily a bad thing, I just think there's actually better old games out there. Games that managed to create a visually appealing environment despite graphical limitations.\n\nOne thing games like this always seem to fail in is visual presentation of populated areas. NPCs look particularly stiff (notice there isn't a single patron in the Gilded Vale tavern that's sitting down? WTF?). Oh and the choreographed movement of your party... ugh that's gross! Baldur's Gate actually did it quite well for the time. NPC models seemed more organic. I remember how alive the actual city of Baldur's Gate felt when I was exploring it for the first time. In this, and many other aspects, Baldur's Gate left a lot to the imagination. But it stimulated the imagination and took it in specific directions. Pillars on the other hand, is just dull. Or maybe I'm just getting old and not so easily amused any more.\n\nThere's plenty I find frustrating with the in game mechanics too. Like why can't I use stealth with just one party member? Why is my whole party stealthed? What's the purpose of making the entire party move slower when stealthed? As a seasoned BG player I thought the game mechanics would be fairly intuitive for me, but I haven't been able to figure out the stealth system or some of the decisions that went into making it.\n\nI remember in an interview one of the devs was very enthused about how all the stats would actually matter and be helpful now, and how it would allow for unexpected and interesting character builds. Well, to be fair, the first part of that is kinda true. All the stats matter in certain ways now, which is nice. But I tried to make a smart and wise barbarian the first time I loaded up. Let's just say I had to restart the game.\n\nWhat's the purpose of limiting your party to 2 sets of camping supplies? All it does is make the game less fun for me.\n\nThe party NPCs are just not memorable. Granted, I haven't got very far in their individual quests yet...but here's the thing: I don't really care to either. Baldur's Gate had memorable NPCs that oozed personality.\n\nI could go on but I think that's enough. I may end up finishing the game and putting a lot of hours into it. But that's only because I've waited a long time and there's nothing better. I've had some decent fun on it too, but my initial excitement has waned.","April 9, 2015","false","29.0"," 138 of 259 people (53%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","53","138","259","12","35"

Sometimes when you are walking around, your companions will talk amongst each other, and it is most often a hilarious. One time, the hunter in my group yelled "son of a moosef**ker!" and the mage (who is a very civilized man) became nervous due to her language. There are plenty more hilarious enounters that happen everytime I play.\n\nIf you want the best experience possible, do not look up how to do anything on the internet. If you get stuck in a quest for example, try to figure it out on your own.

After playing it however I noticed the merit of this game in particular.\n\nIf you've ever played an infinity engine game...this game is identical. Its as if they took the infinity engine and just leveled it up graphically and added a few extra moves to it. I was astounded at how it felt, it was like I was playing Baldurs Gate all over again...but then it differed. The primary difference is of course the law and the storyline. The immersion is there,its very good, I can only hope there is a continuation of this type of game. The lore is unique and intriguing, not your everyday thing but still familiar enough to not be too alien. Learning the lore of the game world was rewarding in its own right. Especially when you replay scenes and you actually understand what is going on.\n\nGameplay is also excellent and well balanced in my opinion, the additional difficulties are also there for the veterans or some might say "geeks". There is a ton of customisation in many forms. Simply in character creation there are more options than I've seen in most any game. You select your gender, race, class, background, culture, you select detailed stats, skills..many races have subraces and subcultures and most of these things may have some impact on story progression and interaction with the game world. The balance of your characters statistics affects combat and also interaction...you might end up having a strong focus on combat...only to have difficulty in social interactions. The reverse is also true. Skills also have a large impact, you might have a very unfit mage who falls off a cliff or gets injured because of poor footing, or you could move massive boulders out of your path with raw strength if you are so inclined. The combinations are plentiful and would take many replays to see all the possibilities. If there was ever to be another Baldurs Gate then this was it.  A true spiritual successor.\n\nFor all my bias and the flowery words about it...I still have some issues with it. If I had not played Baldurs Gate, I may not have seen this as a problem...but the interaction with companions was not as satisfying as I'd have liked. It just doesn't delve deep enough. I couldn't at the end of it all say that I'd really bonded with any of them. It was more like we start as strangers and end as comrades...but not really good friends or anything more. In that sense I might as well play it as a solo character without the need for companions. The companions do have their own draw and they are interesting but as mentioned, there is nothing to keep one interested in them. Once you assist them through their own problems they cease to be interesting and you cannot deepen any bonds. Suffice to say they are very limited.\n\nAdditionally I did not enjoy the conclusion to the story, this is my deduction but the story appeared to have a thoroughly atheist agenda and I did not find the conclusion satisfying. Thats all I can say without spoiling anything. The writing is however very good, dialogue as well.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the best games to grace the monitors of the gaming populace of this decade. I heartily recommend it.","April 13, 2015","true","172.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I never played Baldur's gate, but I am a massive RPG and medieval fantasy enthusiest. Anything with swords, castles, knights and magic makes me squeal with delight, and this game is a gods send for someone looking for a new game to get immersed into.\n\nFor starters the art is absolutely beautiful. It has a really unique and interesting feel to it that I thought I wouldn't enjoy at first, but it compliments the feel and atmosphere of the game very well. The environements are realistic and detailed as well.\n\nWhere there is voice acting in the game it is good. It doesnt feel like a low budget voice actor who is putting cliche emotion into their characters (see: Lichdom Battle mage). The character creation is quite interesting, giving lore right away about the interesting cultures and combinations of classes available to play.\n\nThe combat is the only thing I find a little bit lacking because it feels a little bit slow and can get sort of tedious after a while. But what it falls short of in combat it makes up for in content. This game has a massive amount of lore. There are backstories for practically everything, and lots of interesting reading to be done to really immerse yourself into the world of Pillars of Eternity. This is the part that I love the most because in my opinion for a fantasy world to be good, it needs to have a sense of rich lore and immersion. This game does exactly that.\n\nIf you are like me and a solid 95% of your steam games are fantasy/medieval themed and you love the fantasy genre, buy this game. It is worth every penny and I seriously hope I can find more games that are this rich in lore and history in the future.\n\nTL;DR Great fantasy game, worth every penny.","May 10, 2015","true","24.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

First, it was hyped by middle-aged men wishing to reclaim their glory days of playing Baldur's Gate. Second, it was made by Obsidian. Third, it's a Kickstarter game (which annoyingly they don't let you forget). And finally, it's made on the Unity engine or some variation therof. However despite all these worries Pillars of Eternity is one of the best RPGs I have played in the last ten years. If you liked Dragon Age Origins, you'll really like this game (which is my only comparison since I've never played Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale).\n\nThis isn't an MMO, but I still feel like Pillars of Eternity does everything correct what all MMOs do wrong, and I really wish MMOs were this complicated today. I love that it takes me 5-10 minutes to level up one character the reload a save when I realize what I picked didn't work as well as I hoped. This kind of learning curve that makes you want to learn and play is hard to pull off these days, but Pillars does it so well. The story is easily on the level of early Final Fantasy games, except unlike Final Fantasy it actually explains what's going on instead of leaving it to your 'imagination,' which I call lazy story telling. Good on Pillars!\n\nI'm also amazed at the customizability of the difficulty. Why can't all games do this? It seems that so many games today want to take away your freedom for every little option, but Pillars allows you to blast through it so easily that it may as well be a Telltale Game or make it so difficult you can't even beat the prologue unless you're used to the D&D level of thought behind each attack.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that has many reasons to play and keep playing with (as far as I know) a brand new fantasy world that doesn't rely on old names and old characters then Pillars of Eternity is definitely the game to buy.\n\nAs a final note, I now have a list of two games I can say are successful Kickstarters: Shovel Knight and Pillars of Eternity!","January 14","true","29.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Lots of choices in this game, the character development is probably my favorite part. Usually you have 4 approaches to situations instead of the usual two (good/evil).\n\nThere is a lot of reading, there's excellent voice acting, too, but most of the story unfolds through text. You'll be talking to a lot of NPCs and to your teammates along the way, much like Mass Effect, to find out their backgrounds and sometimes what they think about the situation at  hand.\n\nThe environments are pretty standard fantasy: castle towns, woods, dungeons, caves, but everything seems to have  a history and a place in the world, which gives me a Skyrim or WoW level of immersion. However it's more like a fantasy novel, your imagination does half of the work, there isn't much on-screen but the world feels deep.\n\nIt's not an easy game, this isn't Diablo, it's like WoW if you controlled a full party all by yourself. You have to manage 6 group members: tank, dps, healing & buffs. Pause to give commands, unpause to watch the action, then pause again to adjust strategy. It can feel slow and difficult, but not painful like Dark Souls. Every fight can pose a challenge, but once you get a full party of 6 you have lots of abilities (maybe too many, I think the priest has about 20-30 spells, split into levels of power, each doing something specific like increasing resist to fear, for example).\n\nI run with 2 tanks, 1 priest, 1 wizard, and 2 buff/ranged support. You'll find what works for you and you stick with it! Personally I open with a volley of ranged fire if possible, buff the party, make sure my tanks are in position to intercept, cast AOE in front of the tanks, and then try keep the dangerous enemies knocked over for as much of the fight as possible.","May 6, 2015","true","72.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The stories are excellent, the environments are beautiful, the music is superb, the effects are gorgeous without being overpowering, the combat system feels natural, the spells and abilities are very easy to understand, and it all works together to bring to life a world of magic, mystery, danger, intrigue, and adventure.\n\nOne of the things that really struck me was the fact that this game, while definitely appropriate for kids (tweens and teenagers), is so obviously geared toward adults. There's some mature content, but it's not over the top or "in your face", it's just the right amount of serious for more mature gamers to enjoy things without feeling like they're taking part in some guilty pleasure.  I am also really impressed with the sheer amount of writing involved in this game. There are storybooks, history books, reference books, journals, and diaries, not to mention the scripted interactions, companion banter, and the unique stories of characters with certain gold nameplates which adds to bringing the world to life.\n\nAnother thing that I really like is the use of links in the UI. Certain keywords appear similarly to URL tags in web pages, you mouse over those words and you get a tooltip explaining what that word means in context. This makes understanding spells and abilities very easy which makes enjoying the game very accessible to those who are probably not as familiar as some of us when it comes to fantasy RPGs. Kudos to the team at Obsidian for catering to more than hard-core RPG fans.\n\nThe last thing I'll talk about is the Linux support: It's excellent! After Divinity: Original Sin I felt really disappointed in how Linux support was handled (it came over a year later and only in the "Enhanced Edition") and didn't have high hopes for yet another game funded by Kickstarter burning me and other Linux users. I was very happy to be proven wrong by Obsidian, to say the least. I didn't have to do anything special to get the game to run, didn't need to avoid certain graphics settings, none of that. The game just works.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who's even the least bit curious about fantasy RPGs and especially to those who are fans of the Baldur's Gate series. If you're a beginner with these types of games, Obsidian's development team thought about you and included a "Story Time" difficulty so that you can focus more on the story and less on being punished in combat. There's no excuse, the game isn't "too hard" and all of the barriers to understanding how things work in previous games have been considered and fixed in Pillars of Eternity.

No this is not Diablo light.  That would be Torchlight 2, which some would argue has now made Diablo 3 into Torchlight Light.  This is a game that is going to be closer to Fallout/Skyrim than it is going to be to Diablo.\n\nIn it you control a party of heroes with a fully customizable adventure from what missions you choose, what results you pick, dialogue that effects how people interact with you, fully customizable 6-member party, fully customizable classes and simple and intuitive controls.\n\nThe game is not beautiful.  I'm certain this game isn't even in HD.  But that shouldn't dissuade you from giving this mentally handicapped game a try, it's a lot of fun.\n\nARE YOU INTO CRAFTING?  Yes, it has crafting.  And much like similar titles you gain experience through just about every single thing you do (except for walking because that would be really dumb).  Unlocked a door, awesome level up.  Better put more points in that door unlocking so I can get more experience from unlocking doors!\n\nIt is truly a choose your own adventure game that you can play many many times with differing results.  In my first playthrough I played the role of the warmonger running around sweeping down enemies.  In my second playthrough I'm peacefully moving around looking for middle ground solutions to resolve everyone's issues.\n\nThe biggest downside to the game is that you can't 100% it.  Apparently simply buying it doesn't mean you support the game.  Apparently only people who contributed to the initial kickstarter campaign are allowed to 100% the game.

BG1 was good but not great whereas BG2 is truly epic. BG1 was more condensed with less imaginative locations, fewer epic tales, a main story that is not quite as well told and a villain who is not quite a well fleshed out. I felt much like that in Pillars. The locations, dungeons, monsters and so forth were well done but felt a bit generic at times. There were some good quests but very few I felt were memorable. Companions were there but the vast majority either weren't interesting or were under-developed. They could have done so much more with some of these guys. Itemization wasn't very good and I never did ooh and aah over any new piece of equipment.\n\nNow besides this being a somewhat generic RPG, I really had difficulty in two areas that probably hindered my enjoyment of the game more than any others: combat and plot logic.\n\nLet's take the last one first. I don't think the plot was particularly well told at times and there's a reveal by a major character at the very, very end that I can't even remember seeing before Act 3. The game kept trying to force me into caring about a plot line in a past life that I couldn't give two shakes about. It's like the game kept trying to say "YOU WILL CARE" all the while giving me dialog options that said "basically, I don't care". Thus the plot and character motivations are very uneven. Am I undertaking this quest to save the children? For my now-dead God? For my sanity? For my past? There's not just one motivation that the game allows you to stay with and thus your choices seem contrived.\n\nCombat mechanics and itemization were also not well explained and I think I was seriously missing some tactical options because I didn't understand them. Spells and skills tended not to fire and I have no idea why. Vulnerabilities and counters to strengths I never did figure out. Given the sheer amount of combat in the game, I know this hindered my enjoyment of PoE. I never could figure out the synergies within a particular class, never mind party synergies. It's a combat system that has potential but it needs a lot more explaining and some simplification. I've been able grasp every different version of D&Ds combat but I found this just a bit too obtuse to really enjoy. Needless to say, I rezzed a lot of characters. :-)\n\nNone of this means the game was bad. These are just the points that hindered my enjoyment of it. So what worked right? Well, it's the closest thing to an Infinity Engine game that we've seen in a decade. The art style is beautiful. The writing is excellent. The plot isn't bad - just occasionally poorly explained. The world itself is kind of neat. You get a cool keep to rebuild. There are some good dungeons. There's a lot of just solid RPG gameplay and even with the above problems I was compelled to see the next area, the next level and finish the next quest. There's plenty of side quests and they don't always turn out like you anticipate. There are plenty of opportunities to use different skills. It's just a very solid RPG, one that is good enough to overcome the issues I've had with it.\n\nIt doesn't have the same emotional pull of Planescape Torment, the great character arc of KOTOR, the world-building goodness of Skyrim, the sheer epic scale of Baldur's Gate II or the setting and story of Ultima 7. It doesn't hold a candle to the Fallout series, have the wonderful combat of Divinity Original Sin, the story and universe of Mass Effect, the grim characters of The Witcher or the wonderful emotional quest choices of Dragon's Age.\n\nBut just because it's not a classic doesn't mean it's not good. Being merely good isn't a sin, either. So if you're a RPG fan, you're probably going to like this and thus I'd recommend it.\n\n...\n\nEDIT: I've now played through the game again with the expansions. That's more than 100 hours in PoE. I feel the exact same way about the game. Combat is still obtuse. The plot is still uneven. The game is still good. 'Nuff said.","March 30, 2015","true","110.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The writing and story in this game is unparalled, in plenty of games where I am never too interested in the story and am skipping over all the text, I actually feel compelled to read every little tidbit about the lore and history of the world, as it really draws me in. I may only have 6 hours in the game so far, but that is really a testament as to how deep this game draws you in!\n\nMade by Obsidian (Fallout NV, KoTor, among others) on kickstarter (perhaps why I had never heard of this game until now), it is a well thought out, sometimes complex (but not overwhelmingly so, everything is explained very well in tooltips) old school party RPG. However the complexity lends itself to variety, in all the classes, abilities, weapons, spells, so that no two playthroughs will be the same, even if you are using exactly the same class as last time.\n\nThe combat, is first and foremost really really fun. As complex as it is, I never felt like I didn't know what I was doing, and after getting used to it, pulling of really awesome combos of spells and attacks is really satisfying, and I never felt like the game was unfair, any mistakes were made by me, and I learnt from those, for the next fight.\n\nI would recommend anyone who is a fan of RPGs in general and good storytelling. Is the game worth it's full price? Hell yes. Did I pay full price for it? .....

YES!\n\nThis is the game I waited for so many years. If you miss such CRPGs like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, you will love this game!\n\nUpdated:\n\nAfter playing this game for 20+ hours I only managed to finish the first act, and not because the main quest is long and boring, I was distracted by the great number of secondary quests which are as much interesting as the main story and less cliche. In this game you don't need to go and kill 10 rabbits to get a reputation from some guy. The story here is deep and catch you till the end. As you play you feel that you have much more freedom than in some of the modern RPG. Your choices aren't so evident, most of the times you can't say if it's going to add you the certain reputation or not. You choose by your concious (or your character's). I love how much of in control you feel.\n\nIt feels like Baldur's Gate by the look of it and it's game mechanics, but it also feels modern, bringing CRPG to the new level. Any character can equip any item, but some classes will handle those items better than others. I love how instead of DnD alignment system they added their own personality system that depends on your choices in game. Like punching people? People will call you aggressive. Or maybe your character prefers diplomatic solution. All those characteristics also open more choices during dialogs.\n\nThis game is not ideal, it still have some bugs, which I hope will be fixed soon. Your stronghold feels kinda useless, at first I was quite excited and spent much money to build it up, but then it almost gave me nothing and you want more from it. Your companions are great, they are interesting and each has their own story, but they don't have much impact on your story, and maybe I spoiled by BioWare games, but you don't feel so bound to them, they are your companions, not friends. There are no fightings between them like there was between Viconia and Keldorn. You can't romance them too.\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ Freedom of choices\n+ Great secondary quests\n+ Huge beautiful and interesting world\n+ Roleplay\n+ The gameplay you know from BG series, but now it's even better!\n\nCons:\n\n- Stronghold that you don't really need\n- Your companions are interesting guys but they have almost no impact on the story\n- Some minor bugs","March 26, 2015","true","24.3"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","14","24","2","0"

His battalion of course had a satisfied and candid way about them. They all wore read badges under their real badges that read Simian.Simian.\n\nThey were not die hard for Simian, they were "bufftard". For the biggest part of their childhoods they had worn shackles and now those scaly mistresses were vanquished! Bufftard was the only way to feel in this new world. Simian sold his symbolism for cynical and satisfied undercarriage loyalty. He was a parent and he was also a further friend.\n\nSimian stood on the front line dirt formal, the line at which all front line Captains would stand and address on. While the spit literally flew from his mouth yelling crass crass crass, Simian knew that he was facing a court marshall. He did not care as he raised his club above his head and began chuckling. His call of defiance was met by his solitary friendly brother soldiers. They all raised they 41 caliber Sedric 1974 Full Auto Streaming " Slack Sacks" in unison.\n\nThere were troubled looks on no one's faces as Simian rotated towards the advancing lines and yelled, "tracer bullets!"\n\nAt that order all his brothers in arms pulled a single Slack Sack shell from their ammo pelts. They slammed the tracers neat and snug into the trap door mechanisms of their repeater arms.\n\nSimian placed his old little club on the Portro line and pulled up his own drinking can to his lips and took a big swig of limbs juice. They had passed through a town six weeks before that had blasted out that wondrous sauce by the lake full. A single drop would spurt growths of energy in any man that had the privilege of drinking. Simian had saved the liquid salve for this very occasion when he knew that the courage of his convictions would be tested. He did not think it bravery a drink; Simian thought it privilege juice. The privilege of every friend he stood by now and felt akin to.\n\nEvery man and woman in his arsenal of ravaged warriors took severe drinks of their own limbs juice and returned to checking their weapons for readiness to fire.\n\nAs they readied the energy from the bubbling spice belted through their bodies and ravaged their brains with a pride known only to the Accepted Tactical Survey Commission (also known as the ATSC Royal Dismount Service).\n\nA pauper in the town of Sidelamp had given the soldiers nothing to eat as they marched their dusty boots through that sleepy town. However, he did give them something much more useful. He gave them a dusty nights watch over their tired and battle wary bodies.\n\nPauper's name was Delgano and he was covered from head to toe in Swaddling furs and rags. The night's dust had covered all his furs with a fierce and peaceful blackness that reminded Simian of an instructor he had battled years back.\n\nIn those earlier times Simian had fought to hold his little club from time to time, without the fear of his upper officer's waxed fists. The Delgano like instructor slammed both fists deep into the wax cans and pulled forth two readied punishment hands. Simian and the instructor battled for 70 minutes in the Rye fields before time was called. For his bravery Simian was aloud to carry the little club no more. This was customary of the C&S division of any ascending officer candidate.\n\nAs he lay in the squared pen of Delgano's, Large Night restlessly watched for the pauper's form in the night air. Over the wooden slats he finally caught an eye of the darkened pauper and smiled large and full. Delgano returned the look with a shake of embarrassment. Who was HE to take such a kind gesture from a Royal Forward C&S Captain?\n\nThe next morning Simian looked over the fence and only found a pile of moldering rags. His Menders focused on the fine pile and did not understand what had happened. It was then that Large Night Captain of the Forward C&S awoke and told the tale of the night. They all forgave the pauper Delgano and continued on their way knowing that the nights air and care that that Darkened pauper had bestowed had restored their fighting hearts.\n\nRain water began to settle on the tired guns of the battalions front line. Not a drop was spared in giving a refreshing and much needed break from the desert dust on the front line.\n\nThe tracer bullets were readied and waiting and Simian had piled on a steaming ammunition tray for the other Bombers. "Crass!"\n\nSimian reminiscenced in his mind about how many times now it had been that he had Stood facing the Portro line and had felt the rain blast back his locks. He remembered basic training how his drill instructor wanted to tie his hair back for him but he refused. He was considered "Wash Out Ready" for that judgement.\n\nHe laughed back thinking about all the times he had dropped that little club perfectly parallel on the Portro line. Post fax had lead to this point. Although he (Simian) carried two cans of wax as was basic operating issue for a Captain of his rank, he had Never opened either in punishment.\n\nAll his brother soldiers steeped down metaphorically at his boot length and looked straight up at their Captain. They had been Waxed by him but never in punishment only in gratitude.\n\n"ALL AND GO FORWARD 1 STEP", Cried Large Night as he advanced forward on Simian's left flank. The enemy was still rushing forward without clanking of metal, which was never a tried sign.\n\nLieutenant Anna Jeremy looked at Large Night knowingly and he smiled back that big smile. This was it and they knew but nobody was around to know?\n\nHe remembered back on the big mortar in basic training. It was so big that a standard soldier couldn't look around it. It was from the chronicled Cone Stape Standoff and was outlawed for all but ceremony. That's the day he first saw Simian simmering in a fine clad of punishment.\n\nWhips and Rails were all about Simians body that day. He was a bloody ♥♥♥♥ing mess and Poncey knew it. He wanted to be a Back Track Albrighter but after seeing Simians defiance he reenlisted that very day.\n\nLarge Night yelled. " Not a cough young ones, don't show any disdignity on this battlefield."\n\nSimian singled and Large Nite understood. The soldiers gasped as they looked down from there Slack Sacks and saw Large Nite erased the Portro line and re-address it in a Perpendicular Calvin Full on Split line.\n\nAt that second the soldiers split and became to squads and the rain fell and they laughed.\n\nSimian and his fighting Forward Spitnas Soldiers were doing this for them to hell with railing rules and forward lines.\n\n"Attack,with fists!" Cried Simian.\n\nFrom eight military paces to lateral north were the Forward Crimson Calvary service watching Simian touching off and keeping his men and women ready for zeal.\n\nAdmiral Ronolst Dradon was on sanctioned caravan with the Forward CC and pulled out his "block". He put it to his eye and could see Simian's rustic and animated face up close through the shiner lens and saw Large Night/s fists horizontally aligned with the ground.\n\n" Captain Gom, will you give this weary pack of hand picked dogs a treaded horse gallop of support?" Questioned the Admiral.\n\n"My orders are to watch and wait for a reasoned soldier insubordination, to mark it and leave. Every one of those brave soldiers will die today sir. It was decided by the Pland Council about a week ago."\n\n" May the sacred winds guide their sentry rifles" soothed Admiral.\n\n","April 25, 2015","true","87.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swixel/recommended/291650/","swixel","Swixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swixel/","1449 products in account","I've done my best to avoid spoilers in this, I don't think there are any, as the only name I've dropped from in the game is mentioned at the start (and I mean in the very start).\n\nInterface and Organisation\nThe game's UI is clean, sensible in design, and there are divisions between the "musts" and the "wants" and the "boy that'd be nice".  For "questing" this is a three part division, with the "Quests" being what you MUST do to complete the game, and two lesser categories below.  (This only gets confusing when you need to appease some group and it isn't a quest; in context it makes sense, but you need to stay on the ball.)\n\nGame Length:\nThe length of the game is also nothing short of fantastic.  You can choose to spend forever playing this game (my first run took 30 hours on Path of the Damned, Expert, Iron Mode and I didn't attempt to complete every quest or search for much in the third act), or you can blast through it with a sensible class designed to speed run in 4-6 hours (for the purposes of, say, resting less than 10 times as an achievement, or killing less than 175 monsters, while simultaneously going for Solo and Triple Crown Solo achievements).  Being able to adapt to the length this much is clearly beneficial.\n\nGame Depth\nThe items, the companions, the general conversational style of the game is both shocking and awesome.  The range of linguistic styles employed is, upon closer examination, significantly more limited than you'd have thought (which, truthfully, is to be expected given the size of the team), but the way in which they present themselves masks how small the team is, and gives a richer, deeper, gameplay, including tying certain linguistic norms to certain groups (i.e. dwarves speak differently to humans, not so much in phonetics/phonology (sound) , in as much as the lexical choices (syntax and thus semantics)).\n\nAlignments and Behavioural choices\nPerhaps the most intersting part of the game from an interpersonal/social perspective is your choice to go about your business as a nice person (forgiving, etc.), or to adopt what might be kindly described as a sociopathic rampage (with no feeling, just doing your thing).  I'm not suggesting a Hotline Miami style bloodbath (though you can attack just about anyone you want), nor am I suggesting you can complete the game without killing anyone or anything; I'm simply suggesting that there's always a plan A and a plan B (kill or talk them down).  You can even keep the murder to a minimum (and, in fact, must, if you want one of the achievements -- at least in that run).  The downside to going with "Plan B" (murder murder murder) is that sometimes you'll find your characters (your hero or the companions) dislike what you're doing.  It will impact their abilities to fight (or heal) unless you take a specific attribute.  So if you're the sort of short tempered "must kill" type when things go sideways, the ability to do this without severe penalty is great; if you're the type of person who realises how damn powerful that extra non-class attribute is, then you'll realise the penalty is pretty severe (depending on how you choose to play it is or isn't).  I guess the point is that it's well balanced in this sense, and they obviously put in some good work here.\n\n\nThe TERRIBLE Bugs (without spoilers):\nIf you're someone who habitually double clicks things without needs to, you've no doubt hit the clothing bug.  I'm not, so I didn't, so I'm not sure if I should file this under the "why are you doing this?" pile or the "gamebreaking bug" pile.  Help is on the way with a patch due to land sometime soon.  Either way, I hope you learned your lesson.\n\nThe Raedric crash/lockup on changing tiles is another bug.  There's a tentative fix involving modifying your save slightly (removing files from an archived file) which sorts it out, but requires you to re-run an area.  My second complete run through the game didn't trigger this so perhaps there's something weird going on.  Either way, I believe this is also being addressed.\n\nThere are some graphical bugs which can happen if you alt-tab a whole lot while playing.  Again, could be system related, could just be that alt-tabbing during a game is an awful idea, and it could be chance.  Restarting the application (i.e. not the run, the game's binary file) fixes these.\n\nOther CommentsThe game is one which requires a lot of talking to NPCs, to your companions, and sitting through (unskippable) cutscenes.  While this initially irritated me (namely after a bug made me repeat things), the cutscenes are important to the story, and eventually you'll find yourself surrendering to the particle effect-driven pretty narrative.\n\nRecommendationsIf you like cRPGs, if you like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Icewind Dale (etc., etc.), you should consider this game.  It's the first in quite some time I've enjoyed in this way.  If you're coming from something like Diablo then you probably won't enjoy it as much, as the game is truer to the tabletop style of gameplay, and relies far less on the "all must die" emphasis Diablo has is its franchise.  For those on the fence I'd say this game is good, and on the lower difficulties is no doubt forgiving.  For those looking for a hardcore, ultra-brutal, unforgiving experience, there's also the Path of the Damned difficulty, which, when coupled with Expert mode and Iron Mode, means you'll be playing the game almost like a rogue-like (there's a single save, it'll let you take the last one, even if you die).\n\nQuick BreakdownGraphically it's very pretty, somewhat excessively for a cRPG, which in turn adds a level of depth supporting the rich lore.\nLore is well constructed (though, like all lores, it has holes); it adds depth to those who choose to read it.\nControls are fine, cRPG-like, and as expected.  There are some nagging issues with multi-monitors (mouse capture is lost from time to time).  You can fix this with an alt-tab out then back in, though this can, on rare occasion, cause graphical issues.\nStoryline is interesting, and without giving away details there will be those who don't like the ending (though isn't that always the case?).  It doesn't disappoint if you read it all.\nMain Hero's Role is perhaps the most interesting I've seen in quite some time too.  You are both "just someone" and "not someone", and without spoilers it's hard to explain.  Perhaps the best way is to suggest you are not the "great man" of history, but rather someone thrust into the role by circumstances (and chance), right at the beginning (at the end of the "tutorial" style phase, so you see the change).","March 31, 2015","true","36.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I watched my father play it and gave it a try myself (as good as a six-year-old could, at least) and I remember being so enraptured by the story and universe. Aside from the lore of Warcraft, it was Baldur’s Gate that helped shape my understanding of high fantasy--not Lord of the Rings, as many people seem surprised by.\n\nSince then, the original developers of Baldur’s Gate have shuffled around the past few years, some of them sticking together, others branching out on their own projects, though it seems to be common to equate Obsidian Entertainment as the most direct successor of the original Black Isle Studios. Obsidian’s known for some pretty high profile stuff in recent years: South Park: The Stick of Truth; Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II; Fallout: New Vegas (and, in a past life, the original two Fallout games), among others.\n\n...\n\nI definitely recommend Pillars of Eternity to any and all gamers, especially those who have been yearning for an RPG like the good ol’ days. Though it was made with a target audience in mind, the fact that this game is easily one of the best games of 2015 thus far, but its achievements and what it represents for Kickstarter projects, crowdfunding, and honoring quality and the passion of game development, as well as the amount of power we gamers have, keeping Obsidian afloat in what seemed to be a last ditch fundraising effort… this is one for the history books.\n\nI’d be so bold as to say that Pillars of Eternity is the cRPG equivalent to Skyrim: it exhibits mastery, charm, and a standard of excellence that ought to make Obsidian proud, and that other developers should strive for.","April 26, 2015","true","46.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I even read some of the in-game books, unlike in Elder Scrolls games.\n+ Fantastic companion voice dialog.\n+ Morally ambiguous decisions and factions.\n+ It's stable. I've had it crash on me once in 45+ hours of play.\n+ Just an addictive and rewarding play experience.\n+ Lots of game for your money. I'm 45 hours in, and estimate that I'm less than halfway done. And there are chacter classes I haven't even tried yet.\n\nBad:\n- Terrible framerates and loading times.\n- Not enough graphics settings.\n- Not nearly enough variability in terms of character and gear appearence.\n- NPCs don't feel real, They don't follow daily routines, just stand in the same place forever.\n- Obnoxious kickstarter-related content.\n- Your party members will sometimes get stuck or wander away from battles at the worst times.\n\nOverall, it's a very good game that could be made into an excellent game if more work is put into optimization. This is 2016, I shouldn't need to sit through a 15 second loading screen just to enter a one-room hut, and then again when I exit. And a system that can run Skyrim smoothly shouldn't struggle to achieve 30fps with this game. I'm hoping for a good optimization patch. There should also be an option to disable kickstarter content, because the game world is infested with NPCs that can't talk, and tombstones with immersion-destroying text. With all it's flaws, though, I still think it's fun as hell.","January 31","true","54.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The world calls out to be explored.\n- The main plot is mature and engaging, the world well built, the lore rich and deep. More in line with Planescape: Torment than BG or Neverwinter Nights.\n- Voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag (Grieving Mother, Kana, Aloth), but mostly good (Eder, Sagani, Durance, Lady Webb).\n- OMG moments, like entering Gilded Vale for the first time, or talking to Uscgrim or the animancy hearing at the Duc's.\n- Chanter's 'The Thunder Rolled like Waves on Black Seas' invoked that badass feeling no other iso game ever did for me.\n\n\nCons:\n- Combat may get boring after a while, as the vast majority of encounters feel repetetive. You gain access to several classes and a crapload of abilities, but in the end it all makes little to no difference on the actual gameplay. Sometimes less is more. Original Sin it isn't.\n- The engagement mechanic, coupled with terrible pathfinding, dumb collisions and your own party members blocking each other is more of an annoyance than anything else.\n- Random difficulty spikes, eg. Sky Dragon or the final fight...\n- ... yet paralysis/petrificacion + spell nuke will easily win every boss fight within seconds.\n- Certain parts of the dialogue tree are voiced while others are not. Additionally you get a lot of written storytelling in between, which is totally ignored by the voice actors. The game can't really decide whether you should be reading or listening, and this in turn breaks immersion a lot.\n- A minor gripe, which is the Kickstarter content, eg. meaningless NPCs stories and cheesy tombstone memorials. Makes you ignore most yellow NPCs after a while.\n- The Keep feels like an afterthought.\n- Bugs.\n\nPlayed it twice, the first time on hard but got stuck in the final dungeon due to a bug. Second time on normal+expert mode. Overall an enjoyable experience, writing and atmosphere is where the game really shines, while what it lacks is some meaningful, well designed combat encounters. Never been a fan of the BG series, so I'd place it before BG1 and BG2, but certainly after PS:T.\n\nVerdict: 8/10","January 13","true","240.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The look is just gorgeous and it takes you back to the younger days of PC gaming where the games were hand drawn and they had "a soul" (no pun intended). The gameplay is just right - meaning it IS hard and you will be punished for blindly running into the fights. However, it's not as clunky as the fights in Baldur's gate were, and having the fights in real time instead of turn-based makes it even better.\n\nPausing the fight is a must and there's no way you can kill anything in a group larger than 2 without some tactics. Especially in tight areas or smaller rooms where you can't fit your whole party. There's a decent number of side-quests and lore, as well as side-characters that have their own stories to discover. The only remark I have are the long loading screens you encounter when you leave/enter each zone. But it's not a big deal.\n\nIf you consider yourself a RPG lover, and you want a huge nostalgia fix at the same time, just stop reading this already and get the game.","April 1, 2015","true","28.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

For example: Animancy is the study of spirits. Animancers try to find the cure to the disease that plaque Dyrwood. But it is also very close to necromancy. When do the deeds they make to further the study into the disease get 'evil'?\n- Black & White text- based scenes\n- Weapon enchanting, crafting from the loot/herbs\n- New ruleset (non D&D).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordbalder/recommended/291650/","lordbalder","Balder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordbalder/","927 products in account","Well, hello...\nI grew up playing BioWare's fantastic RPG titles... Baldur's Gate was my favourite game for a very long time.\n\n--- Might contain mild spoilers ---\n\nNow, for Pillars of Eternity... It is a nice game with quite a few problems, so I'll try to summarize my whole experience...\n\nWhen I started playing it, aside from strong feeling of nostalgia I was stunned by beautiful background graphics (characters are pretty low quality for today's standards, but they do the job)... Interface design is also fantastic...\nAnyway, I was immersed in game, story was interesting, depressive town of Gilded Vale was... well, depressing, and I really felt that... I started doing all the quests (as I normally do), and enjoyed it...\n\nThat changed, and after some time the whole game became a kind of chore... I wasn't as immersed as at the beginning, I stopped caring for characters... i.e. I really cared of Calisca and her sister and I generally liked stories of characters in Gilded Vale... After that, I didn't feel that vibe... I probably don't have enough time (as I had 10-15 years ago) to be immersed in the game for that long, but I played Witcher 3 for about 120 hours, and enjoyed every second of it...\n\nOd Nua is interesting idea, but I didn't find it to be very important... Endless Paths are just to Hack-n-Slashy for this type of game (and combat), I didn't like it... And that is another problem of this game; It is full of uninteresting and unimportant combat. Some encounters are very easy, and have no point both storywise and for gameplay, but are there to build up playing hours, and then some of them are so hard that it is impossible to complete them (ie when you enter the last fight location, you won't be able to go back and build up your levels, and the last combat is really, really hard... it's ridiculous).\n\nTalking about combat, I didn't find special abilities to be special at all... Aside from healing and summoning spells... Damage spells are ok, but you can't use them too often...\n\nI really liked other adventurers, and their personalities... Side quests are hit and miss... The main quest starts really strong, but ends up being... well, not as good as the beginning...\n\n"Reading" souls can be frustrating from time to time... It is often written in some kind of riddles or in strange sentences, that I needed a lot of effort to understand them... Or I just don't have as much patience... It has it's strengths; it shows that it is not so easy to read souls, and shows the chaos that is building up in his head, but it was just too hard, sometimes... Of course, for native English speaker, this is probably not a problem...\n\nAnother problem is tied to travel times... Not so important, generally, but it really damage up immersion... When travelling from location to location that are one next to the other you'll need i.e. 4 (or more) hours... That is not a problem as it is (those to locations might be that far away)... But then, in one instance, you'll actually enter underground tunnel in one location and exit it in another... In about 2 minutes, when not fighting... As I said, not so important, but hurts the immersion...\n\nWhen I speak about locations, it is hard not to talk about loading screens that take too much time... Every little house that you want to enter in game, will take tenish seconds of your time to load... And for you to realise there is nothing in there... And now back, loading the location where you are...\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nVerdict:\nAlthough I wrote many problems about Pillars of Eternity, I think it is a nice game... A lot of these problems that I have now are probably tied to my subjective opinion, and the fact that I don't have as much time as I had when I played Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, etc... Then, again, I liked some parts, mostly because of nostalgia, but we're all very subjective xD\n\nAnyway, my final rating would be... 6.5/10","October 27, 2015","true","29.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

From here, you pursue your Nemesis across the realm in an attempt to find meaning and answer.\n\nAt times, Pillars is completely brilliant. The first 1 1/2 acts of the game is some of the best I've played. The story is riveting, the characters are interesting, the combat is complex and there's promise of some cool upcoming features that are hinted at in these early segments.\n\nUnfortunately, the game mostly falls apart about halfway through Act II. The game loses any semblance of challenge it had, the story and characters and insane amount of side-quests all kinda boggle among themselves and the writing drops a few notches. You'll likely find yourself starting to get bored nearing the end of Act II (also right when I hit the level cap) and rush your way through Acts III and IV.\n\nThere are some cool features that I was excited about that don't seem to go anywhere. Building your own keep was a cool idea I haven't seen implemented anywhere in a game like this, but it actually does absolutely nothing in the game. Money is pretty infinite by the time you start building your keep. At that point, it's just time-gated. You can take prisoners.. but why? They just sit there doing nothing, occasionally offering bribes to be released. The crafting and enchanting systems are useless. Consumables are a joke (often taking longer to consume than they heal or buff). Some spells are ridiculously overpowered (Level 5 mage Charm is insanely powerful).\n\nEven with all of this, I highly recommend this game. The visuals are fun, the characters and plot are largely interesting. The dialogue paths numerous and the endings multiple. The combat in the first half of the game is near perfect until you start getting overpowered.\n\nTl;dr: Pillars of Eternity has a slew of great ideas, some poorly or half implemented. But the core gameplay is amazing, the story is fantastic and the characters are interesting. The game is also 65+ hours long (supposedly 80-90 if you do all the content, but I rushed Act III and didn't do much in the way of side quests) and has a ton of content.

In the end, I came back to it a year later, got the expansion season pass and enjoyed it, but to do so, I had to forget my hopes and expectations and approach it as a new game again.  It was easier to do this when I knew the things I hated about it and could make adjustments (not playing as a wizard for my main character, and focusing on the story vs the combat)\n\nEven though the game captures the look and feel of an infinity engine game, they chose to create a new game system instead of liscensing the D&D or some other popular system, and this was the primary source of my frustration.  In particular, the new system is very limited in the spell selection of both wis and int casters compared to the baldur's gate games.\n\nThe other thing I dislike about the new system is that rogue backstabing is nearly impossible to pull off, and even when you do, the results are underwhelming for the effort.  Part of it is that even with stealth maxed for your level, it is nearly impossible to sneak close enough to anything to do a backstab, and when you do, the multiplier is only something like 1.5 or 2x, and it is never enough to outright kill anything that is not incredibly weak compared to you.\n\nThe stronghold was also a disapointment.  Obsidian did a pretty good job with the stronghold in NWN2, so I had high hopes for the implimentation in this, and they did have some interesting ideas, but they just felt rushed or unfinihsed.  Its not so much that the stronghold is bad, its just not as good as it could have been, and not as good as what they did with NWN2.\n\nNow for the good points.\nThe story is different and interesting with a lot of twists I did not see coming.  The first part of the game is pretty slow going as you are getting acquinted with the world it is set in, but things really start to pick up once you get to the main city.  I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that the story was good enough to me that it was worth getting past the negatives I listed to enjoy it. The story and quests in the expansion (Whitmarch) are also very well done, and the expansion is well worth getting if you decide to get the game.\n\nI'm gonna give it a positive rating, but for anyone who has not played the Baldur's Gate or Neverwiner Nights series, I would highly recomend any of those over this, and I would also recomend Dragon Age: Origins and Awakening over this (but skip Dragon Age 2, that game is a steaming pile of rubbish).\n\nTLDR: Great story, disapointing game mechanisms.","May 22","true","192.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

An entire section could be devoted to the mechanics but I will simply say they are great in my opinion.\n\nStory: PoE is a book wrapped as a game and the storyline is novel quality that would scare young adult fantasy readers. If you are in it for the story-line alone play PoE on the easiest difficulty with all the help you can get. You create one character and over the course of the story have up to an additional five characters join you. You can even create your own and not bother with the in-game characters. You may want to have as many in-game characters as you can in your party if you want to see the story-line mature fully.\n\nCombat: First, I am playing the game on what is called "hard" difficulty and with a special setting called "expert" mode. PoE's expert mode turns off a lot of helpful information so you must learn what enemies are weak to and much of the information is hidden. Based upon my settings my overall assessment of the combat is brutally difficult, imagine playing chess-master on a grandmaster setting but instead you don't know what all the pieces do but computer does and often has more pieces than you until you get a full party... and even then the enemy will often outnumber you. This is refreshingly positive experience as I am expecting to steamroll the AI as I do in most games. Even with these difficult settings the battles with the AI enemies still feels fair. I feel like I am playing more a game of chess on equal footing than what most games do to make up for bad AIs such as give special bonuses and stats to the AI to make it difficult instead of developing a tactically smart AI. The AI in PoE feels like they are fighting for their life, targeting certain members of my party and using the strengths of their pieces to the best of their ability and even minimizing losses to win the complete battle at times (which is game-over for the player).  The downside of such a difficult AI is a slight draw away from the storyline, in that I've found that I won't bring the in-game characters because they aren’t min-maxed enough for their particular role which means I may be missing out on some dialogue. PoE does have an even higher difficulty but it just increases the stats of the enemies and I'm not interested in that. PoE even has an iron-man mode for the masochist which could make for a fun easy difficulty iron man story.","April 1, 2015","true","114.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morsk/recommended/291650/","morsk","Morsk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morsk/","60 products in account","TLDR: Combat is bad. Too much micromanagement needed for the most basic of things. Lovely art and passable story, ruined by tedious combat. Play this on Easy, or not at all.\n\n90% of combat is keeping the party in formation, so the enemies don't run past the tanks, and no one gets gibbed. That's it. Your "choices" are to initiate combat perfectly to get a good formation, and then pause constantly to keep it together. That's all, and it's not even challenging. When your party formation breaks, it's because you grew too bored to pause often enough, and risked that it might happen. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.\n\nThe art is a triumph. To capture the style of classic isometric games, in modern 3d rendering at high resolution, is something you have to see to believe.\n\nThe story is only passable. There's a lot of "anti-fantasy" by jaded writers who no longer enjoy the genre. They hate wizards, so they add guns. They hate gods, so they killed one with a bomb. (Not a spoiler; it's backstory.) There's more grimdark and gothic horror than epic fantasy. Why is it so hard for amateur -- er, "indie" -- artists to appreciate a popular style and stick to it? Perhaps games have publishers for a reason.","October 7, 2015","false","28.3"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","29","54","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theghostdivision/recommended/291650/","theghostdivision","Psychomachia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theghostdivision/","228 products in account","In this review, I will discuss THE GOOD (things I liked), THE BAD (things that were mechanically wrong or off with the game), and THE UGLY (more general stuff that really just shut me down about it.)\n\nTHE GOOD:\n--Plays and feels like a CRPG! Mission accomplished!\n--Party creation system is cool; you're able to travel around with companions from the story or custom mook-people who were designed in exactly the same fashion as you were. Your choice!\n--Combat is a bit hard to learn at first, but fun and even a bit tactical when facing enemies on par with your level or higher.\n--Pretty big game world, but not overly so.\n--Health system is really good. It forces your party to take breaks from adventuring for fear of permadeath and gets rid of classic "we've been underground for a month!" phenomenon.\n\nTHE BAD:\n--Healing is at a premium for all classes but one or maybe two. This basically forces you to have a priest on hand. Or a full party of Paladins. It detracts from any sort of party diversity and feels very min-maxy.\n--As of recent patches, crowd control effects have been nerfed into oblivion. Maybe this is a "realistic" choice considering which monsters were buffed, but it makes some classes very uninteresting on some levels and complete garbage on others.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n--This game has a lot more ugly for me than it will for others. I'm not trying to start a minor flame war when I say that I think Fallout 4 is a better roleplaying game than Pillars is. You may feel they aren't comprable, but I would disagree. It's a great CRPG, but I will explain later in this section why that isn't enough for me.\n--Do not get Pillars if you want a coherent story. In the previous incarnation of this review, I stated that it suffers from Clockwork Orange Syndrome; the belief that making up your own language and implementing it willy-nilly is cool, but if you can't execute it properly, it's overwhelming and distracting. That's still true. It gets a little more cohesive later, but it stays pretty murky for quite a while, I felt; far too long for a game that's so hyped up.\n--The crux of my Dislike: CRPGs often fail to be actual roleplaying games. The problem with MMORPGs, CRPGs, and even some ARPGs, is that they are all about a tidal wave of numbers crashing upon the rocky shore of the coastline of Other Numbers. Your characters will not feel special. Mine certainly never did. I knew nothing about the land I hailed from, I was given a great big bag full of cookie cutter dialogue options to flesh out my character, and nothing I could do made me truly care about him. Because of how foreign and unrelatable the game feels due to its original fantasy setting combined with the absurdly sheer density of lore, I just couldn't penetrate it. Min-maxing is practically a must on any difficulty above the easiest, for you must combat the numbers swarm! That's why they let you hire your own party, it's not to tell any kind of story. Your hirelings might as well be heavily armored, sometimes magically inclined sheep for all the characterization they're allowed.\n\nHere's the deal. I'm an avid paper and pencil RPG player. While CRPGs are based off of PPRPGs, they have been corrupted. They are no longer roleplaying games, but rollplaying games. Do you see the difference? In a roleplaying game, character driven story is absolutely the most important aspect. In a rollplaying game, it's all just one big, impersonal clash of the dice titans as math jockeys swing their Holy Avenger +5s around.\n\nPillars of Eternity commits this crime. People complain on and on about Fallout because it doesn't hand them a story about their character; it doesn't force feed it to them. This is why people nowadays like the Witcher games; they have no concept of original, open characters. Not to say that the Witcher games are bad (the first two are), but the point is that I can't play Geralt the way I see him, only a handful of ways in which the developers see him.\n\nFallout 4, to me, is a better roleplaying game because I've played it through three times with characters that were WAY deeper than anything Pillars offered. They weren't deep in the game, but in the only place that mattered: my own head. FO4 exemplifies such an openness for imagination that you can be anything.\n\nMy first FO4 character started out optimistic and even excited about the chance for a new life and a chance to rebuild the shattered and insane wasteland, but eventually became jaded and nearly suicidally depressed after making some key story decisions later on. My second character was an older man who had married his secretary after knocking her up and didn't ever answer the hero's call, believing that the nightmare of the wasteland was just that: a cryogenically induced lucid dream that let him do almost anything in a playground of violence and nonsense. There were others, but I hope you get the idea. FO4 gives you a tiny bit of backstory, a voice, and that's it. Not that the game doesn't fall flat in a lot of areas, but the freedom to characterize is vastly superior.\n\nA true RPG let's you do anything within the reasonable confines of the world. It's a practical sandbox. Pillars forces you into a corner with barely noticable character dialogue. There isn't even a bio screen to write. I'm the kind of player who LOVES Skyrim's journal mod because I would write my characters' thoughts in it.\n\nIf you skim over this review and decide you don't care about the aspects I've mentioned, I challenge you to tell any kind of significant story with your characters. I doubt it can be done. I don't hear water cooler stories about the imaginative bloom of characters coming to life in Pillars...just of jumbled numbers striking other numbers with their number swords. It's not a bad game mechanically speaking, I just really dislike that Pillars of Eternity doesn't nurture players' imaginations. It, like so many other games, simply placates our wonder while distracting us with admittedly good gameplay.","October 31, 2015","false","59.8"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","29","54","4","0"

I liked the atmosphere it created, especially in the first town (ooh, dark and edgy) and creating my character was interesting and full of possibilities.  But one thing brought it all down for me:  Combat.  I look forward to combat in RPGs and in this game I did not like it at all.  Once the honeymoon of the campaign setting wore off, I kept playing, hoping the sum of its parts would overcome my distaste for the combat.  Sadly, this did not happen for me.\n\nDespite how I carefully crafted my characters and selected their spells & abilities, I was not at liberty to use them in everyday encounters... which is where I spent most of my combat time (lots of small encounters).  So I ended up basic attacking (which is boring) through every fight I could, being afraid to expend "real" power.  I had a lot of trouble positioning my attacks and abilities.  It made me yearn for proper turn-based combat.  I would carefully indicate what I wanted to happen, but once I unpaused the game my attacks would fire in the wrong place or not as quickly as I had hoped.  The result is that many of my useful abilities "on paper" were not easy to use at all.\n\nNevertheless, I liked the music, the story was moderately compelling, and the NPCs were interesting enough... so I pressed on until I had liberated my stronghold, thinking finally, this will tip the balance: I love having a base I get to improve.  And yet, it was not enough.  I still needed to do a lot of combat to make progress, and through clearing the rest of my stronghold I realized I couldn't take the combat anymore.  It's too imprecise compared to true turn-based combat, and rationing my neat abilities may have added to the challenge but it took away what fun was left for me.  If I could have turned on a mode to allow resting and remove resource management, I might have kept playing for the story and the characters (basically trivializing combat, but hey, I didn’t' like it anyway, may as well go for broke).\n\nThat said, I hope you enjoy the game if you buy it.  It has a lot to like, and just because it wasn't for me doesn't mean it's not for you.  Unfortunately for me, combat is my thing, and this type of combat is not.  :)\n\nPS - Why did I have to stealth my entire party to search a room?  I felt like an idiot stealthing in front of people so I could "search" their room.  I think search and stealth should be separate actions.  That was my only nitpick worth mentioning, though, which is a good thing.\n\nEdit: Typos fixed.\nEdit 2: Well what do you know, it's not just me.  ;)\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/why-i-hate-pausable-real-time-rpg-combat","April 12, 2015","false","14.6"," 99 of 191 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","99","191","5","5"

Because the story-line of Baldur's gate is epic, in an incredibly uplifting way.

Your major goal in this game is to take that event...and undo it. I repeat, your goal is to undo the only thing that make your character unique.

Whether it's the nearly empty locations you can go to, or the party member quests being both tiny, or part of the main quest, you are left wanting. I repeat from above, comparing that to the 2-3+ hours you could spend on some of baldur's gate companions is offensive.

This is compounded by the fact that there is a limit to how often you can rest with the available supplies.\n\nThere is a lot of lore and system information to remember but the explanatory popups work only in some of the places where e.g. the names of gods or skills appear.\n\nMost of the areas I visited so far are just your regular old wilderness spot with evenly spaced enemies and a few plants to collect, making for a very boring gameplay.\n\nIf you are thinking of buying this game because you enjoyed the old Infinity Engine games I would strongly recommend against it.

These are all problems with the design, so not fixable.\nThere are strange bugs during combat:\n- party members forget that they are fighting and just hang around after you use one of their abilities. This happens sometimes, so you never know if you need to manage them or not.\n- abilities don't work as advertised, e.g. the fighters ability that lets him engage 3 enemies sometimes just doesn't register and he is flanked even with just 2.\n\nI am not sure if I wil continue playng - it's become quite boring.","April 2, 2015","false","32.3"," 125 of 242 people (52%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","52","125","242","9","0"

You accept a quest, run somewhere, quest suddenly ends. Poor exceution and lack of good storytelling\n- way too much combat, which is a problem, since combat is the weakest thing about the game\n- choices often dont matter at all or very little\n- an endless amount of loading screens\n- uninspired maps that often consist of one primary goal and a secondary goal to "explore", like loot a corpse or go into a smell temple\n\nAll in all this game is busy trying to market itself as the next Planescape and BG, while in reality it falls incredibly flat.

From it's beautiful rich environments, great story line, and intriguing companions, the game brings you into a great new world to immerse yourself in.  Some small game mechanics are still a bit wonky (pathing for your companion AI is one) but it barely bothered me.  The new system with Endurance vs. Health was strange but refreshing and by the end I actually loved the idea of it.  One of the biggest problems I had in BG series was the need to rest everytime I had my wizards use their spells, however in POE that wasn't an issue at all.  The same problem applied for health in BG but again, in POE with the Endurance vs Health system it drastically cut the need for me to be resting all the time to replenish 'health'.\n\nAnother part of the game I loved was the different routes of personality you could take in this game.  The many different options to reply ingame allowed for multiple ways situations could play out.  Also if you didn't care for any of the ingame companions AT ALL you could hire/creat your OWN PARTY.  I don't know why you'd want to do that though...Eder/Aloth/Durance for life.","April 29, 2015","true","190.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love how they usually have few different endings and how the decisions to choose from are often moral gray zones. When creating our character, we have 11 classes to pick from, as well as 6 races, from which each has few subraces. Our class, race, deity or alignment sometimes matters during conversations- some of conversation options are either locked or unlocked. Some of these depend on our statistics too.

There are plenty of things done better compared to the old infinity engine games, although some die-hard fans may see them as downgrades- just because some stuff is done differently. There aren't many NPC companions to recruit to your team, but we are given an option to "recruit" a self-made character by creating them in a tavern, so I believe that makes up for it. Combat is quite enjoyable, but you have to pause a lot to plan your moves. I must admit though that playing on hard difficulty, the game is not a really huge challenge. I found Icewind Dale to be a lot harder, and it didn't even have difficulties to pick from. Overall I can't help but recommend this game.

Having not played any of the decades-old isometric rogue-like games, I didn't have much in terms of nostalgia for this type of game to bias my initial opinion, though I very much loved Divinity: Original Sin which came out much more recently.\n\nPlain and simple, this game is not for everyone. The combat is hard but very deep and rewarding once you learn the ins and outs of the mechanics and statistics. I've put in almost 60 hours, with one restart after the first 5 hours or so to try a different class, and I've only gotten through 2 of the 4 acts of the game. The game world is large, yet incredibly packed with stuff to do, people to meet, and big baddies (or goodies) to kill and loot!\n\nThe only real cons in my opinion are:\n1) The AI pathing is kinda totally borked. In tight spaces, you and your companions rarely take the route you expect them to take, and while this is slightly frustrating on its own, it wouldn't be so bad except when combined with...\n2) "Engagement" - People who haven't played yet won't understand this much, but essentially during combat your characters are locked in place with the first melee fighter they come in contact with, and if you move your character away, the enemy gets essentially a free, immediate, hit. I wouldn't mind this mechanic if there were a way for your melee classes to pull aggro off of other characters so that you can attempt to control the battlefield better, but this seems to not exist (although admittedly I haven't played all variations of all classes, so the talent may be there somewhere, I just haven't seen it). Needless to say, combined with #1, it is frustrating to attempt to position your characters during a fight so that your melees engage the enemy melees, then have your glass cannons in the back accidentally be engaged because whoops now they're in the front because your melee character decided to go frolick in the flowers.\n3) No friendly combat AI option available. This one is a nit-pick, but for me there were many fights which didn't need my direction every second, but I wish the companions would use their abilities as necessary. I wish there was at least an "enable companion use of 'per encounter' abilities". Micro-management is fun during tough encounters, but for the more trivial ones, I wish there was more of an autopilot setting.\n4) No monk, barbarian, or rogue companions unless you hire them as adventurers (with no dialogue). Particularly monk and rogue companions would have been a great plot addition in my opinion.\n\n9/10","May 2, 2015","true","68.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game expects you to talk to everyone, use every dialogue option and explore every nook and cranny of its relativly linear open world for a complete experience. Though the game has great dialogue options it feels that to get the "perfect" clear you have to play a nosey white knight that has a wiki in their back pocket telling them were to go, who to talk to and when to talk to them. Were I prefered rgps to have less guidelines and more open quests the game feels like it has some parts that are over developed and some parts that recived far less developement, starting areas and certain companions had a plethera of interesting interactions, well designed quests and fun easter eggs that you could find. I recomend taking an hour or so before you play the game to read indepth what each class gets and the recomended way to play them, this will allow you to make your ideal party and plan for level ups far into the future.

The whole system was new to me, and I found it was fair.  I was successful in playing this through on normal mode without much of a hassel.  I never did need to lower the difficulty through the game, which is nice as I am not a hard core RPG stats guy,\n\nThat being said, I got to the final boss and did everything I could to beat him.  It felt like a fought that battle over 100 times.  No dice.  I will never see the completed the game achievement as I do not have the patience to respec my guys or to grind out a few more quests to level up.  Hats off to all those RPGers that blew through the final fight without an issue.  Just keep in mind that the game can be challanging, which is how end game content should be.\n\nThis game deserves a recommend since it was a real enjoyable playthrough up until the final boss.  Who can go wrong with 30+ hours of interesting story lines, keep management, companion building, and a TON of other things.  Great throwback to the Baldur's Gate style games.  I hate to admit it, but I ended up using god mode (which disables all achievements, but is nice for guys like me who are unable to progress) so I could just see the ending.

In the end, Pillars of Eternity taught me why a lot of these old RPG tropes have become extinct.\n\nI had fun with the game, relatively speaking, but in the end I spent way too much time being stumped by the way this game seems to enjoy complexity for the sake of complexity. There is so much reading to do in the initial character creation that it nearly turned me off, but I gave it a fair chance. The game seemed to be deep and it looked like a lot of fun... and then I had to restart my entire game because somehow I had gimped my character and the first actual combat I came across post-tutorial was completely unwinnable.\n\nBy the midgame, I had grown incredibly weary of spending hours in each quest hub reading seemingly endless dialogue. It took me a few hours just to gather sidequests and orient myself. The story was convoluted, dry, and appeared to be going nowhere. The stronghold was a nuisance, rather than anything interesting. Combat had switched from a terrifying problem to a boring chore.\n\nBy the endgame, combat had become more of a chore than anything, especially coupled with the amazingly terrible combat AI your party is equipped with. They don't like to listen to your directions, and they don't like to do anything that makes sense. The story had become so amazingly cloudy that I wasn't sure of the motivations of any of the characters. The final quest hub area was a pain. Combat was totally simple.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, the final boss battle was stupidly difficult and caused me to rage quit the whole thing altogether.\n\nI don't think this game was meant for me, even though I'm a fan of classic PC RPGs. It seemed to have all the weaknesses of Obsidian games with none of the strengths. I guess I endorse it because it is clearly a labor of love on the part of Obsidian, but I wouldn't put my full support behind it.","July 13, 2015","true","73.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In Pillars of Eternity it's more like "meh, I really don't know if this is an improvement or not and I don't really know what caused us to win the battle". It is a bit too fuzzy and unintuitive when it comes to battle mechanics. I enjoy more clear systems where +1 means something and you know you don't have enough points yet.\n\n- too many npcs in comparison to party size. I hate it when you have 3-4 characters waiting in line and you want to have chat with each one of them and play the story with each one of them but you can't because they don't fit in your active party. I'd either have fewer more intricate characters that I can play with at the same time instead of excess amount of characters that I have to juggle all the time in and out of the party to get everything out of them\n\nBut still recommended as the storyline is well written and atmosphere is really close to what made BG series so good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/291650/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","After supporting the game on Kickstarter (one of very few games I supported), after patiently waiting for two part expansion to get released, I finally played Pillars of Eternity in it's complete current 3.x version and it was an amazing adventure to have. All of my expectations were met and exceeded and not just because we sadly lacked games with truly great stories for the past decade, but because even if there were many, Pillars would be just as great. It's everything you loved about Black Isle, early Bioware, Troika and, of course, Obsidian themselves, but perfected, taken to a new level, despite the very nostalgic interface. It's simple enough to get sucked into it, but complex and deep enough not to be a very fast food-ish feeling game a lot more recent AAA RPGs have become.\n\nSo what is Pillars of Eternity with both parts of White March expansion and latest patch? It's an RPG with an active pause and Infinity Engine-inspired aesthetic. But where Infinity Engine felt restrictive in later games, both technologically and storytelling mechanics-wise, where D&D rulesets felt restrictive for the stories BioWare and especially Black Isle wanted to tell, Obsidian made something perfectly suited for their needs. The inteface is highly customisable and smart, technologically the game is much less restricted and the ruleset they created for their world is a joy to play with. You pretty much cannot create a "bad character" unless you try to (and if you do something you regret you can respec easily). All mechanics and ideas complement the concept of you playing the game the way you want and shaping the story the way you want. It isn't as freeform as what Fallout tried to be, but wow it is trying and is much more flexible than even Planescape: Torment. As an example - combat itself doesn't give you experience now, so you never feel like you NEED to kill everything you see and doing things in other ways is perfectly viable. And the idea of very text adventure-like segments that focus even more on your deeds and abilities to do things normal gameplay wouldn't allow is an incredibly smart decision.\n\nThe adventure itself is structured close to how the original Baldur's Gate worked (a region where you open new destinations on the world map to go to), but every map tries to bring something new, something unique, something exciting to learn and do. The world lore, the main story, mini stories, companion stories are very fun and try to ask interesting questions and put new perspectives on what you think you already know. In the way how deep and amazing story is, I wouldn't even compare it to Baldur's Gate games, but more to Planescape: Torment or probably a bit of Arcanum. Now, in the White March part 1, story is considerably simpler (and the events take place as an extension of the main story, not as a post-game thing), but part 2 brings back the excitement of the main game topics and questions game asks of you, even if it's still not as great as the main game.\n\nThere are, of course, some nitpicks to be had. Loadings for every map, for example, do become frustrating even if it was the only way to preserve the pre-rendered beauty of the backgrounds, especially since as you play longer game seems to start becoming "heavier" for the system. There are rather frustrating AI things as in the fight all party members seem to follow very simple pathing algorithms and can block each other without any logic to go around or shuffle to the side without breaking engadgement with the enemy. The party AI and presets, on the other hand, are very good most of the time, so it's just weird to see pathing being so much of an issue. And there are also some occasional glitches - wrong script triggers, character getting thrown over the path boundries and getting stuck there forever, controls just refusing to work suddenly and even few crashes. These happened VERY rarely, but they did.\n\nThese things aside, however, I had fantastic time with Pillars of Eternity and it's two-part expansion and I'd recommend the game to anyone who loves a really great story that you help shape the way you want. One of the best RPGs in a decade, probably best game from Obsidian so far and and adventure to be had. I really wish there will be more games in this universe.","March 3","true","69.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Exploration and combat are excellent with graceful smooth interaction which enhances the magic and wonder of discovery with the contrasting explosive tense combat. It is a much welcomed evolutionary step up from the BALDUR'S GATE series of old.\n\nMusic is soothing and transcending touching the mind with soft kisses from another world. Graphics are thick with endless variety and detail making the world feel alive with sensual delights and death threatening terror. Lighting is a mixture of the surreal, eerie and haunting casting a shimmering glow upon dungeon walls and lighting wooded areas with torches that can also be used in combat to set enemies on fire. Ancient machines glow with futuristic energies from unimaginable dimensions where time seems to have been shattered as glass into a nullified state where it has no bearing. Nights are a spooky neon blue or romantic velvet blue for the lovers out there.\n\nVoice acting makes me connect with my character and the npcs of the world triggering emotional moments whenever the unexpected happens. Alongside the incredibly well written grim story and theatrical effects like dramatic music while cutscenes play out or a battle is about to begin these are some of the best things about Pillars Of Eternity.\n\nI love how pausing was implemented during combat and how it can be turned on or off in the options menu. Combat is very fluid along with movement and has a certain action packed motion to it making one thirst for more battle which in turn made me want to explore every nook and cranny of the world not only for treasure,alchemy ingredients,supplies,npc interaction etc but for lethal visually stunning death dealing encounters.\n\nAnother great thing are the options for people who suffer color blindness as well as font scaling to make text bigger which is great for.. older eyes :) You can also set up the pace of combat and many other things in the options menu to make things as comfortable as you want them to be according to your play style.\n\nWriting is truly stunning in its excellence. Its on a level of high caliber literature bringing the story home with the sizzling steak appeal of a LORD OF THE RINGS movie. Characters come across with endless range of personality making them very likeable even if they are scoundrels. Best writing i have seen in a rpg in ages since PLANESCAPE TORMENT complimented perfectly by top notch professional voice acting.\n\nIndeed PILLARS OF ETERNITY is a beautiful and shocking harsh world which draws one in and does not let go in its seductive hug er i mean grip yea BONE CRUSHING GRIP. Before i knew it three hours had passed and i was still hankering for more but alas real life needs a chore or two done :)\n\nIf your looking for a very intense modern day Baldur's Gate style experiance with a different combat system with its mix of pause/turned based action Pillars Of Eternity is the rpg to satisfy the dnd fever in you with mind blowing writing fleshing out a grueling story of a brutal world where every day is a dark journey to survive.\n\nThank you OBSIDIAN and congratulations on your magnificent creation.","March 26, 2015","true","23.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That beign said here it goes.\n\nI remeber playing thousands of hours just playing Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and it's expansion Throne of Baal. I remember Icewind Dale one and two. I remember playing Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor and other countless D&D and RPG titles like Niverwinter Nights. Very selddom does a game bring me back in a way to the feelings I had about those games. I love RPGs they, to me, embody what a game should be. It sucks you into your own world that is just yours, the decisions you make effect you, charatcers that have a special place in your heart, I'm talking about you, Minsc and Boo!\n\nThis is one of those rare games that I play and I feel the magic I felt about games when I was a kid. The trail and error, the building a character and finding what playstyle works for that class, the dungeon crawls that I play for hours and don't realize it is time to eat. Instead of my mother calling me down for dinner it's my wife, or my kids sitting next to me going "Dad we are hungry can you pause it after you kill this monster?" and when I pause it they groan with annoyance that it needs to stop. Now instead of playing solo like when I was a kid I have 3 of my own to share the magic with, and the memories I make I now share with them. I hear their laughs as the characters banter as you walk through the cities and caves and forests.\n\nMy oldest is now trying to battle her way onto my computer to play this game bcause it is like the games I loved when I was a kid. Simple yet complicated, easy yet hard, and it has all the makings of a classic. If you are a RPG fan or a fan of any of the Baldur's Gate games or Neverwinter Nights and you don't buy this game your are an idiot. This game will take you back to a time when games were amazing and not just good. I know I might catch some flak for that but how many games that have come out in the past 8 years have made you wanna go back and play them through 20 times? I can count the number on my hands. Yes there are fun games to play that are good for one maybe two play throughs but seldom suck me into my own world for hours and hours and hours of gameplay. I have about 50 hours on this game and I got it just a few days ago. I can't get enough and niether can my kids.\n\nWhile it has it's drawbacks like any game and they are few and far between, such as the double clicking inventory bug, but they are so few I have yet to find one that is game breaking. you can't even say that for Skyrim or any other RPGs that have come out within the past 5 years. If you don't like RPGs then this game is not for you, if you never played Baldur's Gate and never will this game is not for you. But if you love them and want a game that takes you back then get this game.","April 2, 2015","true","139.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Combat System is not perfect - but it works and you have many strategic choices.\n\nThe Game World is impressive, although the unity engine is too old and need an upgrade.\n\nObsidian could do many more with Pillars of Eternity -  new monsters, better encounters.\nAnd a bit respawn - perhaps Obsidan would put some assasins in the Game or something different.\n\nThe PoE RPG System could do so much more !  For Example : a group of zealot try to kill you.\nAnd with the application of zealot, assasin and so on - you would create an amazing Respawn System.\n\nThe biggest weakness in Pillars of Eternity are the empty maps  if you kill all the enemies.\n\nThe Game is good, but without more enemies, encounters or similar things - it will never be perfect.\n\nBest Regards","October 4, 2015","true","31.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Does it hit as hard as BG2? No, it's hard to do that. BG2 existed in a kind of beloved universe by nerds, cultivated with a rich goofy history from Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nThis attempts to do it's own thing, though common fantasy tropes are brought in. None the less it's interesting and takes a strong themeatic focus upon the concept of the soul, which here is a particular thing with particular qualities, capable of being approached in an almost scientific manner.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially turn based though real time, you will pause often. AI can be preset for companions to make it flow easier and I've found it to work fine. The classes are many and interesting while the stat system is a little more forgiving, as usefulness is spread out wide amid the stats. It's hard to build yourself into a character hole.\n\nThe dialogue and reading is plenty. Play this game ever night, a little bit, before you go to bed. It's like cozying up with a book. It isn't supposed to give you an adrenal rush, but be an enjoyable journey.\n\nI would suggest playing it on the harder difficulties, I did at first and rarely had any issues save for near the end.

As a fan of the old infinity engine games you should really try it. Younger RPG lovers should also get it.\n\nNow I'm a seasoned Planescape and Baldur's Gate (also NWN) expert so I'll use those classics as reference in mind.\n\nGraphics are nice but old style, Divinity looked more modern but still every equipped armor shines neatly.\n\nMusic is Conan style, no surprises but good and fits. Sounds like Baldur's Gate.\n\nVoice acting - good but we expected this.\n\nWorld and lore is a copy of forgotten realms essentially. Standard fantasy you'll feel right at home.\n\nRule system is somewhat on par with D&D2 and slightly inferior to D&D3, no multi-classing either.\n\nParty, choice of the assorted fleshed out companions, those have a lot of personality, bicker as always and come with a quest. You can also create more adventurers for small coins if you rather want custom characters. Companions are on par with the averagely made Baldur's Gate companions say Corgan, Keldorn or Mazzy and better in cases. No Minsk, Imoen, Morte or Annah though.\n\nQuests - those are very good.\n\nThe main story is high above average game standards. Souls, reincarnation, unearthing the past, all of that. After reaching act 2 the plot gains some depth.\n\nYeah the game tends to the casual player, quest givers are conveniently next to locations, companions can hardly be missed, game is not really punishing, skill reset possible.  I hardly got lost and there are no riddles. You can out-level hard battles. Still you can break quests like by force-attacking friendly people which is even an option. I haven't seen such for years now. Still you can win battles by the skin of your teeth - I like that a lot.\n\nThere's no good/evil but a Divinity like stoic/rational/passionate etc. rating system of character, those are heavily used in dialogues as are skill, attribute and background checks where Torment fans feel at home.\n\nFormations are in, companion AI is in, most gamebreaking is ironed out. One hang in all my playtime. Several difficulty settings, one deep optional dungeon, ton of loot. Stonghold - check. Crafting is in but really an afterthought.\n\nIt's fair to say you won't be getting a better infinity engine-like RPG in a long time. 9/10","September 29, 2015","true","32.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

PoE is the original in terms of bringing back an almost dead genre. Whether you're new to IE or a vet who played all the originals, you will feel at home here.\n\nFor a nos BS, roots RPG experience, look no further. My game of the year so far and also one of the best combat experiences I've had in any game\n\nIf you're tired of AAA, watered down nonsence, all our old favourites being made more action orientated to appeal to the masses, get on board with a real game like Pillars Of Eternity and show the devs some love..\n\nIf you want a future of gaming that isn't shaped by COD-loving teenagers, "Frag-Master-Camper" get on board with the Renicance revival, buy this ♥♥♥♥ now, smoke a fat bag and enjoy.\n\nthank me later.","October 1, 2015","true","41.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not like Wasteland 2 where it seemed like BS magic.\nThe game is huge and in the cities at least, diverse.\nYou get your own castle.\nFighting is fun and challenging.\n\nCons:  You can create your own characters and thus the characters you can pick up seem static and not worth talking to.    I like the old Baulders gate where your companions where unique, but here they are all the same.  Sadness.\nLack of good side quests.\nNo ability to find stuff on the map.  You can get quests which take HOURS and HOURS to complete simply because you didn't talk to the right people in the right order.  So annoying.  This makes the game longer but not in a good way.\nBugs.  Lots of bugs.  At least when I played, I found several bugs such as the infinite fireball, that loaded back in when I came back to my keep.  I can thus never own my keep, because a fireball is going off in my dungeon all the time.  LOL.\n\nSo ya, if you have lots of time.  I HIGHLY recommend this game.  If you are going to only play an hour of this a night.  Stay as far away as possible.  The lack of map help for the quests is a killer.  Only a few quests I found ever showed up on the map.  It may sound lazy, and it is.  But I don't care.  I want map help.  I play for the story and fighting, not fetch quests.  My name is not Rover.

The game expects you to talk to everyone, use every dialogue option and explore every nook and cranny of its relativly linear open world for a complete experience. Though the game has great dialogue options it feels that to get the "perfect" clear you have to play a nosey white knight that has a wiki in their back pocket telling them were to go, who to talk to and when to talk to them. Were I prefered rgps to have less guidelines and more open quests the game feels like it has some parts that are over developed and some parts that recived far less developement, starting areas and certain companions had a plethera of interesting interactions, well designed quests and fun easter eggs that you could find. I recomend taking an hour or so before you play the game to read indepth what each class gets and the recomended way to play them, this will allow you to make your ideal party and plan for level ups far into the future.

If you have never played an isometric CRPG before I recommend looking at videos as well as user reviews.\nThis game, even on normal mode, can be very intimidating considering the amount of combat mechanics. The game goes over the basics, but many things either fly over your head at first or are not explained at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andrew-handerson/recommended/291650/","andrew-handerson","Poro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andrew-handerson/","28 products in account","One of the retro RPG games quite similar to Dragon age Origins. You command created character (you) that travels through the world to uncover deep mystery. While doing so you do many side quest and tasks and find (or create) other companions. You can go with up to 5 another champions in your adventure party (total party size is 6) while others take care of your keep which you are repairing from by enemies infested ruin to glorious castle.\n\n>> Pros\n+ Deep characters system (stats, classes, etc.). You even develop reputations (like honest, diplomatic or aggressive) by way you interact with NPCs.\n+ Way you created and developped your character is reflected in conversation choices available to you. This means if you create different type of character you can have different experience while playing again.\n+ Story is strong and well told.\n+ Combat feels balanced and rewarding.\n+ Graphics is simple yet nice with no extreme hardware requirements so you can play it on notebook.\n+ No internet connection required for play.\n+ Several difficulty settings that can be combined. It is not just basically divided into easy->hard options but you can turn on or off several difficulty features as well.\n\n>> Cons\n- Sometimes too many text to read.\n- Only few texts are voiced (some texts are only part voiced which feels really strange).\n- Extremely stupid AI of both your companions and opponents in combat. Characters stucking when available path is just next to them, going somewhere for no reason or just staying idle while few meters away there is battle is shamefully frequnt.\n- Poor auto management of characters automatic behaviour in combat. You can't tell what abilities your character can use like in Dragon Age but you can only pick template like "Aggresive" or "Support" which mostly doesn't meet your expectations and you are forced to handle all champions yourself, which is exhausting after several time.\n\nIf you like to care mostly only your character, 2 last points above are really irritating. If you like to manage all your champions yourself they hardly matter.\n\n>> Pros or Cons? (depends on your personal taste)\no No free world. You have system of little maps connected by their borders. In the end there is very little of true exploration because on every piece of living space there is something.\no Nothing hold your hand in terms of quests means no arrows, question marks or explamation marks. You must find your quests by talking NPCs around and if you wish to not miss any you need to talk them all through. It's similar to Divinity Original Sin.\no I personally found crafting useless except enhancing weapons which is exact opposite and is necessary.\n\nIf you like those types of RPGs it is a good choice. If you like retro type games (no hand holding) do not hesitate a second, you will love it. It is not game for everyone though as it may seem slow and boring for modern type gamers used to Diablo 3 or Dragon Age Inquisition like games.","January 27","true","190.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Much more interesting combat system than in Baldur's Gate. Though it is not polished well so sometimes battles look like you are a lumberjack in the woods. Relatively complex class and abilities system sometimes require good knowledge of those to finish the fight but those happen only occasionally. Access to almost all the map from the beginning result in good battles scattered through the world which in late game on higher lvl makes most regular encounters very easy to beat. Battle AI is very usefull and sometimes gives insights into winning battles especially on Hard. I should admit that those rare battles which finish with half of your team lying unconsious and almost all with low health are unforgettable especially if you manage to do them from first try.

In the end, Pillars of Eternity taught me why a lot of these old RPG tropes have become extinct.\n\nI had fun with the game, relatively speaking, but in the end I spent way too much time being stumped by the way this game seems to enjoy complexity for the sake of complexity. There is so much reading to do in the initial character creation that it nearly turned me off, but I gave it a fair chance. The game seemed to be deep and it looked like a lot of fun... and then I had to restart my entire game because somehow I had gimped my character and the first actual combat I came across post-tutorial was completely unwinnable.\n\nBy the midgame, I had grown incredibly weary of spending hours in each quest hub reading seemingly endless dialogue. It took me a few hours just to gather sidequests and orient myself. The story was convoluted, dry, and appeared to be going nowhere. The stronghold was a nuisance, rather than anything interesting. Combat had switched from a terrifying problem to a boring chore.\n\nBy the endgame, combat had become more of a chore than anything, especially coupled with the amazingly terrible combat AI your party is equipped with. They don't like to listen to your directions, and they don't like to do anything that makes sense. The story had become so amazingly cloudy that I wasn't sure of the motivations of any of the characters. The final quest hub area was a pain. Combat was totally simple.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, the final boss battle was stupidly difficult and caused me to rage quit the whole thing altogether.\n\nI don't think this game was meant for me, even though I'm a fan of classic PC RPGs. It seemed to have all the weaknesses of Obsidian games with none of the strengths. I guess I endorse it because it is clearly a labor of love on the part of Obsidian, but I wouldn't put my full support behind it.","July 13, 2015","true","73.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The voice acting ranges from AAA+ to B-Movie, although not all sections of the game are voiced (even some critical scenes are missing some voice overs).\n\nThe plot takes a while to develop, is strong in the mid game, but then falls apart a little in the end game. As it's fairly open to the player to decide their progress, this may have just been because of my specific playthrough or "background" choices.\n\nThe biggest detractor were the bugs, most frequently in the combat stats/rolls that resulted in instant deaths of high level party members at the hands of trash monsters. The reputation system was frustrating as well, as some poor choices early in the game could lock you out of different factions and break quests with no option to rebuild rep. Don't play this game without frequent saves!\n\nMost comparable to Baldur's Gate 1/Icewind Dale, I found most of my disappointment in this game was simply because I went into it expecting Baldur's Gate 3, rather than the first in a possible new series of games. The party dialogue and quests are great, but not to the same level of detail as BG2, where party members would interact and conflict with each other, and there were romance options.\n\nMy expectation now is that this game is part one of a new franchise. From that perspective, it's a pretty great first game and I recommend it to anyone with 60+ hours to drop into an RPG.","April 22, 2015","true","79.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Generous story, great art, well thought classes, smooth interface - everything that next game (BG3, PS:T2 or IWD3, whatever you wanna call it) needs to be.\n\nFirst off; the negative reviews, I believe they are written by people that are old time RPGers but are bored of the genre now.\n\nAs for my expectations and what I got:\n\n* Setting: The setting is brand new, and backed up with an amazing historical background. It's rather too "normal" for my taste but Obsidian has done a respectable work in just 3 years. 4/5\n* Story: It never let's you go. It has tons of cliché moments in it but it manages to surprise you time to time as well. I could do with a more personal story but guess customized characters don't allow it. 4/5\n* RPG mechanics: These are new too. They work quite well, and there are almost no trash stats at all. Perks and talents are quite interesting as well - I just wished some fun perks or traits but it can come in a later expansion. 5/5\n* Interface & gameplay: This is probably the strongest side of the game. The interface works flawlessly, especially when compared to older IE games. 5/5\n* Visuals: To put it simply; they're amazing, in terms of quality. The map designs may be a little too bland for some people's taste but the customers asked for a better version of Baldur's gate series and they got it. 5/5\n* Music: Very atmospheric. It's not everywhere but when you hear it, it makes a difference rather than making background noise. 5/5\n* Companions & NPCs: Both your companions and NPCs are very detailed and involve unreadable amounts of text. Your companions are interesting enough, so you don't really want to make a custom party. However as a PS:T fan I was expecting some extreme characters such as Morte or Nordom - with unique non-class based mechanics. But now I'm not sure this franchise is going that way. 4.5/5\n\nFinal: This is an awesome, huge, fresh game for all RPG fans but targets especially BG fans, which I'm not. I mean, Baldur's Gate is a Bioware franchise and Bioware games are rather bland and dull compared to Black Isle/Obsidian. Still they have colored this new "BG world" with lots of Obsidian colors and they managed to capture me easily. It's better than all past Bioware games (BG & DA series) but a little duller compared to past BI/Ob franchises. Best game I've played in the last 2 years and one of the top 10 RPGs of all time. 4.8/5\n\nAll we need is Obsidian to make xpacs & sequels to this game - preferable a little more courageous.","March 26, 2015","true","112.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

Taking the core gameplay style of the original Baldur's Gate, combining it with the storytelling of Planescape Torment and creating a whole new world with new character classes, skills, magic, and abilities. Obsidian have managed to create a new classic and benchmark for RPG games in this decade. One of the great features of the game is the way that skills, character class, race, past choice in conversations etc. all give you different options in conversation with NPCs and especially in scripted moments. Being without a particular skill is never game breaking but they can give you an edge when exploring, dealing with a villain or looking for loot. The game itself is huge with lots to do, many side quests and enormous replayability with the way that the main story unfolds.

Few sub-groups do this as vocally and with as much affection as fans of traditional RPGs like the near-legendary Infinity Engine games: Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, etc. This might be because so many of those gamers found these games in tandem with traditional pen-and-paper RPGs, which is understandable when you see how much similarity there is between the two.\n\nPublishers and developers of course play on this nostalgia and claim that their title will be the game that ushers in a resurrection of the classic RPG - a grand return to the days of high adventure. And of course they are consistently wrong because pitching a 50+ hour game with thousands of pages of text to read through is a hard sell.\n\nFear not these false prophets, though, for Obsidian has delivered unto you a second coming of traditional swordplay, wizardy, and esoteric lore. Lead us not unto Dragon Age. Deliver us from The Witcher. For Pillars of Eternity is the power and the glory. It's every D&D session in a moldy basement, every late Saturday night in the cold glow of a CRT displaying Icewind Dale, distilled into one game and freshened up just enough to make it more functional to a current audience. And that's it. It's a very *pure* experience. I can't give it better praise than that.\n\nThis shows you what a team can do when the budget isn't being poured into marketing, graphics, and bloated staffs.

Pathfinding in combat is awful. No way to set up some abilities to auto-attack mode. No quest tracking and no proper descriptions in quests. Castle's facilities feel like a nice feature at first, but then you realize most of those don't bring anything. Silly trips around the global map to get a buff you need for a conversation but then it throws you into a dead end.\n\nWith all nagging aside, a really good game, highly suggested.

Thanks for giving back the old RPG style games like Baldurs gate/ NWN's. I sincerely hope you bring out a few expansions.\n\nOnly down side gold npc's... i literally bypassed all of them... there was nothing to gain from reading all that text... sure its great to get the backers involved but telling me about it during the game?... immersion breaker number 1 (which is light... but still an immersion breaker. There was no real point to them being there...)\n\n2nd immersion breaker which... was the tombstone memorial tabs throughout the game... leaving messages from backers/helpers or whatever they were in the game was a complete immersion breaker... then half way through the game looking at the loading screens messages was advised that they knew this would break the immersion but put it there anyway was just silly i think. Give them credit? ABSOLUTELY!!! give credit where it is due... but give credit in the "CREDITS" section like everyone else. Big spoiler.\n\nI still love the game, a few balancing issues to work on however my review was just to highlight x2 things. 1 I thought the game was absolutely fantasitc, from the storyline/graphics/new style RPG/new classes i have never seen was great!!\n\n2nd was just a message to the developers.. please don't spoil the immersion by putting in the tombstone comments from people in the game...\n\n8/10. Definately worth the money :) just certainly not the $45 extra for Royal addition?!?!?! cash grab anyone? O_O\n\nMy gameplay (on hard.. will give it a few days before i go into the hardest setting... should be good!)\nWell where to begin. I have restarted this game many times to find what i thought was my ultimate character / team and found the cipher to be quite good as a main. Dual wielding stilletto with high dex, per, int, res with only 3 con and 3 str and i was still able to king nearly every fight without throwing the meatbag fighter in front to deflect dmg. main reason why i dumped str and con was so i could win the battle-by-speeches. So many areas where you needed high res or int to get the desired outcomes. Play this build and you'll get maximum enjoyablility! meh.. personal preference i suppose. My Cipher / Duo with rogue (as in cipher provide prone/paralysis etc on aoe enemies and let the rogue to town dishing monumental damage over time if built correctly / fighter /  druid who was max might/ dex and a bear transformation! 50 dmg for the majority of hits!! the team was just unbeatable... and cmon... its a gigantic bear! just love the graphics/animations. i left the other two slots open so i can carry the playable game characters and finish their quests just to ensure i covered every quest i could locate.","May 14, 2015","true","290.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The voice acting ranges from AAA+ to B-Movie, although not all sections of the game are voiced (even some critical scenes are missing some voice overs).\n\nThe plot takes a while to develop, is strong in the mid game, but then falls apart a little in the end game. As it's fairly open to the player to decide their progress, this may have just been because of my specific playthrough or "background" choices.\n\nThe biggest detractor were the bugs, most frequently in the combat stats/rolls that resulted in instant deaths of high level party members at the hands of trash monsters. The reputation system was frustrating as well, as some poor choices early in the game could lock you out of different factions and break quests with no option to rebuild rep. Don't play this game without frequent saves!\n\nMost comparable to Baldur's Gate 1/Icewind Dale, I found most of my disappointment in this game was simply because I went into it expecting Baldur's Gate 3, rather than the first in a possible new series of games. The party dialogue and quests are great, but not to the same level of detail as BG2, where party members would interact and conflict with each other, and there were romance options.\n\nMy expectation now is that this game is part one of a new franchise. From that perspective, it's a pretty great first game and I recommend it to anyone with 60+ hours to drop into an RPG.","April 22, 2015","true","79.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Taking the core gameplay style of the original Baldur's Gate, combining it with the storytelling of Planescape Torment and creating a whole new world with new character classes, skills, magic, and abilities. Obsidian have managed to create a new classic and benchmark for RPG games in this decade. One of the great features of the game is the way that skills, character class, race, past choice in conversations etc. all give you different options in conversation with NPCs and especially in scripted moments. Being without a particular skill is never game breaking but they can give you an edge when exploring, dealing with a villain or looking for loot. The game itself is huge with lots to do, many side quests and enormous replayability with the way that the main story unfolds. It incorporates morality, the nature of religion, good vs. evil and the player character in a closely interwoven development that has you almost wanting to skip the side quests just to findout what happens next.\nA must have for RPG fans.","April 12, 2015","true","147.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A lot of them are ♥♥♥♥. A lot of them are derivitive nonsense. A lot of them are flashy, and fun for what they are, and brief and forgotten a few months--or even days--afterwards. I don't think Pillars of Eternity is one of those.\n\nIt certainly follows the form of older games, but I don't know that it's derivative. Every moving part seems to have been considered with careful deliberation, and each piece seems carefully placed in an attempt to make a game that's significant, that's fun and that you can take with you.\n\nI haven't finished the game, and I don't have the perspective to look back on it, so I don't know how much Pillars of Eternity will stand out in memory, but for the experience of activing playing it at least, it's an excellent time.\n\nSome nameless soul on the internet compared it to a novel, noting the differences between it and other, more so-called modern games. Such other games are like movies--action movies, in particular--with flashy visuals and sound design and ultimately superficial interaction and storytelling. They're fun for what they are, but their souls are perhaps not so grand. Pillars of Eternity aims more to be like a novel, sprawling and perhaps a little uneven, but saturated and infused with wit and care and thought. This could of course still lead to ♥♥♥♥, if said thought and wit were poor and lousy and made by ♥♥♥♥boys. Luckily Pillars of Eternity seems to have been made by reasonable folks, nerds who have an understanding of atmosphere and storytelling, and a knack for finding a place for the player in the world so that the game serves as more than a mere distraction or carnival ride.\n\nIt's tight ♥♥♥♥.

If you are a fan of classic CRPGs, or of newer CRPGs like Dragon Age, you should find this very much worth your time, even if it might not be in the top 3 CRPGs of all time. It's one of those games you don't just blow through in 8 hours but can spend a while studying, and that's exactly what was called for.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing the Pillars team make the next BG2 or Fallout 2. But while this is a great game and a really solid effort, I think it's worth qualifying that this game isn't all the way at the top of the heap yet.\n\nInstead of the old D&D-based setting and systems, this game has its own completely new setting and statistics. While I found these a little silly at first, I warmed up to them over time and some surprises at the end eventually made me a fan; the setting is comparable to Dragon Age or Elder Scrolls in quality. As a true CRPG, this is the kind of thing where there are lots of pointless books sitting around containing neat things like plays written from within the universe.\n\nOther than that new stuff, most of the format comes from Infinity Engine games, particularly the Baldur's Gate series, with a few refinements and simplifications. Overall, though, this game doesn't fix what wasn't broken, and that's a very good thing. As in Baldur's Gate, the backbone of the game is real-time combat with the ability to pause, but there's a decent variety of things to do. You play a character who has a secret to explore, you recruit up to six party members, you explore their backgrounds and do their character quests, you travel through wilderness maps, you explore several city-hubs in which you do quests where you can explore conversation trees and take sides, you go through dungeon crawls and beat big bosses, you hoard magical items and dress a paper doll to get the right bonuses.\n\nWhile playing this, I kept finding things which slightly reminded me of past games. Here are just a few examples:\n* The Stronghold is a pleasant expansion of the concept from Baldur's Gate 2.\n* The use of guns and some of the mechanics reminded me of Arcanum.\n* Hiring custom party members reminded me of Icewind Dale.\n* The player's role and some of the themes from the dialogue reminded me of Planescape: Torment.\n* The way the ending was done is right out of Fallout and Fallout 2.\n\nThat's just a few examples of why I believe that Pillars of Eternity incorporates a lot of conscious thinking about what worked and didn't work in CRPGs of the past. And after suffering through so many games which just didn't get what was special about the best classic CRPGs, I think this thinking contributes a lot to the solid, quality feel of the game - that it doesn't try to fix what wasn't broken.\n\nAt the same time, the game isn't a slave to the past. As an example of the ways that this game moves CRPGs forward, one of its biggest refinements of the Baldur's Gate formula is "the stash," a huge holdall that follows you everywhere. This is welcome, because much of my playtime in Baldur's Gate was repacking inventory to make the most of limited space so I wouldn't miss out on gear (much like I spent a lot of my time in Fallout organizing my hoard on shelves). It's much nicer just to grab stuff and not think about it until I want to sell it. On the other hand, it can be hard to find things in the stash sometimes. This isn't the only improvement, just an example; I noticed a lot of well-thought little features like this.\n\nOne important caveat about this game compared to the CRPG greats, and I don't doubt this relates to scheduling and funding, is that it has somewhat less content. Playing most of the quests, I found the game to have a decently long playtime, but I didn't feel inspired to immediately reroll and try different things (and the creative ideas I have tried haven't worked out). I don't feel like I missed enough content or possibilities that it is worth a replay anytime soon, although there are lots of difficulty features for hardcore combat addicts who love replaying. There are a decent number of recruitable characters, and two big cities - enough, but not really so many. I expect there will be more content in expansions or future games, which is only fair.\n\nIn terms of its themes and writing, I give Pillars a solid B. The writing is not the best I've seen, but it's very good.  The themes explored are interesting. You have some scope what you want to be. But a limited scope. There is no restrictive alignment system, and you don't easily lose party members due to disagreements with your choices. Unfortunately few of the self-defining questions you answer as part of your roleplay really affect anything. You can be all kinds of people, mostly, but  you can't choose to be (say) a Glenfathan. You can be a priest of an evil god, but you are still basically guaranteed to be a cruel hero at worst, and all of your companions are more or less just neutral or good. It would be simply impossible to complete a pacifist playthrough.\n\nArtistically, the backgrounds are beautiful, the 3d art is good, the sounds are good, and the voice acting is unmemorable but not bad. The music that's present is of good quality, but it feels like they only made 3-4 songs so it rapidly gets a little repetitive. This is not a huge deal, but I hope that future games will be able to budget for a little more variety.\n\nTechnically, I am well satisfied with the game. Something crucial to me is that it supports Linux almost perfectly - just without displaying capes for some reason. There were a few launch bugs affecting all platforms, but I did not find them to be that severe, and the pace of patches has been very steady. You might want to regularly make separate saves, though.\n\nSuperficially, there are a few niggling details I think people harp on way too much. Some people don't like the backer content on the "gold plate" characters or the tomb inscriptions, but you are never required to read ANY of it and it can be removed with mods, so I don't think it hurts the quality of the game. Similarly, at release a lot of people complained about having to sneak to find hidden things, but you can use 2x speed to help with that, anyway this is exactly like Baldur's Gate and as you play, you start to learn that hidden things are in certain kinds of places rather than just everywhere. Similarly, some classes are harder to play than others but they are still not too bad as long as they suit your playstyle. So I think there are a lot of little complaints people have that don't matter very much.\n\nIt's a good game which makes me very hopeful for the future of CRPGs. Thank goodness that Obsidian was willing to gamble on this and that Kickstarter and the Kickstarter backers were around to catalyze it.","April 16, 2015","true","80.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I loved playing that character.\n\n+ The story is ok, actually, it's more than ok, i'ts very detailled and interesting. I even find it well written at times.\n\n+(?) it's got a lot of feature identical to Baldur's Gate, even the "help a man in a fight outside a bar and he joins your party afterwards" (NW2 with the dwarf), to many, this is a positive thing I guess\n\nI can't really think of anything else, it all runs smooth with not to many hiccups.\n\n\n- It feels like it's not a finished product\n- It feels shallow and not coherent, example : big city has riots, you go back there after a short while, almost everything is as before except for one or two NPCs who say a few different things\n- though the background story is pretty good I think, the actual conversation scripts and peripheral story writing can be absolutely terrible at times, I was sometimes literally smacking my head\n- they did reproduce from the old successfull RPGs, but reproducing from a good game doesn't make a game good.... they didn't build on anything, they didn't push any barriers, they didn't bring any depth to the characters and the story or even the setting, the world and so on.\n\nIt felt like a polished but unfinished game. There was no creativity, there was nothing "new" except for details mostly related to modern technology.\n\nConclusion : It's like playing Baldur's gate I and II and NW 1 and 2 mixed together with today's technology and a different story.\n\nie, nothing special.\n\nconclusion : I did enjoy playing it for a while though I got bored as well after a while, I only finished it out of principle. And I'm sure many people will enjoying playing it, in fact whoever's reading it, you'll probably have a "nice" time playing it.\n\nBut it's certainly not an exceptional game, certainly not as good as all the hype was saying and certainly not worth the price when you compare that to games like The Witcher 3.\n\n10-20 euros, yeah, good buy, but other than that ..\n\nand that was my short version :p","May 25, 2015","false","93.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

The graphics are just amazing. I was really amazed when I saw it, especially after I re-played Icewind Dale the so called HD edition. That graphic compared to Pillars is like from B.C. Pillars look gorgeous. I really really appreciated the zoom in/zoom out featuire which these types of 2D isometric RPG's were always lacking.\n\nThe music is also very good, and some songs are epic. Remind me the good old times from Baldurs Gate. Fits very very well to this fantasy world. My only problem here was, that after a while it felt repetetive. I am not sure of the songs are just similiar or there arent many of them ( didnt heard the ost ) but I had the feeling when I entered a map that the same music is playing .... again, or atleast a very similiar one.\n\nThe story overall, is basicly what makes these games so good. The story is always huge and complicated in these games. Yes, you read a lot in this game. I am a person who not only read in games ( RPG's ) , but I also read a lot of books and not only fantasy. I must say that the story in Pillars for me was mediocre, or below avarage at its best compared to other games aswell, like Final Fantasy, Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment ( one of the best ). Pillars just doesnt catch up here. People who never played a good story based game, or never read a very good book... they might like Pillar's story but dont expect something mind blowing or something that gives you chills everytime you think about it. It's just not there for me.\n\nSpeaking asbout the story, I think that the NPC's I had in my group or Castle ( waiting for me to pick them up ) werent interesting. Eder ? Aloth ? I really wanted to like them I really tried.... I just couldnt care less about their story. It's not Minsc and Boo from BG, it's not Morte or the Nameless One, It's not Morrigan from Dragon Age. Thats why I created 4 characters on my own and just ignored almost all the NPC sidequests. I didnt enjoyed them. But you dont have to care about this if you didnt played any of these games, it is my little little note which I wanted to share.\n\nThe biggest feature of this game is always the combat, which is amazing in Pillars. It is very dynamic, fast, colorful, bautiful... and also chaotic at the beginning. You can slow it down anytime, or even pause to assign commands. Basicly it works like this. You press spacebar to pause the game, assisng command with every party member. For example, the Paladin activates this spell, atatck with Warrior this enemy, Cast a Fireball with the Mage, Cast a AoE defensive buff with your priest etc.... once you done, you unpause the game and every command you did during the pause will trigger and happen at the same time. Then, you press pause and again.... you assign command ans so on. Easy enemies can be beaten easily without the pause button, but tougher bosses or encounters literally are unplayable without the pause. But thats ok, combat is designed around this in these games.\n\nThe lack of D&D features, names, spells is also a letdown for me. This is not the Baldurs Gate 3 I wanted. I want my Magic Missile not some other looking ( similiar ) spell which is called Minoletta Missiles, it is very confusing at the beginning. You know what was really good in all the previous games ? Once you played any of them and then you jumped on the other one, you didnt had to study all the spells because in the world of D&D every spell did always the same. You had a Magic Missile, Mirror Image, Fireball wtc. in every Black Isle fantasy game. Here I had to read, study, find out what works and what not on my own... I didnt liked it too much, but again IGNORE all this if you never played the previous games. This is my personal note. I understand that implementing the D&D rules is a matter of a lot of money and license but.... oh well.\n\nTook me 60 hours exactly to beat the game. At 51 hours, I was at the final boss, but sadly I couldnt beat him because I was level 7-8 with my party. Had to return here at max level which is 12 btw, and it was suddenly super easy. The point is, that the game didnt told me to do all these sidequests to actually even have chance to beat the final boss. I always thought sidequests are optional, not recommended. A mistake. so dont do the same. You cannot beat the boss I think under level 10, but max is recommended.\n\nOverall the game is really really good. A lot of gametime, possible replayability with multiple and different endings. Looks very pretty, plays very smooth. I had a great time. A comeback of a classic RPG. A reminder in the modern days, what we loved so much in the late 90's. Definitely recommended.\n\n8/10","June 16, 2015","true","60.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I didn't find out about Pillars of Eternity in time to back it on KS, but I began supporting it as soon as I learned of its existence :)\n\nAs a kid I played the old Infinity Engine games. I think my first was Fallout 2, then Fallout, then Planescape: Torment, then everything else. Basically, I cut my teeth in gaming on some of the best (arguably the very best) Western-style CRPGs ever made. It gave me a sincere appreciation for storytelling in games that has served me really well since, though I think any fan of RPGs remembers the dry spell in the 2000s where it looked like CRPGs might irrevocably change to something much lamer, or just not get made anymore. If I had to pick a game that ended that negative outlook, probably The Witcher, by my reckoning, and it has been a great deal better since. I guess it's a real resurgance of craft and storytelling in CRPGs :)\n\nThis game is the best one out of any that I've played since Planescape: Torment, though. Bar none. It has an engrossing story, a brilliantly realized and organic (but mystical!) setting, places that feel truly alien through sincere and earnest effort on the part of the developers. Interactions with NPCs carry the dramatic flair that a VERY good dungeonmaster can bring to a P&P tabletop game, and that feeling is only further enhanced by the clever system of scripted events in the game that have multiple stat or skill checks and require some thought to navigate without peril. They don't happen often enough for you to start predicting every time you'll have one, but they do happen often enough that they are a serious gameplay element and not a gimmicky afterthought. The user interface is a brilliant combination of accessibility and feature-richness, evoking the Infinity Engine interfaces in general but without their frustratingly restrictive control schemes.\n\nI haven't played enough to assess how the game will be in retrospect, after the story has ended. But I am absolutely enthralled by my role in the story so far, and I am not looking forward to the end of it so much as having gone on this awesome gaming journey. You don't get stuff like this often. Buy it, if you're even a little interested you ARE the type of gamer it's for. This will rekindle any person's love for old CRPGs, and I bet it'll make a lot of new fans too!","April 9, 2015","true","140.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

If you enjoy these types of games, you will definitely like Pillars of Eternity.\n\nThe writing and dialog was done very well in the game.

Added it to me wishlist back when it first showed up on Steam.  I did not pick it up however till it was on sale for 50% off. It had many good reviews, so I gambled and bought it.  It's not a bad game, the story is decent enough so far. I can't say it really grabbed me, and made me not want to stop playing like other games have in the past.\n\nSome of the game mechanics, while novel, I just don't care for.  Healing your health is only possible by camping or spending the night at an Inn.  This is seperate from Endurance, which I believe everyone can heal at some point in the game with magic, talents, or abilities, etc. I have heard there are healing potions, but, as of yet, have not found any myself. It might just be the old school RPG player in me, but, this system seems very counter intuitive.  If I just got mauled by a bear, how is spending the night in an Inn or camping in a tent going to heal those wounds up, and yet the classes that in most RPG's online or pen and paper, that can traditionally heal with magic, can't do anything but restore endurance...which is what I consider to happen while resting in an Inn or elsewhere, to do. I have seen several comment on this in various forums, saying it creates a challenge, or finite resource, yadda yadda.  It's a deal breaker for me.  I'm not playing an RPG, for the challenge of deciding how to reduce how many times I have to go stay at an inn or buy more camping gear. But, that's just me I guess.\n\nVisually, it's a good looking game. Some of the maps are a bit small, but, everything I have seen so far, looks good. Spell effects and lighting are well done.\n\nCharacter creation is fairly in depth.  Various choices can create different play styles from the same class. Classes are not restricted to certain weapons and armor, which I did like.  The weapons and armor do have tradeoffs, such has speed of attack, recovery time after using abilities, etc. This in itself creates a new challenge of optimizing your gear to suit your abilites and combat/play style. One of the concepts that I could work with.\n\nCombat is fast paced, and had many options to autopause on various events happening. Also several options for the AI behavior during combat. Although a few times, it seemed like the AI was doing it's own thing, regardless of the settings I had selected.\n\nOverall, just not my cup of tea I guess. Would rather play Balders Gate again or fire up Neverwinter Nights.  I wish I had done a bit more research on it. But that is just speaking for me.","October 6, 2015","false","5.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

Out of the gate the game has the impression of something truly staggering in scope but ultimately lets itself down, like a large painting of Mount Rushmore set up on a cliff.  It's still a nice painting, it's just not quite as impressive as the real thing and setting it up to look like it only deflates the experience.\n\nFor starters the game front-loads itself heavily, throwing a couple small towns with big problems at you that do a good job of setting up the world, the problem is they're static.  Once you solve problem du jour the area is done, the NPCs hardly react to what you've done and nothing of consequence happens in them ever again.  There is one quest that sorta comes back later, but nobody in the town reacts either way the first or second time you deal with it, that's all handled in an epilogue.\n\nThis is a game where weeks pass and country-shaking events unfold.  A little reactivity would be nice, give some life to those areas beyond Questing Zone #.  The whole point of going with the text heavy exposition model is so the developers can add content without adding a whole bunch of assets to the game and it feels like an opportunity was missed when you're wandering through the streets of a town plagued by a cult or a despot weeks ago and every single person is just saying and doing the same things they were before.\n\nThe game also gives you a stronghold.  On the surface you think it might be like Neverwinter Nights 2, where you have to build it up from a ruin and make ruling decisions about the surrounding lands, but you never get so far as deciding anything and the gameplay rewards promised by the various functions of the keep are marginal at best.  It pulls double duty as the Watcher's Keep of the game, and to its credit that part is pretty well done, though that bit has zero connection to actually ruling the Keep and surrounding lands beyond a nonspecific threat that I assume gives you a very frowny epilogue if you don't take care of it.\n\nIt really lost me at the end of Act 2, when a villain so far established as a master of clandestine schemes demonstrates that he can just do whatever he wants whenever he wants.  Adding to that Act 3 feels empty by comparison, even after opening up a 2nd "big city" it lacks any really meaty content to round out the game like Ust Natha did in BG2.\n\nEven with all that said, the story and the big pieces in it are still pretty strong.  Darth Sidious pulling out a lightsaber and murdering everyone he has a problem with not withstanding, all the character motivations and actions are well handled.  It's a little Baldur's Gate here and a little KotoR there and a lot of Jade Empire all over the place, but it all comes together to make something new and interesting.","May 13, 2015","true","84.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

There are plenty of quests, and classes and talents seem to have a lot of depth. Still curious to see what other classes like priest and druid can bring to the table.\n\nCons:\n-Story was vastly inferior to other games like SWOTR and BG2; found myself skipping a lot of the dialouge.\n-From gameplay, plot twists and character interaction, baldur's gate 2 and the first SWOTR did almost everything better.\n-Gameplay and spell mechanics came across as clunky and repetetive; was difficult to notice improvements after gaining certain talents.\n-Quests were ambigiously described (i.e. find cave described in vision).\n-I don't know if it's a pro or a con because of the whole "if it's not broken don't fix it" philosophy, but the game lacked innovation in the sense that at times it came across as an inferior knock off of baldur's gate.\n\nIn short, the game wasn't bad.

CRPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive. First a bit of a disclaimer, I have NOT completed the main story of Pillars of Eternity, I am currently in Act 2 and have put almost 30 hours into the game already. Anyways, on with the review!\n\n---->This game takes lovers of RPGs back to some of the roots of some of the most beloved video games ever, titles like Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale and my personal favorites Fallout and Planescape: Torment are all great examples of CRPGs and some of the highest rated games of all time. I could go on, but, just know that Pillars of Eternity is a game that will take you back to those great experiences while delivering its own. Like all CRPGs the game takes an isometric point of view, you see everything from the sky, looking down, giving you the ability to appreciate grand landscapes and structures that are beautifully done in the game.Things like large buildings, bridges, forest, swamps, the ocean, all are beautifully crafted and the isometric point of view has always been perfect for show-casing these types of games, it looks beautiful and you don't need a top-of-the-line gaming computer to appreciate it. The music scores in CRPGs are usually on par with its excellent graphics and Pillars of Eternity is no different. Every soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and really compliments the atmosphere and setting, the only music that will get annoying is when combat starts, it’s the exact same every time and gets a bit annoying, but the rest of the tracks are amazing.\n\n---->Gameplay is pretty straight forward, use the mouse and click on the ground to move your character, the mouse is your primary device, you have plenty of keyboard hot keys to use as well to assist with things like selecting characters, formations and dialogue options. The interface is nice and slick, not too barebones, not too cluttered and laid out in a very nice fashion, and easily customizable as well. Speaking of customization the character builder in this game rocks! You have a total of five races to choose from, many of which have sub races, then you have eleven classes to choose from, each one quite unique and different and most importantly, useful, you will definitely find favorites but, from my experience, every class can easily be useful alone and in a group and that is a welcomed addition to any RPG. You'll also get to choose color pallets for your characters, multiple voices, and very beautifully detailed portraits. You could and easily will drop many hours in the character creator and still find new characters to create, the best part is the game allowing this to be used throughout the game, as you get the ability to create new companions in addition to finding story ones early in the game, it’s a nice feature, allowing you to create one of every class and try out a multitude of playstyles and strategies for combat.\n\n---->Combat can be hit or miss, I personally enjoy it, but, I can see it being boring or frustrating to some. First, your characters never do anything on their own, even when getting abused with mace blows or shot at with pistols they will stand there taking it all without ever attempting to retaliate. You HAVE to tell your companions exactly what to do no matter what it is, they will not do anything without an order, and when it’s a party of six, fighting multiple bad guys, that can get a bit slow, this isn't helped by the fact that you'll be pausing combat a lot to tell a character to do something after they've done their previous action. Another annoyance with combat is that characters will often run into each other, and will not attempt to move around each other instead, just running forward till whatever is blocking them is out of the way, this makes unit placement annoying and frustrating, I cannot stress enough how important it is to create custom formations to help alleviate this head ache. I'm harsh on the combat but, overall, I enjoy it a lot, the game lets you be as brute force or strategic as you wish and really rewards you for coming up with clever combos and will definitely challenge you with tough fights that will require every bit of cunning and cleverness you can muster. Magic is a lot of fun, spells are flashy and look amazing and actually feel like they pack a punch, they're exciting to use and I would strongly suggest bringing magic along for any fight.\n\n---->Something else you also get fairly early in the game is the Stronghold, this is a player home that you get to upgrade throughout your adventure, allowing you to add multiple shops, a bounty board, a treasury and more. It’s in a ruined state and will look quite impressive as you get closer and closer to completing all of the upgrades, you'll also be able to hire guards to help defend from interlopers, you'll receive taxes to help fund your adventures, and side missions for your companions to do. It’s an awesome castle they give you early on and access to one of the biggest dungeons in the game, there are some missed opportunities with the Stronghold, one that I will share is you can actually arrest NPCs in the world and put them in your prison...and that’s it. You never get to do anything outside of that and your only option is to release them or they will escape on their own eventually. I'm not sure what the point is and haven't discovered anything you can do with it so it just seems kind of pointless, still the Stronghold is awesome and I devoted almost all of my resources early on to restoring it and exploring the dungeon beneath.\n\n---->So the story, hmm, well I haven't finished it so I can't give you a full debrief on it, however, my impression is that it is not as strong or gripping as it could have been. You find out early in the game that you are what is called a Watcher, someone who can peer into the souls of the living, and see the past lives of that person. Unfortunately this awakened something inside yourself and as told to you by a crazy man, you too will suffer the fate of all of your past lives all living with you at the same time, driving you insane and ultimately to your doom. You set out to find a cure and get swept up into other bigger things going on. The story sounds great, the idea of the Watcher is awesome, it just isn't utilized to its fullest; the world becomes background to your concerns, that is to say that at least from the point I’ve played, the world doesn't seem to care about your success or demise. That is a very fitting setting, but it’s a tough sell to engage the player in, since there isn't a life threatening doom approaching, what was needed was strong personal reasons to motivate the player. Again, this all seems very passive and aside from the occasional staring into space, being a Watcher doesn't seem to really be as bad as the world cracks it up to be.\n\n---->Again this is from my point of view and I admit I have not finished the story, but there are only a few acts and by now I would expect to have a full understanding of all that is going on, if they reveal something later on perhaps my opinion will change, but, it shouldn't take till Act 2 to be invested in any story...\n\n[Video Review at: www.youtube.com/RoyialNetwork] (Review was too big for Steam and YouTube, so its been split up link to video above, sorry about that!

Don't double click inventory. If you encounter one of the other bugs, sorry, but the game itself is imminently playable as is. The combat is hard but fun (once you get past the first town's temple which has inexplicably engagement breaking enemies). The art is beautiful. The character creation is extensive and meaningful. The story is rich. The world is rich. The quests are varied. The companions are varied (though they can't compete with nostalgia). The dungeons are deep.\n\nIt's not perfect but it's one of the best RPGs in years. It's not trying to be an MMO like some modern RPGs. It can be obtained legally without DRM! That in and of itself is amazing.\n\nWhile the Dragon Age series has gotten more and more faceroll with thin plots and a built in dating sim, Pillars has focused on making intense, tactical combat and a rich game world, and they did it very well.\n\nDoes the might stat make sense? No. Are there a couple bugs? Yeah. Is it fun as heck? Yes. It's an experience I would recommend to anyone, as it doesn't jerk you off while picking your pocket as is the modern trend. It delivers a real game, with real depth, and many hours of play.

I fell for the crazy hope, that PoE would be like Neverwinter Nights 1/2, just better. I also played Icewinddale and Baldurs Gate (don't remember if 1 or 2). Both of them only for a bit, as they weren't my cup of tea at this time. But even though I didn't play them very long, I had way more fun. I actually remembering that until today(!).\n\nLike many other critics I really tried to like this game. First I thought it was kind of my fault for playing PoE the wrong way. So after some reading I tried it again (hence this amount of hours), because that always helped in the past. This time it didn't help. At all.\nI realised something:\nI just didn't care about my character, I didn't care about their companions and the 'plot' was like: "Well, actually there isn't much plot, sweetheart, but you see, we had to kinda... stretch it for those 3 acts to fit in!"\nSadly those things are exactly what is most important to me...\n\nThis is just my opinion/experience.

Reminds me of C&C 4 and the depature from typical RTS.  Just makes the game un enjoyable. Some say they do this to make it more challenging and or casters are too powerful. I personaly would rather see less dmg on a caster with the ability for me to actually cast without having to rest.  Never knew micromanagement could be done in an RPG - these programmers found a way for that.\n\n- Gone with the Wind type texts for everything.   Overwelming amount of texts for the most simple things.\n\n\nWay overly compliacted.  You have 5 main upgrade choices on levels. Lore Scroll reading, Survival (consumable duration), Stealth,, Mechanics (lock picking), and Athletics.\n\nTypical RPG's use INT / STR / DEX / CON etc where you apply points into these when leveling - not here.  I only found gear could upgrade those and very modestly.\n\nItems / Gear upgrades are very anti - exciting as you realize that any low level item can be "enchanted" to Exceptional / Superb which is the same as the drops you get from bosses - making the boss drops nothing special.\n\nEndurance is now part of the equation similar to "health" - when your endurance hits zero you pass out (in a fight) but your health doesn't improve.  There is no healing or health potions - just endurance.  But you can die apprently if your health goes to zero. Not sure why not just sticking to basic Hitpoints was a bad thing.\n\nMOBS you kill give you virtually no xp - experience gain is mainly quest driven. The items dropped are just an overabundance of useless items maybe for potions or vendor trash.\n\nOne aspect I liked was owning a "stronghold" so you can rest there and get bonus'.  Initially it was great until you realize it's nightmare always attenidng to "unwanted visitors" that you have to pay off to not stay (it brings negative prestige) or escort and are constantly getting invaded that I have to go back to the stronghold (2 days travel) to fight.  You can have it auto resolve by hiring defenders that get paid but that means you can take damage to your stronghold.  Good idea that turned into more micromanagement.\n\nSome may like this unobvious level of micromanagement throughout the game- but I hated it.  I will almost guarantee most any person that plays this game will saving every few minutes if that gives an indicator of frustration.    The dragon fights (possible 3)  - I never got through any of them - not even close to defeating one (i was level 12 the max level).\n\nThe main battle at the end same thing.  I got to the end - but game so frustating - uninstalled the game with only 1 boss to kill at the end.","September 20, 2015","false","113.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

If you like playing a spellcaster, then you will probably hate this game because of the bizarre and excessive limitations placed on their spell casting.  If you like playing an Archer, then you may be disappointed because you are stuck with a weak pet, and when that pet (quickly) dies, you will be stuck doing wimpy damage.  The melee classes are all pretty strong, and they added a strange new type of melee-spellcaster that trumps all of the magic users combined.   It's almost like the devs hated magic users, but begrudgingly allowed one halfway decent class that is "magic but isn't magic" for marketing purposes.   In any case, this is NOT a pick-whatever-class-you-want kind of game.  If you play at the highest difficulty levels, you pretty much are forced to play a fighter of some sort.\n\n\nGamplay:\n\nWhat gameplay?   Most of what you do is auto-attack and waiting for the right moment to use one-shot special abilities.  If you want more excitment, go play bridge or bingo.   This game is all about cooldowns, restrictions, and auto attack.  Once you (very) quickly run out of spells, you will literally be hitting mobs with a book.  Yeah that is about as fun and effective as it sounds.  There is no real strategy involved,  Just smash things before they smash you, and try not to run out of camping gear and spells before the end of a dungeon.\n\nStory:\n\nThe writing is a bit broody and melodramatic, and really a rehash of every fantasy concept ever written.  If it were a novel, I would be embarrased to have it in my collection.  It was not even compelling enough to make it to the middle, let alone the end.\n\nDialog:\n\nThis is actually the best part of the game.  Almost immersive.  Really if you like reading dialog, you might enjoy this game.   But you have to have a high tolerance for all the other snooze-inducing faults of the game.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you loved Balders Gate, but thought the combat didn't impose enough arbitary cooldowns and resitrictions, then you will love this game.","September 18, 2015","false","21.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","8","14","3","1"

Icewindale 2? The story of twin Demons kicked out of hell, who decided to go on a rampage because the human world rejected them? That's edge. Min/Max stats for godly mages/fighters, edgy. Fun.\n\nPillars is, the higher your level, the more overpowered you become, end of story. It gets to a point where your six-peon squad is so deep in DPS that you stop casting spells, buffs, and mostly just watch your team go to town while using a handful of abilities to kill everything, at all times.\n\nPre-buffing was eliminated. Tweaked? Nerfed? No, gone. Armor restrictions as well, which makes for awkward scenarios where I have a Druid in full plate swinging a giant mace in the middle of a fight with the rest of them. I got half way through the game with that character and thought, wait, that's a Druid?\n\nIn Wasteland 2, when I make a team, they have character, my sniper can't move, but kills everything and can take weapons apart to boot. My run and gun is a team leader with great charisma and great bomb disposable skills. My specialist knows the ins and outs of computers, locks, and safes, while being a smart ♥♥♥, but dose the least damage.\n\nMy fighter eh.. uh. My fighter, is in a DPS race with my rouge, and my cipher. Everyone else just kinda stands around taking up space. In pillars I can't latch onto anything I create because the system isn't integrated enough with itself, or with the world it occupies. I have 200 hours and beat the game once, because once you hit lvl 10, you know that's as much fun as you're going to get, and the rest is just talking to uninteresting people, and slogging through what's left.\n\nI dunno, what's going on Obsidian? Where is the beef? Why didn't you just make the god-bomb plot the story of your game? That was edgy, exciting, instead it's background info. What's better, the reincarnation of a god going toe to toe with locals and ending the game with a big frickin' explosion?

The player explores a rich fantasy setting with up to five companions. Though dungeons and questlines are relatively linear, branching dialogue provides various ways for the player to influence the world of Eora and the lives of its inhabitants.\n\nCombat centers around a real-time with pause system, allowing the player to strategically position party members and coordinate their actions. An expertly-balanced learning curve is partnered with four difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard and Path of the Damned), along with two optional game mods (Expert Mode and Trial of Iron) to provide extra challenge for seasoned players.\n\nThe story contains suprrising depth and nuance, provoking unexpected emotion over the course of its many hours. Thematically, Pillars of Eternity explores the immutability of the soul and the role memory plays in informing our conscious and unconscious actions.\n\nGraphically, Pillars of Eternity is a feast for the eyes. Obsidian's artists worked diligently to make little aspects of the world spring to life through the creative use of visual effects and lighting. Using the Unity engine, the developers created environments that appear to have depth, but are actually flat images and planes. A demonstration of how the environments are created can by found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak52BLOFyuo\n\nPillars of Eternity is an instant classic, taking its place alongside other memorable RPGs.","March 28, 2015","true","50.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Unfortunately, combat is a muddy mess of poor programming and bad AI, and the best approach to any combat is find a doorway and exploit the hell out of the repetitive handful of critters.","October 16, 2015","false","129.0"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","10","18","2","0"

This and many other minor overlooked stuff, really brought the game down a level.\n\nI wont get into the spells system or the weapons, i never really felt engaged to the weapons or spells, whatever had the highest damage i used, everything looked the same, and i still finished the game in hard.\n\nA friend of mine also mad about BG2, didnt even finish this game.\n\nWhat mostly annoys me, is that with another 6 months of developing time, this game could have been an 11/10, without really much efforts, just some different choices in the decision making phase....\n\nI was overhyped when it came out, and now im writing a negative review\n\n\n","December 27, 2015","false","98.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

If they fix 2.0 I'll update it with a recommendation.\nUntil then, steer clear, because:\n-Pathing in combat is broken. Your characters will refuse to go where you click, often going an entirely different direction if they move at all.\n-Various spells and powers don't work without setting AI to Aggressive (I don't want AI on at all), which is just silly.\n-Enemies randomly stop attacking and begin regenerating endurance rapidly. Sometimes combat music stops when this happens. Sometimes the re-aggro. Sometimes they don't.\n\nThis is the majority of the problems, but there are other small issues that were introduced as well.\nI hope it's fixed. I really want to recommend this game because it was really good when it was playable. It's just a total mess right now. Combat is unavoidable at various points for many quests, so the whole game is borked at the moment.\n\nEDIT:\nI'm not removing the above, because the fact that it happened at all is a travesty, and should not be forgotten.\n\nI'm still leaving a negative review, because I realised something: I just don't care any more.\nThe loading screens... by the time the next area loads, I've lost the will to live, let alone keep playing, and you'll see them A LOT, especially once you get to the city.\n\nYe gods! The city. "Yaay, made to the city!

You'll need to run many more errands to become strong enough to fight them". I liked 'no combat xp' until this sort of thing kept happening. FORCED meta-gaming. THANKS.\nThe stronghold is just... VIDEO GAMES! Why can I just spend money from a menu? Because VIDEO GAMES! Why do huge stone things just get fixed in days? Because VIDEO GAMES! Why do I just get _handed a castle_? VIDEO GAMES!\n\nThe quests all start out sounding interesting, and end with some petty quibbling, a heavy-handed 'moral decision' that affects nothing, or some combat. That's it.\n\nAll these cool mechanics. All this great lore... for a generic, two-dimensional (metaphorically speaking) game.\n\nOh, and Obsidion relased 3.0 and changed just enough of the base mechanics of the game that I'd want to start over. Then I find out they're working on a licensed digital card game for ♥♥♥♥ing Pathfinder, when I knooow more bugs will creep in.\n\nI don't care any more, Obsidian.

Download a third-party mod to disable auto-saving for a semi-fix.\n\nDue to the auto-save feature requiring the saving of extremely large file sizes (gets worse as the game progresses) each time you load up a new or old area or even a house within that area there is a 1-2min load time. Sounds small, but there are a lot of areas in this game.\nThis is so bad that there is a fairly successful mod designed to simply enable the ability to turn off the autosave feature - this mod has been updated 73 times (upon writing this). A simple fix of allowing the option disable the auto-save feature would make this game playable without mods.\nNote that mods are made redundant with each new update to the game - avoid updating the game until the mod is updated...\n\nTHIS DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL COMPUTERS - check online first to see if someone else has had this problem with your system.

I've been a huge Baldur's Gate fan since forever ago, and i'm really happy that the genre legacy continues (since stupid Dragon Age keeps moving further and further away from it, i'm glad at least someone still tries making these types of games). But I just couldn't get into this one. I think if you're into hardcore d&d and read a ton of that kind of literature - you'll love this. For me the appeal of these games is combat and strategy and it just wasn't enticing enough here. I got so bored towards the end that i rushed through everything, skipping through every dialog.\nOn an unrelated note i thought it was funny that they had that combat music that's pretty much straight out of De-Arnise keep (BG2). And Twin Elms had a theme that was very Kuldahar (Icewind dale).\n\nPros:\nBaldur's gate gameplay.\nStory is not stupid and cheesy.\nYou can create your own party and not have to use official companions.\nThere is a bit of that keep management stuff (although not much).\nDecent amount of content.\nSome interesting combat ideas but read on for cons because those mechanics get meh further into the game.\nParty members have decently unique personalities. Even the bland-♥♥♥ elven mage was spiced up with a secret.\n\nCons:\nWayyyy too much reading: paragraphs and paragraphs of text on every dialog. That may be a pro for some people, but i've read enough in my lifetime and i'm tired of it.\nCombat mechanics too complicated (too many different defenses/resistances/stats/conditions, it may not be more complicated than modern d&d rules but d&d rules have been building up slowly for a long time, while this game just jumps straight into complicatedness.) And i either never found much explanation on how stuff works as far as damage application goes, or i found it and it was more paragraphs of text and i got bored reading it.\nParty members join up too easily and will never leave you, so there wasn't that much roleplaying with them, and also no alignment thing that dramatically restricts how the world perceives you, (yeah yeah there is reputation with different factions but i didn't notice much gameplay difference with that).\nUnique items: that's one of the main complaints i have. They weren't amazing enough or hard enough to get. I want stuff like Carsomyr +5 (BG2). You had to kill one of the hardest enemies in game for it, and only a specific class could use it, but once you get it - it makes a huge difference, (and then you can go after Kangaxx! :P). Here - i got so many clutter drops from enemies and every once in a while there was a small upgrade but it never really made a big enough impact.\n\nAnyway, overall this is not a bad game, and if Steam used a number rating i'd give it a 7 out of 10 maybe. But i didn't love it, i have no desire to replay it, and i wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. It was like going to steak and shake late at night. Nothing else is open, and the milkshakes are good, but the service was mediocre at best and if I had a choice - i would have gone somewhere else.","November 30, 2015","false","43.1"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

Melee is based around "engagements" where a melee unit gets a free attack if an enemy tries to retreat from it. However, this also applies if the enemy tries to shift at all.  This is... problematic in the narrow corridors and dungeons that make up half of the combat arenas, with maybe one or two of your units clogging a doorway that could fit four if engagment allowed shifting of positions.  I now loathe this mechanic, which could be fixed by simply allowing units to slide around each other without breaking engagement.\n\nThe interface is muddy at best.  Battles are obscured behind a cloud of muddy particle effects that don't settle until one or the other side is dead, leaving you looking at a cluster of indistinguishable green and red circles and imagining the epic battle that must be going on under the looney-tunes cloud of dust.\n\nI'm a fan of taking tactical advantage of terrain in a fight, and this game did nothing to scratch that itch.  Different dungeons are tactically interchangable.  I was particularly disappointed by several abilites with strong pushback being thwarted by the fact that every deadly cliff and pit of acid is guarded by an invisible wall.

Can not hold a candle against old school RPG's like Baldurs Gate or the Black Eye (the very very old one).\n\nIt looks okay on the first glance, but the deeper you go the more boring it gets. Sure, there's a ton of spells and recipes and skills. But all the spells are for damage or protection, the enhancements is just luck about what you will find (no foraging skills or anything like that). The levelups are to far between. The whole thing is more trying to confuse you in quantity instead of quality.\n\nThat is also true for the group. 6 guys plus 1 pet and if you have a few creature spells you are with 12 guys in a fight. It's just to much. The AI is dumb as f*** and no matter what you activate, if you don't control each one of these guys by hand and tell them to use a special attack they really won't be efficient or use it clever at all.\n\nAnd so the fights become more of a bore then fun. And really, without the fights there isn't much left. The world feels stale. Characters just stand around doing nothing. Also finding quest givers is hard work, there is no indication where they could be.\n\nI can only imagine that the high ratings for this game come from the fact that there is simply no alternative if you like remotely this kind of game. But really, I prefer to pack out Baldurs Gate again then playing this crap any further.","October 29, 2015","false","8.3"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","24","46","0","0"

It's way too much too often.\n2) A very bad bug that occured  late in the game. One of my main NPCs (Eder) I took out of my party for a little bit, and when I put him back in, all of his gear was gone, he was level 1, and the next time I loaded, he was missing from my character roster completely. Losing an entire character with a lot of time-earned gear was very frustrating.\n3) The lore comes at you with an assumption that you already know some of it, or so it seems. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, throwing names of regions, races, gods, historical events, etc, at you. It might be a bit better paced, but that could be preference.\n4) Minor, but... The kickstarter backer NPCs. They're pointless, and they're all over the place (the first town is especially bad).

I've played almost 50 hours now and it's utterly brilliant. In a time where CRPGs have been reduced to AAA titles with QTEs, linear progression and being spoon feed every morsel of information Pillars comes as a blessing of both nostalgia and fresh air. The character creation is brilliant, the classes deep and interesting and the combat is strategic and tough, yet very rewarding. But it it's the lore and the graphics that really makes this game so brilliant. Your adventures in Dyrwood will immerse you into a world with a rich history, interesting races, frightful monsters, a pantheon of gods, and tons of interesting NPCs. The hand drawn graphics really brings this wonderful world to life in a way 3D graphics just can't.\n\nFor the younger players or those who never played the classics CRPGs of the late 90s, get ready for a bit of shock. Be ready to spend hours reading text, from old tomes, diaries to treaties on local history, books on culture, religion and factions. You'll also spend lot of the game time reading descriptions of characters and events. The game won't spoon feed you lore, it asks you to find out by yourself. It asks you to explore and understand, like all great RPGs should. This is a game that asks you to invest and apply yourself, but if you do it will reward you handsomely for it. The world feels more real and immersive because of it.\n\nIn short, this is wonderful game and all RPG fans need to pick it up, because we need more games like it.","April 3, 2015","true","314.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It captured the essence of what made infinity engine games so enjoyable to play and I see myself as a youngling in front of his computer once again.\n\nThat being said, this game is, actually, overrated. In fact nearly everything is better executed in BG2. The AI  (ennemies or friends) was better, the UI was better, the story too (event though I'm not nearly finished with it, I played for some times, 10-12 hours, and it is slow to take off...), spell variety is lacking....\n\nAnd if you think it's nostalgia, I played my last BG game one year ago. In Pillars, when you are behind a tree or a house you see nothing (no option of semi-transparency), you cannot force the orientation of a non-walking character, you don't see what you gain from quest ("Well, thank you. Here seome gold as rewards !" - wanna know how many ? Well open the inventory before talking to the PNJ, loot at your amount of gold, talk to the PNJ, substract...). The pathfinding is shamefull, especially in combat ; the other NPC lacks depth ("Hmmm I'm bored.... I guess I will come with you. I just like defying death for no reason") ; secondary quests are somewhat superficial...\nAnd some things in need of a serious upgrade were not done (formation is well and good but if they do not move like it it's useless).\n\nI repeat : it's a very good game for RPG lovers such as myself. But the realization is not on par with a 15 years old game.... So even if it's a good game it does not gain his place as one of the best RPG of all times : too close to Infinity Engine games to not be compared, with too much downscale from this games (even though there's some enhancement like character animation).","March 30, 2015","true","94.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/julma/recommended/291650/","julma","Julmis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/julma/","268 products in account","Before i say anything, i just want to point out that this game kicks butt of ALL bigger title RPG's that have been made recently. I cant believe that Obsidian was almost on the verge of shutting its doors, and then they came up with something like Pillars of eternity. In my opinion, the brightest star of RPG industry currently and the best possible tribute anyone could have done for Baldurs gate's, Icewind Dale's etc. PC D&D rpg games.\n\nIf baldurs gate's 1/2, icewind dale's 1/2 were you thing back in the days, i can tell you Pillars of eternity just brought the genre back! Beautiful hand made graphics, orchestral music, top notch plot etc. brings me back to the days when games had just the right amount of difficulty and the player wasn't lead from the hand in every turn.\n\nAnd dont worry, the game isnt stuck to the early years of rpg's. The UI is very well made to the modern standards, as is many other things such as possibility of "hiring" a companion wich is basically creating a filler character in your group by yourself.\n\nThe hiring system is a genius idea honestly, as you want to have a full group as soon as possible early on in the game. Later on you can also of course find groupable NPC's that have a personality, opinions and own agenda wich you can choose to proceed if you will.\n\nSo now you get to make a group with every other npc character in game, as you can simply fill the empty spots with the hiring system. Smart.\n\nAs you play the game a bit further, you get your own stronghold where you can build stuff, switch your companions, get buffs after sleeping there etc. Its a great idea, because you start to get overflowing with money at some point eventually. You need to hire guards wich take weekly payment etc.\n\nAlso you can send your overflow hirelings to do your bidding in case you get a writ. Usually a smart move too.\n\nOne thing i really loved, was how the inventory was made. Can't tell you how many times i almost lost my nerve (except in bg2 with bag of holding :) when i had inventory full of stuff and no idea where to put all that junk.\n\nAnd now... the part that i really REALLY love in this game:\n\nYou can carry as much stuff as you ever will want. You have an option to drop stuff to stash whenever you want, and your inventory will never be stuffed of hundreds of "junk" -items, wich btw are worth collecting and selling to vendors as you get back to town.\n\nAlso i've found out that all the items you find (mushrooms, jewels etc.) are in fact useful and worth keeping instead of selling. All books, papers etc. include tips if you read them carefully and use your imagination.\n\nIf you find jewels and herbs etc. you can use them for enchanting/crafting. I even found vendors selling crowbars, climbing hooks with rope, torches etc. All these items that i found useful eventually. Every now and then you gotta pry some bars aside, climb a wall, or possibly torch something up possibly.\n\nAND yes! You can craft anywhere! You can select the item you want to "enchant" and just do it on the spot without finding a forge and flapping thru useless junk in your inventory for hours. This makes the game much more straightforward (in a good sense) and you dont get stuck at inventory for ages.\n\nAlso no grinding is involved for crafting. Theres no skill's or such required from what i've seen, no farming etc. You simply check what enchants, foods, potions you want/can make and just hit craft. Sometimes you can learn a recipe or such, but overall ive found crafting ever so deliciously simple.\n\nObsidian clearly has realized that spending time in inventory instead of playing has been a fun killer for ages. Theres a lesson to be learned from this for all the big budget RPG -maker's.\n\nWhat i've played this game so far, only problem i find that im scared as heck to play it because time goes like ZAP!\n\nI've allready washed my laundry twice and forgotten it to the washing machine. 3rd time is about to happen, because i'm just too stuck on this game... ;D","March 28, 2015","true","68.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It captured the essence of what made infinity engine games so enjoyable to play and I see myself as a youngling in front of his computer once again.\n\nThat being said, this game is, actually, overrated. In fact nearly everything is better executed in BG2. The AI  (ennemies or friends) was better, the UI was better, the story too (event though I'm not nearly finished with it, I played for some times, 10-12 hours, and it is slow to take off...), spell variety is lacking....\n\nAnd if you think it's nostalgia, I played my last BG game one year ago. In Pillars, when you are behind a tree or a house you see nothing (no option of semi-transparency), you cannot force the orientation of a non-walking character, you don't see what you gain from quest ("Well, thank you. Here seome gold as rewards !" - wanna know how many ? Well open the inventory before talking to the PNJ, loot at your amount of gold, talk to the PNJ, substract...). The pathfinding is shamefull, especially in combat ; the other NPC lacks depth ("Hmmm I'm bored.... I guess I will come with you. I just like defying death for no reason") ; secondary quests are somewhat superficial...\nAnd some things in need of a serious upgrade were not done (formation is well and good but if they do not move like it it's useless).\n\nI repeat : it's a very good game for RPG lovers such as myself. But the realization is not on par with a 15 years old game.... So even if it's a good game it does not gain his place as one of the best RPG of all times : too close to Infinity Engine games to not be compared, with too much downscale from this games (even though there's some enhancement like character animation).","March 30, 2015","true","94.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/julma/recommended/291650/","julma","Julmis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/julma/","268 products in account","Before i say anything, i just want to point out that this game kicks butt of ALL bigger title RPG's that have been made recently. I cant believe that Obsidian was almost on the verge of shutting its doors, and then they came up with something like Pillars of eternity. In my opinion, the brightest star of RPG industry currently and the best possible tribute anyone could have done for Baldurs gate's, Icewind Dale's etc. PC D&D rpg games.\n\nIf baldurs gate's 1/2, icewind dale's 1/2 were you thing back in the days, i can tell you Pillars of eternity just brought the genre back! Beautiful hand made graphics, orchestral music, top notch plot etc. brings me back to the days when games had just the right amount of difficulty and the player wasn't lead from the hand in every turn.\n\nAnd dont worry, the game isnt stuck to the early years of rpg's. The UI is very well made to the modern standards, as is many other things such as possibility of "hiring" a companion wich is basically creating a filler character in your group by yourself.\n\nThe hiring system is a genius idea honestly, as you want to have a full group as soon as possible early on in the game. Later on you can also of course find groupable NPC's that have a personality, opinions and own agenda wich you can choose to proceed if you will.\n\nSo now you get to make a group with every other npc character in game, as you can simply fill the empty spots with the hiring system. Smart.\n\nAs you play the game a bit further, you get your own stronghold where you can build stuff, switch your companions, get buffs after sleeping there etc. Its a great idea, because you start to get overflowing with money at some point eventually. You need to hire guards wich take weekly payment etc.\n\nAlso you can send your overflow hirelings to do your bidding in case you get a writ. Usually a smart move too.\n\nOne thing i really loved, was how the inventory was made. Can't tell you how many times i almost lost my nerve (except in bg2 with bag of holding :) when i had inventory full of stuff and no idea where to put all that junk.\n\nAnd now... the part that i really REALLY love in this game:\n\nYou can carry as much stuff as you ever will want. You have an option to drop stuff to stash whenever you want, and your inventory will never be stuffed of hundreds of "junk" -items, wich btw are worth collecting and selling to vendors as you get back to town.\n\nAlso i've found out that all the items you find (mushrooms, jewels etc.) are in fact useful and worth keeping instead of selling. All books, papers etc. include tips if you read them carefully and use your imagination.\n\nIf you find jewels and herbs etc. you can use them for enchanting/crafting. I even found vendors selling crowbars, climbing hooks with rope, torches etc. All these items that i found useful eventually. Every now and then you gotta pry some bars aside, climb a wall, or possibly torch something up possibly.\n\nAND yes! You can craft anywhere! You can select the item you want to "enchant" and just do it on the spot without finding a forge and flapping thru useless junk in your inventory for hours. This makes the game much more straightforward (in a good sense) and you dont get stuck at inventory for ages.\n\nAlso no grinding is involved for crafting. Theres no skill's or such required from what i've seen, no farming etc. You simply check what enchants, foods, potions you want/can make and just hit craft. Sometimes you can learn a recipe or such, but overall ive found crafting ever so deliciously simple.\n\nObsidian clearly has realized that spending time in inventory instead of playing has been a fun killer for ages. Theres a lesson to be learned from this for all the big budget RPG -maker's.\n\nWhat i've played this game so far, only problem i find that im scared as heck to play it because time goes like ZAP!\n\nI've allready washed my laundry twice and forgotten it to the washing machine. 3rd time is about to happen, because i'm just too stuck on this game... ;D","March 28, 2015","true","68.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is what you would expect from an old school RPG like Baldurs Gate. However, the graphics could be better (try zoom in and you can see how unclear the visuals look). Some of the dialogue is voiced, but most is not. Maybe they will do more voiced dialogue with updates. I think the game is worth the money, but I feel it could have been better. The gaming experience is not "WAUW OMG!", but it is a  pretty good game in the genre. There is a lot of quests with lots of story and dialogue (if you dont like that, then you wont like the quests very much - although you can skip them and let the quests descriptions in the journal guide you instead, if you dont care about the stories anyway. Thus, it is not a huge problem). I would say that game is like 7,5/10 for its genre. There are some combat mechanis from Divinity of Original Sin, which you could have taken into this game. Fx. lightning on pools of water make it electrical and gives lightning damage to those going into it, or being able to freeze a pool of water into ice. The music and sounds in Pillars of Eternity is much better than in Divinity of Original Sin. Also, the characters in Pillars of Eternity are interesting, which makes you want to them a little better. Anyway, all in all it is a highly recomendable game for those who like the genre. You pretty much get what you would expect and there is a lot of hours of gameplay in it, so you get the moneys worth of content.","April 6, 2015","true","60.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which.... well I guess that's not saying much since there haven't been many but...\n\nGreat writing on par with Planescape Torment (though lacking the same depth, somewhat), good interface, interesting, intuitive yet simple combat system.\n\nLittle threadbare in some places.  Item diversity could have used some work, as could the crafting system.  And there were some great opportunities for player-specific interaction when backgrounds/homelands/races etc intertwined that were left unexplored.  Also no romance options, which was a bummer, since those were some of the best story sections of games like Baldur's Gate 2.  You could tell they wanted to do everything but ran out of time or money at some point.  Looking forward to expansions/sequels/new games of the same type now that Obsidian has decent proof that games like this can make a profit.\n\nJust... if you liked BG2, buy this game.

Azbolg the Gaming Orc to review the quasi-renaissance fantasy Pillars of Eternity by Obsidian Entertainment.\n\nA grass roots crowd funding campaign, with over 77,000 backers, raising over 4 million dollars, as it recreated, and maybe surpasses the magic of the classic 3d isometric games of the 90s, the Baldur’s Gate series.  If you are a fan of that series, this game is a definite full price buy, with over 70 hours of content, and if you’re not familiar with the classics of ye old times, and are a fan of real-time strategy, D&D party mechanics, epic storytelling with a vast an immersive world, this game is also for you.\n\nThe game begins in a detailed character creation with some new races that I haven’t seen before since my time in Azergoth.  I picked a Wind Godlike Cypher, since I’ve played almost every combo in these kind of games, and this race class combo was refreshing to see something new and creative.  After seeing what kind of companions you can get, I would have re-rolled to an evil halfing monk with the evil voice, since there isn’t any monks companions in the game.  This isn’t a big deal though, because you can hire a custom adventurers of your exact choosing similar to the character creation process at any inn in the game.  It scales off your level too so don’t get too hung up about it.\n\nhttp://pillarsofeternity.gamepedia.com/Party?cookieSetup=true\n\nThe game takes place in an immersive world of Eora, inside a nation known as Dyrwood.  Your character witnesses a ritual and awakens, where you are known commonly as a “Watcher.”  You are now like the boy in the six sense, but hopefully less oblivious, you can speak with dead people, and touch objects to get visions of their past.  Your journey is more or less open-ended, guided by a quest journal.\n\nThe music is incredible.  A mix between Lord of the Rings, and also brings back memories of Conan the Barbarian running the fields with his Asian nomad companion, but after listening to it on its own, outside of the game, it reminded me of a mystic mystery, which is what this game is.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmAiP__OB9k\n\nThe unpredictability, and freedom this game gives you, is what keeps you addictively playing like a gamer craving midnight mountain dew.  For example, a boy will tell you a secret if you get him a knife made out of special metal.  You can intimidate him and throw him to the curb like the little snot that he is, or go talk to the merchant who sold the knife to some adventures who you can buy it from or attack them and take it by force, and still decide to kick the puny human kid anyways.  Or it could be as simple as breaking up a drug dealer’s den only to find out things aren’t what they seemed.  There are so many outcomes and options, and it’s up to you as the player to be bewildered by how open all of them are too fit your character’s play style.\n\nA feature Pillars of Eternity has superior to the Baldur’s Gate series is that it allows you to have a stronghold which you can improve upon with time and gold.  It’s too bad you can only build one feature at a time though, but the options are so dynamic and fun, you can even repair the dungeon to imprison people in across your journeys.\nAnother epic feature of the game is the endless paths below your stronghold.  A standalone game within its own right.  The map is remarkably creative, none like I’ve seen before.  The winding twisting paths are mysterious as you venture forth through the depths to discover who built it.  It is so massive and epic, and addicting!\n\nA few negative criticisms about the game is that you pretty much have to read the whole story’s dialogue.  So you if you are lazy and don’t like to read detailed and captivating storytelling, then this game is not for you.  So accidently you might read and miss some over some key plot points, partly because the dialogue is so rich.  Also sometimes the NPCs will voiced randomly at times, and other times will not be voiced at all, which tells me either that the dialogue was changed or the voice actor couldn’t act it all out, which is disappointing since the voice acting is great, but overall this breaks the immersion.  I wish this game was completely voice acted, even with all the coughs, yacks, and other things, which I hope a sequel or expansion will bring.\n\nA few tips that I can suggest to you if you are going to play it are to turn up the graphics, since they are set a the middle by default, and also you can key bind abilities by moussing over them and hitting the key you want them to be bound too.  If you find the game is too easy, you can raise the difficulty, but I haven’t even at normal difficulty as some casual fights require pause-by-pause tactics.\n\nPillars of eternity is a vast D&D party adventure with epically rich storytelling, and those fans of these type of strategy RPG games will find that this game not only stand among the classics, but in many ways surpasses them with its unique take on a forgotten game style.  Azbolg gives this game 9 Orc axes out of 10.\n\nThis is Azbolg wishing you well human, like,  subscribe, comment, and see you on the battlefield.\n\n\nMusic:\nPillars of Eternity Soundtrack 12 - Engwithan Ruins (Justin Bell)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5xrgn4CKjs&list=PL0w2QA7IXPn7g2Bu3IQ2vt2MTLfJbGEpg&index=12\n","April 8, 2015","true","44.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has replay value and Obsidian continues to patch it up. The combat is fun and you will get obliretaed if you don't plan out your strategy. Character builds are very detailed as well, so take your time with that build. Be forwarned though, the game is very buggy and crashes randomly to the Desktop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/huud007/recommended/291650/","huud007","Huud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/huud007/","50 products in account","The goal for Pillars of Eternity was to recapture the essence of old RPG games like Balder's Gate or Icewind Dale.  This game not only succeeds at this...it triumphs.  Character creation is very easy to follow with excellent descriptions and explanations to help you understand your stats, spells, etc.. In-game controls and UI are also easy to master; and with a multitude of options for customizing what you see, how you see it, and when the game will pause itself, you will feel comfortable playing in no time.\n\nWhile all of that is a major plus, making the game fun to play, the best part of Pillars of Eternity is the story.  The developers could've easily just have done a simple fantasy trope and put the Baulder's Gate skin over it.  Here though, we have a very interesting and engrossing story, one that I instantly fell into and became obsessed over.  Some of the descriptions are down-right poetic.  The music is very well done as well, really captuing the fantasy spirit.\n\nThis game will not be fore everyone though.  If you do not like reading a lot of text or if you don't like a lot of point and click dialogue; Pillars of Eternity will not appeal to you.  There are no fast-paced combat maneuvers or CGI cutscenes.  Most of the cutscenes are simply displayed like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Novel and combat is really simply picking an attack or spell and unpausing the game to see what happens.  If such a notion doesn't appeal to you, then I would pass on this.  If you have played/enjoyed Balder's Gate or Icewind Dale back in the day or now on your mobile device...then you really will love this game.","March 29, 2015","true","55.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForPsyence/recommended/291650/","ForPsyence","Subbie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ForPsyence/","791 products in account","An instant classic, but not without its flaws.\n\nKickstarter as a history when it comes to nostalgia-bait titles aimed to fans of certain genres, but sadly, the majority of crowdfunded to live up to the expecations they set themselves by appealing to those fans in the first place. For every Shovel Knight, you have dozens of other offerings ranging from mediocre to just flat out bad.\n\nThankfully, Pillars of Eternity is to CRPG's what Shovel Knight is to Platformers - It doesn't just evoke memories of it's influences, but instead draws up a chair to sit amongst them. Pillars does too much right for me to accurately sum up its brilliance (and shortcomings) in a few paragraphs, but regardless, I'll try my best.\n\nGameplay is highly customizatable, with multiple tweaks available for all aspects of the game. If you want no help/tooltips while in conversation, but you don't really want the combat to be too hard, then you can do that easily enough. If the reverse is true, and you fancy your chats brief, and your combat nearly impossible, then that's just as easy to set up! It's a very elegant system that, instead of tying multiple values to the same difficulty, allows you to play the game as you wish to play it. And after that, you get to spend an hour (at least) making your perfect hero in Character Select - Woo! Character creation is top notch, with so many variables for each & every class that your character will almost certainly be unique. Each class has it's own pros and cons, and the spell diversity available is nothing short of amazing... Oh, and don't listen to anyone who says Wizards aren't that good - Wizards are awesome!\n\nThe story isn't easy - It's anything but. Expect to be VERY confused for the first few hours while every NPC around you references various places & people you've never heard of before as if you're one with the world. But, as time goes by, and it all comes together, you'll be thankful for the early rounds you suffered at the hands of Obsidian's literary boxers. The fascinating world is enhanced by a selection of very varied companions, but I can't overlook the limited number of them available. This could be one of the few cases where a somewhat limited (yet very generous KS) budget might not have allowed them the time to do so, but I really would've hoped for at least one NPC per class. As it is, there's a couple of classes that you can only experience when you make them yourself, which means you're going to endure a lot of silence unless you find yourself writing up a character backstory yourself - Try it!\n\nThe art is some of the best I've seen in any videogame. While it may look a tad dated from the compressed screenshots you've seen online, it all makes sense once you boot the game up and admire the beautifully handcrafted environment and real time lighting effects. The sound design is, for the most part, just as solid, however there's a noticeable lack of variety in music. Every combat encounter, regardless of it's importance, is accompanied by the same instrumental piece. It really would've added to the effect of the larger boss encounters if they'd had a new tune like the Curst Battle in PS:T, but hey, it's a minor complaint.\n\nOkay, so what's wrong with the game? Other than the minor gripes listed above, the game does currently have a few bugs that, thankfully, Obsidian should be patching this week. Keybindings could also be handled a lot better. When in combat, if you hover over a spell and press a key, the game will automatically bind that ability to that key - Great, right? But you're never told which keys you can and can't use, and simple things like unbinding the M (map) key while in combat to allow it to be used as an ability should be pretty obvious, but sadly isn't catered for. And damn, aiming wall abilities with just a mouse can be a pain in the backside, but it's manageable.\n\nMinor gripes that, for the most part, don't detract from the overall experience. It's a stunning game that's best experienced blind, so do yourself a favour and give the game a chance before jumping onto YouTube to check out a few videos.","April 1, 2015","true","130.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It can be played as if it is a turn-based game, it can also be played as if its not. The main thing that seperates this game from others is difficulty. You might (and probably will) get stuck on a certain enemy at some point in the game. That just means you need to change your tactics or go level up or change your party. Once you do beat that...one enemy... that one group... it feels good. Much like the retro games like Contra, although not NEAR as hard.

I'd rather play thru whole game lovin it than just rush thru it and then start a new char to play properly.\n\n+Deep character creation without limitations like "warriors use 2h swords and rogues only daggers" **\n+Story so far\n+Combat\n\n-** But this might lead you to the point where you start allover like me realizing your char is weird with weird stats so study each stat if not familiar yet\n-Graphical style is beautiful but there could be more interactive things/modern touch like Divinity Original Sin had.\n\nI'm not a reaviewer so thats all I say.","April 2, 2015","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seemed that those good ol' days of infinity engine (as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale were all part of our youth) were all gone. With games like Pillars of Eternity you can rest well and enjoy the fact that your hopes were fulfilled. We still have a bunch of people who miss those unforgiving dense plots with enchanting narratives and with an engine that allows us to weave that variety of spells and live through unforgettable battles.

This game not only succeeds at this...it triumphs.  Character creation is very easy to follow with excellent descriptions and explanations to help you understand your stats, spells, etc.. In-game controls and UI are also easy to master; and with a multitude of options for customizing what you see, how you see it, and when the game will pause itself, you will feel comfortable playing in no time.\n\nWhile all of that is a major plus, making the game fun to play, the best part of Pillars of Eternity is the story.  The developers could've easily just have done a simple fantasy trope and put the Baulder's Gate skin over it.  Here though, we have a very interesting and engrossing story, one that I instantly fell into and became obsessed over.  Some of the descriptions are down-right poetic.  The music is very well done as well, really captuing the fantasy spirit.\n\nThis game will not be fore everyone though.  If you do not like reading a lot of text or if you don't like a lot of point and click dialogue; Pillars of Eternity will not appeal to you.  There are no fast-paced combat maneuvers or CGI cutscenes.  Most of the cutscenes are simply displayed like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Novel and combat is really simply picking an attack or spell and unpausing the game to see what happens.  If such a notion doesn't appeal to you, then I would pass on this.  If you have played/enjoyed Balder's Gate or Icewind Dale back in the day or now on your mobile device...then you really will love this game.","March 29, 2015","true","55.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Deep, interesting world, great visuals, awesome music, truly living npcs with their own backgrounds.\n\nI am really amazed by the hit system. No more binary hit/miss with flat 5% crit chance. The mechanics built for attack rolls and miss/graze/hit/crit is really awesome. And the best thing is, it works the same on every aspect. Exactly the same formulas work for swinging a sword and casting a spell.\n\nI am playing a paladin and I am really happy that for the first time paladins aren't just uber-good warriors in shining armors. You can select from multiple ways of life, you can be a cruel/aggresive paladin, honest/diplomatic, rational/stoic and more. There is no trivial good-evil axis. There are many dispositions, many possibilities of action.\n\nIt is like taking all that is best in Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment and improving it 300% so that it matches the expectations of today's gamers.\n\nI am harsh when it comes to rating games, but Pillars of Eternity is peremptorily 10/10.","April 8, 2015","true","249.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It captured the essence of what made infinity engine games so enjoyable to play and I see myself as a youngling in front of his computer once again.\n\nThat being said, this game is, actually, overrated. In fact nearly everything is better executed in BG2. The AI  (ennemies or friends) was better, the UI was better, the story too (event though I'm not nearly finished with it, I played for some times, 10-12 hours, and it is slow to take off...), spell variety is lacking....\n\nAnd if you think it's nostalgia, I played my last BG game one year ago. In Pillars, when you are behind a tree or a house you see nothing (no option of semi-transparency), you cannot force the orientation of a non-walking character, you don't see what you gain from quest ("Well, thank you. Here seome gold as rewards !" - wanna know how many ? Well open the inventory before talking to the PNJ, loot at your amount of gold, talk to the PNJ, substract...). The pathfinding is shamefull, especially in combat ; the other NPC lacks depth ("Hmmm I'm bored.... I guess I will come with you. I just like defying death for no reason") ; secondary quests are somewhat superficial...\nAnd some things in need of a serious upgrade were not done (formation is well and good but if they do not move like it it's useless).\n\nI repeat : it's a very good game for RPG lovers such as myself. But the realization is not on par with a 15 years old game.... So even if it's a good game it does not gain his place as one of the best RPG of all times : too close to Infinity Engine games to not be compared, with too much downscale from this games (even though there's some enhancement like character animation).","March 30, 2015","true","94.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/julma/recommended/291650/","julma","Julmis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/julma/","268 products in account","Before i say anything, i just want to point out that this game kicks butt of ALL bigger title RPG's that have been made recently. I cant believe that Obsidian was almost on the verge of shutting its doors, and then they came up with something like Pillars of eternity. In my opinion, the brightest star of RPG industry currently and the best possible tribute anyone could have done for Baldurs gate's, Icewind Dale's etc. PC D&D rpg games.\n\nIf baldurs gate's 1/2, icewind dale's 1/2 were you thing back in the days, i can tell you Pillars of eternity just brought the genre back! Beautiful hand made graphics, orchestral music, top notch plot etc. brings me back to the days when games had just the right amount of difficulty and the player wasn't lead from the hand in every turn.\n\nAnd dont worry, the game isnt stuck to the early years of rpg's. The UI is very well made to the modern standards, as is many other things such as possibility of "hiring" a companion wich is basically creating a filler character in your group by yourself.\n\nThe hiring system is a genius idea honestly, as you want to have a full group as soon as possible early on in the game. Later on you can also of course find groupable NPC's that have a personality, opinions and own agenda wich you can choose to proceed if you will.\n\nSo now you get to make a group with every other npc character in game, as you can simply fill the empty spots with the hiring system. Smart.\n\nAs you play the game a bit further, you get your own stronghold where you can build stuff, switch your companions, get buffs after sleeping there etc. Its a great idea, because you start to get overflowing with money at some point eventually. You need to hire guards wich take weekly payment etc.\n\nAlso you can send your overflow hirelings to do your bidding in case you get a writ. Usually a smart move too.\n\nOne thing i really loved, was how the inventory was made. Can't tell you how many times i almost lost my nerve (except in bg2 with bag of holding :) when i had inventory full of stuff and no idea where to put all that junk.\n\nAnd now... the part that i really REALLY love in this game:\n\nYou can carry as much stuff as you ever will want. You have an option to drop stuff to stash whenever you want, and your inventory will never be stuffed of hundreds of "junk" -items, wich btw are worth collecting and selling to vendors as you get back to town.\n\nAlso i've found out that all the items you find (mushrooms, jewels etc.) are in fact useful and worth keeping instead of selling. All books, papers etc. include tips if you read them carefully and use your imagination.\n\nIf you find jewels and herbs etc. you can use them for enchanting/crafting. I even found vendors selling crowbars, climbing hooks with rope, torches etc. All these items that i found useful eventually. Every now and then you gotta pry some bars aside, climb a wall, or possibly torch something up possibly.\n\nAND yes! You can craft anywhere! You can select the item you want to "enchant" and just do it on the spot without finding a forge and flapping thru useless junk in your inventory for hours. This makes the game much more straightforward (in a good sense) and you dont get stuck at inventory for ages.\n\nAlso no grinding is involved for crafting. Theres no skill's or such required from what i've seen, no farming etc. You simply check what enchants, foods, potions you want/can make and just hit craft. Sometimes you can learn a recipe or such, but overall ive found crafting ever so deliciously simple.\n\nObsidian clearly has realized that spending time in inventory instead of playing has been a fun killer for ages. Theres a lesson to be learned from this for all the big budget RPG -maker's.\n\nWhat i've played this game so far, only problem i find that im scared as heck to play it because time goes like ZAP!\n\nI've allready washed my laundry twice and forgotten it to the washing machine. 3rd time is about to happen, because i'm just too stuck on this game... ;D","March 28, 2015","true","68.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Loving it to death :)  Interesting to see that we can still have great written story this days : the story about gods and reincarnation it's pretty mature subject. I hope the little bugs I have seen will be fixed soon and I can't wait to play an expansion and a sequel. I think it's better then BG1 but not 2 and the fact that it's not D&D makes me love it even more. I hope they will implement more options for party AI and random enounters. Arcanum still remains the best RPG for me but I'm happy to see new lore. The graphics in this game is amazing! I don't understand people that says it's mediocre because I understand how much work the put in and it shows : every weapon is made with detail and care, the background , 3D models and lightning looks amazing. Another great thing it's the option to increase the size of the text : I played it at 130% because it has a lot of text and it's really great to not have to stare at the monitor or TV in order to read it with ease.

A couple more hours in, I am still impressed by the scope of Pillars of Eternity...but somehow I can't help but feel slightly let down.\n\nThat's not to say that there isn't an awful lot they DID do right. The combat, e.g., has been given a successful overhaul. It's still  fun and deep, but plays out a lot faster and seems far less dependent on fairly random crowd control effects from the old games. I also like the little touches like the per-battle (rather than per-day) abilities, the fast movement mode, and innovative classes like the Chanter.\n\nAlso, in general the story and dialogue are interesting, although I do agree with some reviews that the entire affair does tend to get a bit long-winded and a bit too serious at times.\n\nThat being said..I feel the whole thing is a bit uninspired. The quests, the level design,  and even the loot (basically you get very little good stuff, you have to enchant it) certainly get the job done, but it never strays far from the established formula and all feels a bit...bland. Compared to the freshness of e.g. Divinity: Original Sin, which did manage to bring something truly new to the table in spite of being decidedly old school as well, PoE is a letdown. It also falls quite a bit short of the game it's so obviously paying hommage to, Baldur's Gate 2..that game constantly managed to surprise you with great level designs and quests..here I've waded through 7 levels of Endless Path dungeon without anything that stood out.\n\nMaybe this comes across as overly harsh, since it is a good game and I am enjoying it, but it does feel like quantity over quality..they basically throw everything but the kitchen sink at you and hope it will stick. Most of it does, and there are some really good idea on display here, but a lot also feels like padding (far too many samey accounters, a flimsy stronghold...ironically, exactly the things that Dragon Age origins also did wrong)\n\n","April 21, 2015","true","92.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each chapter begins with a well written and well spoken introduction that pulls you into the story and makes it come alive. Along with the truly interesting story line is a great isometric combat system and a robust character creation system. I have'nt been pulled into a story like this ever. It was all I could talk about for weeks after getting it. The voice acting though sparse is well done and well written, and the game looks amazing. The different environments all have a life of their own. The combat may be difficult at first but once you get a full party going and get the hang of how each class plays a role in combat you can tackle even the toughest foes. And with that difficulty, victory becomes that much sweeter. Each time you delve into a dungeon or go hiking through the woods it feels like an adventure. Your skills and choices actually have an impact on the direction of the story as well, unlike some modern rpgs. (looking at you fallout 4) I can't really recommend this game enough. and now that both white march expansions are out it looks even more amazing.

Few companies write characters like Obsidian, and even if the main plot is a little on the cliché side, the D&D inspired universe is bound to keep you involved for at least 60 hours.\n\nThere are plenty of sidequests and some novelty gameplay elements that keep the game fresh, such as maintaining your own keep and  interactive fiction minigames. While the maps are fairly small to today's standards, you'll find that the sprawling dungeons and the handful of wilderness areas that are sufficiently populated with content, all of which are beautifully detailed with pre-rendered art.\n\nThe constant loading times do get annoying, and the turn based combat can be unforgiving to a younger generation, even on Easy levels, but those who welcome a challenge and are not intimitated by walls of (masterfully written) text will find Pillars a nice change of pace from modern RPGs. Last but not least, the soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous and makes up for the lack of full voice acting. 4.5/5","April 26, 2015","true","68.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I am not a fan of D&D 4th, I have always said that their combat system would work better in a com♥♥♥♥r game, and I feel that Pillars of Eternity proves me right here. I did not play Pillars for its combat system, but I enjoyed the tactical battles none the less.\n\nWithout mentioning any spoilers, the storyline for Pillars of Eternity is fantastic. There are a myriads of options and solutions to most if not all problems in the game, with significance to your characters reputation which I felt led to natural consequences throughout the game. While there were some small handful of places where I felt like I could have done with slightly more branching paths in the storyline, I were pleasently surprised when the game often gave me choices that I did not expect.\n\nThe companions are a colourful collection of eight, and while I love them and my characters' interaction with them, they may well be my biggest critique in the game. While their quests are interesting, and while I grew attached to their bantering in the background in the course of our adventure together, I felt as if they are largely ignored by the world. They will sometimes comment upon an ungoing dialogue, yet the NPCs will often neither remark upon or indeed notice your companions contribution. This makes them feel sadly invisible and unimportant. I still love them, I simply wish that they had more of an impact on the overall game.\n\nThe music of the game is discrete and enjoyable. I am generally the kind of gamer who will turn the music off while playing to listen to my own, yet I left the music on throughout the game as I felt that it heightend the experience without being all up in my face.\n\nTo round things up, I would recommend Pillars of Eternity to any cRPG fan out there, and also to anyone who wishes to get into cRPGs as the learning curve is not too steep, certainly not as steep as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. The game caters to many different kind of playstyles, so anyone who likes seeing their own character grow forth as a person in and of itself is bound to enjoy this wonderful game.","April 8, 2015","true","59.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can notice the art team did an amazing job down to the details.\n\nThe problem is that the game is still quite buggy, I came across a lot of them, including major ones that wouldn't allow me to continue and would make me load an older save file. So keep this in mind and save often and in different files.\n\nThe battle is often poorly balanced because of it's system. It feels as if they tried to make this revolutionary system of endurance with armors, damage reduction, graze/crits being more realistic. But it fell short in the execution and you will notice battles can be quite draggy, often going for much longer than it should despite having the most powerful weapon and a high level character. I feel they could have achieved more by sticking with a stable equipment system (+1,+2, etc) and spending more time polishing the game, removing bugs and adding more depth to quests and NPCs.\n\nThe Stronghold  was extremely positive, adding a lot to the game without disrupting your adventures around. But the Endless Paths could definitely have used more time. Some levels were quite plain and could easily be just part of other levels. And safe a few levels, most of them didn't have any characteristic or good NPCs or puzzles such as Watcher's Keep did in BG2.\n\nHaving said that, I really enjoyed the game. It doesn't have the magic that Baldur's Gate series had had (every area had so much depth and quests and interesting NPCs that is hard to compare), nor Pillars of Eternity has a very surprising storyline. But I quite enjoyed it and I think everyone will feel accomplished by the end of the game.","April 3, 2015","true","68.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is Baldur's Gate for 2015.\n\nPros:\n-- Character Creation:  Excellent setup - great back stories, plenty of customization.  Talents, skills, and point distribution.\n--  Difficulty Settings:  several different options here - which should give it high replay value as well.\n--  Storyline:  so far so good.  Got me involved right from the beginning.  The main story-arch is developing nicely and gradually.  Good voice acting and dialog seems to flow - feels genuine\n--  Combat - similar to BG of course\n--  Crafting -- oh yeah!  That's a nice touch, nothing too dramatic yet - but you don't just have to sell junk - you can craft some useful combat buffs.\n-- Stash - very helpful\n--  Recruit mercs - early on even you can recruit some party members for reasonable amounts of copper.  Very helpful in those sticky places\n--  Stronghold - just just started this part.  But seems like a nice developing touch of building your stronghold - looks like you can develop some residual income\n\nCONS\n--  Graphics are so-so but this isn't a big con for me.  In a top-down 3rd person, I can live with it.  Some like it, some don't.\n--  Combat sometimes is overwhelming.  Getting into some places early on where I'm completely overwhelmed.  Could be frustrating to some.\n--  Fog of war feels a bit tight, but not incredibly so.\n\nThat's all I can think of now - will update more later.\n\nOverall I have no hesitation in saying it's worth the money.  As a BG / Icewind / RPG fan, I'll get every penny's worth out of this one.\nThis game will make great grounds for future divorces.\n","March 26, 2015","true","106.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pillars of Eternity really captured the feel of the old Infinity Engine games (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc), but modernized and improved.  The story isn't as strong as the Baldur's Gate games, but the world is unique and well realized (and the central question of the game was a welcome surprise).  It starts off a bit slow, and the NPCs you gather don't seem that interesting at first, but by the end they really grew on me. To the point that I felt guilty for not finishing one's quest.\nThe game manages to feel short, even after 60 hours of play - there are still several things I didn't do (and I would have appreciated a little more warning when I got to the point of no return for the end-game), and there are a number of extra missions that can be explored, several of which I failed to complete (and may go back and do, even if I don't re-beat the game). But overall, I was very happy with the game; they achieved their goal of reviving the style and adapting it to modern gamers.  There are still some niggling things they need to do (the filter on store items actually remove items rather than graying them out, better multi-step planning and visibility in battles), but those are minor flaws on an otherwise sparkling gem.","May 17, 2015","true","80.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels like editorial mandates got in the way of the story that some writers were trying to tell and gummed up the works.  Quests can feel disconnected and companions occasionally feel neutered by editing, especially those written by Chris Avellone.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the story is fantastic and the companions break the Bioware mold that many RPG's find themselves stuck in.  The world is fantastically realized, being both dark and gritty while also maintaining a sense of wonder not always found in contemporary fantasy.  The lore is also well written and interesting, avoiding some of the pitfalls of other games of the genre by making the lore seem too distant from what is actually presented and giving a real sense of belonging within the game world.\n\nThe graphics are another high point, for the most part.  All the backgrounds are well detailed with particle effects that just pop, but the models aren't really consistent.  For an indie game of this magnitude, they do look very good, but if you are expecting highly detailed, AAA models, look elsewhere. Occasionally enemies will have their models go over scenery that they really shouldn't, it is most notable when they die.  Despite those flaws, the overall artistic design is stunning.\n\nMusic is okay, nothing really spectacular, but it more than does the job.  For the most part, it is rather sparse and when it does come in it is typically light and unintrusive.  While this can feel immersive, it means that I wouldn't really say any of it stands out.\n\nOverall, it is a really good game, that seems like it could have been better with more time and money.  That said, it is probably the best singleplayer RPG in years and without a doubt the best throwback to the old infinity engine games on the market (although with Numenera looming on the horizon, that may be a better option long term).\n8.5/10","February 20","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Short version of my review comes first, detailled Pros and Cons second.\n\nOverall the game improves visually and adds a thousand new exciting things to the classics Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment. Unfortunately the battle system and the quests and the importance of your decisions is lacking greatly. I feel that if this game gets a sequel, and that sequel will be worked out properly (I feel like this game was rushed a bit) the sequel might be one of the best games ever made and might tie or even beat Baldurs Gate 2.\n\n+ Awesome Artwork, Soundtrack and generally everything you, hear, see and feel is awesome, generally the game feels like a mixture of BG1 and BG2\n+ The story is interesting and compelling\n+ You get your own ♥♥♥♥ing Castle, that you can upgrade, do quests in and collect Bounties of powerful outlaws for/in\n+ The Experience gaining system is very nice (Exp for new areas, exp cap for every type of enemies you kill)\n+ The NPCs you can have in your party are mostly nice, although not as interesting as in BG2\n+ Nice Crafting system for Potions and Scrolls\n+ Almost no quests have a black & white solutions, theres always 2 sides of a story, also the amount of quests is very nice\n+ New interesting Races and Classes that bring new mechanics to the game\n+ The wild areas feel like a perfect mixture of BG1 and BG2, they are beautifully designed like in the first game, but not as empty\n+ You can enchant weapons, armor and shields\n+ Slow down/speed up buttons to play without pause/travel through already explored areas\n\n- ♥♥♥♥ing loading screens. They're way too long and they're everywhere.\n- The battle system feels clumsy and the battles don't require much tactics (except in the beginning for some reason). In comparison the IWD and BG series felt way harder and challenged me more\n- Theres no choice paths in the game, so replaying and always using other dialoge options (and fractions) the game will basically be the same\n- Your Castle's Dungeon Crawl quest feels boring and repetitive with an insane amount of dungeons that lack quests\n- All items feel the same, especially with the Enchantment options, which is a very big con unfortunately. After a while I just stopped caring about items. Also there's a lack of certain item types like hats/helmets and the necklace/cloak slot got fused into one. On top of that some early game items are so good that you never change them through the entire game. Itemization is my single biggest issue with this game.\n- AoE Damage spells don't seem to have much impact anymore\n- Ranged weapons are way better then melee weapons, if you have 1 tank, that's enough melee\n- The game is too hard in the beginning, especially when you don't have many companions yet","February 20","true","54.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A fascinating, dark and gritty high fantasty world, bursting with interesting and entertaining characters in which you search for answers to a mysterious event from the start of the game set the stage for the telling of a very well devised story.\n\nLike most games of this genre, it features a reasonably well detailed character creation system which allows you to feel that important attachment and immersion during the story, and the voice acting/script writing work is very well done. Expect to be amused, baffled and enthralled in equal measure by the numerous NPC's with which you can party up and travel with (all with their own backstories, most of which I found pretty neat).\n\nCombat-wise the game is solid, being pretty much standard fare for this type of game, but it felt nice and smooth and there is a good variety and diversity of skills amongst the classes. Loot is also varied and interesting enough to keep you constantly on the hunt for that next upgrade or nice drop.\n\nOne thing I found very pleasing about the game was the abiluty to acquire and upgrade your own "Keep", which was obtained through a very interesting quest and worked solidly with the main story line of the game, intermingling seamlessly as I quested back and froth between them.\n\nOverall this is a game which borrows, and to a small extent, builds on the solid foundations of prior games in this genre and couples it with a beautiful and detailed world and engaging story. There is nothing particularly groundbreaking added in this game (or at least, what I have experienced of it this far), but there a few new features here and there which fit in very well with the overall experience, without parting too much from the old school feel the game conveys.\n\nHighly reccomended, especially if you already a fan of similar games.","March 1","true","77.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After reading all the good reviews i figured i'll try this game out, not really knowing what to expect.\n\n\nFirst i have to say i was a little bit disappointed by the graphics after the hype that was created here about them. They are not bad at all, and the atmosphere is good, but i expected even better.\n\nAfter spending nearly an hour creating my character, i jumped into the adventure (props on the options). The story is interesting and keeps you curious about what will happen next.\nHowever as a inexperienced fantasy RPG player it was sometimes hard to keep track of all the unearthy named people and parties. Further in the story, also the number of quests who are active at the same time, often left me feeling a lack of overview or perspective of why or for what side i was doing this quest again. If i did i probably would have made a few different choices.\n\nWhat i did love were the conversations with NPC's, where very often you had the option to use a skill for a shortcut or outsmarting manouvre. Also that the members of your own party jump in the conversation now and then, makes them more charming.\n\nThe combat system is pauze-command-play style, and simple enough to learn. However in certain situation i felt like some of my characters were not completing the given command for no particular reason(no magic and no obstructions on the path), and if you don't pay attention they just stand idle while the rest gets butchered. That being said i didnt have problems surviving on the normal difficulty settings except for a encounter with a dragon and Raedic 1.\n\nThe story ending is clearly explained but a bit abrupt, it would have been cool to really see your keep blossom instead of just to read it has. Also 'The master below' which seemed a interesting and difficult quest to finish. Was not needed to progress to the end of the story and did not seem to influence the outcome of your keep either (wich is something different then what your stewart tells you). So i felt a bit discouraged of completing it still since the story was allready over, and thats a shame.\n\nAll in all i still think this game is not bad, it was a nice experience to get more familiarised to this kind of genre. I got this on a 50% off sale so i recommend the game. Although i think a RPG fan will prolly appreciate it even more then i did.","February 28","true","52.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However it does not follow any DnD ruleset at all. Instead it invents the wheel with its own set of rules that are confusing to say the least.\n\nWhile traditional DnD states that health is the primary attribute for how healthy a character is, PoE mixes in endurance that factors in on every encounter. You will regain endurance (up to a certain point) after each fight, but health is not. Think of it as fatigue and hp. Long battles will drain your endurance, while the number of encounters you take before camping will drain your hp. Unless there are permanent effects in play, you will regain full hp and endurance after camping - for which you'll need supplies to do so.\n\nIt's certainly an alternate take on RPG and while the game offers plenty of atmosphere, a solid soundtrack and voice work, the aspects of how the game calculates damage, modifiers and character "wellness" is confusing to say the least. I wish they just stuck with regular tropes here as after over 10hrs in I still have troubles figuring out how all of this ties together.\n\nIf RPGs of days yore is your thing you'll get your fix here, but think of it as a reinvention instead of a ressurection. PoE does things its own way which, I guess, makes it unique. However, it may be too unique for those hardcore savants of Baldur lore.","October 4, 2015","true","47.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ieatyourhead/recommended/291650/","ieatyourhead","Ieatyourhead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ieatyourhead/","82 products in account","Overall, a pretty entertaining game.\n\nThe combat is alright, I can never decide if I actually like this sort of game, but it seem to work pretty well for the most part. If it isn't your thing, just turn down the difficulty of the game. I personally prefer easy difficulties for this sort of thing as I find the combat more entertaining when you don't have to worry about it so much.\n\nFor those unaware, the system is that of a top down, pausable RPG where your characters have various abilities you can use which are either per-encounter, per-rest, or use some kind of in combat resource (i.e. monks use "wounds" to power their stuff). I'm not personally a fan of per-rest stuff, as I find it tends to be that I just avoid using certain abilities unless I really need them, which is kind of lame because it makes the combat have a lot less variety. There's also a mechanic called fatigue which makes your characters weaker if you don't rest for a long time, and I'd have preferred to see that more fleshed out in place of a hard limit of "this ability can be used twice per rest".\n\nThe story and interactions is where the game stands out though, and for me is the real reason to play it. There's quite a wide variety of things to do and people to talk to, with many response options to choose from (I'd recommend turning off the option to see why you can choose certain options though, as I find it makes the interactions more interesting - often if I see I've unlocked an option by having X stat, it will make me want to choose that option. If I can't see that, then I just choose more naturally what I want to do). Overall pretty fun though, in particular if its on sale I'd recommend picking it up - it's worth one playthrough at least if you can get it for a good price.","March 20","true","52.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A fascinating, dark and gritty high fantasty world, bursting with interesting and entertaining characters in which you search for answers to a mysterious event from the start of the game set the stage for the telling of a very well devised story.\n\nLike most games of this genre, it features a reasonably well detailed character creation system which allows you to feel that important attachment and immersion during the story, and the voice acting/script writing work is very well done. Expect to be amused, baffled and enthralled in equal measure by the numerous NPC's with which you can party up and travel with (all with their own backstories, most of which I found pretty neat).\n\nCombat-wise the game is solid, being pretty much standard fare for this type of game, but it felt nice and smooth and there is a good variety and diversity of skills amongst the classes. Loot is also varied and interesting enough to keep you constantly on the hunt for that next upgrade or nice drop.\n\nOne thing I found very pleasing about the game was the abiluty to acquire and upgrade your own "Keep", which was obtained through a very interesting quest and worked solidly with the main story line of the game, intermingling seamlessly as I quested back and froth between them.\n\nOverall this is a game which borrows, and to a small extent, builds on the solid foundations of prior games in this genre and couples it with a beautiful and detailed world and engaging story. There is nothing particularly groundbreaking added in this game (or at least, what I have experienced of it this far), but there a few new features here and there which fit in very well with the overall experience, without parting too much from the old school feel the game conveys.\n\nHighly reccomended, especially if you already a fan of similar games.","March 1","true","77.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After reading all the good reviews i figured i'll try this game out, not really knowing what to expect.\n\n\nFirst i have to say i was a little bit disappointed by the graphics after the hype that was created here about them. They are not bad at all, and the atmosphere is good, but i expected even better.\n\nAfter spending nearly an hour creating my character, i jumped into the adventure (props on the options). The story is interesting and keeps you curious about what will happen next.\nHowever as a inexperienced fantasy RPG player it was sometimes hard to keep track of all the unearthy named people and parties. Further in the story, also the number of quests who are active at the same time, often left me feeling a lack of overview or perspective of why or for what side i was doing this quest again. If i did i probably would have made a few different choices.\n\nWhat i did love were the conversations with NPC's, where very often you had the option to use a skill for a shortcut or outsmarting manouvre. Also that the members of your own party jump in the conversation now and then, makes them more charming.\n\nThe combat system is pauze-command-play style, and simple enough to learn. However in certain situation i felt like some of my characters were not completing the given command for no particular reason(no magic and no obstructions on the path), and if you don't pay attention they just stand idle while the rest gets butchered. That being said i didnt have problems surviving on the normal difficulty settings except for a encounter with a dragon and Raedic 1.\n\nThe story ending is clearly explained but a bit abrupt, it would have been cool to really see your keep blossom instead of just to read it has. Also 'The master below' which seemed a interesting and difficult quest to finish. Was not needed to progress to the end of the story and did not seem to influence the outcome of your keep either (wich is something different then what your stewart tells you). So i felt a bit discouraged of completing it still since the story was allready over, and thats a shame.\n\nAll in all i still think this game is not bad, it was a nice experience to get more familiarised to this kind of genre. I got this on a 50% off sale so i recommend the game. Although i think a RPG fan will prolly appreciate it even more then i did.","February 28","true","52.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My favorite picks would be BG2, BG2TOB, NWN, BG1.\n\nCombat is flawless and follows to a small degree(loosely) the DND ruleset which is known in IE games for being a staple mechanic.\n\nThe sheer amount of content with the Endless Dungeons and bounties adds much flair and things to do. Let's not forget that you get your own keep and can upgrade it AND pay people to guard it! There are multiple secret areas and numerous items good and bad to find.\n\nThis game from start to finish took about 32+ hours to complete with about 60% of the game explored and completed.\nThere are multiple facets that I havn't even discovered and I plan on replaying through the game again solo.\n\nGiving this game anything below a 9 would be ludicrous.\n\nMy only complaint is that this game advertised that it is able to be solo'ed.\n\nSo far the balancing of the classes other than a barbarian is kind of messed up. This game would be a perfect 10/10 for me if I could actually solo it. I've obtained a platinum in the Dark Souls series and Bloodborne but, even those games are not as hard as Pillars of Eternity solo on NORMAL.

True, I didn't care much for the story (the whole soul thing didn't strike my fancy, and the world and races simply didn't knock my socks off), but I was entertained, alright. On the one hand there was, of course nostalgia, on the other the game simply oozes the designers' lifeblood. You can feel it in all the little details and every line of text, from the dialogue to the virtual novel style elements. This is not a "medal for effort", though. Only a game that shows that the developers cared - really cared - can hope to be  good, or even great game and lately too many games are released that show quite the opposite.\nAll in all PoE is worth playing; be it out of nostalgia, the love of role playing games or the respect for devs who actually care! However this is game is not the holy grail some people claim: it's nostalgia, first an foremost! If you loved Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment you probably will feel right a t home in PoE.

The last time I said that was after finishing DragonAge:Origins... I played this game about 1-3hours per sitting, more would have made me bored of the reading or the combat.\n\nI loved how you could trick and make deals with you enemies/friends and backstab them in the back or play as a diplomat - I even managed to skip at least 2 annoying boss fights that way. Combat was fun and loved the resting system - it gave more of a challenge and more lovely micromanagement. I loved how your choices actually felt like they affected the world around you.\n\nI wish the game had more memorable characters tho! And they could have made the companion characters models better than your awerage npcs... I only really got a general skin deep idea of the companions and a romance would have been fu---ALOTH STOP DYING FFS I hate you and I also love you please take all my gear so you could at least do some damage with your sad "might" stats.

While I am not a fan of D&D 4th, I have always said that their combat system would work better in a com♥♥♥♥r game, and I feel that Pillars of Eternity proves me right here. I did not play Pillars for its combat system, but I enjoyed the tactical battles none the less.\n\nWithout mentioning any spoilers, the storyline for Pillars of Eternity is fantastic. There are a myriads of options and solutions to most if not all problems in the game, with significance to your characters reputation which I felt led to natural consequences throughout the game. While there were some small handful of places where I felt like I could have done with slightly more branching paths in the storyline, I were pleasently surprised when the game often gave me choices that I did not expect.\n\nThe companions are a colourful collection of eight, and while I love them and my characters' interaction with them, they may well be my biggest critique in the game. While their quests are interesting, and while I grew attached to their bantering in the background in the course of our adventure together, I felt as if they are largely ignored by the world. They will sometimes comment upon an ungoing dialogue, yet the NPCs will often neither remark upon or indeed notice your companions contribution. This makes them feel sadly invisible and unimportant. I still love them, I simply wish that they had more of an impact on the overall game.\n\nThe music of the game is discrete and enjoyable. I am generally the kind of gamer who will turn the music off while playing to listen to my own, yet I left the music on throughout the game as I felt that it heightend the experience without being all up in my face.\n\nTo round things up, I would recommend Pillars of Eternity to any cRPG fan out there, and also to anyone who wishes to get into cRPGs as the learning curve is not too steep, certainly not as steep as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. The game caters to many different kind of playstyles, so anyone who likes seeing their own character grow forth as a person in and of itself is bound to enjoy this wonderful game.","April 8, 2015","true","59.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Perhaps a bit too much. It doesn't seem to improve upon things as much as it could have. It often keeps things that perhaps would have been better to be improved or ditched entirely.

True, I didn't care much for the story (the whole soul thing didn't strike my fancy, and the world and races simply didn't knock my socks off), but I was entertained, alright. On the one hand there was, of course nostalgia, on the other the game simply oozes the designers' lifeblood. You can feel it in all the little details and every line of text, from the dialogue to the virtual novel style elements. This is not a "medal for effort", though. Only a game that shows that the developers cared - really cared - can hope to be  good, or even great game and lately too many games are released that show quite the opposite.\nAll in all PoE is worth playing; be it out of nostalgia, the love of role playing games or the respect for devs who actually care! However this is game is not the holy grail some people claim: it's nostalgia, first an foremost! If you loved Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment you probably will feel right a t home in PoE. If you have never played one of those, chances are that you might find PoE not THAT fun and entertaining, especially if you are mostly used to RPGs that have been realeased in the last 5 years. On the other hand, you might like it anyways...","February 13","true","39.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hardcore sucks because the game mostly won't let you retreat from battle and puts difficult fights directly into easy storylines for comedic value I guess. You are probably suppose to memorize the game in normal because playing hardcore, which sounds about like chopping wood to me.\n\nThe game play and story are alright. The voice acting is on point. The story is kind of childishly gritty - they try to make it seem rough by having drug abuse themes and birth defects as plot drivers might work for you. It doesn't for me.\n\nI had to butcher a party member in my hardcore game because they glitched into a wall and couldn't move. I could have saved and restarted, hoping for the best, but I didn't try that.\n\nAll in all, I think this game is a great buy for when it goes on sale.","July 10, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

I like the way the codex fills out as you travel and fight different monsters to reflect your growing knowledge of the places you visit and the creatures you fight.

Being a big fan of story-driven RPGs with nice gameplay elements this game fulfills both niches. A throwback to the 2d isometric hand drawn environments for those of us who are fans of nice illustrations.\n\nThis is not the typical RPG we may be used to where we "kill ever bad guy or enemy" we come across. Albeit you can play it like that (I am heh), you'll just find it very difficult if you do if you're also on the hardest difficulty setting. For those who enjoy challenges this will definitely scractch an itch. But one may equally talk their way out of many hostile situations or simply avoid them.\n\nMy only complains is that there's a bit too much side-content that draws me away from the main story for too long. Being a completionist I like to do every side-quest but occasionally I found myself rushing through them because I really wanted to get back to the main story. The fact that certain achievements are tied to these side-quests didn't improve matters, but hey I'm probably the only person who'd complain about too much content.\n\nIf you enjoyed old-school rpg series like Buldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Torment you will definitely enjoy this game as well. Kudos to the devs developing a unique mechanic system since they couldn't very well use DnD rules :P.","May 21","true","139.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot has changed since BG II and the game presents us with polished and improved battle mechanics that have less exploits and frustrating bits.\nThat said, the devs did not try hard enough to make the game accessible to an inexperienced audience - the easy difficulty leaves the monsters' stats and battle rules unchanged, which means you still need to understand the mechanics and be able to adjust your strategy with every battle.\nOn the other hand, the games offers several ways to scale up the difficulty, if that is something you desire.\n\nOne of the goals this game set for itself was "mature storytelling" and I think they succeeded well enough. I mostly paid attention to the main story it and enjoyed it, which is rare for me. I tend to skip over text and not care that much what is happening between the banter with my party and all the monster-killing.\n\nOne unattractive blemish is the issue of hollowborn children - basically a metaphor for disabled people who are nonverbal and need help with daily activities. In the game, these children are like this, because they are soulless. As a cognitively and developmentally disabled person I did not enjoy reading about people resembling me and my friends being inhuman. Unfortunately this is part of the main plot and as such unavoidable.\n\nThe characters, which are one of the main draws of a game like this, were well executed. They range from cute to intriguing to deliciously hateable. Their personal stories are interesting, if a bit short.\nWhat I felt was lacking, was the depth of interaction you have with them as the PC and the interaction they have between themselves. The banter is funny, sure, but I am used to drama complete with hissy fits and threats of leaving the party (now I miss BG II).\n\nAll in all - a good staple for those long weekends where you don't feel like doing anything.\n\nP.S.: At the time of writing this, I am almost done with the game. A few days ago White March II has come out, with a patch for the regular game. Unfortunately I can't comment on the changes right now, because there is no time left for me to explore them.\n","February 25","true","83.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celessia/recommended/291650/","celessia","⠀","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celessia/","745 products in account","Warning: might contain spoilers.\n\nThere are countless people telling you how this game is great and close to flawless so i wont be focusing on that. Ill tell you what is wrong with the game.\n\nRoleplay options, - the core stats are a joke. Intelligence recommended for a barbarian, Might not recommended for monk, intelligence on wizard is only good for debuffing and 'dialog'. There are no special changes while having stat a minimum - 3 int talking like normal, 3 dex having no problems swinging 2 swords etc. The system is extremely flawed and its a huge letdown when you make some conceptual hero, take appropriate skills and then they are almost never checked outside prologue.\n\nIn the entirety of Act 1 i havent seen a single Survival/Stealth/Mechanic/Athletics*past prologue* checked in dialog or events, no finding hidden ♥♥♥♥ doesnt count. And it stinks. The game presents itself as hardcore old school RPG which it certainly is if you think ♥♥♥♥ graphics, extremely horrible party AI, massive pathing problems equals old school. The same 'roleplay' problem is felt all over - say i killed Roedric and come back to Calisa's sister she is still panicking oh no we'lll get hanged mode. Maxed out reputation with people in the village, the dialog doesnt change with anyone outside random ♥♥♥♥ villagers say. Really? This is supposed to be a top tier rpg.\n\nI liked how the quests adapted to what you do, like instead of doing the 'make water to brew' you instead murder everyone, that was good and it was a step in the right direction, but it ultimately didnt matter one bit how you went through prologue. The outcome is always the same, same with almost everything you do. They dont change anything on macro level. Say after the other watcher dies there are 3 options to do with his soul, giving roleplay opportunity but they are the same as an outcome... Why even have it then? To show off what it could have been? Dissapointing.\n\nThe Stronghold felt exciting, yet it feels so dead and depressing when i show up, the events are not fun, they are terrirble, instead of inviting over opressed peasants to provide them heaven or w/e im visited by some duke who i cant even go have a talk with.  It could have been a great addition, but it feels superficial and obsolete since the moment you get it and all through the game.\n\nYou guys talk about creative freedom for the game, yet the achievements are the most uninspired garbage ever. Kill these many or dont kill as many! Finish the game on highest difficulty and prove you are the TRUE TRYHARD or that you can make a fire godlike monk and play fine with it. Whoever was in charge of achievements - let someone else do this, you are ill suited for the task. They feel tackled on, a 'modern burdern' which they had to make for the check mark at the game launch. For someone not constricted by publishers or backers hurrying you up that was really ♥♥♥♥in bad. Dont want people to spoil story for themselves? Make them hidden or whatnot, make them fun!\n\nTechnical issues with this game are few...but extremely irritating and game breaking including, removal of passives on doubleclick, having your people stuck somewhere with no option to get them out including: ladders with spaces below them,  treelines post scripted dialog. Game glitching out hard in dialogs if launched for extended period of time...and these are just the ones i saw, i struggle to grasp how many total there are.\n\nRealism: a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ village with about 100-200 people in it sustaining a huge ♥♥♥ castle fit for a king with more guards then villagers. And other incredible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that all over the game.\n\n\nAnd thats all just Act 1. Almost a week past the release there is no patch. Obsidian, you can do better then that.\n\nOverall though its still a fantastic game and possible THE RPG of 2015, but it could have been so much more. I give it 8,5/10 Right now and 9.5 when issues are resolved *at least the gameplay wise, i dont expect anyone to figure out a way to fix flawed quest design.\n","March 30, 2015","true","244.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The first is the lack of AI on your party members. They will just sit their even when combat starts until given an order and sometimes their orders get lost so they just stand there again. I'm playing on a harder difficulty so I constantly pause to micromanage but for the trash fights it can get a little tedious. The second is the seemingly random voice acting. Sometimes a response will be voice acted but the next in the same conversation wont be and then suddenly the last is.

It is arguably a bit short and easy, but that is ultimately preferable to an experience that outstays its welcome.\n\nOn its surface, the setting seems like your typical fantasy cliche. However, the more you delve into the lore and each character's backstory, the more you find yourself exploring mature and thought-provoking themes. Do not be fooled by the ogres and elves - there is plenty of creativity here in both the main plot and side-quests. The writing is rich and thick with lore references, but never to the point where the player feels lost or disconnected. On the contrary, the more time I spent reading up on the lore, the more internally consistent everything felt.\n\nBut the real attraction to the writing was the characterization - both direct, in the way the characters are described by their authors, and indirect, in the way they act and interact with the world around them.\n\nThrough its characters does this world feel real and believable, and it was the intimate detail in which these little pixelated people were described that made me feel immersed in Dyrwood. There is a certain psychological realism - for lack of a better term - that manages to bridge the gap of disbelief between the player and the setting in Pillars of Eternity. It also does not hurt that the voice acting is incredibly convincing, conveying subtle nuances with perfect timing. But more than that, it feels like acting in the true sense of the word; in the sense that is above mere line-delivery. The simple-minded good-hearted warrior with a troubled past manages to consistently sound like a simple-minded good-hearted warrior with a troubled past, while still including variations in mood. The mysterious, powerful villain conveys a permanent sense of calm and authority, and yet he sometimes seems benign, while at other times there is a subtly menacing tone.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially a streamlined, modified version of the systems in Baldur's Gate 2. This is by no means a negative, although some purists or old-timers might decry certain features as being too dumbed down or casual. In my opinion, a lot the enjoyment comes from the variety of meaningfully distinct classes and abilities, as well as the freedom to continuously make additions of both player created and "canon" characters to the party. Variety and experimentation are key words here. Players are encouraged to have fun mixing and matching different party members and testing different playstyles.\n\nThe developers have really paid much attention to detail, and it would take a long time to praise each of the small features that make this game a joy to play. For example, I really loved how information about enemy stats was progressively added to the journal, helping the player adopt more effective tactics in battle. Also, the interface does a good job of letting you interact with a rather complex world and combat system in as few clicks as possible (Wasteland 2, this ain't).\n\nI mentioned in the beginning that the game is a bit easy and short. However, this is coming from someone who grew up with turn based strategies and rpgs. And it is also from someone who spent a significant amount of time planing their party and optimizing both ability and gear distribution. In combat, I paused the game every half-second, making sure to use my cooldowns as efficiently as possible. Lastly, I did a huge chunk of the side quests on offer, which meant that I was maxed out on experience and had the best items at about three quarters of my playthrough on hard difficulty. If that is the mindset you bring to the game, I don't believe you will find any insurmountable obstacles. However, if you expect to simply click on things and make them die, then you are in for a world of hurt. Even with everything maxed out, you will still need to keep your wits about you and make shrewd decisions in combat. Very few were the moments when I could just let the game flow unpaused through a whole encounter.\n\nThe only remaining complaint is that the game feels like it could have been more. Not just in terms of length, but also in terms of rpg mechanics and story-telling. You can see in the design of classes that much has been either removed (presumably for balancing purposes) or it simply never made it past the planing stages of development. For instance, he wizard's grimoire goes up to level 10, but the highest level spells in the game are at 6. Similar things can be said of the chanter's or cipher's abilities. Also, the relatively low, 12 level cap (combined with only a couple of top tier weapons in each class) makes much of the later side-questing somewhat irrelevant. Lastly, I could not help but notice how none of the character archs had any gameplay impact on the characters themselves. This is particularly jarring in one side-quest, upon completion of which, the player is informed that said character has become more aggressive and stronger. And yet there isn't even a +1 to accuracy or anything of substance added to the character. It all just makes me miss the amazing party interactions from Planescape: Torment. If anyone remembers Dak'kon's zerth blade transformations, you'll know what I'm talking about.\n\nStill, like a good book, this game was able to keep me hooked for many sleepless nights. It is both accessible and deep, mysterious and familiar. It can be shockingly grim and dark, but also humorous and light-hearted. It challenges and rewards, but hardly ever frustrates or disappoints. It makes you think, it makes you care, and it makes you take risks. And it's a thoroughly fun to play video game.","April 16, 2015","true","80.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The classes, leveling and talents are solid and fairly easy to understand. Giving up on certain classic D&D rules is a good idea in my opinion. Now you can have your Cleric wield a crossbow, making it a deadly sniper from the back. However, the lack of specialization classes is a flaw IMHO. Also the lack of Party AI (behavior) is a really silly. A lot of micromanagement needed at times.\n\nGraphics are very solid, beautiful, yet paying homage to the original games. 3D characters look very good an blend seamlessly into the background. Sounds are also good and the music made me think of old Baldur's immideately. The game feels sublime and finished, and there seems to be very few bugs to encounter.\n\nHowever, the story seems a bit vague compared to the original Bioware games and characters lack charisma. They are not as interesting as say Minsc or Edwin, but still are interesting enough to keep you company.\n\nAll in all, I am giving this game a strict 8/10.\nIf the party AI is added I would raise it to 9/10.\n\nThere is plenty of content, but I do hope there will be a substantial amount of extra content in DLC-form in the future.\n\n","March 29, 2015","true","33.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am a gamer of an older generation and a backer of this game, and I believe that this definitely influences my opinion about this game. Since this game was announced I like the idea of a kickstarter project by one of the best companies in the creation of RPGs . I hate to speak like an older generation, especially in such a thing like games which is mostly destined for young people. but:\nEven if I wasn't a great fun of Baldur's Gate, I miss the depth and the beautiful stories of games I was playing ten or twenty years ago. New games have graphics and use technology that we, older gamers couldn't even imagine that it would ever exist. The first game I have ever played was in my uncle's Amstrad and there I could control a hero made of less than ten pixels, let alone the limited number of colours of the computer screen (less than 16 in comparison with thousands today). Today's most games are full of great cutscenes which are technologically laudable. Does this make them better games than the older ones??? If you are a gamer of a younger generation you may be used to high technology graphics, so it may be difficult for you to play an older game. For the same reason you may not like Pillars of Eternity. The graphics are certainly of the last decade and not this one, it looks like a game created in the end of 2000's. Does this mean that the graphics do not lookl good? The answer is no. They try to compensate for not being high-tech bY BEAUTIFUL HAND DRAWN BACKGROUNDS AND BEAUTIFUL ARTWORK. the design may not be that of high technology but it EMPHASISES ON LOOKING BEAUTIFUL AND NOT BEING ONE OF THE MOST RECENT TECHNOLOGY IN GRAPHICS. IT LOOKS GOOD IN THE EYE WHERE A LOT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY TRIPLE A's FAIL. This is is why I give an 8/10 in GRAPHICS.\nAnother relevant you would like to consider, and gamers-older and younger-should consider is whether DO CUTSCENES REALLY MATTER? HOW IS A CUTSCENE A PART OF THE ACTUAL GAME? In the older times I was hungry for new, high tech cutscenes too, but after playing Divinity Original Sin last year, I found out that it is now for me LESS IMPORTANT THAN I THOUGHT. RECENT TRIPLE A'S FOCUS IN CUTSCENES TOO MUCH AND THEYMOSTLY NEGLECT  THE QUALITY OF THE STORY!!! THEY TRY TO MAKE GENERIC STORIES SO THEY CAN SELL IT TO EVERYONE AND NOT GOOD ONES. MOST OF THEM HAVE STUPID STORIES COMPARED TO OLD GAMES. in the beggining I thought that the reason I was tired of playing newer games was because I got older, but then there are games like this one that which give me the excitement that older games were giving me. AND A GOOD STORY MATTERS MORE THAN CUTSCENES. PILLARS OF ETERNITY IS A TEXT HEAVY GAME BECAUSE IT IS A REAL RPG, WHERE STORY DEPTH, CONVERSATIONS AND CHOICES MATTER AND CHANGE THE WORLD AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE QUESTS. OTHERWISE THIS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN FETCH/KILL QUESTS OF RECENT RPGS. YOUNGER GAMERS COULD TRY TO GET USED TO IT. It is not easy in the Beggining but it pays off. As for me I really need to play games with a story and depth like this one. so STORY 10/10\n\nANOTHER WEAK POINT OF MANY TRIPLE A's IS THE OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF GAMES RULES AND MECHANICS. GAMES WHICH ARE SIMPLER CAN SELL TO A BIGGER MARKET, BUT THEY ARE SOMETIMES INSULTING AND UNCHALLENGING IN COMPARISON TO OLDER GAMES. AN UNCHALLENGING GAME OR A GAME WITH FEW CHOICES IN TACTICS IS MORE LIKE AN INTERACTIVE VIDEO THAN A GAME. PILLARS OF ETERNITY HAS DEEP MECHANICS AND MAKES THE PLAYER TO TRY TO FIND THE MOST SUITABLE TACTICS FOR THE CHARACTERS IN CONTROL. BATTLES CAN BE CHALLENGING IN THE NORMAL MODE EVEN FOR RPG TABLETOPS PLAYERS LIKE ME. I would give it a straight ten if it wasn't for some bugs in the party's AI which make the use of micromanagement inevitable and a bug which I had to tolerate in one of my fighter's abilities(into the fray ability) which made the ability unavailable during the last twenty hours of the game). For this reason. GAME MECHANICS 10/10 BUT GAME'S AI 8/10.\nANOTHER PART OF A GOOD GAME. ESPECIALLY AN RPG IS THE LORE. I THINK THAT THE LORE IS AMAZING. I personally prefer this lore to the lore of FR for example, as I find the lore of FR good for designing any kind of tabletop campaign but a bit too generic. BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT TRIPLE A's worlds are usually too kitch for my taste. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT QUALITY COMES IN BIG NUMBERS. A DRAGON IS A REVERED THING IN HIGH FANTASY. A THOUSAND DRAGONS IS A RIDICULOUS ONE. I FOUND MYSELF DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE LORE OF PILLARS OF ETERNITY, BUT THAT IS SUBJECTIVE. SO LORE 10/10.\n\nMUSIC/SOUND/ACTING: A Game which has not perfect graphics can invest a lot in music and sound. THE MUSIC IS GREAT BUT NOT AS GREAT AS IN THE DIVINITY SERIES. THE THEMES ARE WONDERFUL BUT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THEM. For this Reason: MUSIC 9/10. The SOUND IS OKAY NOT EXCEPTIONAL 7/10. The budget was limited so NOT ALL OF THE DIALOGUES OF IMPORTANT NPC'S ARE RECORDED. I THINK THAT THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD WEIRD!!! MOST OF THE TIMES IT IS NOT A PROBLEM THOUGH AND I WILL BE LENIENT ON THAT BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED BUDGET. THIS WOULD BE UNFAIR FOR THE ACTORS, WHO DID AN AMAZING JOB AND GIVE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES. For this reason: ACTING:10/10\n\nA 9/10 is a fair score for this game. But in my heart it will always be one of the 10/10 titles. I DON'T SAY THAT THIS GAME IS FOR A EVERYONE. BUT I DON'T CARE. IF YOU ARE BUYING IT YOU SHOULD JUDGE IT ACCORDING TO THE THINGS IT PROMISES TO DELIVER. AND IT DOES DELIVER!!!!

BEST Unplaned purchase I have done on Steam.  The game really gets it right.  It scratches that old BG itch and then some.  Beautiful graphics, great sound, and an easy to pick up and play system.\n\nAfter my impulse buy, I just sank 10.2 hours into the game during a busy NHL playoffs day.  It's that good :)\n\nSo far my only complaints are\n1.) Almost too many spells for Mage types (But honestly, since when is abundant choice a bad thing?)\n2.) The screen can get crowded with enemies, making the action hard to distinguish.\n\nI pray that they will be making a sequal, the game is so good I want to see this become a franchise or at least carry the game system over to a new ip.\n\n9/10 would buy again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Deatar_/recommended/291650/","_Deatar_","N4mel3ss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Deatar_/","684 products in account","I actually Kick started this back when it was first announced and I do not regret doing so. If you are familiar with Baldur's Gate 2 and enjoyed it then you will love this game. It feels very familiar and yet brings a lot of new things to the table along with improvements. Even if you are not familiar with Baldur's Gate 2 you will still enjoy this game.\n\nThe combat is almost exactly the same as Baldur's gate, it's an Action RPG where you can pause mid combat (similar to the modern Bioware games such as Mass Effect etc.). It is very challenging and it actually forces you to think which weapon type and which spells to use on each different enemy.\n\nAnother great thing about this game is that it really is open, in the sense that there are multiple ways of completing a mission. As an example there is a certain area that you need to enter but it has been sealed off and it guarded by 2 guards. You can either:\n1. Kill them and enter anyway\n2. Bribe them and enter\n3. Go to their boss and gain his favour to allow you entrance\nThere might be more ways that I haven't come across, but that's just one example.\n\nNot to mention this game has mods on steam workshop. Since it is a recent release, it won't have as many mods at the moment, but give it a bit of time and look at the mods coming in.\n\nI personally love the endurance mechanism during combat that replaces your health so that when you endurance drops to "0" you are unconcious but once the combat is over you are back up again, but with some sort of injury the second time your health drops below "0" you will die however unless you rest. Unlike BG2 you can't just rest as many times as you like, you need to have camping equipment and you can only carry a maximum of 5 at any one point.\n\nThough it's not all great. Some people have been complaining about the speed it takes to load a game once you are quite far in to the game. Personally I don't have a problem with it as back in the day the load times generally were really slow anyway.\n\nThe other problem is that I feel that there is just too much talking about things that I feel are not really that important to me. I mean sure lore is important, but too much of reading will bore the game, especially when it is not directed to me.\n\nMy personal issue with the story is there are moments when you can actually choose an option about your past of why you did something or who someone is exactly. (i.e. relative, partner friends etc.) And I feel like that freedom shouldn't be given because the story then feels fabricated rather than customised to you. So overall the story can use some improvement, but that still doesn't mean that the story is bad. It can definitely use some more voiced over lines though, compared to modern games this one is lacking in that area. Though again if you compare it to BG2, PoE feels like it has more voiced over lines despite being a smaller game.\n\nOverall I would give it a 8/10. I would have given it more had it not been for the amount of unnecassary lore that was forced fed.","April 21, 2015","true","68.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The classes, leveling and talents are solid and fairly easy to understand. Giving up on certain classic D&D rules is a good idea in my opinion. Now you can have your Cleric wield a crossbow, making it a deadly sniper from the back. However, the lack of specialization classes is a flaw IMHO. Also the lack of Party AI (behavior) is a really silly. A lot of micromanagement needed at times.\n\nGraphics are very solid, beautiful, yet paying homage to the original games. 3D characters look very good an blend seamlessly into the background. Sounds are also good and the music made me think of old Baldur's immideately. The game feels sublime and finished, and there seems to be very few bugs to encounter.\n\nHowever, the story seems a bit vague compared to the original Bioware games and characters lack charisma. They are not as interesting as say Minsc or Edwin, but still are interesting enough to keep you company.\n\nAll in all, I am giving this game a strict 8/10.\nIf the party AI is added I would raise it to 9/10.\n\nThere is plenty of content, but I do hope there will be a substantial amount of extra content in DLC-form in the future.\n\n","March 29, 2015","true","33.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am a gamer of an older generation and a backer of this game, and I believe that this definitely influences my opinion about this game. Since this game was announced I like the idea of a kickstarter project by one of the best companies in the creation of RPGs . I hate to speak like an older generation, especially in such a thing like games which is mostly destined for young people. but:\nEven if I wasn't a great fun of Baldur's Gate, I miss the depth and the beautiful stories of games I was playing ten or twenty years ago. New games have graphics and use technology that we, older gamers couldn't even imagine that it would ever exist. The first game I have ever played was in my uncle's Amstrad and there I could control a hero made of less than ten pixels, let alone the limited number of colours of the computer screen (less than 16 in comparison with thousands today). Today's most games are full of great cutscenes which are technologically laudable. Does this make them better games than the older ones??? If you are a gamer of a younger generation you may be used to high technology graphics, so it may be difficult for you to play an older game. For the same reason you may not like Pillars of Eternity. The graphics are certainly of the last decade and not this one, it looks like a game created in the end of 2000's. Does this mean that the graphics do not lookl good? The answer is no. They try to compensate for not being high-tech bY BEAUTIFUL HAND DRAWN BACKGROUNDS AND BEAUTIFUL ARTWORK. the design may not be that of high technology but it EMPHASISES ON LOOKING BEAUTIFUL AND NOT BEING ONE OF THE MOST RECENT TECHNOLOGY IN GRAPHICS. IT LOOKS GOOD IN THE EYE WHERE A LOT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY TRIPLE A's FAIL. This is is why I give an 8/10 in GRAPHICS.\nAnother relevant you would like to consider, and gamers-older and younger-should consider is whether DO CUTSCENES REALLY MATTER? HOW IS A CUTSCENE A PART OF THE ACTUAL GAME? In the older times I was hungry for new, high tech cutscenes too, but after playing Divinity Original Sin last year, I found out that it is now for me LESS IMPORTANT THAN I THOUGHT. RECENT TRIPLE A'S FOCUS IN CUTSCENES TOO MUCH AND THEYMOSTLY NEGLECT  THE QUALITY OF THE STORY!!! THEY TRY TO MAKE GENERIC STORIES SO THEY CAN SELL IT TO EVERYONE AND NOT GOOD ONES. MOST OF THEM HAVE STUPID STORIES COMPARED TO OLD GAMES. in the beggining I thought that the reason I was tired of playing newer games was because I got older, but then there are games like this one that which give me the excitement that older games were giving me. AND A GOOD STORY MATTERS MORE THAN CUTSCENES. PILLARS OF ETERNITY IS A TEXT HEAVY GAME BECAUSE IT IS A REAL RPG, WHERE STORY DEPTH, CONVERSATIONS AND CHOICES MATTER AND CHANGE THE WORLD AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE QUESTS. OTHERWISE THIS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN FETCH/KILL QUESTS OF RECENT RPGS. YOUNGER GAMERS COULD TRY TO GET USED TO IT. It is not easy in the Beggining but it pays off. As for me I really need to play games with a story and depth like this one. so STORY 10/10\n\nANOTHER WEAK POINT OF MANY TRIPLE A's IS THE OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF GAMES RULES AND MECHANICS. GAMES WHICH ARE SIMPLER CAN SELL TO A BIGGER MARKET, BUT THEY ARE SOMETIMES INSULTING AND UNCHALLENGING IN COMPARISON TO OLDER GAMES. AN UNCHALLENGING GAME OR A GAME WITH FEW CHOICES IN TACTICS IS MORE LIKE AN INTERACTIVE VIDEO THAN A GAME. PILLARS OF ETERNITY HAS DEEP MECHANICS AND MAKES THE PLAYER TO TRY TO FIND THE MOST SUITABLE TACTICS FOR THE CHARACTERS IN CONTROL. BATTLES CAN BE CHALLENGING IN THE NORMAL MODE EVEN FOR RPG TABLETOPS PLAYERS LIKE ME. I would give it a straight ten if it wasn't for some bugs in the party's AI which make the use of micromanagement inevitable and a bug which I had to tolerate in one of my fighter's abilities(into the fray ability) which made the ability unavailable during the last twenty hours of the game). For this reason. GAME MECHANICS 10/10 BUT GAME'S AI 8/10.\nANOTHER PART OF A GOOD GAME. ESPECIALLY AN RPG IS THE LORE. I THINK THAT THE LORE IS AMAZING. I personally prefer this lore to the lore of FR for example, as I find the lore of FR good for designing any kind of tabletop campaign but a bit too generic. BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT TRIPLE A's worlds are usually too kitch for my taste. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT QUALITY COMES IN BIG NUMBERS. A DRAGON IS A REVERED THING IN HIGH FANTASY. A THOUSAND DRAGONS IS A RIDICULOUS ONE. I FOUND MYSELF DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE LORE OF PILLARS OF ETERNITY, BUT THAT IS SUBJECTIVE. SO LORE 10/10.\n\nMUSIC/SOUND/ACTING: A Game which has not perfect graphics can invest a lot in music and sound. THE MUSIC IS GREAT BUT NOT AS GREAT AS IN THE DIVINITY SERIES. THE THEMES ARE WONDERFUL BUT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THEM. For this Reason: MUSIC 9/10. The SOUND IS OKAY NOT EXCEPTIONAL 7/10. The budget was limited so NOT ALL OF THE DIALOGUES OF IMPORTANT NPC'S ARE RECORDED. I THINK THAT THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD WEIRD!!! MOST OF THE TIMES IT IS NOT A PROBLEM THOUGH AND I WILL BE LENIENT ON THAT BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED BUDGET. THIS WOULD BE UNFAIR FOR THE ACTORS, WHO DID AN AMAZING JOB AND GIVE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES. For this reason: ACTING:10/10\n\nA 9/10 is a fair score for this game. But in my heart it will always be one of the 10/10 titles. I DON'T SAY THAT THIS GAME IS FOR A EVERYONE. BUT I DON'T CARE. IF YOU ARE BUYING IT YOU SHOULD JUDGE IT ACCORDING TO THE THINGS IT PROMISES TO DELIVER. AND IT DOES DELIVER!!!!

Ill tell you what is wrong with the game.\n\nRoleplay options, - the core stats are a joke. Intelligence recommended for a barbarian, Might not recommended for monk, intelligence on wizard is only good for debuffing and 'dialog'. There are no special changes while having stat a minimum - 3 int talking like normal, 3 dex having no problems swinging 2 swords etc. The system is extremely flawed and its a huge letdown when you make some conceptual hero, take appropriate skills and then they are almost never checked outside prologue.\n\nIn the entirety of Act 1 i havent seen a single Survival/Stealth/Mechanic/Athletics*past prologue* checked in dialog or events, no finding hidden ♥♥♥♥ doesnt count. And it stinks. The game presents itself as hardcore old school RPG which it certainly is if you think ♥♥♥♥ graphics, extremely horrible party AI, massive pathing problems equals old school. The same 'roleplay' problem is felt all over - say i killed Roedric and come back to Calisa's sister she is still panicking oh no we'lll get hanged mode. Maxed out reputation with people in the village, the dialog doesnt change with anyone outside random ♥♥♥♥ villagers say. Really? This is supposed to be a top tier rpg.\n\nI liked how the quests adapted to what you do, like instead of doing the 'make water to brew' you instead murder everyone, that was good and it was a step in the right direction, but it ultimately didnt matter one bit how you went through prologue. The outcome is always the same, same with almost everything you do. They dont change anything on macro level. Say after the other watcher dies there are 3 options to do with his soul, giving roleplay opportunity but they are the same as an outcome... Why even have it then? To show off what it could have been? Dissapointing.\n\nThe Stronghold felt exciting, yet it feels so dead and depressing when i show up, the events are not fun, they are terrirble, instead of inviting over opressed peasants to provide them heaven or w/e im visited by some duke who i cant even go have a talk with.  It could have been a great addition, but it feels superficial and obsolete since the moment you get it and all through the game.\n\nYou guys talk about creative freedom for the game, yet the achievements are the most uninspired garbage ever. Kill these many or dont kill as many! Finish the game on highest difficulty and prove you are the TRUE TRYHARD or that you can make a fire godlike monk and play fine with it. Whoever was in charge of achievements - let someone else do this, you are ill suited for the task. They feel tackled on, a 'modern burdern' which they had to make for the check mark at the game launch. For someone not constricted by publishers or backers hurrying you up that was really ♥♥♥♥in bad. Dont want people to spoil story for themselves? Make them hidden or whatnot, make them fun!\n\nTechnical issues with this game are few...but extremely irritating and game breaking including, removal of passives on doubleclick, having your people stuck somewhere with no option to get them out including: ladders with spaces below them,  treelines post scripted dialog. Game glitching out hard in dialogs if launched for extended period of time...and these are just the ones i saw, i struggle to grasp how many total there are.\n\nRealism: a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ village with about 100-200 people in it sustaining a huge ♥♥♥ castle fit for a king with more guards then villagers. And other incredible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that all over the game.\n\n\nAnd thats all just Act 1. Almost a week past the release there is no patch. Obsidian, you can do better then that.\n\nOverall though its still a fantastic game and possible THE RPG of 2015, but it could have been so much more. I give it 8,5/10 Right now and 9.5 when issues are resolved *at least the gameplay wise, i dont expect anyone to figure out a way to fix flawed quest design.\n","March 30, 2015","true","244.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The classes, leveling and talents are solid and fairly easy to understand. Giving up on certain classic D&D rules is a good idea in my opinion. Now you can have your Cleric wield a crossbow, making it a deadly sniper from the back. However, the lack of specialization classes is a flaw IMHO. Also the lack of Party AI (behavior) is a really silly. A lot of micromanagement needed at times.\n\nGraphics are very solid, beautiful, yet paying homage to the original games. 3D characters look very good an blend seamlessly into the background. Sounds are also good and the music made me think of old Baldur's immideately. The game feels sublime and finished, and there seems to be very few bugs to encounter.\n\nHowever, the story seems a bit vague compared to the original Bioware games and characters lack charisma. They are not as interesting as say Minsc or Edwin, but still are interesting enough to keep you company.\n\nAll in all, I am giving this game a strict 8/10.\nIf the party AI is added I would raise it to 9/10.\n\nThere is plenty of content, but I do hope there will be a substantial amount of extra content in DLC-form in the future.\n\n","March 29, 2015","true","33.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I am a gamer of an older generation and a backer of this game, and I believe that this definitely influences my opinion about this game. Since this game was announced I like the idea of a kickstarter project by one of the best companies in the creation of RPGs . I hate to speak like an older generation, especially in such a thing like games which is mostly destined for young people. but:\nEven if I wasn't a great fun of Baldur's Gate, I miss the depth and the beautiful stories of games I was playing ten or twenty years ago. New games have graphics and use technology that we, older gamers couldn't even imagine that it would ever exist. The first game I have ever played was in my uncle's Amstrad and there I could control a hero made of less than ten pixels, let alone the limited number of colours of the computer screen (less than 16 in comparison with thousands today). Today's most games are full of great cutscenes which are technologically laudable. Does this make them better games than the older ones??? If you are a gamer of a younger generation you may be used to high technology graphics, so it may be difficult for you to play an older game. For the same reason you may not like Pillars of Eternity. The graphics are certainly of the last decade and not this one, it looks like a game created in the end of 2000's. Does this mean that the graphics do not lookl good? The answer is no. They try to compensate for not being high-tech bY BEAUTIFUL HAND DRAWN BACKGROUNDS AND BEAUTIFUL ARTWORK. the design may not be that of high technology but it EMPHASISES ON LOOKING BEAUTIFUL AND NOT BEING ONE OF THE MOST RECENT TECHNOLOGY IN GRAPHICS. IT LOOKS GOOD IN THE EYE WHERE A LOT OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY TRIPLE A's FAIL. This is is why I give an 8/10 in GRAPHICS.\nAnother relevant you would like to consider, and gamers-older and younger-should consider is whether DO CUTSCENES REALLY MATTER? HOW IS A CUTSCENE A PART OF THE ACTUAL GAME? In the older times I was hungry for new, high tech cutscenes too, but after playing Divinity Original Sin last year, I found out that it is now for me LESS IMPORTANT THAN I THOUGHT. RECENT TRIPLE A'S FOCUS IN CUTSCENES TOO MUCH AND THEYMOSTLY NEGLECT  THE QUALITY OF THE STORY!!! THEY TRY TO MAKE GENERIC STORIES SO THEY CAN SELL IT TO EVERYONE AND NOT GOOD ONES. MOST OF THEM HAVE STUPID STORIES COMPARED TO OLD GAMES. in the beggining I thought that the reason I was tired of playing newer games was because I got older, but then there are games like this one that which give me the excitement that older games were giving me. AND A GOOD STORY MATTERS MORE THAN CUTSCENES. PILLARS OF ETERNITY IS A TEXT HEAVY GAME BECAUSE IT IS A REAL RPG, WHERE STORY DEPTH, CONVERSATIONS AND CHOICES MATTER AND CHANGE THE WORLD AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE QUESTS. OTHERWISE THIS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE ANYTHING MORE THAN FETCH/KILL QUESTS OF RECENT RPGS. YOUNGER GAMERS COULD TRY TO GET USED TO IT. It is not easy in the Beggining but it pays off. As for me I really need to play games with a story and depth like this one. so STORY 10/10\n\nANOTHER WEAK POINT OF MANY TRIPLE A's IS THE OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF GAMES RULES AND MECHANICS. GAMES WHICH ARE SIMPLER CAN SELL TO A BIGGER MARKET, BUT THEY ARE SOMETIMES INSULTING AND UNCHALLENGING IN COMPARISON TO OLDER GAMES. AN UNCHALLENGING GAME OR A GAME WITH FEW CHOICES IN TACTICS IS MORE LIKE AN INTERACTIVE VIDEO THAN A GAME. PILLARS OF ETERNITY HAS DEEP MECHANICS AND MAKES THE PLAYER TO TRY TO FIND THE MOST SUITABLE TACTICS FOR THE CHARACTERS IN CONTROL. BATTLES CAN BE CHALLENGING IN THE NORMAL MODE EVEN FOR RPG TABLETOPS PLAYERS LIKE ME. I would give it a straight ten if it wasn't for some bugs in the party's AI which make the use of micromanagement inevitable and a bug which I had to tolerate in one of my fighter's abilities(into the fray ability) which made the ability unavailable during the last twenty hours of the game). For this reason. GAME MECHANICS 10/10 BUT GAME'S AI 8/10.\nANOTHER PART OF A GOOD GAME. ESPECIALLY AN RPG IS THE LORE. I THINK THAT THE LORE IS AMAZING. I personally prefer this lore to the lore of FR for example, as I find the lore of FR good for designing any kind of tabletop campaign but a bit too generic. BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT TRIPLE A's worlds are usually too kitch for my taste. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT QUALITY COMES IN BIG NUMBERS. A DRAGON IS A REVERED THING IN HIGH FANTASY. A THOUSAND DRAGONS IS A RIDICULOUS ONE. I FOUND MYSELF DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE LORE OF PILLARS OF ETERNITY, BUT THAT IS SUBJECTIVE. SO LORE 10/10.\n\nMUSIC/SOUND/ACTING: A Game which has not perfect graphics can invest a lot in music and sound. THE MUSIC IS GREAT BUT NOT AS GREAT AS IN THE DIVINITY SERIES. THE THEMES ARE WONDERFUL BUT THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THEM. For this Reason: MUSIC 9/10. The SOUND IS OKAY NOT EXCEPTIONAL 7/10. The budget was limited so NOT ALL OF THE DIALOGUES OF IMPORTANT NPC'S ARE RECORDED. I THINK THAT THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD WEIRD!!! MOST OF THE TIMES IT IS NOT A PROBLEM THOUGH AND I WILL BE LENIENT ON THAT BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED BUDGET. THIS WOULD BE UNFAIR FOR THE ACTORS, WHO DID AN AMAZING JOB AND GIVE EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES. For this reason: ACTING:10/10\n\nA 9/10 is a fair score for this game. But in my heart it will always be one of the 10/10 titles. I DON'T SAY THAT THIS GAME IS FOR A EVERYONE. BUT I DON'T CARE. IF YOU ARE BUYING IT YOU SHOULD JUDGE IT ACCORDING TO THE THINGS IT PROMISES TO DELIVER. AND IT DOES DELIVER!!!!

The fact that I'm 50 hours in and yet have barely scratched the surface of this excellent game, should tell you something about the size and density of this nostalgic throw back to the Infinity games of yore.\nThe first thing likely to strike you will take place in the character generation screens. It's easy to get so involved in this process that an hour will easily flick by. I can think of few games since the Baldurs Gates series or Icewind Dales that have had that effect, perhaps Skrim or Morrowind, but again this just proves the richness of the characters and backgrounds on offer here.\nOnce into the game proper I felt instantly transported to the Baldurs Gate and Torment era. A little further scratching showed that whle POE has stayed true to those great games it does not feel like a game of that generation. Indeed Obsidian have managed to create a modern and innovative RPG that feels just as right in 2015 as would have in 2000 at the height if the Infiity engine age.\nTo name just a few of the things on offer here, player choice, great NPC interaction, a rich and diverse world and an even richer and diverse story.\nSo far I can't find a lot to fault. If I had to come up with one negative it could be that I will struggle to go back and play the likes of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale again, as finally they will feel aged and matched, if not bettered, by a modern RPG.","April 6, 2015","true","152.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Examples: you might be required to KITE a boss around with a ranged dps character becuase the rest of your party is DEAD/MAIMED, you might be required to use tight spots (DOORS) to prevent enemies from overwhelming your party, you might be required to PULL monsters where you want them to be before actually engaging them, etc.\n\nAlso note that you can't tell if your enemy is tougher than you, so save often and don't fret.

The first is the lack of AI on your party members. They will just sit their even when combat starts until given an order and sometimes their orders get lost so they just stand there again. I'm playing on a harder difficulty so I constantly pause to micromanage but for the trash fights it can get a little tedious. The second is the seemingly random voice acting. Sometimes a response will be voice acted but the next in the same conversation wont be and then suddenly the last is.

I've heard this and don't see how it's possible. I finished everything (side quests and all) in 42 hours.\n2) Plot wasn't good, sadly. I was very disappointed by the ending. It was anticlimactic, didn't really make any sense, and just left me feeling underwhelmed. Hopefully expansions are better.\n3) I have had a few major bugs but was able to fix them and proceed using console cheats (no achieves, though).\n\nPositives -\n\n+The environments and art are gorgeous and easily the best part of the game.\n+So many UI and extra features to love; a lot of customizable options in menus, great tooltips/descriptions, slow/fast mode, the ability to leave companions at the keep, etc.\n+Writing is great; it’s not perfect but for the most part it is engaging.\n+I love the written cutscenes and physical descriptions embedded in dialogue.\n+The amount of choice in the dialogue, such as the different dispositions and attribute checks, is really great, even if it is an illusion of choice at times.\n+I like the keep; it's not deeply customizable but it's fun\n+Character customization is great, as usual for Obsidian games.\n+I’m mostly enjoying the combat so far, more than I thought I would (that was my biggest concern).\n+Surprisingly glitch free (for me); that’s not to say I doubt that others have glitches - I’m sure they are out there, but so far I haven’t had many at all.\n+Music is decent; I appreciate how the composer tried to make much of it reminiscent of old Infinity games.\n\n\nNegatives -\n\n-The writing is sometimes a bit rough. There are some cheesy lines and places where the voice acting doesn’t match the description of what is happening (e.g., says she giggles but the voice actor sounds sad).\n-Only 12 levels. I understand that this will increase with more content but... 12 is a little underwhelming. At least 15, preferably 20, would be a better pace.\n-Crafting. I don't know, it's just boring. I barely used it... Bland recipes, simple system, not really fun at all.\n-Having to scout to reveal hidden objects is really annoying... I'd rather not move that slowly all the time, at risk of losing out on hidden treasures if I don't. Should be like NWN where the reveal happened without having to stealth.\n-Really bad pathing. It's actually worse than it is in older games. You'd think that more modern games would have better algorithms for this but apparently not. My characters will be standing right next to an enemy and instead of walking 2 feet to the left so that they can hit them, they stand there confused as to why they can't reach past my other characters.\n-I’m not happy with some of the choices in stat design, which I already knew about before purchasing. For example, while I like that they tried to make every stat useful to every class, I don’t like some of the decisions they made in making certain stats not just useful but essential to classes who shouldn’t be using these as primary stats. The best example of this is the wizard and might. I want to roleplay the stereotypical old, lanky, wizard. He shouldn’t be ‘mighty’, he should be intelligent, keen, and perceptive, maybe a little dexterous but certainly not mighty. Yet if I give him reduce points in ‘might’, his damage will suck. I don’t like this at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lolitron/recommended/291650/","Lolitron","Aeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lolitron/","436 products in account","Pillars of Eternity, what can I even say that has not been said about this masterwork.  Being a fan of Infinity engine games of old, ie Baldurs gate 1 & 2, Planescape Torment, Arcanum.  Among other non infinity games such as Neverwinter knights, Dungeon Siege ect.  This game is the glorious return of the infinity style isometric rpgs.\n\nTrue Strategic Combat,  every engagement in this game is dangerous, you can easily wipe your party against even the simplest of enemies, especially on Path of the Damned difficulty.  This game nails the pausable real time combat system from the days of old in a way Dragon Age Origins only dreamed it could.  This is the true sequel that the infinity engine games deserved back then when Bioware decided to go for the more casual approach.\n\nA deep compelling story and companions.  Hundreds of pages worth of dialogue (some is even voiced)  deep conversation trees, meaningful responses, so far beyond a simple good and evil system a la Mass Effect or dragon age.  Each companion has real in game world beliefs, aspirations, interests ect.  I find myself dripping at the mouth for more, where in some other games I've found myself wanting to skip dialogue.  The world building is astounding and it sucks you in almost instantly.  Mature dark fantasy at its very best.  No shoe horned in sex scenes or cheesy lines can be found here.  The world is so well developed and so believable that I just cant pull myself away.\n\nI can't say enough good about this game really.  It is the true Baldurs Gate 3 that everyone has wanted for years, all shiny with a coat of new paint and modern game play improvements without leaching out the life that makes these games so loved.  When I compare this to an attempt like Dragon Age it's almost laughable.  Dragon age is the definition of streamlining, casualization and consolitus,  and even though Origins was a good game it really did destroy the line of games and turned them into something more accessible.  Pillar's does this in the right way instead.  It makes the game more accessible but not at the expense of difficulty or charm.\n\nIt's sure to spawn a fantastic new series, and will spearhead the renaissance of CRPGs.  Obsidian, along with other companies like Larian, with their fantastic Divinity Original Sin, and inXile with their Wasteland 2 and upcoming Torment: Tides of Numeria are proving that a game doesn’t have to be all about multiplayer and graphics, and that not every gamer wants their games easier with every new iteration.\n\nI played Dragon Age Inquisition,  the tactical camera made me want to vomit, its completely unusable, and the game has essentially devolved into a strategy-less third person hack n slash game.  Bioware, oh why have you fallen so far, Just take a few pointers from Obsidian here, they made the game you have been incapable of making for the last 20 years, and they did it right the first time.\n\nIf you are in any way a fan of RPGs or Strategy games, you woudl be doing yourself a huge favour by pickign thsi game up.  It's net even the price of a full game, and it has more content and depth than most 70 dollar games even dream of having.\n\nIf you are a fan of Dragon Age or Mass Effect, I strongly urge you to pick this game up, and see how much deeper an RPG can be when the chains of mass market and console release are removed.  I guarentee you will not be dissapointed.\n\nIt would be foolish to overlook Pillars of Eternity.","April 4, 2015","true","257.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a flawed but ultimately worthy imitator of the great Baldur's Gate series, and a promising sign of things to come.\nIf you are the kind of person who has purchased any of the recent Black Isle remasters from Beamdog, then let me tell you in no uncertain terms that you should go buy PIllars of Eternity right now. It is the nearest thing to Baldur's Gate II since Baldur's Gate II, and if that doesn't already make you champ at the bit, then let me tell you that its a darn good facsimile.\n\nIf you aren't the kind of person who has done something like that, then the first thing you'll want to know is that Pillars of Eternity is an isometric party management RPG in the style of the old nineties and noughties games, complete with their beautiful writing, massive single player adventure, and difficulty. While you start off going through the familiar motions of building a character, Pillars of Eternity introduces a few new wrinkles that make it interesting. For starters, while all the familiar archetypes are represented, some truly weird and original character classes exist here, including the chanter who sings harmful and helpful chants, and the cipher, who wields eldritch power to corrupt and destroy the souls of your foes. All the classes feel suitably different, and at time of writing the balance seems to be fairly good across the board. Another thing that Pillars of Eternity does that will probably surprise newcomers to the genre is that every single stat has a direct and significant combat impact. There are no dump stats here and while this means min-maxers will probably be arguing amongst each other for months to come, it is now pretty tricky to gimp your character.\n\nYou can also supplement your party of six adventurers by hiring characters you create from scratch at any inn. But this would be a mistake. The game includes 8 NPC companions, and you should do everything in your power to have all of them in your party at some point in the game as their writing and acting is so well done you would be robbing yourself of the experience by building a custom party of adventurers. This quality of writing extends to virtually everything else you'll encounter during the course of the game to boot, and it is consistently excellent from start to finish (with two minor and largely irrelevant exceptions which I mention below). Without spoiling anything, the world of Eora will seem immediately familiar to anyone who has spent any time travelling around Faerun in the Forgotten Realms, but it doesn't just feel different enough to be fresh - it's positively revelatory.\n\nOh, and did I mention its gorgeous? The area maps are eye poppingly beautiful, and the characters actually animate splendidly, plus there are loads of cool spell and ability effects. In fact, sometimes they can even be a bit overwhelming. There were moments, especially early on when I was finding my bearings, where I couldn't tell what was going on in fights.\n\nThe game also features a brand new, proprietary combat system that you'll need to spend a little time getting your head around. And I really do mean that, because this game is hard. Even on Easy or Normal difficulty (which you should probably stick to if you're the kind of person who only plays games once) you will sometimes find yourself badly overwhelmed at strange points as though the game was poorly paced. The learning curve is hardly gentle either, and even if you know your way around this sort of game, there are variations both intentional and unintentional that you wont anticipate in your first few hours with the game. It's a recipe for frustration, and while genre veterans are likely familiar with that feeling, if you're not used to that kind of abuse, expect Pillars of Eternity to test your patience from time to time. Still, the challenge rarely feels unfair (though make no mistake - there are some moments where it feels EXTREMELY unfair in some of the optional endgame content), and it is immensely satisfying to finally triumph over a difficult encounter.\n\nPartly this is because a job well done is its own reward, but partly this is because of the loot! And Pillars Eternity has a heck of a lot of it, and it comes in a pretty smooth progression that reminds me of the best moments of Baldur's Gate II, when you were excited to pick up the burning sword that the most recent boss left behind when he finally keeled over. And best of all, the game smartly does away with the old dumb system of playing inventory tetris, Pillars of Eternity allows you to have an unlimited number of items in your inventory in the form of a stash chest that is accessible at any time with a single mouse click whenever you bring up your inventory screen. For anyone who is used to juggling arrows and quest items, it feels downright civilized.\n\nThe game is not perfect, however. Even after a patch designed to address it, the game features a strangely low level cap that you will absolutely hit. "But wait," I hear you say, "Baldur's Gate had a level cap!" This is true, but it was one that you could only hit by importing your heroes and taking them through the game, and subsequent games abandoned them entirely. By contrast, you may make the unpleasant discovery that you are max level just around the time you really feel like you're starting to cruise. It's jarring and unpleasant, and it's best you're aware of it now.\n\nFurther, a lot of the kickstarter stretch goal content is terrible. For example, early on in the game you encounter a stronghold which you capture and make your own. While it houses the biggest and best dungeon crawl in the game, it also features a stronghold building metagame that is deceptively terrible. The game is also awash in backer NPCs and memorials - NPCs and gravestones designed by kickstarter backers identifiable by their yellow name bars and tombstone icons. These are uniformly terrible, and you may make the mistake of wasting time reading through them when you first boot up the game. The serious player should regard them as unfortunate concessions to people who wanted to overpay for the game and ignore them completely. It is a real shame to think that these efforts could have been spent on shoring up the game itself.\n\nThe only other objection I have with Pillars of Eternity is that it is just a little more segmented than it should be. In each Act you are gated on the world map in some ways that feel pretty silly, and while it still feels pretty modern, it lacks the freeform feel that the very best games in the genre had. Still, this is a minor complaint, and there is lots of great sidequesting and adventuring to be done.\n\nOverall, Pillars of Eternity feels like it has all the things that a throwback to one of the old greats should have, plus a few smart new inventions. It's actually a little short and content light by genre standards, as the game clocks in at around 40 or 50 hours for an leisurely, exhaustive completionist playthrough, and perhaps a little more than 30 for a more main-story-only run. But if we're being honest with ourselves, that's still a whole lot of bang for your buck, and oh boy, what a ride Pillars of Eternity is if you're up for its challenges.","May 24, 2015","true","49.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Mediocre combat. This game is the definition of mediocrity.\n\nPossibly the weakest story yet by Obsidian standards. Completely forgettable antagonist with an overcomplicated story that tries to be 2deep4u and to make you think while failing to do so. You can easily notice that it was written by different people trying to copy someone else's style of writing.\n\nGameplay wise I'd say it's "okay" as well. If you've played Baldur's Gate 1, that's pretty much what you're gonna get, except spells are more "MMORPG" like. Freeze for x seconds, stun for y, etc. There's no time stop or any other fun spells in here.\n\nMusic is extremely repetitive. It's good when you're 5 hours in, but when you reach the end 60 hours later you'll probably want to mute it.\n\nBackgrounds are dull for the most part. Exceptions to the caves, the late-game area with all the dragons which is quite colourful, and the area where the last boss fight takes place, which is wonderful to look at.\n\nI'd dare say it is easily Obsidian's worst RPG so far (not counting NWN2). Worth a playthrough, but that's about it.

I have beaten it twice once on normal and then again on path of the damned.  POTD was hard but only at the beginning, with good custom NPCs, you can still crush the bad guys at the end.  I did things totally different with each time I played it and the endings changed and the stories mid game changed and the quest items were different.  I am really really impressed by this game and I cannot wait for the expansion to come out.  I beat this, then said ok time for wasteland 2, after a few hours Im back at pillars.   then i say ok something new time for Divinity, then after a few hours its back to pillars.

An old school isometric cRPG? Heck yes I'm in!  Evern if it's a fraction as good as Baldur's Gate or Shadows of Amn it will still be amazing. Like Icewind Dale back in the day.\n\nI was a bit worried that Obsidian (formerly Black Isle) would botch this like so many other games in their back catalogue but after about 20-something hours it seems my fears were unfounded.\n\nThe writing is pretty good and at times really hit home with the imagery they presented in text. The background lore is fairly interesting and the writes did a good job of creating a world with a rich past and interesting conflicts and inhabitants. My only real qualm with the dialogue, writing, and conversations was the voice acting. Sure, hearing recognizable voices was fun but the talking ruins it for me. I want to read not listen. I can read faster than you can talk and give you accents of my own imagining! Gah!\n\nThe combat is very similar to Infinity games, closer to Icewind Dale II than Baldur's Gate though. Per encounter / Per rest abilities spice things up while you're playing a figher, ranger, or barbarian compaired to BG. The caster classes and spells are all interesting and visually pleasing. I found the difficulty level fairly tame, even on Hard and Path of the Damned (Pillars hardest), but that comes with many years of playing tactical RPG's I think. If you're new to this type of genre you might want to steer clear of anything above Normal.\n\nGraphiclly it looks much like other Unity Engine games. Shadowrun Returns, Divinity:OS, and Wasteland 2 all share the engine with Pillars and it's easy on the eyes and I believe Pillars did a better job on scenery than the others. The towns, cities, and wilderness areas are all beautiful.\n\nThis is a great game for any cRPG / Infinity Engine enthusiests and highly reccomended. If you enjoy a good RPG in general you might want to check this one out.","April 15, 2015","true","190.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have not had this much fun playing a CRPG since Planescape: Torment.\n\nThe game feels like a classic Infinity Engine game (Baldurs Gate, Planescape Torment, Icewind Dale), but revised with modern graphic capabilities.   Some of the best gameplay improvements are:\n\n* Half Speed Movement\n* Double Speed Movement\n* Inventory Stash to remove inventory management mini-game (easy access can be disabled for the truely hardcore)\n* Removal of need to monster grind for levels by eliminating XP from monsters after a certain amount of kills of that monster type.  The XP focus is now on initial kills of a monster type and Quest experience.\n\nHere are some other gameplay change that you may or may not like. I find that they streamline the game over D&D type rulesets:\n\n* Trap Detection / Trap disarmement / Picklocking all covered by same skill: mechanics\n* Mechanics is a skill that any class can learn, so it is no longer mandatory to have a rogue in order to cover the above thief like actions.\n* Some spells/skills can be used a certain number of times per combat\n* mage/priests can cast a certain number of spells of each level per 'rest'; mages can only select 4 spells per level\n* AoE spells have 2 ranges, an inner range that can target both friend and foe, and an outer range that only can target foes.  In addition some AoE spells are listed as foe-only and can not harm friendly characters.  Stats can increase the radius of an AoE spell.\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who was a fan of the RPG classics from the 90s and early 00's.","March 29, 2015","true","212.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
