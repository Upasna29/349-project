"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KnightGamerRex/recommended/426010/","KnightGamerRex","KnightGamerRex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KnightGamerRex/","528 products in account","Womb Room is a rather strange game. The goal of the player is simply to die. There are chances that you will die by your own means or by accident. A single run of the game will take less than 5 minutes, but there was a single run that I played that ended before it started. I started the game and died as a baby before being born.\n\nThe game is glitchy, however. All text would say "Null" and nothing else. I'm sure this was supposed to be replaced with some sort of reason behind my death. Some items clip through other things or the ground. I really wanted to like this game, but there's just not much to it.\n\nI'm sure my time with the game was bad simply because I couldn't tell what was going on with the "Null" problem.\n\nYou roam around each room picking up things and setting them down. There's not much else to do in each room other than that. Then you walk through one of four doors and await your life on the other side hoping you made the right choice.\n\nI'd give this game a go I suppose if you have time to waste, otherwise don't waste your time with it.","April 4","false","0.1"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","64","75","3","3"

First off it has no options and literally no UI once you have started the game you only have the option to quit or finish the game. Second the game is very short and has very little to no plot and with most of my outcomes my character would be dead before the teenage years. I see no point to play this game more than once and it is not worth 1.50~3.00$. I would suggest to the developer to make this game free and think about working on his coding a bit before actually selling his product.","April 4","false","0.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

You are given a life. You can die at any point in that life. You go through birth, childhood, teenage years, adulthood, and your elderly stages. As mentioned in some other reviews it is all randomly generated what happens. What would make this game at least come close to the potential it had for the price, is if the rooms weren't so pointless. Perhaps if the objects you interacted with effected your room, or the doors had a more karma like variety to them and it mattered the decisions you made. All in all though you just pick whatever door, walk through it, and a puppet generates the next step in your life. If you are an achievement hunter keep in mind that all of the achievements in this game are simply rng based and some seem like a really low chance.\n\nNot really worth wasting the money on.","April 7","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
