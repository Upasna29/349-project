This game really makes you realize how much Jason Brody, Booker Dewitt, and every other major  fps protagonist since owe the man with the crowbar, Gordon Freeman.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsa2by4/recommended/280/","itsa2by4","Theuaredead`","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsa2by4/","151 products in account","Half-Life: Source is the 2004 port of Valve's award winning game to the Source Engine. With just that knowledge, it would sound like Half-Life: Source was a gift from above, but it's anything BUT that. Half-Life: Source was critically panned, which makes you wonder HOW it has a "Very Positive" on Steam Reviews. Half-Life: Source is one of those games Valve chooses to forget, with the likes of the first Left 4 Dead and Ricochet. But, before we get into a review, lets go over the history of Half-Life: Source.\n\nThe History:In 1999, Valve started development of Half-Life 2, the award winning squeal to Half-Life, originally running on the GoldSource engine. Around 2001/2002, the Source Engine was created, and it surpassed what the GoldSource engine could do, so, Valve planned to port Half-Life to the Source Engine to have it replace the GoldSource counter parts. In 2003, Axel Gambe got a hold of the full Half-Life 2 Source Code, raw map data, and a build of Half-Life 2, who later gave it to some friends, who leaked it. In those leak files, there was the Half-Life Source port, along with files to a Source port of TFC, DMC, and CS 1.6 (which was remotely playable, but at this time, this port was starting to become the game we know today as CS:S.) The port of Half-Life: Source was quite buggy and unfinished, which is to be expected for it being a leak of a beta. So, 2004 comes around, and then Half-Life 2 is coming around the corner, as a bundle with Half-Life 2, you could get Counter-Strike: Source (by this time is the game we all know and probably love) and Half-Life: Source. Half-Life: Source saw little change from the 2003 leak of Half-Life 2, minus some minor bug fixes and having the Half-Life 1 HUD. At this point, be expected Half-Life: Source to be just like Counter-Strike: Source, a re-imagining of the game, in HD (for 2004 standards), but what they got was a direct Half-Life port that didn't seam quite finished. This is why if you ask anyone why they don't like Half-Life: Source for the most part (especially pre-2013) you get told it's graphics were just the Half-Life graphics. But as stated before, Half-Life: Source was meant to replace Half-Life as a whole, but due to how poorly received it was, Half-Life Original saw another day. In 2006, Valve ported the Deathmatch counter part of Half-Life into the Source Engine, and if you thought Half-Life: Source was a bad port, you should of saw this game. All player ragdolls had broken physics, some weapons were broken (the Shotgun's double barrel sound is just the single barrel sound), and the gameplay was more like Half-Life 2 Deathmatch with minor HLDM gameplay stuff slapped in (the game even lacks the backpack pickups that were in Half-Life Deathmatch), the only reason I can see for this port, was just to give EP1 a pack-in game. Around 2007, Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source were ported to Source Base 2007, but due to the amount of bugs now included with the game, Valve didn't release this patch to the public, it wasn't until 2012 that the public knew of this update's existence, since in 2012, the whole 2008/2007 source code to Source Base 2007 was leaked into the public, it also confirmed that the Team Fortress Classic port was in further development than what everyone thought. But due to the amount of hate towards Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source would mean we would probably never seen of these ports.\n\nSo, that runs down a good chunk of the history of Half-Life: Source besides one of the more major things, the 2013 update. Valve in an effort to ditch the GCF system and upgrade everything to VPK and have a better downloading system and a better game asset pack to engine communication, they created Steampipe, but since Valve decided it would be best to port all games to Source Base 2013, they decided to do that, and try to provide updates to all Valve games. In the same year, Valve canned the project, leaving a ton of games in a broken state, Half-Life: Source being one of them.\n\nSo, this leads us into the review.\n\nThe ReviewHalf-Life: Source was a mediocre port to the Source Engine, where it would be mixed who liked the game and disliked the game, since Half-Life: Source had that audience. Half-Life: Source is now a BAD port to the Source Engine, since those 2013 updates broke more than what it fixed. Not only did Valve cancel the updates to these games, they released the beta depots into the release depot to remove traces of GCFs. So, those games that had a good release depot, now have a beta released into them, and a lot of these betas were far from done. We now have broken Save/Restore errors in various NPCs, 2 out of the 3 tentacles in Blast Pit can harm the player or AI, one of the maps in Residue Processing will blind the player if your flashlight is turned on, skill configurations are broken (so now the AI is harder), Gonarch spit is now black squares, one of the maps in Surface Tension has a broken skybox, you can jump over a lot of things making it so you can skip half of "We got Hostiles" and skip various other parts in other chapters, all of the Chrome shaders are complete ♥♥♥ (they were never good, but this is just worse), and even more. It's sad when a 2003 leak is better and more playable than a 2013 update. Plus, if you load the HD Pack you get a GameBanana skin pack, since Valve was too lazy to port the assets their selves of even double check to be everything matched in the first place. But the icing on the cake is that, well, at first install, you can't even PLAY Half-Life: Source since Valve provided corrupted or outdated DLLs to Steam VR, so every time you reinstall Half-Life: Source you have to verify the cache of Half-Life 2 or Steam VR. Not only that, the person who was working on these updates, Alfred, shrugged off a few errors as design points.\n\nHalf-Life: Source had potential to be a great port, to even be on par with the Original Half-Life (definitely should NEVER replace the Original), but its potential was lost with a company who couldn't care enough about the game, which is why it was left for about 6 years without an update.\n\nI recommend to play Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source so you can see what happens when a company just flat out doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEven though I didn't review the pre-2013 build, I'm still going to give it a rating\n\nThe Half-Life: Source that existed before 2013, I give that a 6 out of 10\n\nI give the current Half-Life: Source a 4 out of 10, avoid at all costs.\n\nActually, I recommend you report both Half-Life: Source and Deathmatch: Source, as it very unplayable and is using stolen assets. You shouldn't let Valve sell this to people, especially when people think this is the better version of Half-Life","August 10, 2015","false","42.5"," 428 of 575 people (74%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","74","428","575","48","32"

Would I recommend Half-Life: Source? Er, maybe. The original Half-Life was, and still is, an absolutely fantastic game. The story and how it’s conveyed to the player works extremely well, and the controls, gameplay mechanics, visuals, and sound are all phenomenal. Very few bugs, and certainly none game-breakingly noteworthy.\n\nHowever, this is where Half-Life: Source fails. This game’s major problem is its glitches and bugs. Some minor, some absolutely game-breaking. On one hand, you have scientist’s AI screwed up, running into open fire, constantly shooting off their response lines. On the other hand, you have some parts of the game where the textures and models go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, essentially simulating your graphics card melting.\n\nEven with the bugs, the game does try to make it up with some enhancements thanks to the Source engine. The water effects are slightly better (although in my experiences it’s just extraordinarily shiny and reflective), and the lighting effects are significantly improved, although inconsistent when walking into an area that needs to load. However, the HL2 bullet hole decals make it possible to create magnificent works of art with your crowbar on walls.\n\nThankfully, the gameplay, controls, and overall look and appeal of the game is still there, unaltered. There’s no denying that the game is awesome. Half-Life in general is awesome. I just love how people on the GoldSrc version of Half-Life were complaining about the game having extremely old and outdated graphics, saying HL:Source is better in this field. Well, it’s not. A majority of textures and models are completely identical. Aside from the water and bullet decals, the games are visually the same, which is something I’m completely fine with. The regular version of Half-Life actually comes with the HD texture pack, something this port lacks. It essentially gives the game updated models to characters and weapons, and slightly enhanced textures in some areas. It’s nice, but not essential, which is fine.\n\nOverall, yeah, go ahead and get it. If this is ever on sale for cheaper than the regular Half-Life, and you own neither, by all means, go ahead and get it. You (hopefully) won’t regret it.\n","July 2, 2014","true","10.4"," 76 of 82 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","76","82","0","1"

Assuming, of course, that it was designed for its engine.  Meet Half-Life Source, a game that was made on GoldSrc then converted to show off the new engine they had made.\n\nHL simply wasn't designed for Source, and no effort was put into properly re-writing the game for the new engine.  The AI is bugged to eternally walk into any wall, I've yet to see a working hitbox, and HL1's graphics are better than this remake.  It's actually unplayable due to the scripted events being broken.  Sorry, that door isn't opening.\n\nSo you may ask about the low playtime.  Well, when I realized I wouldn't be entering the test chamber, I tried skipping forward a few levels with the map command.  Guess what?  BUGS!  LOTS OF EM!  Nearly anything involving AI interaction would NEVER happen, half the time your enemies can't even hurt you (and vice versa), and a few levelskips forward, I even fell out of the world once when I got hit by a box.\n\nOverall, I'm scoring HL Source with a 3/10.  A complete waste of money you're seeing here, it's got to be some sort of joke on Valve's part.\n\nIf you want to play the REAL Half-Life bug-free on the GoldSrc engine, click here.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/70/","September 27, 2014","false","0.5"," 315 of 432 people (73%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","73","315","432","18","32"

Half-Life is Half-Life. It's unimaginably fantastic. Half-Life Source is different though. It's essentially the same game, just on a more updated engine. And while that might sound like a good thing, Half-Life 1 wasn't designed for the Source engine. It doesn't fit. The updated textures look strange and out of place, it's buggy as all hell, and the AI is changed. That last one's big. Considering there's no cutscenes in Half-Life, any important scenes are done as scripted events. And with the AI different, they just don't act the way they're intended, making you miss important story points. I've also noticed that they move around a lot, so you'll get swarmed real quick, which makes the game go from challenging to unfair. It also doesn't help that weapon switching is unnecessarily slow in this one compared to the original, giving a horde of enemies barrel-assing around the corner ample time to punch holes in you. Also, with the new Source engine, any music that's playing is cut off when you move to the next map, and since there's music cues right before a map change, you'll hear the first five seconds of the song before it just stops playing. Seriously, if you want it, make sure you play the original first. I may have under twenty hours on the Source version, but I have over 130 hours on the GoldSrc version. And that's the campaign alone. Don't be stupid. Get the original.","July 29, 2015","false","21.0"," 93 of 119 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","93","119","5","2"

With less game breaking bugs and better textures.\n\nAt first when I started playing I didn't notice many different things as the game still looks a lot like the original Half Life. Apart from some different textures like the better models and water physics the game looks pretty much identical.\n\nMy biggest problem with the original version of Half Life was that the game was incredibly buggy. I encountered many game breaking bugs. This wasn't the case with Source. Apart from one chapter where I encountered texture pop ins, I didn't encounter much more.\n\nIn the end there's nothing more I can say about Half Life Source that I didn't say in my original review. It's a fantastic game and one of my favorite games to date. I highly suggest buying it if you haven't already and playing.\n\nNow which version do I recommend playing ? I suggest playing this instead of the original. But I do suggest getting the first one just for Opposing Force and Blue Shift.\n\nFinal Rating:\n8/10 - Worth Buying\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a like and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 26, 2015","true","7.5"," 82 of 103 people (80%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","80","82","103","10","2"

There really is no difference between this and Half-Life other than chapter selecting, gmod compatibility, and source enging modding and editing etc.\n\nEdit:\n\nWith the current EA release of Black Mesa it made me think. A bunch of people on the BM forums are complaining about how it's a paid mod and all that junk, but really BM is a giant remastering, a complete overhaul built from the ground up in a whole new light, and yet Half-Life: Source still lingers around and has no real fresh thing about it other than it's simply on the source engine and there is no mod community for it at all.\n\nPeople should be getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at this than BM, because this has more reason for it. If BM was released by Valve, or just suddenly popped up without anything previously knowing about it, it would have no hate whatsoever.\n\nHalf-Life: Source should not be sold separately because it has nothing to it that's worth a full 10 dollar price tag on it's own.

Playing HL is an experience, regardless of trivialities such as this.\n\nI wouldn't get this by itself personally; if you really wanna pick it up, get it via one of the packs in the Store and/or wait for a sale.\n\nOne interesting note though, you can load up the content from this game in Garry's Mod. If you have Gmod, this might give you some fun stuff to play around with.","January 11","true","0.2"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","32","35","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charmander5/recommended/280/","charmander5","Davjo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charmander5/","64 products in account","Half-Life is an amazing adventure, sci-fi, and FPS game from Valve.  Your goal is to escape the ruined Black Mesa (the same one that is rivaled with Aperture Science from Portal) while fighting the invading aliens.  Even though first person shooters are generally hated today becayse they are considered rehashes and uncreative, this game is the exact opposite.\nYou start off in a train ride on your way to some sort of test chamber everyone is talking about.  As you take the ride, you will see a lot of different places that you will visit later, so pay attention.  You eventually make your way to the test chamber when disaster strikes and aliens invade.  It sounds a bit cliche at first, but the game tells the story in such a great way that it works.  You eventually meet a security guard and encounter enemies.  The security guard then helps you, which brings me to my first point.\nOne amazing thing about Half-Life is that it gives choices.  When you meet the security guard,  you already have your first weapon: a crowbar.  Since a crowbar is a weapon, and there is a person with a gun in front of you, and you need to survive... well, you can see what most people would do.  About 20 minutes into the game, you can already get a gun early, or you can have the security guard help you, until he is apparently can't crawl through a whole that an average scientist can... what a security guard.  This is just one example, and there are a lot of security guards willing to help you.\nAnyway, onto the graphics.  They're not as good as other Source games, but don't let that discourage you.  Games are meant to be played, not looked at.  Also, if you want to, you can make the game look like the original Half-Life.\nI would reccomend Half-Life to pretty much everbody, as long as you don't get scared easily.  Trust me, you will get a bit scared.  There is a creepy atmosphere, zombies, and A LOT of tension and a feeling you are being watched.  There are no jumpscares are other cheap scares, luckily (I'm looking at you, Slender).\nThis game gets a 10/10","March 1, 2014","true","35.4"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

Easily one the first FPS done perfectly while other developers went through their own growing pains of figuring out the magic formula that makes FPS of today so awesome. I had the previlage of playing this class on the Playstation 2 first. I miss those sweeter graphics vs the PC but more importantly the PC plays exactly the same. I loved the game enough that a minor graphic downgrade it perfectly acceptable because I don't own a Playstation 2 anymore but I still get to keep Half-Life. Excellent gameplay with a story that makes you want to see what happens next. Even after beating this game a dozen times, I still come back one every two to three years. It just weathers time that well. If you never played Half-Life, don't let it's age and dated graphics fool you. As cheap as you can get it today enjoy a fresh experience that shows you how great games began before the rules were known.

That being said... This version has taken that amazing game, ported it to the same engine as Half-Life 2, and neglected to fix the  massive  glitches. These include weapons that do not work properly, several graphical problems (If you use the flashlight in a few rooms, the visuals just about break.) Sure, the graphics are 'better' but all that is changed is the blood, lighting and the added ragdoll physics. But these clash with the textures, all of them much lower resolution, making the game look  worse	. I reccomend the original Half-Life, as well as it's expansions and sequels. And if you can't stand the graphics, then I reccomend Black Mesa Source. It's a  much	 better remake of the original Half-Life.","March 31","false","50.0"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","1"

The setting for the game is an underground research facility, your character witnesses a catastrophe that plunges the facility into chaos. You have to fend off alien species to escape the facility and try to figure out what is happening. It’s a sci-fi game and that’s what gives it its character. The weapons especially get more interesting as the game develops, as you start to discover more and more alien technology.\n\nI used to love watching my dad play this as a kid, but I just never managed to be able to get very far myself until I decided to go back to it now. The Half-Life 1 series is extremely nostalgic to me and its great still being able to play these games despite how old they are. For me, they are great, but I imagine for people that have never played them before, they might just look awful.\nDespite that, I would hope the overall feel and story of the game would be compelling enough to make those people enjoy it anyway.\n\nHalf-Life: Source has a few bugs here and there, a few of which I thought were going to be game breaking for me. But there was always a way around it. The glitches and bugs were tedious but given how old the game is it’s forgivable.\n\nThe source engine reboot of this game changes up the game quite a bit. It was given new map textures, new weapon models, new NPC models and enhances to the sound. The changes are good, they definitely make the game look better. But I enjoy the original just as much, if not more. I’m used to and remember the old one. Which oddly, when I played this game I’m not too sure what happened with it. I downloaded the game, fired it up and played quite a bit in one session. Not noticing that it was all actually the old game assets. I shut it down and gave the game a break and when I booted it back up suddenly the new stuff was being used. Weird!\n\nAnyway, there is never a dull moment in this game, there is action and something new always around the corner. It’s essentially a first person shooter, but it manages to break it up in-between and give you enough else to do so that it doesn’t get boring.\n\nIt’s all around a fun game and I think you should give it a try, even if you haven’t got that Half-Life nostalgia that I do.\n\n\nTL;DR : Old but great, lot of nostalgia for me. It’s a good first person shooter sci-fi game, give it a try.\n\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Half-Life: Opposing Force:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/50/","January 1","true","17.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","8"

For me there is no fix.\n\nWhen the game needs the user to open up the console and cheat to get it working, then you know its wrong.\n\nThe game feels like it was halfassed.

Well this is the same old Half Life we all know, except that now it has some improved textures, mainly the metalic ones (incluiding floors), overall lighting, color intensity and all of the character models. The weapons are better looking too as well as your H.E.V. suit (it has nice details on your hands and arms. I recommend it, yes, but only to people that don't own the original or die hard fans like me that would take up any excuse to replay this masterpiece.\n\nThe thing that bugs me (ignoring the glitches) is that this remasteriztion feels incomplete. Despite they added physics and the death's are more realistic and satisfying (plus the bullet impact splatter and the bullet holes on characters are a nice detail too) now you CAN'T hit them with the crowbar, it just passes through. The only way to "hit" the body is hitting the surface were it is and through the bodu. Only then it'll start moving and it is weird because the hit sound it's still the surface one. If they are re-releasing this too, they should have added something extra, like achievements or cards. I also hate that the impact sounds of the crowbar, even when you are smacking wood, it's METAL-HIT-LIKE SOUND. WHAAT????\n\nFinally, I have to say that I played Black Mesa. That is a remake, it has the essence of this game but changed some maps and things (the leechers on the water are gone and the enemies act and react different to the weapons, for example). I liked it and it was a good excuse to travel to Black Mesa again. I still prefer the originall one, but I salute the developers for making an outstanding job at it.","October 6, 2014","true","4.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

This is just a short insight on my thoughts of the Source version.\n\nHalf-Life: Source is simply the original Half-Life ported to Valve's newer (at the time) Source engine, it doesn't bring anything new to the table aside from a few new menu options such as selecting a chapter, but it does improve a handful of aspects, mostly minor and technical. The most noteable changes are to the water, the ragdoll physics and the map lighting (in some cases).\n\nThere are plenty of other minor things that you will notice after playing through once, it's like a new layer of polish, but nothing that would make me recommend buying this version over the original game as unfortunately the Source port has also caused a large number of bugs and errors to arise that were never in the original version. While some of the new features and mechanics in the Source engine are nice, the game hasn't really been updated to take those aspects into account, and thus, more problems popped up.\n\nSo I have mixed feelings about Half-Life: Source, but I'd say that this version is worth playing through at least once if you are a Half-Life fan, it has a slightly different feel to it but ultimately I'd say to just stick to the original version of the game instead. It may be dated but that's what gives it it's charm.","May 12, 2015","true","6.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","2"

I bought this with a package so it was worth it in terms of price.\n\nThe game crashed a fair amount and on one level the textures bled everywhere to the point where I couldn't see anything.  I had to search for a fix and it worked but that was really annoying.  Also the skyboxes on some levels are lacking in textures.  I also don't understand why your character moves so freakin' fast.   It's awkward when you're trying to complete the game's numerous jumping puzzles.\n\nHowever, this game is a classic that has influenced numerous subsequent FPSes, so if you buy this game you're owning a piece of gaming history.  I just think you should try to get the original version if you can, though Black Mesa looks interesting, too.\n\n\n\nI don't think it withstands the test of time quite as well as HL2, but it's a lot more fun to play than the original Wolfenstein these days.\n\n\n","May 25","false","30.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mauro_rmp/recommended/280/","mauro_rmp","mauro_rmp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mauro_rmp/","168 products in account","For the record, my review of Half Life: Source can be applied to the original version of the game, except for a few asects that I touch upon regarding its transition to the Source Engine.\n\nBy now, PC gamers everywhere have grasped full comprehension of Half Life. This monument of the videogame medium as a whole was VALVe Software's very first product; one that was by no means easy to produce, but was eternally rewarding. Half Life is still being played today and enjoyed by many people, and deservedly so. For it is one of those titles in videogame history that is recognized by many; even those who might have very little experience with the franchise or its modded stand-alone offsprings.\n\nHalf Life puts the player in the shoes and HEV mark IV Protective System of everyone's favorite mute, crowbar-wielding, monster-slaying, marine-fighting theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman. The plot takes a humble beginning, as Gordon arrives to work--late--and prepares for what seems like a regular day at the Black Mesa Research Facility in the underground desert landscape of New Mexico. Perhaps a regular day, if not for the "deviation from standard analysis procedure." The player is let loose to briefly explore parts of the facility, allowing for a brief settlement before the experiment you are taking part of goes horribly wrong and all of a sudden that elevator you rode is out of order, that corridor you walked through is now covered in blood. That security  guard you talked to is trying to revive a scientist you had just run into 5 minutes ago, and that other scientist you talked to has turned into some weird mutant that is now walking towards you, though no longer with any interests of making small talk. Everything that the player had seen and gotten used to is now part of a horrific thrill ride; one that is action packed and will only get better from there.\n\nThe game's story telling is absolutely fanstastic. It delivers a truly immersive experience by never leaving the first person perspective of the player and Dr. Freeman. It sacrifices cutscenes and cinematic mumbo-jumbo for first-hand experiences and uninterrupted gameplay. Said gameplay is very satisfying. There is a very good mix of firefights of varying intensity combined with puzzles and first person platforming. The puzzles can be a tad difficult at times, but just the right kind of difficulty to encourage perseverance and reward the player for their astuteness. Firefights are also quite fun; you start out making your way through waves of hostile inter-dimensional beings and later on fight none other than the few, the proud, the Marines, who pose quite an intimidating threat. The Marines really shine in the AI department, they're aggressive but smart enough to know when to retrieve. They have a sense of personal preservation unlike anything I have ever seen in any other videogame. They will try their hardest to kill Gordon, using any tools at their disposal, but they don't want to die, and will thus will make effective use of cover and defensive tactics.\n\nI would highly recommend purchasing the Source version of Half Life due to some added features such as much better particle effects, improved lighting and water effects, as well as the intergrated ragdoll physics. Those not interested in such added details could easily overlook the Source version and buy vanilla Half Life, seeing as how it is the same price on Steam as the Source version, but I would highly recommend getting this version for those who haven't experienced Half Life and are looking to get into it.\n\nYou musn't dare call yourself a fan of Half Life or VALVe if you haven't played this game. Experience the original tale of a theoretical physicist trying to escape the Black Mesa Research Facility, perfectly remastered into VALVe's state of the art Source engine. It's a game you will not regreat putting your time and money into","November 17, 2012","true","26.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Textures are pretty much the same. Models are better, but it's still the same pretty much. No new content of course.\n\nIf you own the original Half life, then this might give you a bit different view on it, but Black Mesa looks much better, because they completely remade the Half life story using the Source engine.\nIf you don't own the original Half life, then avoid this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/280/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Half-LIfe: Source is a, ehem, "remake" of Half-Life 1, which in this case means "we took HL1 recources and transfered them off GoldSrc engine to Source Engine". And yes, it contains single-player campaign of HL1... DeathMatch portion was released serapately later. Though now that you can only purchase bundle of Source with DM, it doesn't matter much. Yes, it comes with HD models from Blue Shift bundled\n\nSo, what remake brought? Nothing major. Just small things here and there. First, default things from engine changes - dynamic shadows from flashlight that HL2 Episode 2 brought into engine, for example. There is more of metallic reflective textures, that look ugly in the darkness. The water was changed into HL2 style one... Means more transperency yet the rippling animation was removed. Enemies don't have death animations anymore - they use ragdoll... Which sometimes looks clunky with low-polygon monsters. There are even occasional decoration object that now uses physics, like hooked boxes. And you don't throw boxes away over the hills when you try to move box sideways. At least it all comes along with HD Models pack from Blue Shift.\nOne of the non-graphics changes got to be improved AI, which I also think came. NPCs always react finely, while in original they would often first turn around slowly to face the threat. Security officers that follow you don't get lost as easily, you can even forget about babysitting them. And where in original they had "shoot at some aliens" as high priority, "follow the player" seems to be higher one in this remake... Which means that they will not shoot a thing if they will be busy following strafing player. Guards are better at guard duty, yep. On one of the notes, flying enemy with huge brain in final parts of games is now more aggresive, attempting to get into your face, all the time!\nSome of the damage values were changed. The biggest example got to be clowbar, it got buffed... Now, just like in HL2, it takes only one hit of this tool to bring down Headcrabs and Barnacles.\nSome of small bugs in HL1 were fixed, some new small bugs were added. Oh yea, and music stops when you go to the next area.\nBut overall, original is safer bet as mods for HL1 will work with original, not Source remake. But Source one isn't bad either. Much better looking today, at 2014 year thanks to engine updates, while at time of release it didn't look like it added much.\n\nDeathmatch multiplayer part of remake was released after single-player part and comes by default with bundle on Steam... But let's just say, it's dead and not worth checking out.\n\nP.S. I approve ability to start at any chapter, easier to pick up.","August 11, 2014","true","7.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

A complete remake of the original Half-Life but in the Source engine with all the technological and graphical improvements that would bring. It is something a lot of us fans of the original would love to see. Unfortunately that is simply not what happened here.\n\nHalf-Life Source only barely qualifies as being a port. They didn't change or upgrade anything, everything looks and feels the same and the only way you can tell it's a Source game is by looking at the game name.\n\nGraphics, animations, physics. Nothing has been improved to what Source is capable of.

A pretty good game, in my opinion. Graphics arent great at all considering the games we have today, but graphics dont entirely make a game. The story was pretty good. This game doesnt focus on just running around, killing everyone, completing the objective and moving on to the next stage. It has a good amount of jumping puzzles and scenarios that make you think about how to advance to the next chapter. I will admit i was stuck on the end boss for about a  good 30 minutes before i realized what i had to do. The end of the game definitely left unanswered questions.

So now Gordon has to stop it with his trusty crowbar that he got from a dead guy along with a few other weapons by finding out how to get to the cause of all this chaos while the military try to prevent the public from finding out about this so they also try to kill Gordon and the rest of the science team as well.

Although a completely linear game, the setting varied from huge desert cliffs to claustrophobic air vents.\n\nAt the time, most games heavily involved platforming and Half-Life was no exception.

I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe story is a bit odd, but still quite good. Freeman just gets thrown in the deep end, which if you look at it from one of two perspectives either makes everything terrifying or hilarious. This also provides a bit more backstory to the universe, which is good.\n\nA wide variety of weapons available. More so than hl2, I think, which is interesting and quite neat. It makes sense, given that this is set in a scietific research complex.\n\nI had some trouble getting my xbox controller to work with this, but I think using a keyboard/mouse setup works better. There's no real need for a gamepad here.\n\nTextures are about the right wuality for the age of the game. Not great by "today" standards, but still better than some games released about that time.\n\nThe soundtrack in this is really good, but the voices in the game can sound a bit garbled and echo-ey at times.\n\nDespite the fact that this is a moderately old game, the source remake means that it has no compatibility issues with newer systems.\n\nIf you've never played the original half life, then definitely buy this game. If you've not played either half life or half life 2, I would reccomend looking for a bundle on steam to buy that contains all of them.","July 1, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Half-Life: Source is an update using Valve's source engine. While it's mostly the same, from level design, weapons, ect. there are minor differences such as updated water, better lighting and ragdolls. But this version has a lot more bugs than it's Goldsrc counterpart. Some that i came across were a floating scientist in the Anomalous Materials chapter, invisible barnacle tongues and the tentacle in Blast Pit not doing any damage (although that might not be a bug as I've heard that it was severely nerfed and can barely hit you). As for which version you should get for a first time player, it's kind of a toss-up. On one hand, Source looks slightly better, can be played in widescreen and has the updated water/lighting, but the original has much less bugs and has many more mods. It's really just up to you which you want. If you already have the original, though, there's not enough of anything new to justify a purchase. If you want a true source remake from the ground up, then buy BlackMesa.","June 2, 2015","true","80.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you haven't played this, you have a sad life. Go and play it.\nIt does have a few problems- mainly glitches and bugs- but they aren't absolutely. Sure, there is a part in Surface Tension where the background stuffed up, when i got the crowbar but it was invisible, and Military dudes not killing programmed to die people. But they can be worked around. Compared to the original half life, I acctually think this version is better. It has advanced physics, making certain areas more life like. For example, the crate jumping in Chapter 3. In half life, they are still. In source, jumping on them makes them swing around. This adds to the overall difficulty (I died a few times there).\nThats all, buy it to see more of its greatness. Also Deathmatch comes with it, that adds to the fun.","December 6, 2014","true","61.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Needing only a 500 MHz processor and a 16MB Direct 3D card this game was very much playable today, but since source came out (2004) the game's graphics engine was updated causing a 1.2 GHz Processor and a 64MB video card uping up the graphics, but still being beat by Half-Life 2's graphics later in the year.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay was very long and hours, even days to complete this 19 chaptered game in order to have the full experience, but I'm not going to tell what happens in the story like Half-Life 2's review because I'd ruin the story.\nThe enimies are harder in this game than Half-Life 2, but it's still able to be beat, but you will need to stratigize to beat this without taking tons of damage to yourself.\n\nRating:\nThe final rating was 9.5/10 because it could've been less time consuming, but the story really counters that con anyways.\nUp next in reviews by Dead Kitty: Half-Life 2: Episode One","February 2, 2014","true","178.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This however, is not exactly the original game, but more of a remake, built in the Source engine. In my review of the game I'm going to sum the whole game up, with an honest review on it's ups and downs - so let's get right into it.\n\nSo let's start of with the storyline of the game. You stard of as a newly graduated Gordon Freeman on his way to work at the Black Mesa research facility. When you get to work, you have to get into a test chamber, where they are putting some kind of crystal onto a laser, but something goes wrong. The crystal messes with time and space and opens a portal to another dimension called Xen, through this portal, alien beings wreck havock in the facility. In the mean time the government here's of this, and decides not to help, but to kill everyone and everything involved.\n\nNowadays, this story seems pretty generic, and is used in practically every sci-fi movie ever made, but this was made in 1998. Even still, I do think it was a bit lazy, but was a fun and exciting story nevertheless.\n\nThe game includes many strategy based puzzles, and most things were very challenging, and some points I had to watch a YouTube tutorial on how on earth to complete parts. These puzzles were slightly annoying though at times, such as when the tram in 'On a Rail' and the conveyorbelts in 'Residue Processing'. Despite this, you always feel a sence of achievement after completing them, which is great.\n\nThe original Half Life was a game that was made in 1998, and the graphics, while not horrible, are not great. This Source remake version was made in 2004, and the graphics are slightly improved, but I don't really think it matters which game you decide to play. I do think that the Source version however, was not ported over very well, as there were many scripted events that were broken, such as a security guard dying and so on. Also on the chapter, 'Residue Processing' which jumping from platform to platform, the screen will randomly show yellow, red and black splatters of colour across the screen, (see screenshot on my profile) which made the level almost impossible.\n\nOverall, I found this a great game to play, it was verey enjoyable, but extremely annoying and painful in certain chapters. I am going to give it a 7/10, purely because there was a lot of stuff that was broken, but aside from that I would reccomend you play it.","March 8, 2015","true","16.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You'll save a ton of money, and on sale it's fairly cheap.\n\nThe story is excellent, the game is a bit on the hard side. There were points in the game that I had to beat without getting hurt once, because I had ~3hp. In one section, I had to clear out  about 12 soldiers and a tank  to get to the next area. It's really good. Sometimes a headcrab would pop out at me and give me a jumpscare.\n\nThe source version is buggier than goldsrc Half Life, So I recommend Half life more.

It was ahead of its time when it was released, but has it aged well? In terms of mechanics, not really. Graphics? Meh. The story, however - holy ♥♥♥♥! I forgot how much I loved this game, and loved it with good reason too. The story is nothing short of amazing, and it's pretty obvious why people are begging for an edition to wrap everything up.\n\nIf you want to get into the series, HL: Source is the way to go. Updated physics and a few graphical changes may not mean the biggest difference in the world, but it's enough to get noticed.\n\nAre there things I'd argue are flawed? Sure - but overall the plot is so enjoyable that you'll accept the game's age for what it is and still have a great time.","February 9","true","24.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Yes please!". At that point, I had already played Black Mesa, the fan-made mod for HL2 which is essentially Half Life with better graphics, better than this even!\n\nAnyway, the Negatives:\n- I had some graphical issues related to the factory levels with the conveyor belts, when I turned my flashlight on and look at water, the whole screen would mess up\n- Gonarch at two points refused to move, meaning I had to skip the entire chapter (but I could do that easily via the menu, I didn't need to use commands!)\n- Even enemies refused to move sometimes\n- Xen in general was pretty broken and messy, so if that's your favorite chapter, be warned!\n- You can't gib ragdolls by hitting them anymore, nor can you move them around like in Half Life 2\n\nThe Positives:\n+ The graphics and physics are really nice, everything feels more real than the original\n+ Destroying shelves and boxes and whatnot is way better and more fun\n+ The Flashlight was improved a LOT, as well as lighting\n+ Unlike Black Mesa, all the levels were exactly the same and the enemies behaved the same way as they did in HL1\n+ The Menu was improved a lot, as well as saving and loading and the whole GUI\n+ Movement is still the same, but it felt smoother to me and less clunky than in HL1\n\nAll in all, I'd only recommend this game if you have played Half Life 1 already and want to play it with slightly better graphics. I wouldn't recommend it over Black Mesa if you want a Half Life game JUST for the graphics, only if you prefer the gameplay and feel of the old game and want to see it with a slight twist!\n\nIf Half-Life 1 was a 96/100, I'd give this game a 88/100!","August 28, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Well because I wanted to, but all other things aside this game is a great game hands down. Now I know it is a remake of Half-Life on the Source engine so it does do things a little bit differently sometimes from the original game. But the original game in a nutshell is basically that you are a scientist named Gordon Freeman on a project doing with specimens from a dimension called "Xen". You arrive at work late one day to test a rather unstable specimen, causing a sort of bridge between the dimensions of our world and Xen. You must fight through these monsters that teleports through this bridge and find out whats causing this catastrophic event. You must also fight the military who are trying their best to quiet this event by killing all of the monsters and the faculty of Black Mesa. Shooting is very satisfying in this game and it goes by the traditional "You are Hulk ♥♥♥♥ing Hogan and you can put 20 guns in your pockets". Which means you can carry stuff like pistols, smgs to rocket launchers and alien weapon things. Overall I give this game atleast 9.5/10 in my book.

I don't really understand how Valve could have broken so much in this game with updates?\n\nTechnically speaking there are supposed to be very little changes, controls feel like you would expect in Source and are good and accurate when compared to how the old GoldSrc games control today which can take some getting used to but isn't bad. The way everything is rendered and shaders are diffrent, things look a bit more crisp but all models and textures are old. They actually look uglier to me than the standard HL1 non-hd models which I feel are the best to me visually. Ragdolls are added but thats really the only physics addition. Everything else from gibs to med packs uses the old HL1 physics where it simply falls or for gibs bounces and bounces. The water looks nice but does not fit in when everything around it looks cartoony. It ruins the dam scene for me atleast. Also they made some small changes in areas that I wasn't a huge fan of, mostly just looks related stuff and nothing big or something worth whining about. But of all the ports of HL1 I have played, which is only the PS2 and Source port, I like this one less. Atleast the PS2 version was objectively better than the original on PC when it came out in 2001. The orignal was released in '98. The Source port came out in 2004 and has none of the new content found in the PS2 version including the Coop expansion, Half Life Decay. I have not touched the Dreamcast version nor have I ever owned or played the Dreamcast aside from maybe one time at a family friends...maybe..its been probably near a decade since that. I also have not played the Linux or Mac ports but honestly I have no reason to ever want to us Mac OS. Linux is gaining ground though.Also the expansions are not present. Just basic Half Life 1.\n\nPresent in this current version there is a huge problem with hit boxes on tanks, helicopters, and enemies of that type. The Gonarch also seemed to not take damage alot of the time when I was hitting it. Its just iffy and I want to say broken. Also with source some of the design decisions that were taken with Half Life 1 just seem awful. Vorts never missing even though it feels like your moving like Speedy Gonzalez just feels like bs and Xen still sucks. Yeah, Xen always sucks. I hate it so much until you get closer to the end and fight the nihlanth/final boss.\n\nBut Half Life is still half life and its still fun. But this just isn't better in any way than the original aside from a few negligible graphics points.\n\nBlack Mesa Source is what this game should have been, except for the fact that they did change alot of the game and removed some points and added others. This game should have just been Half Life but graphically updated with some small gameplay upgrades. Its just not what it should have been and falls short of the original.","February 27, 2014","false","8.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LouieBee/recommended/280/","LouieBee","LouieBee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LouieBee/","2282 products in account","Half-Life Source is a slightly enhanced version of the 1998 classic.\n\nThis supposed remake retains most of the original game's textures, models and animation but favours towards the better world effects available from the new Source engine of the time. Half-Life Source has a Havoc powered physics engine with enemies and objects obeying Newton's three laws, picture-quality water reflections and expanded scenary - now built as geometry rather than painted on backdrops. Also, the sound and presenetation now borrows heavily from Half-Life 2.\n\nMy opinion of Half-Life Source is rather mixed, befuddled even. HL: Source feels very sloppily put together and thrown over. Valve could of and should of done a complete overhaul of the game. It's lukewarm reception from the many alienated players of the game led to the creation of Black Mesa Source, a total conversion set to unofficially reimagine the first game on the source engine. I implore you to wait for it instead. Otherwise, buy the original.","July 5, 2011","false","1.2"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

Half-Life is easily my favorite game of all time. The controls are amazing. The story line is intriguing and is hugely expanded on by the large amount of sequels (still no Half Life 3 though). I love how you can talk to the AI in the game and convince them to follow you and help you fight, which can help save ammo, but also adds to the control you have. Honestly, thats what makes Half Life 1 great. Control! You feel like you have full control over the game. You are never fighting with it to get it to work.\n\nI hate to do this, but this is just one of those few games that I simply can't find any flaws with. I would honestly rate this game a 10/10. I often come back to this game and play through it again, and I will continue to do so in the future.

I enjoyed it because of that. Everything related to the original game is there, so, yeah, Half-Life: Source is a very good game in that aspect. Read that review to understand that HL:S could be a good choice for those that never played Half-Life - http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/70. For people like me, that played the original back then and many times after, the only real change seen is in the graphics but not in a spectacular way.\n\nContrary to the title, the Source Engine, from Half-Life 2, isn't used at all. In reality, I feel like it's just the HD Texture Pack that was applied. And that pack was used for Half-Life: Blueshift, released in 2001. The mod-that-became-a-game Black Mesa is better if you want a real Half-Life with the Source Engine (though it's not sticking strictly to the original in terms of level design).\n\nI felt cheated. I don't remember if I bought the game or if I got it in a collector's edition of Half-Life 2 but I felt cheated there. I was expecting much better thing from Half-Life: Source and in the end, apart the fun that is still intact because it's Half-Life, I felt that the promise wasn't there.\n\nThat's why I'm thumbing down this version of the game for people that love Half-Life and that would have preferred a better treatment for it. It doesn't mean that the game is bad in itself, I repeat, it's Half-Life. But I prefer to buy the original than that, that's all.","November 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

The problem ironically doesn't last on it's graphics or even voice acting, the problem with Half Life it's it's game design, playing through the popular mod "Black Mesa" I can assure you that each and every single problem was solved on my part, the game was incredible, it had fantastic set pieces that played across perfectly as you played through the game having fun and confort all together, but this classic is just invaded with problems such as bad controls, difficult platforming, "sluggish shooting", and so on.

It's one of the few games that I remember playing, and completing during that time. I would recommend Half-Life to anyone who hasn't played it, but for those who have, it just doesn't hold up over time. It's just not the same as playing it back in the 90s. Then again, many things aren't.\n\nThis source version of the game, doesn't do anything for me. The graphics are better, but that makes the game... "less scary". There is way too much lighting. Areas that used to be dark, and spooky, are now brightly lit, and the emenies aren't scary at all, because the newly done models, just don't have the same effect as the older, darker models.\n\nI remember nearly running from the room when the game originally came out, because it was just too scary. The new graphics, and brightly lit models, just put me to sleep.\n\nI find this source edition to be even less interesting, because it gives you instant access to every level in the game. So there is no challenge anymore. There is no reason to play the game from the start (there is no reason to save), because you can just pick any level you want, and start there. That might be fun for some people, but as soon as I saw that was an option, I was instantly turned off. Sure, this is an option, and you don't have to play it that way, but just due to the fact that the levels are all open, is a turn off for me.\n\nIf you're looking for this game, because you think it's going to take you back to the 90s...

As a huge fan of FPS games, I wanted to like this game.\n\nSadly, I didn't. At least not as much as other FPS games I've played, such as Doom, Quake and Unreal. Those games are better than this on many levels. For one, they didn't have annoying platforming with mechanics that just barely function. They also didn't include frustratingly difficult human enemies that drain your health from 100% down to 5%, sections where you had to run and jump through enemy hordes and traps because the game suddenly decided to not give you any ammunition, or areas you couldn't get out of if you happened to find yourself lost in them.\n\nHalf-Life, on the other hand, did include all of those things, and those are the reasons why I only enjoyed it so much. While the game shines in its presentation, it falls short on its gameplay, at least for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krjones/recommended/280/","krjones","Choatech","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krjones/","8 products in account","Half-Life was an amazing game back in 1998. It's one of the few games that I remember playing, and completing during that time. I would recommend Half-Life to anyone who hasn't played it, but for those who have, it just doesn't hold up over time. It's just not the same as playing it back in the 90s. Then again, many things aren't.\n\nThis source version of the game, doesn't do anything for me. The graphics are better, but that makes the game... "less scary". There is way too much lighting. Areas that used to be dark, and spooky, are now brightly lit, and the emenies aren't scary at all, because the newly done models, just don't have the same effect as the older, darker models.\n\nI remember nearly running from the room when the game originally came out, because it was just too scary. The new graphics, and brightly lit models, just put me to sleep.\n\nI find this source edition to be even less interesting, because it gives you instant access to every level in the game. So there is no challenge anymore. There is no reason to play the game from the start (there is no reason to save), because you can just pick any level you want, and start there. That might be fun for some people, but as soon as I saw that was an option, I was instantly turned off. Sure, this is an option, and you don't have to play it that way, but just due to the fact that the levels are all open, is a turn off for me.\n\nIf you're looking for this game, because you think it's going to take you back to the 90s... Don't be surprised when it doesn't have that same effect.","October 19, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jayukshun/recommended/280/","jayukshun","Jayukshun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jayukshun/","23 products in account","This is one of the best games I have ever played. Half-Life is a classic that should be played by anyone who appreciates FPS's. In fact, it's your obligation to play this game, because it was the first to do so many things in video games. There are many games that have heavily leaned on the format, gameplay and story telling strategies of this game. The game is very dated, and it shows, but Valve did implement the Source engine which gives it a more polished, free-flowing look. I was able to disregard the dated graphics, because I knew that this was such an original and classic game.\n\nThe first half hour of the game is brilliant, because nothing is really happening, but there is an ere tone and feeling that lets you know that something's not right. Some subtle foreshadowing occurs when some of the computers break, and a scientist says the power is going to be switched on to 105%. It's show-not-tell things like this that make the game so gripping and immersive. It's something we don't seem to see in many games anymore.\n\nAnyway, during the first three quarters of the game, you're running around, collecting new weapons, killing aliens, and soldiers sent there to kill you, (a perfectly executed plot twist) solving puzzles, picking up more of the story, riding on rails, launching rockets, blowing up helicopters, storming military bases, navigating mine fields, annihilating green, bangy, tentacle thingies, electrocuting, and blowing up giant, blue flamethrower monsters; the list can go on and on. Basically, you're just having a lot of fun. The constant change of objectives really keeps the player immersed in the game. You never feel like you're repeating the same things over and over again. This is a staple in the Half-Life franchise. Once you start getting bored of something, it changes it up so that you're doing something different and more exciting. The pacing in this game is also phenomenal. It usually goes in the order of: Action event, slow puzzle event, action event slow puzzle event, with some events that feature action and puzzle at the same time, and story exposition sprinkled around and mixed in through everything you do. It's constant fun that never frustrates you or makes you feel cheated.\n\nThe subtle rise in difficulty is more subtle than, you know, just changing the color of the monster. It's realistic, and makes you feel the tension rising around the Black Mesa facility. The first three quarters of the game are nearly flawless.\n\nIn my opinion, the only downside to this game is the last quarter where you play in the alien world, Xen. This segment of the game really breaks up the immersion. The gravity is toned down, so everything you've gotten used to in the first part of the game is scrapped for a floaty, hard to manoeuvre, way of moving. It's also very slow. From a story telling perspective, it's mind blowing, but from a gameplay perspective, it's quite dull and frustrating. During the chapter Xen, you're just platforming, trying to figure out where to go. Gonarch's Lair was just an annoying, frustrating, slow paced boss fight, But the REAL kicker was interloper.\n\nI hated this level. It was way too long, way too difficult, way to confusing, and way too frustrating. If there was an enemy I could have removed from this game it would be those flying baby thingies, but they were everywhere here and they would respawn all the time! There's never enough health, energy, or ammo for you, so you have too eek by in this extremely hard level. In most levels, if it was hard, it was because you needed to change your strategy. It was your fault if you died. But in this level, there are just way too many overpowered enemies. You're trying to save your health and running out of ammo, and BOOM! You're hit with ten million, flying babies, and bee shooting giants, while being hit with vortigaunt lightning from every corner. The only way to get through this level is to set the difficulty to easy, and die a million times before you memorise where each enemy will be and when he will attack. That's no fun. That's just drudgery.\n\nNihilanth was just a giant version of those annoying flying babies. Great. To be honest, he was just mediocre. Okay, I do hate how all the Zelda bosses, for example, have huge shiny targets on them that show you exactly where to place a bomb or shoot an arrow, but at least they help you figure out how to defeat it. In Nihilanth, I had no idea how to defeat the monster. shooting it did nothing, and it kept sending me away to these weird caves by throwing portals at me. I was completely lost. I had to go on youtube and see how it was done before I even knew how to kill it. It was still too hard too kill it though. If you play it the way it was intended and jump up onto those cliff things, it's really hard, and he will keep sending portals at you. If you're cheap like me and just hid behind the spiky rocks, then it's easier, but it's painfully repeditive and tedious.\n\nBoss fights in this game were not good with the exception of the green tentacle thing. I will cut it some slack though, because it was kind of a 90's thing to have bosses in your games, and this was a very hard game to put bosses into.\n\nIn the last chapter, you're given a monologue from the mysterious G-man, who you may have noticed stalking you throughout the game. He makes you go through a portal, and then the credits hit, reminding you how good the soundtrack in this game was.\n\nAll in all, Half-Life was a classic, and should be played by anyone who likes video games. If you like steam you should play this game to show your respects to Valve. It was the first game they made. Half-Life rose to my personal favorite video game franchise after the Metroid Franchise was ruined by Other M. Anyway, just play this game. You have no excuse not to.

Explosions sprites have also been replaced with half-life 2 like explosions. Overall I would say this game is considerably better then the original Half-life.\n\nI would also like to mention that this game is worht playing even if you have Black mesa.

This is Half-Life with a ton of additional bugs,better water, ragdolls, improved(?) skyboxes, motion blur, bloom and nothing else. Not good! And whaddya know the port was done by Gearbox. Some of the alterations to the gunplay already affect it negatively but what's most shocking is how buggy it is and how many lenghty loading zones that weren't present in the original Half-Life have been added. One level is even uglier than it was in the original shockingly by making the map look far less expansive:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=696250055\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=696250301&fileuploadsuccess=1\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=696253620\n(The last picture is from Black Mesa's faithful remake.)\nIf you've ever seen a picture of a scientist floating above a chair then the picture was in fact taken from Half-Life: Source as that bug never happend in Half-Life 1. Oh and here's an example of one of the many bugs ingame:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=696258149\nNote the lack of sky and the fact that my HEV suit has dissapeared. There are also instances where new Half-Life 2 textures are right alongside badly ported Half-Life 1 textures leading to a George Lucas remastered effect. Not to mention some broken scripting, missing music and textures shining as bright as the sun in dark rooms. The orginal runs flawlessly and works in widescreen and in terms of gameplay still holds up quite well with the obvious (Doesn't bother me.) exception being the graphics which are more than a little dated. Oh but of course you could always just toggle to use the HD models instead. If you wan't a version of Half-Life with subtle improvements to atmosphere, immersion and better graphics and that actually take full advantage of the Source engine get Black Mesa instead. In fact both the Black Mesa mod (Black Mesa retail/Steam edition runs on Source 2013 and recently so did Half-Life:Source.) and Half-Life: Source run on Source 2007. Half-Life: Source was so crummy that we have it to thank for inspiring people remake Half-Life on the Source engine themselves. If Counter Strike: Source was just 1.6 visuals with the Source engine as a backend and a plethora of bugs and weird changes to the gameplay you would have pretty disapointed wouldn't you? This doesn't do much of note visually and adds longer loading to really hammer the nail in the coffin. This is pretty useless and I don't reccomend getting it in the year 2016.","June 25, 2015","false","47.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I really can't stand it. Yes, this game is important to history, so you should at least try it at some point, but I don't think it's worth anything anymore. At this point, it's a relic that represents a landmark in gaming history more than it is a game. My main gripes are its absolute adherence to old-school shooter design with the modern (as we know it) narrative design layered over it. It was revolutionary at the time, but so many games have come along and done what it did so much better that it's impossible to look back on this and still say it's good on it's own terms. Maybe Black Mesa will change my opinion on it (especially if they put in PROPER full controller support), but until then?

Half-Life WAS an OKAY game, for it's time. Now this isn't because of age I have multiple reasons.\n\n\n*THE STORY*\nI blew up something and now there's aliens?\nIf the story was padded with interactions with characters it would be alright, but you have no sense of direction. I literally spent the game shooting things and aimlessly pressing buttons. I'm not a stickler but this was done horribly. I just walked, shot, pressed buttons, jumped, and turned wheels. The story is just awful in the first. The security guys are useless as well. They just say stuff that doesn't matter, giving you vague objectives. What kills the story is that everyone and everything feels lifeless. You can hate me but it's true. The game is LITERALLY 13 HOURS OF SHOOTING ♥♥♥♥ AND PRESSING BUTTONS WITHOUT ANY PERSONALITY. No one was funny, no one was cool, no one was my friend. It was a chore to play this game. Hell ,if Gordon was suppose to be an extension of the player why do we barely interact with people. THEY JUST SAY "SURE I'LL RISK MY LIFE 4 U ♥♥♥ IT BIG BOI!!!"\n\n*THE GAMEPLAY*\nOh god, even on easy everything was a bullet sponge while *YOU* THE GUY IN A POWER SUIT DIES IN LIKE 4 HITS!\nKilling ♥♥♥♥ didn't even feel satisfying, it got so boring that I turned on god mode the last 4 chapters. IT'S NOT FUN AT ALL. THIS PIECE OF *BLEEP* IS STILL BUGGY AS ♥♥♥♥ ON MY NVIDIA GTX 640 INTEL I7 QUAD CORE AND 16 GIGS OF RAM! There was screen tearing and crashing. What. The. ♥♥♥♥. It didn't do much except the EXCEPTIONAL PHYSICS ENGINE! The gameplay remained tedious with a few sequences of platforming and escorting people, that is too far apart and too far in between.\n\nHow does it hold up today?It doesn't.\n\nI give Half-Life Source a 4/10.\n","January 2, 2015","false","13.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It has aged poorly. I guess if I had the fortune of playing it upon release I would appreciate it more, but I just can't understand how it managed to garner so much praise back in 1998. Perhaps there were some major changes that affected gameplay when they released the Source version in 2005?\n\nThe AI is completely broken. You can edge around corners and slowly pick off immobile enemies by shooting their feet. If they can't see you their AI won't kick in. Pretty terrible mechanics. Apparently the AI was taken from Half-Life 2 when HL: Source was released. It doesn't show it.\n\nThe controls are way too twitchy. It's almost impossible to succesfully climb down a ladder without dying the first time. You often go sliding off edges as if Gordon's feet are made of ice. It was certainly a frustrating experience.\n\nThere is also absolutely no story or character development. None. You are Gordon Freeman, a scientist. You open a portal to another dimension. You close the portal. The end. Everyone you meet along the way is disposable and has no distinguishing features or names.\n\nThere is no explanation for any of what is happening, there is no lead up to Half-Life 2. The reasons for the military presence are not explained, neither is the fact that they are replaced with Combine forces in the sequel, however many years later.\n\nThe only connection between Half-Life and Half-Life 2 is Gordon Freeman and the G-Man. That's it. The only recurring enemies are the headcrabs and Vortigaunt, the latter of which are apparently on your side for some reason. Who knows how they ended up on Earth if the portal was closed.\n\nThis was an amazingly empty experience, void of any story or sense of progression. I understand that was Valve's and, especially, Gabe Newell's intentions, but it just doesn't sit right with me.\n\nI know my opinion will go against the grain and, while I did enjoy the game overall and appreciate how it is placed within the Half-Life universe, I still can not overlook the many smaller flaws that become overbearing during gameplay. I have to wonder if these issues exist in the original Half-Life game or if they are exclusive to the Source version.","November 14, 2012","false","9.7"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

I can answer that question with one word.\n\nNo.\n\nMy friend had been pestering me for months to play this game. I had heard so many wonderful things about it, “It’s the greatest game of all time”, “It has an amazing story” are just two of the many great claims I’ve heard about this game. I’ve got to say, I’m extremely disappointed.\n\nAfter launching the game, I’m greeted by some pretty abysmal graphics. The original game was released sometime around 1996, so poor graphics are to be expected in the original version of the game. What’s not to be expected is for there to be poor graphics in the remake/remaster of the game (Half-Life Source). If the graphics are this bad, I might have well just played the original version.\n\nAt first I put this aside; a game with bad graphics doesn’t always equal a bad game. I decided proceed through the “tutorial” area until I actually reach the real part of the game (in which you get your first weapon). I was quite frustrated to find out that I had to use a crowbar as a weapon, which in my opinion is quite a bad design decision. You are going to get a gun later in the game anyway, so why not just provide a gun earlier in the game? Another thing I can't work out is why did they put glasses on the main character? It doesn't seem very badass for the main character to wear glasses.\n\nI then struggle to play though the game due to the dry story and boring combat mechanics. I honestly don’t know why everyone thinks the story to this game is so amazing. A science laboratory gets filled with aliens and you need to escape that laboratory. The story doesn’t get any more complicated or in-depth than that.\n\nYou also see a man in a suit from time to time. I don’t see the point in this since you never get the chance to fight him. He is clearly the bad guy in the game, but instead of fighting him at the end of the game, you just speak to him instead. What a disappointment.\n\nTake my advice.

Prior to Half-Life I had only played Woffstein3D and doom for PC. Doom was great but it wasn't really interactive or very realistic.\n\nHalf-Life was a dream come true and it will always be my favorite PC game of all time.\n\n\n\nFor all those youngling's out there who grew up with Call of Duty and the like, you probably won't like this game. The graphics are old now, and the pace is slow. However if your still relatively new to gaming then please do yourself a favor and try it. Hell it even has a training room for those who don't have experience controlling a character in first person.\n\n\nThe only difference between HL and HL source is that source has slightly improved lighting and textures in certain areas.

You can also gather some extra details by cautiously examining the environment.\n\nAll the enemy soldiers have an instantly recognizeable scruffy voice while the friendly NPCs sound more calmed and soft, for the most part. This game also has some os the most well known scores for PC games (like the Nuclear Mission jam), and the weapon sounds are very well made.\n\nAlthough this is a remake of the original release for the source engine the graphics were not enhanced at all, so don't expect brilliant quality. Some users also say this version is inferior to the original because it added extra bugs and other issues, but I encountered none during my playthrough.

Get that! Don't get this please don't! It's so buggy. I have both versions and decided recently to replay it. I thought to myself might as well play the source version and maybe i'll see something new they've added, maybe the textures are a lot better maybe the A.I is different. Well on close examination the game is identical. Yes the lighting is slightly smoother and some textures are slightly different. I wouldn't say they're are better, they still look rather outdated. Just different. Where this version fails is all the bugs. I can only imagine this didn't get play tested at all. They simply dumped the first game into this engine or remastered process and never looked at it again. There are so many little bugs that bothered me. One annoying bug is where I had a few guards with me and if they took damage and yelled they wouldn't stop the yell, they would endlessly react to the pain, even though they werent getting attacked anymore. Really irritating. Where i finally gave up was when you first meet the marines, there is this high octane music, that i remember from the first one. It's like matrix style and gets you into it and really adds something extra. However in this version just after the music starts you hit a load screen to the next area, and that kills the music, it just ends. And then you're left in silence again. It's so awkward and I was so into the music, that it was just enough to me. However on the old version which I started playing again everything is fine, no bugs. I can't play this version if every little element is broken or missing. Just max out the graphic settings on the old version it will look nearly identical to this version and it plays a lot better. Don't waste your money or time on this. I have also read that the final boss in this version is also almost unplayable so yeah don't bother.

One moment your scattering for ammo while hitting headcrabs with your crowbar and the next literally running for your life against a Garganturae or fighting waves of marines as you uncover more about the aliens and where the come from. Is has that real variety that few shooters today have. However if I where to nit pick at something it would have to be a few of the Xen missions felt a bit off par with the other chapters and just seemed more like the scene from a movie you just want to skip and the platforming puzzles. This game could be considered as one of the most innovative FPS of all time for good reason. To be honest I don't think I can think of any other FPS games really like this. This is a classic... nuff said.\n\n10/10","July 10, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game keeps you entertained throughout its duration and doesn't get boring once, you're either gunning your way through an area full of enemies or solving a puzzle to get through a different area and testing your resourcefulness and intelligence; the horror aspect is eerie and creepy without resorting to many jumpscares that today's "horror" games do so much of.\n\nThe game hasn't gotten old either, you can still play this game today nearly 20 years since its release and it will still deliver as enjoyable if you don't mind the old fashioned graphics and audio, of course!","July 13, 2014","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A non stop action package with zero cutscenes.\n\nThe story is explained through small chats with the surviving members of the facility and paying attention to enemy  conversations. You can also gather some extra details by cautiously examining the environment.\n\nAll the enemy soldiers have an instantly recognizeable scruffy voice while the friendly NPCs sound more calmed and soft, for the most part. This game also has some os the most well known scores for PC games (like the Nuclear Mission jam), and the weapon sounds are very well made.\n\nAlthough this is a remake of the original release for the source engine the graphics were not enhanced at all, so don't expect brilliant quality. Some users also say this version is inferior to the original because it added extra bugs and other issues, but I encountered none during my playthrough.

While I would say that you have to take all this praise with a grain of salt, I would still consider it a game that you should probably play.\n\nPros:\n\nAwesome storytelling.  The story is not necessarily the most complex or the best in gaming, but the way it is presented to you is hard to beat.  98% of all information that you need to know can be found in-game; the other 2% are essentially backstory.\n\nWell designed environment.  Half-Life: Source is not necessarily pretty, as it is an engine update of a game released in 1998, but the environments are designed to both a.) give you the feeling of being in Black Mesa, and b.) giving you a direct goal, even if that requires backtracking.\n\nChanging game genre.  This may sound strange, but the game will often change its genre, depending on where you are.  Early in the game, it's just survival-horror as you fight your way through aliens, just trying to escape.  Then it becomes more like a real shooter, with people firing back, as the army arrives and begins to fight you.  The battles gradually grow larger and larger, the intensity level growing... and then it goes back to survival horror.  THEN, the game comes back to more tactical shooting, just in time for the most epic level of the game.  You then travel to the alien homeworld to kill their leader.  All this keeps the game feeling fresh and new.\n\nGreat gunplay.  Guns are given to you only when it is necessary, and most weapons have a purpose.  You will, at some point, use all of the weapons.  The gunplay itself is commendable, with a lot of different options against enemies.  Some enemies are tough to take down, but with the right combo they can be killed with ease.\n\nGreat Enemy A.I.  Half-Life: Source/Half-Life has better A.I. then I see in games that were released in 2005 and 2007.  The enemy A.I., especially in squads, will work together to bring you down.  The squad A.I. is often tough to beat.\n\nGood soundtrack.  The music is good, but it fades into the background, in a good way, that prevents it from being too overbearing.\n\nCons:\n\nLabrythine map design.  Especially in the later levels, there will be many a place where you will go one way, then have to go back where you came from, then have to go down an entirely different route.  In some places this is a good, but in others it is just frustrating.  There is a TON of backtracking in this game, making the gameplay feel somewhat tedious.\n\nExtremely poor friendly A.I.  This game, HLS, does a better job of making sure they follow you, but that's just the first step.   Often, friendly A.I.  will run into mines, shoot you if you go ahead of them, get in front of your line of fire, or even run into heavily armed enemies.  The middle two are particularly frustrating, especially in the earlier levels.  There was many a time where I would run in front of my ally, confident in his competency, when I would get shot in the back.  Also, there was one time where I was shooting and he ran in front of me, and I got him in the arm.  Due to his coding that makes him seek revenge, (which is justified) he shot and killed me.  (I had low health.)\n\nAs mentioned before, the game can be very tedious.  Length is a good thing, but Half-Life's levels can be annoyingly long.  There have been times where I've wanted to play through the whole thing, but I just had to stop.  It's a sad thing that can often drag the fun of the game down.\n\nI would give this game a 8/10.  It is well designed, with good enemies, weapons, and GENERAL map design, but some more intricate maps, and longer maps, can be very boring, dragging down the game.","July 21, 2014","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After the richness and depth seen at the climax of the '2.5D' era, the move to full 3D seemed to throw all that advancement out the window. Whereas the 2.5D era had reached a point where such depth was near inherent, successors like Quake and Quake 2 showed a simplicity that while enjoyable, left an undeniable lacking. And gone were so many of the innovations defined by the previous era. On consoles, a game named Golden Eye brought many of those past innovations kicking and screaming, into the 3D space; On PC, at the forefront of the charge, rode the mighty Half Life.

It's just the original game ported to the Source Engine. The result is alright for a few things, but in all honesty I've found it to be less enjoyable than the original.\n\nOn the plus side, the best thing I can say about is that the water looks better. Yeah, it's not much, but you can actually see through it here unlike the original, which can be helpful for getting an idea of underwater areas before diving into them and can allow you to more easily target underwater enemies without actually having to be in the water and risk attacks from them.\n\nThere's also the addition of ragdolls, which generally look much nicer than the set death animations and poses NPCs took on in the original whenever they were killed.\n\nHowever, some enemies don't have the same behavior as in the original, some enemies are less aggressive and will not seem to notice you as often,  It might make the combat a bit easier, but that's what takes away from the gameplay, it's not quite as challenging as the original is.\n\nOther NPCs don't seem to have translated very well over to the port. One of the best examples being the friendly NPCs, Scientists and Security Guards will constantly make pain noises and grunts after being injured just once, something that's rather annoying to listen to if you want any to accompany you for backup.\n\nOverall, the game just doesn't have the same old feel of the original that I found myself enjoying and is also less challenging than it. I definitely don't recommend playing it before the original Half-Life, at the very least. It's not necessarily a "bad" remake, just one that doesn't offer enough to be favorable to the original, I feel.","April 9, 2015","false","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, that depends on what your willing to deal with between the two. Half-Life Source looks quite a bit better than the origanal with its water effects, motion blur, and fixed box-pushing machanic. However, unlike the origanal, Source DOES NOT have an auto save! So you could progress throu the entire game, die right at the end, and start over at that damn long tram ride. Another thing to mention is the enimies just love to get right in your face, so be perpared to use you shotgun alot. As long as your willing to deal with that, and have a habit of pressing the F6 key, then go ahead and get Half-Life Source. Otherwise, just stick with regular Half-Life.\n\n*Note: In case anyone hasn't played a Valve game before, F6 is the manuel save.\n\n*****","July 17, 2012","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played it nor Half Life 2 back in the day, so I am completely unbiased by nostalgia. Both games have intrigued me for years, though, and I saw them together in a Steam sale bundle so decided to pick them up and finally play through them. The original Half Life looks quite dated and is missing many modern FPS creature comforts we have come to take for granted, but still shines thanks to its brilliant & pioneering design.\n\nYes, it was state of the art when it came out and a truly groundbreaking game for its time. But is it fun to play now? When I first fired the game up my initial thought was, “I can’t do this. It’s too old.” The polygon models are harsh, even in Source version. People’s hands look sharp enough to poke your eye out. The sound is downright terrible in some places. Environments are often sparse with low-res textures. It can also be difficult to tell whether or not you are damaging certain enemies.\n\nDespite all that, I took a break and came back to it. I’m happy to say I got hooked shortly afterward. Half Life is made so well, I was able to overlook its technical shortcomings and get immersed in Gordon’s flight from Black Mesa. The pace is frenetic, rarely giving you the chance to catch your breath. It’s a very intelligent shooter, also. There are many hidden areas, multiple paths, clever puzzles, and neat surprise moments along the way. You keep moving almost continuously to the very mysterious ending.\n\nWhich brings me to why I almost gave the title a thumbs down. The ending is deeply unsatisfying. After everything that happened I still only had the vaguest idea of what was going on. I think there was an accident in the lab that led to an alien invasion, with either the gov’t or privately contracted troops trying to destroy the entire facility to cover it up. And then, dude in suit with briefcase in the interdimensional train car. The end.\n\nI have started Half Life 2 and while I love it so far, in terms of story it adds even more confusion to the narrative. Gordon Freeman is one of the most incurious people in the universe, never once pausing to ask anybody, “Hey, WTF is happening!?!?” I’m hoping more light gets shed on the plot as I progress through the sequel. You can only tease people for so long before they get bored.\n\nFrom a pure gameplay standpoint, though, Half Life: Source will not disappoint. If you have never played it and can deal with outdated graphics & sound, go ahead & pick it up. If not, you can skip straight to Half Life 2 without missing a whole lot. In other words, you’ll be just as confused at the beginning of HL2 whether you played through the first game or not.","March 18, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played it nor Half Life 2 back in the day, so I am completely unbiased by nostalgia. Both games have intrigued me for years, though, and I saw them together in a Steam sale bundle so decided to pick them up and finally play through them. The original Half Life looks quite dated and is missing many modern FPS creature comforts we have come to take for granted, but still shines thanks to its brilliant & pioneering design.\n\nYes, it was state of the art when it came out and a truly groundbreaking game for its time. But is it fun to play now? When I first fired the game up my initial thought was, “I can’t do this. It’s too old.” The polygon models are harsh, even in Source version. People’s hands look sharp enough to poke your eye out. The sound is downright terrible in some places. Environments are often sparse with low-res textures. It can also be difficult to tell whether or not you are damaging certain enemies.\n\nDespite all that, I took a break and came back to it. I’m happy to say I got hooked shortly afterward. Half Life is made so well, I was able to overlook its technical shortcomings and get immersed in Gordon’s flight from Black Mesa. The pace is frenetic, rarely giving you the chance to catch your breath. It’s a very intelligent shooter, also. There are many hidden areas, multiple paths, clever puzzles, and neat surprise moments along the way. You keep moving almost continuously to the very mysterious ending.\n\nWhich brings me to why I almost gave the title a thumbs down. The ending is deeply unsatisfying. After everything that happened I still only had the vaguest idea of what was going on. I think there was an accident in the lab that led to an alien invasion, with either the gov’t or privately contracted troops trying to destroy the entire facility to cover it up. And then, dude in suit with briefcase in the interdimensional train car. The end.\n\nI have started Half Life 2 and while I love it so far, in terms of story it adds even more confusion to the narrative. Gordon Freeman is one of the most incurious people in the universe, never once pausing to ask anybody, “Hey, WTF is happening!?!?” I’m hoping more light gets shed on the plot as I progress through the sequel. You can only tease people for so long before they get bored.\n\nFrom a pure gameplay standpoint, though, Half Life: Source will not disappoint. If you have never played it and can deal with outdated graphics & sound, go ahead & pick it up. If not, you can skip straight to Half Life 2 without missing a whole lot. In other words, you’ll be just as confused at the beginning of HL2 whether you played through the first game or not.","March 18, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would recommend you just skip this if you have played the original Half-Life because it's almost exactly the same thing. However with the Source engine you get ragdoll physics, much better water, better looking hit decals including blood on the NPC models now, 3D skybox, and shaders that pretty much do nothing but change water. That's it, it's pretty much the exact same game. Also the player movement in this game is so slippery, kind of like walking on a slippery puddle the whole game. I also noticed some game breaking bugs that affect progression such as not being able to defeat the helicopter on the Surface Tension chapter of the game. And I also noticed some corrupt textures on old models versus the HD models. Your better off to just play Black Mesa TBH.","June 22, 2015","false","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its smart and flat-out INTERESTING, something you can really sink your teeth into. Seriously enthralling. Its always got you asking; "why", "how", "WTF!?!" , you never get bored advancing through events or dialogue. You spend the game fighting your way through the Black Mesa research facility discovering what happened in the catastrophic event. Taking the role of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist turned legendary hero. A man who witnesses soo much ♥♥♥♥ and accomplishes every impossible task set forth, and never has a fkn word to say. Like a boss. The silent hero of silent heroes.   He really is a legend in the game world. The story is well enough to pick up the game, but the mechanics and platforming are pretty fkn awesome too. You will actually spend a good chunk of game platforming and solving small 'puzzles', so it's not just a shooter. The game is pretty outdated, and this source version doesnt do much to revive the out of date engine. However there is a mod called Black Mesa that uses the HL2 engine and is exactly the same story and levels with just updated scenery and voice acting(same script). So you dont have to play Half-Life(original) till you get into the Xen/Alien chapters(my least favorite). Play this game.","July 20, 2013","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, that depends on what your willing to deal with between the two. Half-Life Source looks quite a bit better than the origanal with its water effects, motion blur, and fixed box-pushing machanic. However, unlike the origanal, Source DOES NOT have an auto save! So you could progress throu the entire game, die right at the end, and start over at that damn long tram ride. Another thing to mention is the enimies just love to get right in your face, so be perpared to use you shotgun alot. As long as your willing to deal with that, and have a habit of pressing the F6 key, then go ahead and get Half-Life Source. Otherwise, just stick with regular Half-Life.\n\n*Note: In case anyone hasn't played a Valve game before, F6 is the manuel save.\n\n*****","July 17, 2012","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They don't realy change to much of the game. But some graphical things are pretty much improved. Some puzzles also include a brand new twist because of Source's physics engine. The body's are now fully dynamic and so is the flashlight. You're now able to add motion blur and other new graphical stuff that makes the game look a lot better. They also keep the tone and mood from the first game by including all of the original textures. But some of the sounds (Like the foodsteps) are directly from HL2 witch makes the game sound alot better. And if you're a fan of the HD content the original Half-Life had, they included all of those moddels into this version. Witch makes it look even better. So if you're a HL fan, this game will stand nicely in your game library.\n\np.s: Sorry for my english.

Valve took everything I loved about the original Half-Life: the excellent and capitivating story, the brilliant enemy AI, the polished gunplay, and the at times mind boggling puzzles, and shoved it into a slightly prettier package with sharper textures, not-so-HD models (that, while clearly not HD, look better than the original), cleaner particle effects, death ragdolls, and water that actually looks like water. I recommend this game to anyone who does not have the original, as it is the superior version. However, I can't recommend this game to anyone who does own the original unless they own Garry's Mod- since this game is in the Source engine, you can mount it in Gmod and use props and NPCS from the game. The only downside is you can't use original Half-Life mods like Half-Life Zombie Edition or Natural Selection, as they weren't designed for the Source engine. For those, you need the original game.","July 26, 2012","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played it nor Half Life 2 back in the day, so I am completely unbiased by nostalgia. Both games have intrigued me for years, though, and I saw them together in a Steam sale bundle so decided to pick them up and finally play through them. The original Half Life looks quite dated and is missing many modern FPS creature comforts we have come to take for granted, but still shines thanks to its brilliant & pioneering design.\n\nYes, it was state of the art when it came out and a truly groundbreaking game for its time. But is it fun to play now? When I first fired the game up my initial thought was, “I can’t do this. It’s too old.” The polygon models are harsh, even in Source version. People’s hands look sharp enough to poke your eye out. The sound is downright terrible in some places. Environments are often sparse with low-res textures. It can also be difficult to tell whether or not you are damaging certain enemies.\n\nDespite all that, I took a break and came back to it. I’m happy to say I got hooked shortly afterward. Half Life is made so well, I was able to overlook its technical shortcomings and get immersed in Gordon’s flight from Black Mesa. The pace is frenetic, rarely giving you the chance to catch your breath. It’s a very intelligent shooter, also. There are many hidden areas, multiple paths, clever puzzles, and neat surprise moments along the way. You keep moving almost continuously to the very mysterious ending.\n\nWhich brings me to why I almost gave the title a thumbs down. The ending is deeply unsatisfying. After everything that happened I still only had the vaguest idea of what was going on. I think there was an accident in the lab that led to an alien invasion, with either the gov’t or privately contracted troops trying to destroy the entire facility to cover it up. And then, dude in suit with briefcase in the interdimensional train car. The end.\n\nI have started Half Life 2 and while I love it so far, in terms of story it adds even more confusion to the narrative. Gordon Freeman is one of the most incurious people in the universe, never once pausing to ask anybody, “Hey, WTF is happening!?!?” I’m hoping more light gets shed on the plot as I progress through the sequel. You can only tease people for so long before they get bored.\n\nFrom a pure gameplay standpoint, though, Half Life: Source will not disappoint. If you have never played it and can deal with outdated graphics & sound, go ahead & pick it up. If not, you can skip straight to Half Life 2 without missing a whole lot. In other words, you’ll be just as confused at the beginning of HL2 whether you played through the first game or not.","March 18, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I still haven't finished this one.)\nBut I played Black Mesa first, and the gameplay in HL:S is so much more balanced and fun. The graphics, obviously, have suffered over the years.

Get that! Don't get this please don't! It's so buggy. I have both versions and decided recently to replay it. I thought to myself might as well play the source version and maybe i'll see something new they've added, maybe the textures are a lot better maybe the A.I is different. Well on close examination the game is identical. Yes the lighting is slightly smoother and some textures are slightly different. I wouldn't say they're are better, they still look rather outdated. Just different. Where this version fails is all the bugs. I can only imagine this didn't get play tested at all. They simply dumped the first game into this engine or remastered process and never looked at it again. There are so many little bugs that bothered me. One annoying bug is where I had a few guards with me and if they took damage and yelled they wouldn't stop the yell, they would endlessly react to the pain, even though they werent getting attacked anymore. Really irritating. Where i finally gave up was when you first meet the marines, there is this high octane music, that i remember from the first one. It's like matrix style and gets you into it and really adds something extra. However in this version just after the music starts you hit a load screen to the next area, and that kills the music, it just ends. And then you're left in silence again. It's so awkward and I was so into the music, that it was just enough to me. However on the old version which I started playing again everything is fine, no bugs. I can't play this version if every little element is broken or missing. Just max out the graphic settings on the old version it will look nearly identical to this version and it plays a lot better. Don't waste your money or time on this. I have also read that the final boss in this version is also almost unplayable so yeah don't bother.

It's just the original game ported to the Source Engine. The result is alright for a few things, but in all honesty I've found it to be less enjoyable than the original.\n\nOn the plus side, the best thing I can say about is that the water looks better. Yeah, it's not much, but you can actually see through it here unlike the original, which can be helpful for getting an idea of underwater areas before diving into them and can allow you to more easily target underwater enemies without actually having to be in the water and risk attacks from them.\n\nThere's also the addition of ragdolls, which generally look much nicer than the set death animations and poses NPCs took on in the original whenever they were killed.\n\nHowever, some enemies don't have the same behavior as in the original, some enemies are less aggressive and will not seem to notice you as often,  It might make the combat a bit easier, but that's what takes away from the gameplay, it's not quite as challenging as the original is.\n\nOther NPCs don't seem to have translated very well over to the port. One of the best examples being the friendly NPCs, Scientists and Security Guards will constantly make pain noises and grunts after being injured just once, something that's rather annoying to listen to if you want any to accompany you for backup.\n\nOverall, the game just doesn't have the same old feel of the original that I found myself enjoying and is also less challenging than it. I definitely don't recommend playing it before the original Half-Life, at the very least.

I chose to play through this one instead of the original because of the more advanced engine.  Gordan Freeman must fight his way out of the Black Mesa facility after a terrible experiment release creatures from another dimension into our dimension.  The Government sends troops to silent the experiment and all survivors within the facility.  It feels like a classic FPS such as 007: GoldenEye, which is good then again it is from 1999 and Valve's first game.  There isn't much reason to play this other than to learn of the history before Half-Life 2.  For 1999 standards I give it a 9/10, for its 2004 release 8/10.  Right now, a 7/10.","July 21, 2013","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It still stands out as a revolutionary game for its time. I do happen to play a few older games(not too many). This is mostly because: ·It's cool how games have changed ·The ones you hear might hear about more, like Half-Life, are very interesting milestones and ·With my current laptop these older games are much less taxing and can be played at the best settings.\n"Well HL:S is just the same game but on the Source engine with some graphical differences. It ruins the experience" -Yes, that's exactly what it is. But it doesn't ruin the experience. I'll compare this to a newer game hopefull you may have played. If not, go do that after you play this. It's like The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Amazing N64 game. Woah! Look it's Link in 3D! And a couple years ago WHAM! It's LoZ OoT 3D. Link in real 3D woooaaahhhh! It's the same game, in fact that has more differences than HL:S to HL, and they're still mostly visual and otherwise unnoticable.\nYes, if you haven't played this game, play it.

I miss aiming ;w; but thats a personal preference)\n\nCons: -Some bugs appear (The game might crash sometimes on newer machines due to its age, also I had an issue with the hitbox of helicopters and a level with SERIOUS graphic-glitches for example).","January 31, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I and many people didn't like about the source version was that, when we heard from Valve we were going to get a source remake of Half-life we though it was going to be amazing, although when HL:S was delivered it was just a source port. Although I would absolutely fine with this port if it wasn't for the bugs, glitches and gameplay.\n\nSuprisingly Half-life Source has more bugs than the original game, and these bugs are awful almost breaking the experince. Even after the 10 years its been out, this game hasn't been fixed. Half-Life 1 is my favorite FPS game it topples everything in my opinion(even the sequels), and to be a port how can the gameplay be bad?\n\nWell, since Half-life is running on a new engine the hit points and aiming is horrendous, for example the chopper: In the original game it took one or two hits to know the chopper down and a full charge from the tau cannon. However the the damage never seems to register properly so it makes the game unplayable. And it ruins the shooting with the new kick-backs of the weapons.\n\nHalf-Life: Source is an unpolished port and massive trump in valves libary of games.\nBut would I reccomend it?\nOf course not, you should really just grab the original it has the single player campaign working flawlessly and a multiplayer that comes with it, unlike Source where you have to purchase it independently.\n\nBut if you feel like playing this game in the source engine and you think it looks good then I would say maybe get it.\n\nEven though there is a source port for the original Half-life that looks superb.\n\n6/10","July 21, 2014","false","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
