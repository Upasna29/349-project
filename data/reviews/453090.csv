Resembles the original RCT style whilst giving much more freedom.\n- Unlike RCT1/2, you can build walls, roofs and things inside each other, which makes building so much easier, and allows for some fantastic architecture.\n- Nice, cartoony graphics.\n- Easy to use.\n- The dev team is very passionate about what they're doing, and seem to be fully committed. I reckon they won't stop working on this until it can't be made any better.\n- Great music (I mean, there isn't much of it yet, but the menu song is nice and upbeat :P).\n\nCons:\n- Currents lacks some things (water rides, some objects, maybe some coaster types), but that's purely because it's in early access. I should note that it by no means stops you from making great parks.\n- Complex parks may run a bit slowly on lower-end machines (again, probably due to early access).","May 7","true","7.5"," 56 of 64 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","56","64","0","1"

For the moment there is only one mode in the game which is a kind of sandbox mode but they will be updating the game monthly.\n\nThe fact is in this mode, planting down rides, planting down items and stores is easy, quick and fast to use! I was so relieved by that. Simple things which should be done simple. Which they were.\n\nThe only drawback is that because it's early access (alpha build) there is not much to it right now. There was also a problem I was having when trying to customly make coasters which I currently solved by using their preset designs.\n\nThe game I can't stop shouting about though because it just is all I wanted in a Park Sim Building game and what I've missed out on with other certain games! :)))\n\nYou can see a preview of the game from this link\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QHpgE3Xrwo","May 5","true","2.6"," 56 of 76 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","56","76","3","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxfreak/recommended/453090/","maxfreak","maxfreak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxfreak/","410 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me begin with, I was one of the individuals who contributed to the Kickstarter to help this game become a reality. Heck, I remember when Sebastian was showing off his concept work using programmer art to demonstrate the systems he was working on. Then Garret hopped on the train and the game REALLY took off. I would liken this game to a beautiful fusion of the original Theme Park by Bullfrog and RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. I will explain the how and why later on in my review. This game as a whole is a massive labor of love by everyone involved and it truly shines because of this.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game plays exactly how you would expect a Theme Park simulator to play. You paint paths, place rides and shops, build coasters of doom- I uh mean Thrilling Coasters!1!!1, and hire staff for your park. On top of that you also are in charge of planting scenery, constructing buildings, terra-forming, adding water to your park, and so much more! If you have played RollerCoaster Tycoon then a lot of this will feel very similar and you can easily dive in with a few quirks. A feature in Parkitect that the RollerCoaster Tycoon games lack is a shopkeeper and stock system. This was present in Bullfrogs Theme Park in the form of a graph like GUI where you order stock for your burger shop or drink stall through delivery trucks. In Parkitect you hire "Haulers" who are staff members that will exit the park to pickup crates and deliver them to their respective stalls. This adds an additional layer of strategy on the game because you can either have your Haulers carry boxes through your park in plain sight or you have the option of constructing employee only paths that can hide behind the scenes or travel underground! To top this off the Staff Paths can also lead to a building I wish we had in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, a staff room! Without a Staff Room your Staff members will instead use the benches in your park, this will also contribute to them becoming more irritable as well.\n\nThe game also features a Piece by Piece building mode akin to what was available in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Speaking of building things, Parkitect removes the grid that everything was constrained to back in the day. With a caveat though, everything besides scenery is constrained to a grid. However trees and scenery pieces are free game during placement. An on demand grid with adjustable sizes is also avaiable with the ALT key if you prefer to precision place your objects. Also when it comes to track ride construction they added a lot of fantastic additions to make it feel familiar yet very powerful. It's still a Piece By Piece builder akin to RollerCoaster Tycoon, however they added fine tuning controls which are total game changers. You can now adjust the exact size of your piece by click on a "+" or "-" button to make them longer or wider. Mix that with the pitch controller (which lets you do a full 360 degree roll vs just 1 banking option like in RCT2) and you can create some extremely wide and twisted track designs. The game does a great job in giving you a very guided yet free form building environment.\n\nIn terms of Park Guests they are an absolute joy to amuse and please. ( I won't go into too much detail here as I have a lot to say about them in later topics). They explore your park as singular entities Ala RCT1 and 2 and go about their business carrying balloons, park maps, food, umbrellas, riding rides, vomitting, and ETC. For the sadistic players you are able to drop peeps into water and watch them suffer. :( Coasters can be derailed and crashed as well. The insanity continues!\n\nGraphics:\nThe visuals in the game are downright gorgeous and adorable. The game sports a very toybox look which is both clean and aesthetically pleasing to the eye. While the games graphics are very simplistic don't let that fool you. Every object is chock full of detail, especially the rides and rollercoasters. You can see bolts, wheel assemblies, and ultra smooth animations on everything that moves. Flat rides are clean and distinctive with a full RGB color scheme to paint them with. The animations are wonderfully done with heavy pendulums showing clear stress from weight and Launched Freefalls giving me the sensation of weightlessness.\n\nComing back to the topic of people, they are very well done with a variety of skin tones, hair color and styles, and various accessories they wear such as backpacks and hats. Their animations are a joy to witness. All of their animations are extremely smooth with virtually no transition between them. What I mean is when a peep goes to sit down on a bench, they don't instally teleport to the seat. They actually turn around and will sit down, and do the same when standing up. This applies to everything such as benches and rides. Even food objects are smoothly eaten and disposed of. Their facial expressions are especially endearing as they animate on the fly and clearly demonstrate their emotion.\n\nThe game also allows the scenery objects to be scaled to different sizes and some can even have an adjusted color scheme. Trees sway in the wind, placing objects will cause a force that will push trees using a faux wind effect, and objects plop down and appear with satisfying animations. Buildings have a definite toylike look to them (which isn't a bad thing) and really compliment the colorful nature of the game. Water in the game is simplistic but gets the job done as well.\n\nSound:\nThe sound effects in the game absolutey elevate the experience even further. I don't even know where to begin as audio is a big focal point for me when playing games. Let's begin with the peeps. The general peep ambiance is very Sim Golf esque where there is a lot of audible gibberish and general blabber. It's quite entertaining to listen to and it definitely brought a smile to my face. On rides peeps scream and laugh very realistically. There is a lot of charm in this area because it ties everything together perfectly.\n\nRides creak, groan, and make very nice pneumatic sound effects. Shoulder harnesses and lap bars also make very nice clicking sounds and they're lowered and gates will squeak as they open and close. Rides also make satisfying clanks and clangs as they come to a stop or switch operating modes. Scenery also has a variety of sound effects as well. Trees make a nice planting sound, rocks clunk down on the environment, and flowers make a nice swoosh sound when planted. I think my favorite sounds have to be the ones objects and rides make when being placed. It's a very brassy, heavy, clank and clunk sound that definitely gives the illusion of the object having weight. I think Gordon, their sound designer did a phenominal job in this area.\n\nClosing thoughts:\nAll in all this game has an incredible foundation setup for it. The developers did an incredible job keeping fans and prospective fans in the loop. They post weekly updates to their Tumblr, ar every active on Twitter, and occassionally do live streams showing the creation of new assets. They are also very receptive to modding, in which Parkitect Nexus will be your primary stop for everything Parkitect related (also run by incredible people). At this price you are getting a very solid experience with a lot going for it. I'm ecstatic to see where the future of the game goes from here. It has changed so much from the beginning but in the best ways possible.\n\nTLDR;\n\nThis game is freakin amazing! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","May 5","true","51.2"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","36","45","2","0"

The game has a lot of content right now - although it is just a sandbox, at this point. There is a lot to build and manage. From custom rollercoasters and buildings to Steam Workshop support, you will definately have plenty to entertain yourself if you have the imagination.\n\nWhile I was not as 'blown away' with this as a majority of the reviews, I think it comes down to getting out what you put in. Like a box of Legos, you have to entertain yourself. There is no tutorial here, or end goal. It is really not that hard to keep your budget in the black, either.\n\nPros:\n+Graphics and art style really work well here.\n+Controls are intuitive and work really well.\n+It is a modernization of Roller Coaster Tycoon, with all the goodness of that series and some added in things that are a breath of fresh air.\n\nCons:\n-It could benefit from a fairly in-depth tutorial (which I assume is likely to be added), so no biggie.\n-It needs music! Currently there is only one track for all the rides (the same track), and its hella annoying (classic carnie music).\n-Keep the content coming!\n-Other small things that you would expect from an alpha Early Access game.\n\nYeah, if you like amusement park tycoon games, this is a no-brainer.","May 8","true","3.5"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","25","34","0","0"

If you are cosidering RCTW, really consider this instead.

Didn't have to search for anything I wanted to do. ( Not reinventing the wheel )\n- As with many unity games ... MODS! ( not just on workshop but also on nexus )\n\nCons:\n- Performance! While not horrible frame rate will drop as the map fills up, and them allowing you to place way to much stuff on the map does not help :) Certainly not RCTW levels of bad performance ( which is a joke ), but when it comes to simulators I tend to find performance important. Hoping it will improve as progress continues. )\n- Coaster design additions sometimes make it tough to reconnect tracks when editing if you dont do it perfectly. ( hoping for a "fill gap" option.\n- Some lack of content here and there in unimportant places. Like different path types and music for rides is limited to 1 song atm.

It's in Alpha state so it's neither feature complete nor bug-free.\n\nThis said, the game is well playable for a couple of hours or even a lot more, depending on what parts of the gameplay you emphasize. There's no game-breaking bugs I've encountered or any crashes I've had, just minor stuff like visitors walking through objects or walls or a mechanic stuck in a door.\n\n(I strongly recommend to get the free cam mod from parkitectnexus to replace the isometric perspective with a free-floating camera. This helps immensely when building objects and is overall more fun and looks better.)\n\nYou can already:\n\n- build giant rollercoasters of all kinds\n\n- ride those rollercoasters, thanks to a mod\n\n- custom build houses, which your visitors can enter and you can place attractions, food stands or whatever you want in. Base game does not offer the variety of Planet Coaster yet though.\n\n- build a nice variety of attractions, however they're somewhat limited and a park the size of the quarter of the map will likely contain all of them.\n\n- terraform the map to your liking\n\n- download countless mods, custom buildings, new themes, maps via parkitectnexus.com and Steam Workshop\n\n- report bugs you find on the forums\n\nwhat you can't:\n\n-get your hand held: there's no tutorial, no tooltips. However everything is pretty selfexplanatory imo, all information is visualized somehow. You need spacebar to turn objects and controls for the camera, for everything else there's a button in the UI\n\n- build large parks as the engine isn't optimised and will run into performance issues when zooming out with parks bigger than a quarter of the current map size (means around 700-800 visitors at once, I guess this takes 3-5 hours to achieve)\ntechnically you can build bigger parks of course but to run smoothly you can't zoom the camera out too much.\n\n- manage your park: you can hire personel but that's about it, I think you don't have to pay them yet and can't create zones to assign them to yet (correct me if I'm wrong though, there's a button to assign them to zones, but I can't figure out how to create them)\nthere's no financial challenge, the park will make plus no matter what. If you lack money, just speed up the game and wait\n\nSo, the conclusion: If you're the creative type and just want a sandbox to build the rollercoasters and amusement parks of your dreams I figure there's already dozens of hours of fun in this. If you expect a lot to manage, any scenarios to accomplish or great challenges then you might wanna pass out on this for the time being (but keep an eye on it!)","May 10","true","8.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

If you are expecting high end graphics, dont get this.. just yet! This game surprised me. From the reviews, i thought it really was going to be like rct2 and etc. However, i was wrong. This game is completely different to rct2... in a good way though.\n\nParkitect has a new feature which i havent seen in any other park simulation game, stocking your shops.  In my opinion, i thought it was pretty cool. Its new and more realistic.\n\nTo break this down, here are the con's and pro's of Parkitect.\n\nPro's:\n\n- different but realistic features such as shop stocking\n- allows you to place a variety of rides, shops and coasters including but not limited to:\no The Haunted House(general ride) and the Suspended Monorail (transport ride)\no The Mini Coaster\no Cash Machine and Balloon Shop\n- the guests in your park aern't as picky with rides like rct3 XD\n- there is a large variety of terraforming, building and scenery\n- the money system is not hard to manage but still provides you with a challenge to get in the greens\n- the path placer and ride queue and exists are easier than ever to place\n- simple and easy to learn controls once you play it for a bit\n- the create a coaster tool is simple to use\n- Neat and easy to use interface :D\n- The rating system with rides is different to most park simulation games which although can be confusing , makes it unique in its own way (still shows the high, medium and low rating next to the numbers)\n\nCon's-\n\n- Guests dont have a favourite ride (Personally this has always been a favourite in park simulation games)\n- no tutorial (hard to learn if you have not played many park simulation games such as the rct series)\n- not much of a variety of food and drink shops\n-  guests get tired really quickly, meaning there has to be alot of seating in your park for them to stay happy\n- there isnt much of a night in the  game like there was in similar park simulation games (the lights dont look any different to day)\n-  Barely any of the coasters have loops and corkscrews\n- when creating a rollercoaster, it can be confusing seeing it run through  back to the station while designing but after ,when testing, it wont make it back to the station\n- Not many seating options other than benches..,  (I would love to see tables implemented like wooden tables)\n- Entertainers only have one outift and cannot be changed (only the colour can)\n- glitches when a mechanic is fixing a ride ( cant get out of the exit, just freezes there)\n\nOverall, despite my number of cons, i still strongly recommend this game to people looking for a casual, fun and enjoyable park/business simulation game. I am confident most of the cons will be fixed by the time the finished version of the game is released. :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 7","true","5.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

But holy ♥♥♥♥ this game is flawless. It is a return to the classic isometric style of RCT1 and RCT2 but adds a boatload of great new features. The coaster design is great, it does not limit you in the way of the original tycoons but is structured just enough so you don't hit RCT World territory. Another great addition is the free placing AND snap placing of objects. The free placing allows you to place scenery and props anywhere you want, allowing for some really cool possibilities. On the other hand you can use the grid snap to presisely create buildings and other structures. All in all this game is fantastic, especially for being in alpha, and if you're into roller coaster sims I would highly recommend you pick this one up.","May 14","true","10.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

I have been a HUGE fan of RCT 1&2 since my windows 95. This takes everything i loved in those games and elevates it.  The customization in this game makes RCT look pathetic.  Make gorgeous scenery around your rides with half the effort, and twice the effect. The coaster creation tool sticks to the grid system we love, but expands it into a fluid system.  Allowing you to set the perfect banking for your turn, even if that should be a simple 5 degree bank.\n\nWith all that said, lets remember it's in early access.  I hope to see many new rides and coasters join the line up in the months to come(Gotta have some go-karts!).  And I hope to see Senarios added in eventually, as I found half the fun in RCT1 was unlocking and exploring new parks and challenges.

If you've liked designing and building nice sandbox parks for hours and your PC cannot handle more demanding 3D-games, this definitely is for you! A game for designers, architects, coaster-enthusiasts and - hopefully soon - tycoons!\n\nI played RCT1&2 since 2002 and used it mostly as a creative tool for building nice theme parks, so I very early found out about this game as it is very close to the first two installments of the series and thus bought the pre-alpha.\n\nGraphics:First I didn't like the graphics and the perspective of the game, but I grew fond of them because they optimized them and added color filters to tone down the bright hues. And the view is more optimized and mods even add first person functions as well (always wanted to walk around parks in RCT2). There are still some graphic glitches (also due to being able to build so freely) but I'm sure they will be resolved.\n\nGameplay/building:The grid-based building process is very similar to RCT, but has a lot more freedom because you can overlay multiple objects/walls and place objects like trees, rocks and decorations outside the grid as well.\nCoaster building is an extended version of the original RCT coaster builder and allows much smoother transitions and banking of the tracks.\nThe vanilla rides and objects are sufficient to build nice parks. There are no official coaster or ride brands in the game, but you can easily get the inspirations.\n\nSimulation:The simulation so far works quite well, I had no trouble with the guests or staff so far. I really like the feature of the delivery and the added staff-only paths and staff rooms - something that was missing from RCT. The coasters and rides run smoothly and I love how the graphs for ride intensity/speed or the guests are presented.\n\nUI/Sound:The menus are sometimes a bit confusing, as I found out about features only by asking about them on Reddit, so there's a bit work left to do there. But navigating in them is easy and the search object function is a plus. Cannot say much about the sound, as I'm mostly playing on mute anyways.\n\nAdditional:The workshop feature and Parkitect Nexus now are somehow split, so I hope this will get resolved somehow as there are some great custom objects, parks and mods like onride or first person camera available over there already.\nFor me sometimes there is not enough costumization, which I hope will be added later, especially on the outskirts of parks (parking lots, roads, hotels and a customizable entrance building).\nI liked giving feedback to this project, as I have the feeling the creators (who might be overwhelmed due to the Steam release now) listen and improve the game continuously.\n\nBefore buying keep in mind:This game is in Early Access = not finished and depending on feedback\nThe economic features of this game are still in development\nThere is no tutorial of how to play it, but if you've played RCT1&2 you will find your ways pretty fast\nThis game has no scenario feature yet\nThere are bugs in this game, that's why it's in Early Access!","May 9","true","24.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

For a game in alpha, this is simply incredible. Of course, there are bugs. However, the development team (which by the way is 1 programmer, 1 art designer and 1 sound designer) iron these bugs out extremely quickly with their weekly updates. Incredible!\n\nThis game is already outstandingly better than (ew) RCT:W. I love Parkitect, it's like the new RCT:2/1 Or even a better version of RCT:3!\n\nThe modding community is already huge; Some mods include a 'Coaster Cam' or 'Better Perspective' (which changes the default isometric camera to a 3d camera, like RCT:3 (see above paragraph)).\n\nFurthermore, the art style is incredible!

In Parkitect, you must build a theme park from the ground up while managing finances, stock and staff.  Personally, this has been one of the most engrossing parts of the gamel; finding new ways to manage and balance finances.  For example, will guests come to your park if you charge a $30 entry fee with all rides at $0.30?  Damn right they will!\n\nThe main focus, however is on designing and creating a theme park from scratch.  You will be given a very substantial plot of land and a large amount of cash to get your park off the ground.  From here, you must entice guests to come to Mr. Fun's Funpark of Fun and spend all of their hard earned cash by pulling it from their cold dead hands in any way possible.  People need to pee, right?  Charge for toilet usage!\n\nThis game also gives you the ability to build rollercoasters' piece by piece that gives you the power to create the rollercoaster of your dreams, before charging out the ♥♥♥ for it.\n\nThe overall look, feel and charm of Parkitect is much like that of RollerCoaster Tycoon. Guests feel like they are experiencing your creations first hand. The ride music and ambience of chattering guests and rattling coasters make sure that your theme park comes to life.\n\nParkitect seemingly has modding built in it from the ground up, with the game featuring a modding menu and steam workshop integration that is akin to that of Cities: Skylines where players have the ability to create and upload their creations to the Steam Workshop for other business-savy players to make use of.  For example, I was in-game and placed a small eco park right in to the centre of my buzzing theme park.  Simple as that.  I believe that the type of modding integration available in Parkitect will vastly increase the games' longevity.\n\nRight now the only game mode is a sandbox mode where all rides, shops, utilities, paths, etc are unlocked from the get go.  Hopefully in the future, we may see challenge modes or game modes where everything is not unlocked from the beginning.\n\nHopefully as the games development trundles on we will see the admission of new rides, shops, utilities and decorations. As well as new ways to pressure guests in to funnelling all of their cash in to your dirty corporate pockets.\n\nParkitect is a title that you should be paying attention to if you have any passing interest in simulation, strategy or management games or have played other titles like Rollercoaster Tycoon, Theme Park World or Theme Hospital.\n\nHowever, this game is still in Alpha and is constantly being improved upon.  You can keep up-to-date through the developers website or the Steam forums where patch information is posted.\n\nIn a time where RollerCoaster Tycoon World exists, you should be buying, or at the very least, keeping an eye on Parkitect.","May 5","true","23.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

However, it shows plenty of progress, the devs update their blog weekly and update the game every month, and they include the community greatly in the development via Parkitect Nexus.\n\nThat said this game fills that RCT2 niche super well; currently it only has a Sandbox mode and the money system isn't perfectly balanced yet. Although don't fret, at the time of writing this review the devs plan to spend the next couple of months vastly improving the game mechanics of Parkitect, not to mention the plethora of mods that are already available for a game in Alpha 1a. Wanted coaster cam? There's a mod for that! Wanted free camera movement and zoom? There's a mod for it! I really can't reccomend this game enough, the devs are very faithful, the community is strong, and the game's core mechanics and essence is just fantastic.

The game is great. It's really nice, but before purchasing - and I'm not being negative here - consider that for now it's a bit lacking in terms of content. I'm just saying that for now there isn't really that much to do. It's just a sandbox; you have to come up with your own objectives. After fulfilling them, you can only try to begin anew. STILL, at the same time, don't worry - your money is not going to be wasted if you decide to buy. The graphics are just right for this type of game, gameplay is satisfying when you watch your park prosper, the UI is very clear and not intrusive, terraforming is damn great, and so on.\n\nThe few gripes I have with this game are there only because of it still being in early development. I adore it, and trust me - I don't say that about many Early Access games.\n\n1. The game's performance could be better as it likes to stutter sometimes. It particularly shows when you zoom out.\n2. Crowd sounds. Your guests make different sounds, from little songs to laughing and shouting in excitement. And it's fine, it sounds natural... until your park grows to a certain number of guests.\n\nIT IS INFURIATING. By the time you have about 200-300 guests it's hardly bearable. The problem here is that your guests make their sounds over each other. Crowd sounds in RCT were perfect. It was just a looped crowd noise with sounds playing over it - it was far less annoying and felt much more natural and less intrusive.\n3. Message feed - it rarely informs you of what is happening with your park, in my case it was only occasional ride breakdowns. Or it's just me not having built a park big enough yet.\n4. Lack of tutorial - well, it speaks for itself. When I began my first game, I was no idea what to do. BUT! On the other hand, the game is very intuitive and it's very easy to figure out most of it - and it's a sizeable "most" - on your own.\n5. Lack of objectives - again, speaks for itself. For now it's just a sandbox i.e. you need to come up with your own objectives, and can only begin anew once you fulfill them.\n\nAh, also, the game supports Workshop, yay!\n\nI understand how the label 'Early Access' scares off some people, but fear not.\n\nJust buy it.\nIt's really good.","May 22","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The low-poly graphics are light on your system so you can simulate huge parks with more guests and staff. With over a dozen coaster types to play with; plenty of shops, 'flat rides', decor, and terraforming you can design the park you want.\n\nCoaster games at their core are business simulation managers and Parkitect does that better than the rest by allowing you to focus on that aspect rather than high resolution graphics.

The game has kept that old-timey feel of locked rotation as well as giving the player the option to rotate the camera freely (to a point). I would recommend it in it's current state 100%. It's pretty decently polished, has the gameplay, and introduces community mods and blueprints to the steam workshop as well as ParkitectNexus.\n\nThe Graphics\nThe graphics in the game are very polished. While it has some glitches here and there, it is an alpha and I look passed that. Parkitect is very aesthetically pleasing in the way of color and presentation. Every time I go in to the game I enjoy looking at it becasue it's not too bright or boring (However, you do get the options to make it boring or very colorful).\n\n8/10\n\nThe Gameplay Parkitect offers a lot in terms of gameplay. Right now there is no story mode or campaign. However, there is a Sandbox mode that lets the player pretty much do anything they would like. The game runs pretty smoothly, however in terms of performance, even on my R9 290x it bogs down in some of the bigger maps when zoomed out.\n\nThe game gives the player many options for customizations on things such as buildings, landscapes, people, etc. I love that the game gives players the option to follow around certain people and see what they're doing in your park. It helps quite a bit to see how to optimize your park, and where to do so.\n\n\n*More to come as I get more in depth with the game.

Whilst it is in early access right now, it's already clear it's going to be an absolutely wonderful game on full launch, and is already extremely fun to play.\n\nIt's been a while since we've had any theme park sims on the market, and Parkitect is one I've been following through the 2 years of development so far. It's developed a lot over those two years, which is impressive considering the small indie developers behind it, so it being in early access feels /right/.\n\nSo what even is Parkitect? In a nutshell, it's a quirky, fun isometric theme park simulator, and if you liked the original RCT games, it’s the perfect modern day counterpart, which many new mechanics that makes it truly unique.\nI can’t recommend this game enough, even in the current alpha form.

I love everything about this game. The cartoon graphics are great and will hold up very well over time, the coaster designer is brilliant, the full 3D that is normally locked to isometric is brilliant. (try moving and rotating while holding ALT) Overall its just a great game. These guys did to theme park games what Colossal Order and cities skylines did to city builders. They rebooted the concept with fun and entrainment instead of just being a platform for DLC.\n\nTheme parks are fun, so games about theme parks should be fun. They should not resemble a CAD program, nor should they be so dumbed-down you don’t have options for detailed building. This game is is a perfect balance of detailed construction while still keeping the game fun and light.\n\nBugs? What bugs? It has worked perfectly fine for me so far.

It brings back great memories of the countless hours I poured into RCT1 & 2.  If you're like me and loved those first two, do not hesitate.  It is Early Access, so there is quite a bit of content still to be implemented.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Motanum/recommended/453090/","Motanum","Motanum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Motanum/","301 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nParkitect is a Theme Park simualtion Game. It is inspired by RCT 1 and 2, but does so many stuff much better already than RCT2. First the visual improvement is a welcome change, much more accpetable by today's standard. There is great charm in the game also, watching people walk around adn see their travel logs is very gratifying. But by far the best aspect to this game in my opinion is the greatly improved coaster designer.\n\nthe coaster designer is not node based like planet Coaster, No limits or RCTW. Instead it's base on the RCT coaster designer, but it is so much better and allows for a lot of freedom. You can bank anyttime you want pretty much, you can extend and reduce track segments, it allows for a lot of smooth ride creation.\n\nThe biggest drawback for the game, is the lack of a tyccon at the moment. While you can make a profit on the park, the game still lacks some of the simualtion elements. For example the resource system is still a WIp which can drag down your park, but the system is worked on and the devs said they want to focus on that this month. The game also lacks some classic rides from RCT (Dingy slide, go karts, LIM coaster) and scenarios. For now its just sandbox.\n\nThe devs are great! They keep us updated every week with a blog post. They have not missed a single week post for 95 updates (They might have some days delay, but always up!). They updated the pre alpha every month, and I have complete confidence that they will not abandon this game at all!\n\nThere already is a modding community, which can enhance the game alot. Extra ride,s extra coaster types, extra scenery objects! Coaster Cam! I really recommend using it, it is very neatly integrated inside the game!\n\nThus, I say Parkitect is a must have if you look for a building simulation game","May 5","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has expanded upon the basic gameplay from that, thrown in a hint of the Sims and released a great piece of work. This is only day 1 of the early access and it has ablsolutly blown me away. There is a large selection of rides and scenery with more promised to come in future updates and from the community. I am still learning the interface but it is easy to pick up.\n\nThe gameplay needs a few balancing tweaks here and there but I am very impressed with it for a Day 1 early acess release in Alpha. The sandbox is a great way to just play around and learn the game with few restrictions.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing. It is very relaxing, yet upbeat and fun. There are enough songs so that they do not get annoying having to listen to the same song over and over again. The caroucel is actually several recorded clips of music from a Wurlitzer 162 organ which is a real nice touch.\n\nI love the artwork as well. It took me a few minutes to get used to it but now I love it! It was made even better by ramping up the graphics. I have a GeForce 750M 2gb card in my laptop and it ran  beautifully on max settings except for a few seconds of initial stutter.\n\nI am very excited to see what the developers bring to this game.

The graphics are pretty nice but there are some gameplay features that are missing from RCT (there\'s no research or park scenarios, for example), and not a lot in the way of innovation, though there is stock / inventory system for your shops and kiosks which is new. However, everything that is implemented is super polished and feels like a finished game in terms of quality (just not enough content yet, imo).\n\nCompared to RCT there are some overall improvvements in the interface and details. Placing paths is much easier and you have a lot more control over coaster construction (including being able to customize the bank on curves) though there are some quirks. For example, even though the graphics are 3d the game is still pinned to a x/y grid and some track segments can\'t be used at 45 degrees. I guess simplifies the engine a bit.\n\nAnd finally, the big thing missing compared to RCT is the variety. Obviously this game is early in the development stage but I think it will really be more fun later when there is more variety in attractions, coasters, styles, and most importantly, scenarios (and possibly some other kind of content gating). Right now it\'s a sandbox and although the core mechanics are well executed it\'s not super compelling in terms of gameplay loop and rewards.\n\nI spent hundreds of hours playing RCT back in the day and this game is so far a dutiful homage to the classic. I\'m sure over time as more content is added it will be even more fun, but I\'d love to see some innovation in the gameplay or game systems department. If your primary fun factor in RCT was just designing the coasters, you will enjoy what\'s here so far. But if you got more enjoyment out of the business / sim / scenario side of things that part is not really there yet. Overall I would recommend buying this now if you want to show your support, but wait if you want more content to explore.","June 1","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The games still in early access but im finding it to be a immensely enjoyable experience and i find im now playing it more than RCTW or PC, both of which are also early access.\nThis takes the isometric template used in earlier RCT games and adds an almost cartoon feel to it. Theres a greater depth to this game which is good, not only is it about building the best park you can but also running and managing it on a day to day business. Shops need stock delivered - youll need a haulier staff to go collect stock from the park and then deliver it to the appropriate store. Mechanics, Janitors, Secuirty and entertainment staff are also featured.\nAt the minute theres only a blank sandbox mode  but this is a great way to start messing around with custom terrain and scenery and getting a feel for park layouts.

Currency does exist and you are able to charge for ride, merchanidse and use the information to determine cash flow. (This system is being worked on all the time).\n\nIf you enjoyed the earlier RCT games, this one is worth every penny.

If you don't care about realistic 3D graphics and riding your coasters, I guarantee you'll have more fun playing Parkitect, than RCTWorld or PlanetCoaster.\n\nIt really is a faithful succesor to RCT2. Most acpects of the game are designed to resemble the feel of classic RollerCoasterTycoon, but removing the limits and expanding on available options. The park building mechanisms are similar - yet more powerful and finer-grained. For example, you can divide the grid by 4 for finer precision when placing trees. Track slopes may have as much as 6 tilt levels in both directions. Ride entrances may be turned 90 degrees. The developers clearly are veterans of the classic game, and know very well what made the original so good, and what should be improved.\n\nThe modernized graphics style is unique - cartoon asthetics fit the theme perfectly. The game has a very HD feel to it, as the cartoonish style is minimalistic yet plesantly detailed.\n\nThere is a wire variety of attractions to build already in the game, but if that's not enough, the mod support is very solid.\n\nAnd finally, the dev team keeps good contact with the community. There are very frequent updates and the progress done is amazing, they are also open to feedback and ideas.\n\nStrongly recommended for all RCT veterans. For everyone else, you may want to wait a little more - the campaign mode and in-game economy are not yet implemented, and the bare sandbox mode may make the game confusing for newcommers.","May 5","true","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Scenary has no space restrictions so you can just overlap and create anything you mind can imagine. Even a coaster that just strolls through a couple boulders for the fun of it. Its very refreshing to see there be no limits on place scenary like rctw, or even rct2 for that matter. Some scenary items are scalable also which is awesome. Id defiantly say the scenary is the strongest part thus far.\n\nCoaster designer is miles better then rct2 but slopes on very tall hills can still feel a little unnatural, like curve -> straight slope for a while -> Curve out at bottom. Perhaps adding another slant between the steepest and vertical would help greatly. Fury 325 for example has 81 degree drop, not quite vertical. Also some elements are limiting, 45 degree turns cant be used on slant, half loops are straight only which made making x-flight ingame impossible. Small Gripes but i enjoy recreating real parks so its mildly annoying for me.\n\nUI and all that is basic but it functions perfectly, staff screen is a bit clunky but overall cant complain considering its EA.\n\nThe cons would be there is no tutorial or any kind of handholding at this point in devolopment, you just have a sandbox to play in basically. So if you really have no past experience with rct or would give up in confusion quickly then sure, avoid till it has tutorial.\n\nOverall ive enjoyed every minute so far and look foward to the future updates and feel it was worth every penny thus far. Devs seem very involved with the community and the game so i have high hopes it will actually reach release given no monitary issues.","May 11","true","40.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In it's current state, it's far more superior than other pre-alpha/early access games. There's a lot to do in game and the more you start messing around with different objects and experimenting with terrain and water then there are many hours you can pour into it, IF! you're creative.\n\nI say creative as I don't feel the game is particularly intuitive especially when it comes to creating scenery and buildings that you see in the pre-built park and on the trailer for the game. I understand that there's a small team behind the game and that we're in pre-alpha, but as noted by over reviewers I do feel a tutorial is much needed. I feel this will make the game feel less clunky and ease confusion on what we can and cannot do.\n\nPark management is, at the moment, somewhat limited with staffing and ride options being minimal and money seeming to be an afterthought. I don't believe there's any way of actually losing money for e.g. making bad decisions. The only costs are for the things you build i.e. paths, rides and scenery. There are almost 0 running costs apart from staffing.\n\nMy only suggestion to the developers is to hire another team member who is dedicated to the extra bits that aren't coding, art and sound. You need someone who can sort out things like, but not limited to; Tutorials, maps, scenarios, park management etc. I'm quite sure you could actually hand select community maps to be packaged with the game and if the tools were available for a scenario editor to be added would really help the less creative/casual player.\n","May 11","true","17.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I wanted to relive my childhood RCT2 days with the isometric styled gameplay\n2. I want customization, on a four camera grid. So think building/flora placement design for RCT2 mixed with the scope and amount of objects to place onto a single building much like Planet Coaster.\n\nNow onto the good stuff, i truly feel "finger crossed", that this game may well surpass Planet Coaster, purely because so much has been done already with the Workshop and Nexus functionality to allow limitless supply of mods/objects/designs and rides, the big old school coaster tycoon vibes you get to bring in a lot of nostalgia and the constant reminder that this is still an early access game and has a lot more to be added and refined.\n\nI cannot say more, these developers deserve your money.

It may currently be an “Early Access Game” but after 3 hours of playing I have not seen any bugs or game glitches.\n\nIt is straight forward to play and the content so far is fantastic.  There are a number of rides and shops available, not to mention the dozens of scenery objects.  I am glad to see Steam Workshop support for ride, scenery and building blueprints.  I am hoping to see a few mods hopefully appearing soon.\n\nThe graphics are smooth and retro looking.  Reminds me of earlier games on the same theme.  Though the character animations and ride movements look and feel great.  The tools in game for building rollercoasters are very easy to use.  I have not had any difficulties placing objects or building complex structures.\n\nTo say that this game is currently in Alpha only excites me to the possibilities the game developers have in store for us.  Hopefully the addition of more rides, themes, scenery, paths and game functionality will be fantastic (though there is plenty already in game to be getting busy with).  I can 100% recommend this game in its current status and its current price it’s an absolute bargain!!!    :-)\n","May 6","true","19.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's cute, technically incredible yet simple and most importantly, stunning. The simple design makes this game visually impressive. When you have 1000's props on a screen it's amazing.\nThe ride building is a mix between the new 'free moving' builder and the old one. It's very nice to use and it's my favourite out of all the coaster games.\nCompared to Planet Coaster it has more things to place and make due it's mods which is fantastic. And even though in PC can CREATE more, it's so time consuming. Whereas in Parkitect it's simple easy and you can make just as impressive stuff.\n\nAll in all buy Parkitect now and just wait till Planet Coaster adds more props and decor (so probably full release.

It has so much meat on the bones in terms of detail though, that it's easy to forget it's mega early access. For me, the enjoyment was to be had in the extreme amount of customisation you can do, especially on rollercoasters themselves and the decorative aspects of your park.\n\nThere's a great amount of detail to be had in the inner workings of the game, but for me the real fun was in building my theme park exactly the way I wanted it, down to the last tree and brick. That said, an extremely open Steam workshop support allows you to grab other peoples creations exceptionally easily if you're not quite prepared to sink the time in.\n\nEven right now, it's a fun game that you can chill and sink hours in to, although as above, if you're not just looking to chill and you want more of the economy side of things, you may want to hang fire a little. My small spotlight video on the game is here, if you had any further doubts.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6BNb4Hp4joM","May 10","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WinterGrey/recommended/453090/","WinterGrey","Winter Grey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WinterGrey/","161 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far, Parkitect has been a fun experience. For an early access game I can cut some slack on lacking on any sort of 'End goal'. Playing it as a park building simulator it's definitely fun and is looking to end up as a great spiritual successor to RCT.\nHowever, it does suffer a bit from 'sit and wait' syndrome. Funds go up relatively slowly and what you want to build does cost a lot. I ended up leaving my game running when I went off for dinner and came back about an hour later so I had the funds to build a rollercoaster.\nWhile I don't know what being in debt does right now if anything, but a bit later in the development cycle, it'd be nice to see a healthy profit boost. Not so much that it's so easy you can build anything you want all the time, but enough that it doesn't take an hour of doing nothing to be able to afford it. Once my park was self sustaining enough, I had nothing to do but wait.\n\nBut as I said, it IS early access. Very early access. So I do recommend it if you want a more modern RCT game, but I might recommend waiting for proper release if you want goals and something to work to rather than a park building sandbox.\n\nAlso if you delete a shop from your world, the workers won't go away. They'll just stand there. Never leaving unless you specifically fire them. I didn't realise I could fire them until later in my playing so for a while I just had some unmoving zombies floating around the park.","May 8","true","18.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Thank you for bringing back my childhood with this game im 25 years old and feel like im playing RC1 again but better and i never thought id find a game better than RC1 but i think ive found it so thank you and keep up the fantastic work cant wait to see whats in store for the future of this game!!","May 6","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you want the challenge of running a profitable theme park, then you might be disapointed at the moment. However, the dev team have been very good at communicating and updates have been frequent, so I have faith that this will be fleshed out.\n\nI have played for around 5 - 10 hours* to see the state of the alpha and I'm very impressed.\n\n*been playing before it came to Steam.","May 7","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game can be prooven to take up 500 hours of your live! What are you waiting for? Me to give you the game? I wish I could but it costs money :c But that's ok because the fun does not stop there! This game has NO TUTORIALS! So forget having to sit through a 5 hour long tutorial making your first pake a master piece of cake, then when it actually comes it looks like trash, when you can just start fresh without a clue what to do! This game is worth the 18 dollars! The only downside is that sometimes the game can get laggy depending on your FPS maximum or if you have to much rides, even the most dummest looking park can be the best one! so STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND HAVE THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE!

The micromanagement and artistic freedom to design incredible rides and spacious parks interested me enough to try other games in the genre in the hopes of rekindling that spark. It was not easy with the mobile cash grab remake of Theme Park and the rather grotesque changes made to the newest Rollercoaster Tycoon dashing my hopes of finding another competent coaster simulator. My search has now led me to Parkitect and a potential successor to the Rollercoaster Tycoon of old. Is this new Early Access product the golden chariot bound to carry the new era of coaster simulators or just another contraption ready to send a carload of patrons plummeting to their doom?\n\nWhile visuals are not a major priority with these type of games, the simple, cartoony style works well. Rides are animated beautifully and small objects such as drinks, burgers and birds are given enough noticeable detail. The music is pleasant, but it gets repetitive very quickly. Attendees frequently speak in a bizarre Sim-like mumbling that complements the screams and laughter of riders. The atmosphere really feels as if it was ripped straight out of an old coaster sim.\n\nIf it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, does it mean it is a duck? In this case, it isn't. The only available mode right now is the Sandbox mode, allowing players to build and test out the rides with no negative repercussions or goals outside of not going bankrupt. It is enough to give people the tools to sink hours into customizing their own dream parks, but it is missing the challenge and variety of mission based scenarios other roller coaster sims provide. It might be enough for some players, but others looking for some meat with their potatoes might be disappointed in the lack of diverse game modes.\n\nIt offers 20 flat rides (motion rides, haunted houses), 13 coasters and 3 transport rides along with 21 shops and utilities. You also get the standard security, janitor, entertainer, and mechanic employees to hire. One special entry I noticed was the hauler employee, which takes supplies brought to the park and carries it to the different shops and kiosks to keep them supplied. I did like this addition, which gave the park a more realistic feel. You can also read the thoughts of attendees, adjust ticket prices, construct coasters and buildings free hand, and change the ride speeds. Time can also be enhanced using the speed up function.\n\nThe problems start to arrive once the parks grows to a mid-terrain size and large numbers of attendees begin to inhabit the area. Loading into these larger parks has caused me to lock up a couple of times and the rest of the time severe frame rate lose was experienced. It is clear the larger the size of your park the more strain it puts on the game, which results in the frame rate issues. The lack of a tutorial can also cause newer players some trouble if they are not accustom to the genre. Requirements such as queue lines, employee territory coverage and ride status can be hard to locate without prior knowledge. The deletion key, set to the right click, can also cause some heavy annoyance as accidental clicks can remove anything you are working on.\n\nIt is possible to spend a good chunk of time create some fairly decent parks using the tools already provide, but it does not offer much to encourage repeat visits. Placing and building can be satisfying, but with no real goals or motivations you end up resorting to murder by flying coaster cars to keep things interesting. This is a better alternative to Roller Coaster Tycoon World, by far, but it is a better option to continuing with the classic Roller Coaster Tycoon while this game is developed further. It is an interesting tech demo for what is to come, but the price of admission is just not justified for what is here. Hopefully in the future this park will expand to something great, but at this point now you are better off waiting to purchase this ticket.\n\nPros\n\n- Looks rather good\n- Coaster and building customization\n\nCons\n\n- Lack of a tutorial for newcomers to the genre\n- Loading freezes (could be based on next negative)\n- Frame rate drops when park increases to a certain size\n- Very easy to accidentally delete something\n\n\nSpecial Note: The user generated content available through the Workshop was not factored into this review due to it being created by users.","May 15","false","6.9"," 20 of 49 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","20","49","3","8"

It's just too expensive for the experience so far. Similiar to most early access games, it has potential but right now at it's intial release to steam it's nothing special. It's one to wait for unless you are interested in playing it through development to watch it change. Now a quick list of problems I had with it and some positives.\nThe Bad\nthe ui is un-organized (no searching by theme)\nit has low fps on large parks (ruining the point of the sandbox)\nit doesn't have enough cosmetics and rides (this will be solved in time)\nright click is destroy (leads to many accidents)  The Good\nfancy graphics (the trash vision is superb)\nthe building of rollercoasters is sweet (same with buildings)\nthe introduction of supplying shops is cool\nyou can still derail rides and drown people\n","May 13","false","0.6"," 13 of 39 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","13","39","3","0"

Outside of the fact that this is on a newer engine.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the coaster building.  I'm sure in time I would have picked it up.  The camera angle isn't very helpfup (although you can swivel a full 360º) Using different color terrian didn't actually seem like it was improving my park but instead adding an awkard color to it.  The game is very simplistic and didn't feel polished to me.\n\nThese may not be strong agruments points but as someone who played a lot of RCT2/3 and even World... I find it diffucuilt to want to play another Park sim that feels so empty and incomplete.\n\nThe biggest turn off is the $17.99 price tag.\n\nIf it was only $5-6 bucks I wouldn't have end up refunding it, but at $17.99 I rather use that money towards a game I'll play.\n\n--------\n\nI would suggest to buy RCT3.

So if you've played RC Tycoon before, playing Parkitect will probably make you want to play RC Tycoon again. Parkitect has some interesting new ideas, but forgets some of the lessons learned in past theme park games. For instance the camera view in this game is limited to only 4 angles, and zooming in and out.","May 21","false","0.5"," 2 of 22 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","2","22","0","5"

Aside from the latter two things, everything looks phenomenal, and I'm ready for when features are added. But then again, I looked to Parkitect because I have grievances for RCT World, and I was hoping to find something of an enhanced version of the classic RCT 1.

It has no tutorial, and is a bit confusing even just to get started off. The UI is pretty clunky and hard to use, especially since it gets in the way of trying to build things.\n\nAside from that, I have no real quarrels aside from the fact that it's entirely too easy to delete buildings. You appear to get a full refund so you don't get punished for it, but it's still a bit of a hassle having to replace buildings due to a simple misclick.\n\nThe game looks like it could have a lot of potential, but if you buy it be aware it seems to have a long way to go before I personally would consider it "ready" even for eary access, it's more of an alpha phase at the moment. I may eventually change my recommendation to "Yes" by the time this game is out of early access, but I can't recommend it now.

It just doesn't do it right.\n\nThe Good:\n- Almost as many mangaement options as RCT1/2\n- A "Handler" Staff adds a new complexity to the game\n\nThe Bad:\n- The "windowed" UI is clunky. When you click a shop to buy and place, the UI window for the shop gets in the way.\n- For me, the camera felt slow to adjust to change, when i rotated it, it would rotate very slowly. Yes there is a mod for this but since when do we give a game credit for what a mod fixes?\n\n---EDIT---\nThis is my OPINION, if your butt feels like it is hurt from reading the following please consult your health care professional...\n\nThe graphics look terrible, and I am not critizing the game developer for this, it is an artstyle some people like it some dont. But the graphics look worse then RCT2, which you can get for a fraction of the cost and it has more features (keep in mind this is an early alpha release). What do I mean by "graphics look terrible", there are no (zero, zilch, nada) textures. Like seriously, trees are green and brown with maybe a dark green thrown in too.

The most helpful positive review gets about 60 people voting on it.  Most of the negative reviews are over 100 to 150 votes with most being not helpful.  This pushes the negative reviews out of the presented ones when you go to reviews.\n\nJust be wary that this is a statistical anomally that looks like an orchestrated movement to minimize negative reviews.\n\nWhen I see a negative review for a game I like, I think, "Huh, that wasn't my impression."\nI don't take it as a personal attack.  I don't defend the game vehemently.  When peope do that, it's incredibly suspect and looks like they have another motive such as being friends with the developer, etc.\n\nDon't do that.  Your comment will be deleted.\n\nThe game might be good, but any game that is released that completely ignores having a tutorial these days is a pain to play.  Game mechanics are a bit clunky, especially trying to terraform.\n\nJust after a few minutes of play, I ran into a glitch with the termperature wouldn't change from celsius to farenheit even after restarting and playing new games.  Several times it changed mid game, from 26 C to 34 F which isn't a correct translation. I assume temperature is important and part of the function of the paid guests not that I would know for sure without any tutorial.\n\nI don't care that it's EA, you release a game I have to pay for and don't have even basic instructions on how to play it, and I'm going to give it a negative review.  I shouldn't have to research your game on youtube to get an idea about controls, basic buttons, etc.  How long would a tutorial take to make?  Just lazy and a pure cash grab at this point.  Especially considering the game has been purchased by people for two years.\n\nGraphics are as basic as you can get.  The game looks like it was made in 1995, and some might consider that charming.\n\nThe camera angle is odd and annoying.  Apparently you can go to an offsite from steam to download mods to fix that, but I'm reviewing the game and not the mods that fix the game's problems.  Speaking of mods, the only Steam mods available are rides from what I can tell.  Not a big deal considering there seems like plenty of content just starting out.\n\nThis game might be a good value at about 4.99, but the 17 dollar price makes it completely unworth the price.","May 8","false","0.3"," 22 of 192 people (11%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","11","22","192","11","2"

Think the game has lots of potential, and I realy hope the developers will make the game more "complete". I realise the game is early access, so I assume they will add and repair minor bugs and graphics. (Yeah some of the graphics looks real cheep).\n\nAs of now there is only sanbox mode, and thats ok, but after 1-2 hours you'll probably be boored as I was. So in the future they absolutely need to bring something like a  "campaign mode" or "quests" so there's a goal when you're playing.\n\nAll in all I would recomend this game if you realy liked the RCT sandbox build ur park games. If ur not quite sure I would wait a bit and see if they will make it more of a "game".

The range of different Coaster styles is big enough to play around an a park is running very smooth, without any laggs or alpha based bugs. Physics in here work great and the cartoon style is also great and for the gameplay much better than these laggy more realistic based same games like RCTW etc.. I will play this game more often on weekends for sure!\n\nFeatures I would love to see in further updates:\n- Having the possibility to smooth the banking. (E.g. creating a barrel roll right now with 4 segments the banking changes strange in a non linear way)\n- The possibility to change the 3 different inclinations, even when the track is already ascending. (Like having a small slope, then going steep directly. Right now you need to go horizontal first to change the inclination)","May 9","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's simple where it hardly matters (such as grass), and it focuses its powers on the game design, such as creating your park.

The developers actually care about their customers unlike some of the larger companies now. ("cough" "cough" "activision" "cough") Also this game is way better than Roller Coaster Tycoon World. This game is definitly worth your mony if you enjoy games like this!","May 30","true","3.8"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
