"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedwarrior/recommended/229890/","icedwarrior","icedwarrior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icedwarrior/","607 products in account","This game is a lot of fun. Think Excitebike, in terms of how it plays. Basically, you’re attempting to reach the finish line, while racking up as much points as you can, and completing as many objectives as you can. Because there’s three lanes on (almost) every track, there’s always an objective or two (or more) that you can’t get in one go, so there’s always an incentive to go back and replay the level. Perhaps I never sat down and studied the moves, but it does feel like you can just mash buttons and get a really good high score, so I don’t like that necessarily, but on the other hand, it is a good game to mess around with. The game includes a level editor that you can create your own tracks with, but I didn’t get to mess around with it too much. The one thing that I will say that’s negative about the game is that there’s a certain track that comes out of nowhere and is just down right infuriating; it took me hours and hours to beat. Still, I would recommend this game, and while I haven’t played the second game, there’s a bundle that includes Joe Danger 2 for very little extra. Something to consider.","January 1, 2014","true","7.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I  read some reviews and watched the gameplay videos and figured that the game would be appropriate for a 6 year old. While the game is more than satisfactory for my son it is also hours upon hours of fun for myself. I play a lot of FPS, flight sim, and TF2. Most of these games have excellent gameplay with great graphics  and serious story lines. This game was a fun and lighthearted change of pace. I have had fun playing maps over and over finishing level accomplisments and laughing at the cartoon daredevil crashes. The graphics are fantastic cartoon graphics, the controls are easy to learn and with a control that fits his hands my son easily plays this game accomplishing levels and stringing together combos of stunts. This game belongs in the library of anyone young or old that plays games because everyone wants to have some relaxing fun occasionally. The levels are chanllenging enough to be interesting without it being too hard for a child to play or too easy for an adult to enjoy. Excellent game.","July 3, 2014","true","5.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/229890/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Joe Danger reminds me of the NES days of Excitebike, mixed with the modern Stuntman series.  It's a simple lighthearted game that follows Joe Danger through his stuntman career with levels slowly increasing in difficulty.  At its core it's a simple game: Drive through courses gaining score by doing tricks and completing objectives.  The game throws a lot of obstacles at you however, and it can be quite a challenge completing all of the objectives without crashing and while maintaining your score multiplier.\n\nThe game is a ton of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Excitebike or Stuntman, or just anyone who likes a challenge.","February 24, 2014","true","11.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
