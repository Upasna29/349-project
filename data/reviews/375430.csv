So, for me, it was definitely worth the $0.50-$1.00 to pick this up. It's a quite unique turn-based JRPG with some neat gimmics that set it apart from your standard RPGmaker fare.\n\nThe dialogue is witty and intelligent, at least from what I've seen so far. The combat system goes in the same vein, using a system of "Pathos, Ethos, and Logos" to use logic and reasoning to beat your opponents instead of violence. You attack their willpower instead of their "HP." It's a neat way to ease up on the monotony of many JRPGs. In the end, though, you're still hitting enemies for number amounts of "damage," the only difference being in the form of what you call the damage (e.g., willpower damage via argumentation).\n\nSo it may be worth picking up for you. I haven't got very far in it, obviously, but I wanted to give this game some love due to the fact that it had no reviews before this one. Worth $10? That's up to you. Probably worth it on sale and definitely in a bundle.\n\n6.3/10?","October 12, 2015","true","7.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I can say a few bad ones. Some of the puzzles might be a bit much, and a lot of the character protraits are flat-out ugly. The story is fascinating, though. Excellent worldbuilding. Frequent hilarity in characters being snarky to one another. Buy this game. Ignore bad reviews.","February 16","true","44.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player still get stuck with one of the most boring variations of combat mechanics that remain unchanged for far too long.\n\nOtherwise, this game suffers from things that plague most JRPGs, especially cheap indie ones: bad controls, a lot of unnecessary walking (this time, without a chance of random encounter even), boring equipment, lack of dialogue trees,\n\nI expected this to be more like "Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher" - which is the game you should try instead, if you're looking for really interesting "word-based" battles. As it is, I cannot recommend this game, even though dialogues and story are somewhat above-level for a genre cursed with endless stories about magical schoolboys/girls.","April 19","false","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geek2theright/recommended/375430/","geek2theright","Geek2theRight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geek2theright/","340 products in account","I honestly can't recommend this highly enough. Between the original premise, non-stock art assets and music, creative puzzles, better-than-average writing, competent dungeon design, and a decent chunk of optional content . . . this game is good. Really, really good.\n\nThe basic premise is that you finalize contracts for a company with people who can make permanent structures in the shared dreamscape that the people of this world visit in their sleep. Most things people create while sleeping vanish, but logomancers can create things that last, and other people can experience those things in their sleep, etc. So it's a skill in high demand. Anyway, you can do the bare minimum -- meet the local logomancer, "test out" his latest dreamscape creation, get him to sign the contract, and then leave town. 2 or 3 hours, ending triggered, game over.\n\nOr . . . you could visit the other townspeople, assist them with a number of side quests, visit other areas of the local dreamscape. As you do so, you'll occasionally come across various bits of weirdness that hint at a greater mystery. Needless to say, most of the optional content(to get the "true ending") ties into this mystery, which you can in fact solve. And once you've done that, there's even a little bit of post-game content that gives you just a bit more information if you can beat its super bosses. The game took me about 23 hours to finish in its entirety(minus 1 super boss), so I'd guess there's at least 15 to 20 hours of content for most people.\n\nAs far as I can tell, no stock assets were used in this game. From the tiles to the sprites to the music, it's all unique. I'm not going to lie -- body proportions are weird, the colors can be very vivid and jarring, but . . . you can tell it was all done by the same person, so there's a consistency. Love it or hate it, you have to admire that someone went through the trouble of making their own stuff instead of using the RPG Maker stock art. And personally, I thought it all worked together really well once I got used to the style.\n\nThe battle system has some neat things going for it. Under the surface, it's pretty much what we're used to. Elemental and non-elemental attacks/defenses, health, magic points, various status effects, and the such. However, it's the trappings that make it so special! Instead of regular battles, you have conversations or debates. Your opponents in the waking world are other people, and in the dreamscape the foes take the form of abstract concepts, logical errors, grammatical errors, and the such. The 3 basic elements are ethos(ethical thinking), logos(rational thinking), and pathos(angry/emotional thinking), and manipulating and taking advantage of those states in order to do the most "damage" makes up the basic layer of combat, and you gain access to a number of skills as you level up(or learn from books) that mix this up. I love that this game lets me drop ethical opponents with a Modus Ponens argument. That's just a bit of magic right there.\n\nNot going to lie. There are some flaws. Getting some of the items necessary for the "true ending" and the post-game content can be kind of maddening. Even if you pay careful attention to everything that's said or every note you read, stumbling across some of it seems to be just dumb luck. There are a couple walls you can walk through that I'm not sure how you're expected to find them; I got lucky and just stumbled on them, but I read that other people had a lot of trouble with them. And one of the superbosses is hiding in plain sight with nothing to indicate that you're about to fight something huge; nothing tips you off that it's not a normal enemy fight until it's too late, and you have to beat it and get its item drop in order to do the post-game content. And the water spine cave puzzle is just horrible -- I Googled the solution, and even seeing the explanations(it's a base-5 counting thing) didn't help; the picture you're supposed to decode to get the solution still makes no sense to me.\n\nAlso, another interesting thing just to illustrate how much work went into this -- you can't really sequence break. For example, there's a "find the journal" side quest at one point. You can talk to A, then B, then go to X, read D, then go to Y and solve puzzle Z to find the journal. Or . . . you can go straight to the puzzle, get the journal, and return it to A without breaking anything at all. And that's just one example. This game really encourages you to explore, and it doesn't punish you(except perhaps by you running into enemies you're not strong enough for yet) for doing so. Go ahead. Do some things out of the normal order. The game can take it. Sometimes doing things in the "wrong" order gets you slightly different dialogue, too. For another example, there is a little time at the beginning of the game when you only have 2 party members. The 3rd joins you very soon if you follow the main story path, but you can wander around and do a number of things before getting her to join you, and the dialogue will be a little different than if you'd had her in your party while doing those same things.\n\nAll things considered, I give it a solid 8 out of 10. It could have been darn near perfect, but a couple non-game-breaking bugs and the obtuseness of certain things I mentioned above take their toll. Still, all in all, a highly recommended experience.","May 22","true","23.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
