You deserve better, Mr. Discerning Steam Customer. Here's the real ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis game isn't good. People enjoy quirky, gimmicky games like Goat Simulator and I Am Bread because there's something substantial and replayable behind the silly premise. You buy, let's say Surgeon Simulator, because hahaha that's not how you do a heart transplant, but you keep coming back because you're getting the hang of manually controlling your hand and manipulating your tools, and you begin to do it more for the fun and challenge of it than the joke. Above all, you keep coming back.\n\nOn the other hand, underneath the skin of Dog Sim is a bunch of tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You have, I kid you not, like five meters to keep track of. You need to babysit these meters constantly. When your food or water meter depletes, your actual, time-until-you-die health meter begins to slowly tick down, and I could not find a way to restore that for the life of me. Unfortunately, your sleep meter decreases every time you eat or drink to increase those meters (or do anything else), and depletion of the sleep meter causes you to pass out for several seconds, during which you may be robbed of all of your dog money by a passing raccoon, or killed instantly by a car if (God forbid) you passed out on a highway. This may sound pedantic given how much the developers stress that lives in this game are fleeting and easily lost, but there is progression here. You don't want to die while you're playing an arcade game or sussing out an easter egg, right? You end up so busy monitoring your health that you don't have any time to actually explore, so what's the point in trying?\n\nIn conclusion, savee that $4 and get yourself a little extra bacon on that next burger instead. Oh sorry, what I meant to say was LOL I PEED ON A FIRE HYDRANT AND GOT RUN OVER 11/10 GOTY. I ATE CHOCOLATE AND POOPED ON A HYDRANT AND THE POOP EXPLODED 5/5 MMM I LOVE WACKY JOKE.

I usually suck at distinguishing pewdiebait from real games, but this game is not very interesting when you start playing it. It's more like having to do chores as a dog. Boring as hell. Sure, there are some fun dogs, but as soon as it dies it's gone and you will have to hope for something that doesn't suck as much. It seems alright at first, but soon you will start to notice that within every 5 seconds you have to fix one of the bars that's down to red. You will have to eat, sleep and poop so frequently you start wondering if this dog has any sense of time. Thanks to the lack of explanation you are also left in the dark as to what you should do to fix something, how to keep on sleeping until the bar is full (It interrupts at irregular intervals) and how much food you actually have. You will also notice a vicious cycle of I have no food -> I have no money to buy food -> I dig for money -> I need more food but I have no food -> I have no money to buy food and so on and so on and so on. The game contains some fun easter eggs here and there but without a real goal and seemingly effectless shops the game will bore you before you even started to like it. It's cheap, so if you really need to kill some time you might want this, but you're better off doing almost anything else.","April 10, 2015","false","1.1"," 837 of 1,008 people (83%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","83","837","1","62","32"

The game was developed by Surreal Distractions who maybe, just maybe, were inspired by another slightly related anti-game? But before I start to review this game, I would like to say that I am appreciative that I was able to have been given this game and though it may not overly appeal to me, some of you may genuinely enjoy it.\n\nOnce you have hatched from your egg, you'll be wondering what the hell you are supposed to actually do. On the store page it does give a slight suggestion: Play, eat, drink, and sleep, remember to take care of yourself!\n\nBut your first experience will be something more like this: Play, eat, drink, and sleep, remember to take care of yourself! -♥♥♥♥, oh sorry, urinate on everything.\n\nOnce you have gotten bored from excreting your bodily fluids and getting hit by cars, you might like to try playing with a ball. Yep, that was fun for about 2 seconds. You are able to customise your house in this game and your dog which may appeal to you, but other than that all you can really do in the game is summed up in the "joke reviews" which are actually entirely serious. Here are a couple:\n\nOriginally posted by (CHOPPAH) frankly:Recommended\n0.1 hrs on record\nPosted: 14 September\nI spent 10 minutes peeing on everything, got confused, and turned the game off. 10/10 would recommend.\nOriginally posted by Sticky Nut Juice:Recommended\n0.6 hrs on record\nPosted: 21 September\nI pee'd on some stuff, got fleas, and played arcade games fun for a an hour or two\nThe pixel graphics are very colourful and may be appealing for some to look at. Recieving a new dog with green hair and black lines across it is always interesting to see. Even though the game lacks in most other areas, it does give a certain seductive charm with its vibrant appearance.\n\nA question I asked myself when playing was, is it funny? You can urinate on almost everything and even eat your own poop, but that slight chuckle in your mind tends to wear off after the first 10 minutes of playing.\n\nThere is some music in the game. It's quite emotionally gripping. Not really, it actually gets quite droning after a while but atleast it's not completely silent.\n\nEntertainment-As you will have probably gotten the impression from my points before, the game isn't overly entertaining and really doesn't entice me to go and play it some more. It is repetitive and is the type of game that you would only drop in to play for 2 minutes.\n\n\nSummary\nPros\n+Is enjoyable to discover the different things for the first time\n+Customisation of your dog/house\n+Trading cards\n+Graphics\n\nNeutral\n+/-Music is okay, but tends to drone on a bit\n\nCons\n-After discovering most of the features of the game it becomes quite repetitive\n-Doesn't give you any sort of direction or objective (no tutorial)\n-The humour wears off after 10 minutes\n-Isn't very entertaining\n\nConclusion\nDomestic Dog Simulator was certainly not the worst game I have ever played. There are plenty of games worse than this that exceed $3 and get up to $50+. This game will not be enjoyed by everyone, but if you do think that you would actually enjoy this game then maybe get it on sale and see what you think.\n\n5.5/10\n\nLiked that review? I have others!","October 24, 2015","false","1.4"," 39 of 58 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","39","58","2","0"

My story is my rise and downfall. You see one time when walking I got fleas from a tree, it took me awhile before I realized I had them and eventually went to the vet. After this, I continued my life as normal, until I got hit by a car(this would be the first of many) and was flown to the vet before waking up feeling almost deprived of life, having to spend a couple of days to recover. It wasn't that bad though. Afterwards I started thinking a bit about finding a mate.\n\nAnd just so happened one time after working I saw a possible mate and proceeded with some compliments[i.imgur.com]. It didn't go well. I continued trying for a bit, but just about every time it ended up the same way[fc00.deviantart.net], starting to just make me apathetic as time went on..\n\nSo I got back to what I was normally doing, I went outside planning on going to the work of digging holes. But then I noticed a machine, it said chocolate or something, that whole day was a blur. But I bought it because I was just curious, and even if it did kill me it's not like I cared too much. After working the majority of the day my stomach felt odd, so I went to the bathroom as I usually do near a fire-hydrant, and after walking away, I hear a boom, turning around quickly to assess the situation. Apparently my ♥♥♥♥ had exploded, water going everywhere as the fire hydrant was destroyed. I started thinking momentarily and got a devilish smile. I was going to get revenge on the damned cars and their drivers for all the times they hit us. So I spent all of my money on the chocolate machine, and set my presents in the street, waiting. And then it happened, it started exploding as cars were destroyed among crashing from the various explosions. I kept this up, crashing multiple cars. I was in the middle of my spree when I go to set another trap, I set one down, and as the minute I try to escape from the street, I get hit by car going much faster, I was sure it was going to kill me as the first car I was ever hit by was moving much slower. I woke up in a hospital bed. Apparently they assumed I was another victim, I made it back home before I just started recovering, taking in what I had done. It took me a while before I came to my senses, this isn't what I want, none of this senseless violence and bloodshed. So I vowed not to do this again unless I had a very good reason, only to protect someone or myself.\n\nI would continue living my life for another year or so, having been in another two accidents from being hit by cars and having to recover, but things started getting a bit boring. Even after buying myself some new things from the stores[i1.kym-cdn.com]. I found out about grilling meat though as there was a grill and a machine that sold frozen meat, damn, the food was good[fc04.deviantart.net].\n\nI kept living as things started getting more boring, but then I heard about some mystery involving the woof woods. Apparently some people say there's a strange phenomenon going over there about flowers and something about seeing strange lights in the sky deep within the forest. Best to check it out. So I went there, saw the flowers and started sniffing them, nothing odd about them, nor claimed territory yet. So I claimed it, but then I found out some flowers I couldn't claim as my own, but then I realized they were leading me somewhere, almost sort of like an arrow, so I followed the direction, coming across another patch, did the same thing, another direction, I kept doing this until I started to get hungry, so I came back another day, eventually keeping this up. This was getting creepy[blog.sfgate.com]. Eventually, I came across it, a light, a box illuminating, I sniffed it, it glowed brighter. I woke up in my house, there being a flying frisbee next to me. It's a fun toy, glad I got it. Apparently it's also alien technology, I solved the mystery, and I got a prize for it. I felt accomplished.[lh3.googleusercontent.com]\n\nA couple of days later I found a cemetery, wasn't really sure why the territory wasn't marked, so I started marking it, then like the flowers in the woof woods, I came across a gravestone that I couldn't mark. It had the markings "B5" on it. I wasn't really sure what this meant, as expressed when I said outloud, "What is that supposed to mean?!", however when I said that, apparently it started moving, I jumped a bit at first, but then it revealed a path, and I went down, it was pretty scary down there, so I bailed as soon as I got in.\n\nNot too much else happened for awhile, and then I started getting sick of paying for the food I bought that would somes be worth more than one day's amount of work. I started to feel this wasn't that fair, not to me and probably not to a couple of others, so I made a plan, I would steal food, because paying for it was just getting old, having to hope that one day's work was enough to get me food, sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn't, it was a bit of a gamble occasionally, possibly because of my buying habits, didn't matter too much to me, so I figured out where the food was being made, and started making attempts to get in, first starting with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the power boxes outside, that didn't work, then tried the chocolate traps on the main door, same result, I kept investigating for a couple of days, and one night I found the door open, so I went in, I found lasers and electric floor panels, but I knew the food was back there. I started moving through the traps.\n\nFirst laser, first floor panel, second laser. Then I felt really tired, I didn't realize that I wasn't sleeping much during my investigating, I should have slept more. Oh well, no turning back, I'll have to power through it. So moved myself through more traps, felt more tired, more traps, fell asleep again momentarily in front of a laser and quickly got myself forward before it turned back on again. Then I made it to the barrels of food. Time to get them out. I got them on their side and rolled them onto an electrical panel, waited for it to turn off and started pushing them again. Last thing I remember is the barrel being very comfortable and closing my eyes for a moment. I had woke up in a hospital bed, I was broke, I was tired, I was hungry. I had to get up and head home, I can try again once I get there. But there was the street. And I started crossing it. Slowly, weakly, then I heard it, I turned my head to see a car speeding towards me. I knew this was it, I'm too weak for my body to take a hit like the one coming up, but by the time I thought that it was already so close. I closed my eyes...\n\n"You either die a good boy, or live long enough to see yourself become the bad dog." ~ Anonymous[memestorage.com]","April 30, 2015","true","1.6"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","72","26","36","18","1"

They have a place, just like any other game. Critique like "They just want a quick cash grab!" makes me laugh. You don't think the major triple A title companies wanna make money? You think the goal is to simply entertain people and go out of business?\n\nThis is an indie title, on a sale it costs next to nothing. For that you get a laugh or two, and a short, simple game. It functions (least in the current state I've played it), and I don't see any indication anywhere on it's store page that it is trying to sell consumers something it is not, or lie to consumers. Then it's allright to be whatever you are as a game, and some will enjoy it and others will not. If there's a chance you don't find these types of silly games amusing, then you should perhaps stay clear.\n\nSome bigger and smaller titles have lied straight in the face of fans and gamers about what they are. That I can not stand. Okay, it may not be straight up lying or illegal, but to show contents at conventons that don't appear in the final product, to not have people try out a certain mode before release date because they know it doesn't function properly but they don't have the time or means to fix it in time. This constant rushing out titles for deadlines instead of actually making the game properly. Game breaking bugs is more of a rule than an exception now, because they will be patched in time so it's fine, right? No, the point is still you can't play the game on release date, so why start selling it then? Why not start selling it once it's actually finished? The bargain bins are overflowing with halfmade games, some of which had great potentials.\n\nI rather have a functional little game that is what it is, and don't cost more than it is worth, than the exact opposite.\n\nThis is a silly little game, and it made me smile. And from what I've seen from the forums the devs try to adress issues and answer questions, which means there's a communication there and a will to please gamers.

Where does one begin about this game? First off let me say some stuff you have a 69% chance of finding helpfull. So i was gifted this by a good friend who likes domestic dogs and simulations. Coming across this game must have been amazing. Being the selfless guy he is he thaught better of spending his money to play it himself but instead bought it for me. Now lets talk about the core game. Domestic dog simulator is the latest in doge technology with a thrilling backstory and interesting characters. You play as a dog whose life is turned upside down when he realises he has nothing to do. You must find things for him to do and earn points. I cant really stress just how great this game can be at times. I would not be suprised if the story line was written by Vince gilligan or someone equally skilled because the acting immersed me into a world of domestic dogs which is what i was looking for. There is but one con which is the multiplayer. In a boring lesson i fantasize about being a domestic dog and running around with other domestic dogs. I know the AI are so advanced you could call them actual people but I would still pay for a multiplayer on domestic dogs just so i could fulfill my fantasies and actually learn stuff in lessons. Now if you have looked at other reviews like on IGN them please dont be fooled by the 7.5/10 "too much doges" because it is criminal to give a game with such a high quality a 7.5 out of 10. I myself must give this game a 9.69/10. "not enough doges". I spent a good 3000 hours on this game but because the gameplay was so fresh it broke my hard drive so i had to get a new one and redo my campaign to doggy stardom. This is why it says i have only played for 5 minutes. You will love this game if you want to be a dog or love dogs. Also for under £4 i really do recommend it. I would like to thank my friend Marcus for buying me this game and i would like to thank the devs for creating such a wonderful game. Not many people can make you so emotionally attached to a virtual life but SPOILERS when my dog got run over i....*sigh* i hadnt just lost a life.. I had lost  a friend.","April 13, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/340340/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Video games have a long history with capitalism. We’re used to scavenging garbage and loot for the merchant in town, playing our part in the endless recycling of items into cash which usually serves as the point for which the rest of the game rotates (especially if it happens to have a strong multiplayer focus). Sometimes we take up the role of the vender ourselves, be it in a higher management position (most city building sims) or direct transactions (Recettear), building our own economy by exploiting the nondescript customers who seem to exist solely to patronize our shop. There isn't anything particularly novel then about a game hinged around mass consumerism, but where Domestic Dog Simulator fails most is in masking or even pretending to recognize the economic loops providing it a skeleton of purpose, or hav ing anything interesting to say or do with them.\n\nYou might imagine a game with as bland and direct a title as Domestic Dog Simulator would at the least be what it says on the tin, but aside from allowing you to take part in a handful of stereotypically doggy things (ie. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on everything) there isn’t much that seems designed to imitate canine life. Maybe that’s because you aren’t actually playing as a dog, instead being presented with an egg which then hatches into disturbing robotic and Lovecraftian abominations, as if they were meant to encompass the entire animal kingdom by pulling bits and pieces from species that should never be mixed.\n\nAnd then you’re let loose into a town of shops and minor distractions. What exactly you’re meant to do from this point on is difficult to discern, but judging by the price tags affixed to every wall and object it seems clear you’ve been dropped into something of a consumer’s paradise. There are so many TVs upon which nothing plays, so many bizarre pieces of art to hang in your empty home. Vending machines sit on every corner ready to dispense a beverage at the push of a button, or perhaps you’d prefer the unmanned cafe, coffees waiting for you on the counter.\n\nThere is so much random stuff to buy in Domestic Dog Simulator, which is especially odd given there isn’t any clear way to make money to purchase any of it. Eventually I stumbled upon a random lot behind my house with a convenient sign telling me to “dig”, so obediently I began scratching at the ground and was soon rewarded with a bundle of cash that had inexplicably been buried here. “Good” the game seemed to be saying to me, “now run off to one of the shops and pick out something nice.”\n\nThis, it would seem, was the life I was intended to live. One of physical labor feeding into a desire to buy things I could do nothing with. There’s no real economy in Domestic Dog Simulator, you simply exist to consume, with the menial tasks required to obtain anything attempting to disguise how hideously pointless everything is. Perhaps then this could have served to illustrate the imaginary meaning used to justify unchecked consumption, but there is no attempt at critique, no commentary on the dangers of systemic capitalistic control or even a hint that the developer recognized what they were making. It just gives the player what it thinks they want, no frills attached, with a giant billboard of the developer’s other game, Squirreltopia, being the closest it comes to actually saying something about the world it has created. I suppose it still gets the last laugh though from everyone who bought it.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 3, 2015","false","1.6"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","51","21","41","8","3"

The thought of it brings me to tears of joy.  From now on, call me Rover. I have always wanted to be a Jack Russell Terrier with a brown spot on my left eye with the rest of me an off-white color. I plan to have surgery to remove my knee caps and to have hair implanted into my skin along with a nose job and bigger ears. My vocal cords will be altered to a higher pitch and only able to produce barks and whines. I love fire hydrants and smelling a$$holes, so this should be a good fit for me. Sadly, my dream ended early when I was hit by a car chasing a frolicking little French poodle across the street. It could have been the fleas, it could have been exhaustion, or it could have been a ton of metal heading 45 mph down the street that killed me. Either way, I lived my dream and dug holes to my heart's content. The only regret was eating my poop for the fifth time and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a butterfly, killing it.","April 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 32 of 65 people (49%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","49","32","65","47","0"

As the egg.\nThen, we start playig. We need to eat, ♥♥♥♥, poop and do a lot of things to keep alive :)\neverything we can do as a dog and there are really good things, some little challenges, and some violent and frustrating deaths,\nsometimes bringing me close to heart attack.\nIt's not easy to play for about 1 hour, reach level 4, and then die from one car hit.\nIn this game we can do EVERYTHING as the dogs from REAL LIFE.\nThere are not a big list of things they do in RL.\nThey poop, pee on EVERYTHING, break stuff, bark for no reason, eat some ugly poop and chase squirrels.\nThis game is actually funny and pretty short in terms of getting 100% of achievements.\nWe also have some cool animals except dogs in this game.\nThere are some ninja turtles, rabbits, raccoons, pigs and sheeps...\n♥♥♥♥ ON THEM TO SHOW DOMINANCE ! I also love the idea of unique "POOP EXPLOSIVE".\nWe can even destroy a car with it :D\nThere is also some hidden places, if u don't wanna get bored by searching it, just google about it like a normal man (y) !\nAlso, we can dig and find money/bones/meat.. :D\nCooool thing is that we have an ATM Card, so we can store our money.\nVets are pretty cool. I was afraid of them, but now when they removed my fleas i like them <3 <3\nOk, this got a little weird, right doc?\nAnd yes, here i go. We can ROB !!\nYES ! We can rob warehouse !\nI just don't know will my dog rob me, i hope he wont.. Damn, this game is sooo strange. Ghosts,Robs,Stuff Breaking..\nI'm done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##### PRO'S : ##### 1. I like the idea of "DOG GHOSTS". We can find them in the church/cementry area, north of our house.\n2. Ninja turtles,rabbits, raccoons, sheps , pigs and few more, is the animals we can find in this game.\n3. Unique idea of ATM Cards.\n4. POOP Explosive. I think i never heard about it before this game..\n5. Game is short in terms of getting 100% of achievements.\n6. Unique idea of randomly spawn as ALIEN DOG and evenn recieve achievement for that. Yes, ALIEN DOG we can spawn as is "Houndeye" from the game Half-Life 2.\n\n\n\n##### CON'S : ##### 1. We cannot save game and our original dog.\n2. It's really too cheap.\n\n\n\nTRUST ME, THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIMAL SIMULATOR GAMES","May 2","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I did enjoy it for a couple of hours, so that may very well be worth the $3 to many people. It has charm, and it's amusing, and I liked the mini-games - but the primary problem was there there simply was not enough content. After an hour or two, you will have done pretty much everything. Any time further spent will either be just goofing around, or chasing pointless and grindy achievements.

Domestic Dog Simulator is just that, a dog simulator. You are spawned in the map and you can go around and do doggy activities like ♥♥♥♥ on everything you see, dig holes and play arcade games. The game is as crazy as it sounds but the game is really bad. The game is played like a classic NES game where you can walk around and try to find treasures. You can use the money you find to decorate your house and stuff like that. The game gets incredibly boring incredibly fast as there is not much stuff to do. The game is also really buggy. Animals glitch through walls, the controls sometimes don't work and stuff like that. The music is really bad, and there's not a lot to do. Overall there's is not much to say about Domestic Dog Simulator. It's just a bad game. Only get this game on a heavy sale or just skip it entirely. I give Domestic Dog Simulator a 3/10","June 4, 2015","false","2.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The game's charm revolves around its alien way of interpreting what a dog is, much like Goat Simulator does with its titular Goat. "DOGS POOP TO LEVEL UP," says the alien being who has constructed this simulator. "DOGS WAGE WARS WITH CARS BY EATING CHOCOLATE AND TAKING EXPLOSIVE DUMPS ON THE ROAD. DOGS ALSO SMOKE WEED BY EXTRACTING THE POPPY SEEDS FROM THE DOGNIP PLANTS. DOGS ALSO DIG HOLES IN THE GROUND TO MAKE DOG DOLLARS, WHICH DOGS USE TO BUY FLAT SCREEN TVs."\n\nAll of that is fun, however I am not so sure that the RPG elements mesh well with the dog simulator element of the game.\nHalf the time I didn't know what the hell the UI was trying to tell me. When the poop bar is full, do I need to poop? Or is that when the poop bar is empty? What is the dog face all about? (It turns out it's a dog happiness meter, something I could easily replenish by playing an arcade game.) It has a very lovely retro look and feel, but I think it needs to explain itself better.\n\nI got approximately an hour's worth of fun out of this game, but I didn't find myself wanting to come back to it after that, much like Goat Simulator lasting around four hours before I abandoned it. If you're the pedantic sort who likes making charts in Excel comparing the amount of money vs. the amount of time, I think three bucks for an hour's worth of whatever the hell this is is a fine deal.\n\n(This game was purchased and gifted by Lemon. Lemon is a fine man who runs The F Plus podcast[thefpl.us], a podcast which I am on. He is also the co-creator of a game called The Wrongest Words, where players are given horrid things to defend in front of their friends and family!

Half-joking, but hey, dogs gotta do what dogs gotta do!  I wish there was in-game help or a tutorial system that explained things the first time around. Not sure what to do with bones I dig up. Not sure what to do with meat that I grilled. I can't seem to eat or chew them, just kick them around... but regardless it's a fun little game when you just want some quick goof off time.  I paid two dollars for it and already got my money's worth just exploring the game mechanics.  If you like inexpensive games with humor, this spoof on a dog's life is for you.

There's an EKG beside your stats that will fluctuate - will beep when you're in mortal danger.\nAt times the controls that require tap-tap-tapping of WASD can put you in danger when you wouldn't think you should be (lasers in the warehouse have a much bigger hit radius than it'd seem) - standard complaint with most of those pixel-side-scrolling-things.\nOnce you've make made the rounds a few times, the world suddenly feels empty.\nThere are no sound options and the windowed mode is laughable (requires a magnifying glass).\n\nI enjoy playing DDS (thus far - unsure of how long that'll last), so I record this as a Positive Recommendation. I implore potential buyers to read the negative reviews; seems the positive reviews are full of headache-inducing "jokes" - the negative reviews (other'n the raging ones) are much more relevant to those who want to know what's what.\n\nDomestic Dog Simulator IS another one of "those" "Simulator" games, but it's acceptable, (>)decent(?) even.","April 11, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's rather bizarre I suppose but I had a lot of fun with it.  You can dig up holes in various spots to get money (or herd animals to certain spots but digging seemed faster).  That money is used for food, toys, house decorations, new collars, or whatever is in the stores.  They are quite a few secret areas to discover (I was lazy and used a guide) and some mini arcade games to play (Dogger - a dog frogger, Dig Dog - a dog boulderdash, and a few others).\n\nSo yeah...there isn't any real overarching goal to the game but just have fun ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on things, barking at other dogs or animals, digging up holes, laying down explosive poop (after eating chocolate)...you know, just being a dog. ;)  The soundtrack is sorta 8-bitish which fits the graphic style of the game and definiting digging (har har) some of the tracks found ingame.\n\nI picked it up from a Groupees bundle so I didn't pay anywhere near what it's priced at, but I've enjoyed it regardless for the short time I've spent on it.

Blow up cars with chocolate-fueled poops. Steal from a dog food company.\n\nIt is challenging in the least mind-boggling way possible; it's addictive to try to get all of the achievements. The pixel art is charming. Peeing on other dogs to cure fleas is probably my favourite thing in the world at the moment.\n\nWith no real end to the game, however, it can get kind of boring once the achievements are all reached.
