"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theatrum/recommended/351870/","theatrum","Chrispea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theatrum/","673 products in account","I loved this game as a kid and can happily say this release works perfectly. It supports modern HD resolutions (up to 1080) and I had no problem running the game. The fps is still low which is understandable for a 2D game but it means window scrolling is a little janky.\n\nThe game itself is a commodity based city builder that focuses on population and resource management over combat. It's unique from other games I've played like that because you control the lives of individual people, tell someone to become a farmer and they will, then promote them to a miller, then to baker, or send them to school so they can learn to be a tailor or a brewer. This is central to the games mechanics. It's The Sims crossed with Anno or Age of Empires and although it's not quite as strategic as AeO I can remember sinking 60+ hours into single levels just because it's so fun bulding and running your colony. It could have some more depth but I enjoy it a lot.\n\n------BUG FIX------\nIf you're getting bugs while trying to play the game you can download a program called DXWnd found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/\n\nAs I said in my review, I haven't had any troubles so haven't done this personally but people who have told me this worked for them. I have used this method on other games so I trust it.\n\n- After extracting the file run the 'dxwnd' .exe\n- A little blank window will open, select the 'edit' menu and click 'add'\n- A window with a bunch of options and tabs will open, fill them out as follows:\n- "NAME:" = 8th Wonder(can be anything you like)\n- "PATH:" = C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Cultures 8th Wonder\Game.exe\nNote: you may have the game installed at a different location eg. "Program Files (x86)"\nThat's it, Hit OK and you should see '8th Wonder' appear as an option from the window that was blank before.\n- Select it and go >edit>run and the game will run smoothly\nYou will have to launch the game using this program or have DXWnd open when launching it from steam every time.\n\nDXWnd is a hook program that you can use to get a lot of old games running smoothly on new systems. I didn't create DXWnd. Sourceforge.net is a trustworthy site for developers and you can get more support from the guy who made the program there if you need it.\n\n\nAs I said, I haven't had to use this fix myself so if you find any settings in dxwnd that improve performance even more let me know in a comment below and I'll add it.","March 28, 2015","true","0.2"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","55","62","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdoggaman/recommended/351870/","sdoggaman","Catastrophically returned online","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdoggaman/","58 products in account","This game has been one of my favourite ever since I played it at about age 7 on disk on my mum's iMac G3. In the days after I could no longer play it, I would even read the manual and look at the pictures. Ever since then i've been dying to play it again, and I had just managed to find a port last year that was relatively buggy. Then, yesterday, I found Age of Wonders III on steam and I thought, if that's on steam, why not 8th Wonder? So on a whim I searched for it and found it - under "Cultures". Then it made sense - it was released as part of the cultures series! I had found it! And it was only 5 bucks, which I happened to have on my wallet!\nI love everything about this game - the pace, the cuteness, the characters, the little quirks and surprisingly advanced bits, and the nostalgia of my childhood. This game (Along with Descent II) defined a few years of my life.\n\nGameplay is great, bugs are minimal - Just a bit of a problem with the resolution settings. Start keying the game on sime higher resolutions can force the across width into a wacky frame size and colour (it basically squashes the game into the left side of the screen and you either have to restart the game or change the resolution settings)\nEverything is included - audio soundtracks (Which I never had on my disk copy!) and all.\n\n10/10 would assign a civilian as an extractor of quarrystone again.\n10/10 would send Bajarni into a fight and risk loosing the whole mission.\n10/10 would DRAGONS, OH MY GOD THE DRAGONS\n10/10, love this game.\n\nNow I want to see Markiplier play it... :D","July 31, 2015","true","14.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

I'm so glad there's now a legitimate way to get Northland and 8th Wonder in Australia because they were never released here. I played 8th Wonder last night and got sucked into it again for 3+ hours. The games are sort of a mix between age of empires, the sims, banished and anno. There's production lines but everything is a little more personal as you have to sort of micromanage the Vikings, including telling them to get married, assigning them jobs and dwellings and telling them to have children etc. Unlike Anno there is a little bit of fighting with several types of 'soldiers' etc but I tend to play on Free Play and just focus on building big civilizations. I still like the graphics style now and the music/sounds aren't too bad either. Overall still love the games and look forward to playing more!","March 31, 2015","true","3.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","3"

The Cultures series is one of my absolute favorites and I still hold out hope for another; a modern game. Nothing has really changed about the game except the resolutions supported, and maybe the music quality, but I'm not sure about that one. I've sought games similar to Cultures and have never found anything that I have felt quite the same about. It is a great series, pure and simple.\n\nMy only real disappointment is that FUNimation has STILL not publicly released the REAL scenario editor. The one that comes with the game is extremely limited in function and has always been that way. I really don't know the reason why some people are allowed to have it and the rest get the dumbed-down version. It's been over a decade since this game was released! Why don't we get to breathe new life into it?\n\nCultures will remain an important part of my gaming history; it is the series that piqued my interest in RTS/Strategy/Economic games. Managing my economy and trade were my favorite activities, and are important functions that I look for now.\n\nThis game is worth far more to me than $5, and I'm really grateful that 2 of the games landed here on Steam.","May 22, 2015","true","1.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

You create a villager, and that's it. That guy goes to collecting food, maybe farming, or maybe mines gold, but he's your average villager guy at his best.\n\nBut Cultures takes a way different approach. You want to create a villager? You don't create him, you have to be born him! And same way, as that guy is born, he grows up, and becomes a "Civilian", and then, you're free to do what your heart desires with him.\nBut of course, even that desire is limited. Say, you want him to be a potter? Now that's possible, assuming you had some clay extractor somewhere and he is skilled enough to be a potter. Or maybe you already have another potter. Then you can train him at a school, otherwise, you need to make him go through the dirty work too. Clay extracting, I mean.\nAs the game says, "every Viking is unique!". Every of them has different skills, and your Vikings will become even proficient in their, well, "proficiences", as they work or fight.\nThe game also has a nice combat system if you ask me, it is not bulk "spam soldiers and go fight", but you can also work wonders with a few soldiers fully equipped with longswords, plate armours and a few amulets on them.\nBuilding a village is way fun tho, it might get a bit repetive, but that speed-up button serves that purpose quite well if you ask me.\n\nIf you like strategy games, but bored of usual way the things go, you should try Cultures. It is some different approach out here, and hell, it is very cheap here on Steam!\n\n...I wish they had implemented the Steam client to the game tho, oh well! It is still some nice bargain here.","June 23, 2015","true","37.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

It's a combination between town building, real time strategy, RPG, micro-managing and economy managing. I've played every game of the series for over 100 hours. While 8th Wonder of the World is technically just a small upgrade from Cultures 2 and Northland, it's definitally worth the try.\n\nAnd if you feel like the game could use more maps, there is a Scenario Editor included and you can find hundreds of user made maps on the internet. :D","June 18, 2015","true","12.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Having been out of gaming for a while, I had missed the release of Cultures 3 and 4.\nThe only drawback is that the game doesn't enable the player to play any of the other cultures in the Free Play mode.  Not a game-killer, but a bit of variety would have been nice.\nIt's a big time killer for people who enjoy micro-management (even down to population creation!) with combat being a bit kluggy and an afterthough (having to choose every bit of equipment for every soldier makes raising large armies very time consuming).\nOverall, a great game that follows a good control base and, at the price it's being charged on Steam, it's practically a steal!","January 4","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have only played 2 tutorials though and it felt just like The Settlers except with more options that have to deal with "personalizing" your settlement. You have to marry your citizens and assign them jobs and give them names. The chain of progress is more involved then The Settlers is.\n\nThe game won't launch at start though. You need to set compatibility to Windows XP (Service Pack 2). This will allow you start the game. Once you launch the game start a game mode and click on the options icon and manually change the settings.\n\nIf you ever played The Settlers AKA Serf City then buy it while it is only 50 cents.","February 9","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
