It's creator, Christine Love, cheekily describes it as being more about transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness, and cosplay. Maybe that's true. All I can say is that as a man, the game struck me as unflinchingly feminist. Now, I don't mean that in a confrontational, all-men-are-♥♥♥♥♥♥-pigs straw feminist sort of way. Hell, maybe feminism is not even the right word for it, maybe it's just a game about female experiences presented matter-of-factly. Ladies, this may seem obvious to you. But to us males, this is a wholly unsettling and unexpected revelation.\n\nThe story as outlined is simple and humble enough. You, a private detective (in space!), travel to a recently discovered wreck of a space ship, which had been previously lost for thousands of years. This ship once held an entire nation of people as it traveled to a distant planet. Somewhere along the way, the ship's inhabitants died out completely. It's up to you to sift through the ship's computer data (with the help of artificial intelligence friends) to discover the fate of the lost nation.\n\nIf you're like me, that story sounds fairly pedestrian so far, right? But the ship's recovered computer logs tell a much different, much more personal story.\n\nOver thousands of years, this isolated society has regressed in both education and culture to the whereabouts of 15th century Korea. Despite living on an impressive space-faring vessel, and being assisted by futuristic artificial intelligences, its inhabitants are mostly simple farm folk who know little of the ship, or the universe, around them. And just like in 15th century Korea, conditions for women are horrifyingly bad.\n\nThe AIs ask you personal questions throughout the game, such as who you are, where you're from, and whether or not you've visited Pyonyang. You know, getting-to-know-you stuff. The first time I played through, I was asked if I was a male or female, and I answered honestly. I played through the game, and that normally would have been the end of it. However, there's a Steam achievement for playing through a particular ending as both a male and a female, so I played the same ending again. As a female, the writing changes. In this new scene, it was all I could do to not reach through the computer monitor and slap that AI around until the smug falls out.\n\nThis AI's dialogue is fairly standard and neutral as a male, while as a female, the AI's dialogue is condescending and dismissive of everything you say. As a male, this concept that I could be disregarded so easily was a bit shocking.\n\nIs Analogue a FUN game? By no means. In fact, there's a race-against-the-clock mission (in a visual novel!) that really should have been heavily altered. But its story is solid, and compelling enough to make you overlook its flaws. Even weeks later, the story stuck with me, haunting me, making me question every interaction I've ever had with women over the course of my life.\n\nTL;DR - Do you like reading? Play this game. It's important.","June 19, 2014","true","7.7"," 140 of 162 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","140","162","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/recommended/209370/","jfietkau","jfietkau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfietkau/","6660 products in account","What would you do if you were to wake up tomorrow, having been thrust into a completely foreign society? Being greeted by your "new family" who tell you what to say, what to think and even how to feel in order to not violate their social norms? Being told that your identity, the place you carved out for yourself in the world, is long forgotten, but that they already have a new role good and ready for you? That your dreams no longer matter?\n\nThis fate, among many others, is one of the gears in the complex machinery that would end up removing all traces of life from humanity's great hope, the huge pioneer starship Mugunghwa, in Analogue: A Hate Story.\n\nIn this unconventional sci-fi/mystery visual novel, you are a space investigator hired to find out the truth about what happened to the Mugunghwa and how it got lost on its mission to settle foreign planets. Arriving at the wreckage and linking up to the ship's computer, you are greeted by the archival A.I., who offers to help you sort through the letters, reports, and diary entries of the people who lived on board before a mysterious catastrophe killed everyone. You quickly learn that very little is as it seems, and there are so many personal motives wrapped up in the situation that actual honesty is hard to come by.\n\nThe presentation in Analogue sets up a computer-y atmosphere with abstract backgrounds and actual in-story explanations for things like the multiple choice "dialogue wheels". The effort put into the art is largely concentrated into the two highly detailed on-screen characters, who delight with a plethora of poses and facial expressions to convey their emotions. The soundtrack, especially the character themes, features recognizable melodies (sometimes in several variations) realized in a consistent style that works extremely well with the atmosphere constructed by the rest of the story.\n\nFor most visual novels, the user interface tends to be an afterthought, and only rarely is it a point of contention in a review. Analogue, however, eschews the medium's tradition of a branching linear narrative and forges its own path in regards to navigation inside the story. In essence, every piece of text that you can find is one of the "files" of the ship's archive that you can view in any order, and you can also talk to the A.I. or drop back to the command-line interface at any point. This provides the player (a term that I use deliberately, because for Analogue, being a mere "reader" really isn't enough) with a high amount of agency that few visual novels choose to provide. It also creates a proportionally high number of opportunities to fail, for example if the player is not quick on their feet when it comes to using the computer terminal as the situation requires.\n\nThis sets up an interesting contrast with the main character's agency in the plot. After all, many years have passed since the events you read about and there is no way to influence the outcome or to save anyone. The only thing you can do is to find out the truth. There is a present-day plot involving the main character and the two artificial intelligences that still reside on the ship's computer, but the focus is on the mercilessly unchangeable past.\n\nThe people on the Mugunghwa lived in a surprisingly traditionalist society with strong codified gender goles and rampant classism. The members of the noble families all struggled for power, but no one seemed to heed the big picture or pay any mind to the ship's course. It was a troublesome situation in which a little girl from hundreds of years ago was awakened from cryostasis. Her family hoped that the Pale Bride might bring them salvation, but what could she do to find her way in a society that was so radically different from the one she knew? You notice early on that she seems to be somewhat of a focal point for the events on board following her reawakening, but how does she factor into the eventual genocide? What caused the ship's undoing? And why do the two A.I.s despise each other so much?\n\nAnalogue is, at its core, a mystery story. While it is still a visual novel and you can gloss over most of it without really internalizing it and still get to the end, it is a more rewarding experience to actually untangle the relationships of the characters and understand how their motivations propel them to do what they do. There aren't really any mechanics in place to support this endeavour, other than the family trees that the A.I.s helpfully provide you with. I found that my enjoyment of the story increased significantly as soon as I started taking my own notes with pen and paper. I would encourage you to do the same, because otherwise it is very easy to lose your perspective as you wade through the countless documents, each colored by its author's perceptions.\n\nBit by bit you wrestle the truth from the ship's archives, and slowly you piece together the puzzle until you are able to see the full picture in all its horror. All aspects of it, from the psychological through the sociological to the interpersonal themes of the story, paint a drab picture of loneliness and despair. It poses the uncomfortable question of whether the ship's population as a whole might have been beyond salvation for who knows how long, doomed many years before the finale of the story; whether the event that put an end to all biological life on board was merely the logical conclusion, much like you would turn out the lights when you leave an empty room. It's hauntingly honest in its depiction of the darkest depths of the human soul, and after completing the story for the first time, it left me with a strong feeling of unease about what any one of us might be capable of, given the right circumstances.\n\nIt does also have its lighthearted moments, and even though visual novel connoisseurs will find many tropes and clichés conspicuously absent, Analogue coquets with the expectations carried over from its genre siblings in certain moments, such as when one of the A.I.s invites you to dress her up in various outfits. It's no stranger to fun and there is plenty of clever humor to be found in the data logs and the A.I. banter.\n\nThe overall execution in this VN is so congruent and polished that any perceived shortcomings almost have to be rooted in personal taste. Some people might not care for the minimalist presentation, others might have preferred a more linear way of storytelling, yet others may have their reasons for not wanting to read a story where gender inequality is a prominent theme. But judged on its own merits, I can find nothing but praise for Analogue: A Hate Story within me. It's unique and interesting, and if you think that a mystery visual novel with deeper than average gameplay mechanics might intrigue you, I can recommend it without reservation.","January 10, 2015","true","5.0"," 102 of 119 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","102","119","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/botagel/recommended/209370/","botagel","Botagel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/botagel/","403 products in account","This is ancient history now, but for a while, back around 2005 or so, there was a perception, largely created by a single translation group, that the "visual novel," a format of linear text adventure that grew out of the Japanese PC games scene, might actually have something to offer beyond cheap titillation. They chose short, indie works like narcissu, Planetarian or OMGWTFBBQ, melodramatic stories of finding that last emotional connection in the moments before your early and miserable death. And then they pretty much stopped doing it (at least for free), because, hell, translating this stuff is a pain, and that was the end of that.\n\nAnalogue feels much like the promise of those earlier works. Written in English by a native speaker and skilled writer, with a great sense for how to use the interactive features of the format to really draw you in, in a way that "an ordinary book" can't. It's smart, somber, and complicated; it's a well-told story, and not just "for video games." And really, I just have a thing for simulated terminal interfaces.","November 25, 2013","true","3.6"," 109 of 140 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","109","140","0","0"

The only real negative was that I found the game did not make it very easy to get into and I felt like the user interface was a little bit unclear in sections. A factor that I have no doubt would initially put people off.\n\nLittle did I know that later on I would come to the conclusion that this game is worth every second I invested into it. The story is incredible once you have managed to piece things together and after some time you begin to learn new things and discover new secrets. The level of depth and thought that has gone into the creation of this game is incredible and I would reccommend everybody to play it. There are some fun little additionals which are added into the game through the use of the command centre, which is a nice little addition which I haven't seen implemented in too many others.\n\nAt £6.99 it is incredibly reasonable for a visual novel and there isn't really a good excuse not to buy it.","October 27, 2014","true","13.3"," 72 of 86 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","72","86","0","0"

It was on sale, and I was bored, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm a big fan of the science-fiction and transhuman genres, and Analogue seemed to offer a bit of both.\n\nI was not prepared for what this game had to offer.\n\nPerhaps calling it a "game" is a bit generous. It's an interactive novel, with almost no action sequences to speak of. The closest you'll come to any sort of twitch-reflex or quick-time events is typing into a terminal while an angry countdown clock stares you down. But still, there are choices to make and consequences to pay, with five potential endings - four of which can be carried right into the second game, Hate Plus.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting action and excitement. If you're looking for that, then you're in the wrong place. But if you enjoy a gripping tale of political intrigue, psychological horror, and surprisingly dark themes - then this is absolutely worth the price of admission. Don't let the cute, anime-inspired artwork fool you. This game is absolutely for adults, and not because of any sexual themes or nudity (although there IS a bit of the former).\n\nIf there's anything to complain about, it's perhaps the usual drawback of an interactive novel. It's relatively linear, fairly short, and light on replay value. Oh, sure, it's worth trying for the different endings (most of which require their own distinct play-through), but you'll still be forced to read a lot of the same letters and dialogue. And, while the writing is absolutely fantastic, it still gets repetitive the second or third time through - especially once you've learned all of the twists and turns that the story has to offer.\n\nBut still - if you're into mature, psychological tales of intrigue and murder, then this game is absolutely worth at least ONE play-through. You won't regret it.","February 16, 2014","true","7.2"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","31","37","0","0"

Therefore it is not suitable for children and early-teens.\n\nThere are 2 distinctive AIs that plays the role of narrating and advancing the plot for you. These 2 AIs have totally opposite personality, and such they reveals 2 different plot-lines for you to read and understand the history and mystery of the "apocalyptic" event that happened. This "unreliable narrator" mechanic is what makes a visual novel so much more interesting and entertaining than conventional book novel.\n\nThe first few entries aren't that exciting, but as I uncover more story along the way, they gives me the urge to continue on. The logs are so carefully crafted, that almost every entry contains a mystery that tickle my curiosity to find out what happens next. The plot are mostly dark and sad, full of love and hate. The few happy moments in the game helps to further contrast the rest of the sadness.\n\nThere are a lot of waifu moments in the game. I am not a big fan of waifu games, but I do find them quite entertaining in this game. They serve as great timeouts in-between reading, helps me clear my mind and combat read-exhaustion.\n\nThere are a few occassions that you need to type some unix-like commands into the ship's console. There is also a timed-puzzle event in the game, which is very easy to solve if you're a gamer. In my opinion, these puzzle elements are completely unnecessary and breaks the mood for novel reading, but they do enhance the unreliable-narrator mechanic and further establish the 2-distinct personality of the AIs.\n\nThe background music is very nice, a mix of Korean-Asian styled theme played with clean modern-futuristic digital music. The music also blends nicely with the mood of the logs you are currently reading, as well as the personality of the current active AI you are interacting with.\n\nThere is one thing that I struggle in this game: I find it very difficult to remember Korean names. I had to re-read many logs to fully understand what's going on sometimes.\n\nIf you do not hate reading, this novel is definitely worth a try.\n\nFor achievement huntersA minimum of 4 play-thrus are needed to 100% this game.

This may have been intentional, to contrast with the overt and at times graphic themes of women's rights suppression and child abuse, but it could also be interpreted as a somewhat cynical marketing gesture. For all of the motivation the story gives the player, the player's ability to influence events is extremely limited; you're basically playing a data recovery simulation while answering yes/no questions to abused women.

It's a little different from your usual visual novel formula. There's no dating, no romance, well... per se.\n\nYou are a space explorer who was hired to investigate the wreckage of a long lost ship whose disappearance has been a mystery for the ages. The ship is silent, it's crew long dead, the only remnants of life are the two AI programs Hyun-ae and Mute. Together you dig through the archives and records trying to piece together what went wrong.\n\nThis game is it's own prequel in a way, you already know how it ends you just need to take the journey to find out how it got there.

The real goal of Hate Story is to understand the two AIs left on the Mugunghwa and the people who shaped their lives.\n\nDark in some places, saccharine in others, the tone shifts throughout the game but I never found myself experiencing whiplash... And for a detective story - a mystery, which means you should be kept guessing most of the arc - Hate Story's plot is telegraphed early on. But that you can see the answers coming is not necessarily a negative; not all stories are measured by their plots, instead by how they make the player feel, and Hate Story managed to engage my gooey center. I empathized with not just the AIs but also many of the background characters mentioned in the log files the AIs provide you with.\n\nAt the end of the day, whether you would enjoy Hate Story or not has more to do with you than the game itself. It’s a polished experience, but if you don’t enjoy reading for hours at a time or hard science fiction blended with a westerner’s anime aesthetic, then there are other visual novel games out there for you.\n\nI’ll put it another way: Hate Story is about people’s stories, the player is almost an observer for most of the game. You ultimately decide the two AIs fate, but there’s little leeway in the endings, which Hate Story boasts five of them... Except the differences in those endings are shallow and not very rewarding, so you’re playing this game to take in a story and not so much to play an rpg (Don’t expect a paragon or renegade meter to pop up.)\n\nI would recommend Analogue: A Hate Story with the caveat that it’s not a romance simulator (although there is some of that); it’s not an action game (hope you’re not turned off by terminal windows, because_get_use *to-this, and entering commands are as close as it gets to combat); and it’s going to, at the max, last you four to five hours - that’s how long it took me to 100% the game and get all the achievements, and I’m not someone who makes a habit of speed clearing games.\n\nI could say more, specifically about the story, but spoilers are the suck.\n\npeace","July 10, 2014","true","5.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I thought it was odd that Steam would release something like that, but after nothing else I decided to pick it up. Was it worth it, even the small $10 price?\n\nStory: You begin with a small message at the beginning indicating your main objective: Find a ship that had a colony completely fade away without any knowledge of what happened. You're sent to find the logs of the ship and download them all and just return. After finding out the logs are password hidden, you're forced to interact with the AI, which is actually still working. She...well "it" is quite happy to see someone new and you dive right into what happened and who was on this ship. The tales of what's told can be emotional, heartbreaking, and completely gut-wrenching as you read about some of the events that occurred. Most of it being focused on a woman named the "Pale Princess" of course once you find the password you can simply just download and leave the game, lasting around 10-15 minutes. Of course that's not supposed to just be the game, exploring everything and every log is what you're mainly to do, and interacting with the AI can get you more info. I found myself trying to unlock every log or to see what happened after the horrible events that happened before. It twists with a different AI who seems to have a different take on the first, the name being *Hyun-ae, unlocking more events and different takes from different people and events that can leave you horrified, ending in multiple endings based on your choices.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is based off of course, reading, as this is indeed a visual-novel style. As you find out more, the AI will give you more logs to read, unlocking more parts of the different stories of the families or notes they wrote, or the diary of the Pale Princess herself, explaining what's going on and how she's being treated. Along with reading you'll occasionally be able to click on a little chat box, bringing up the AI and her...ahem "its" take on the current log, and occasionally be asked a question, and since you can't answer with your own response it usually ends up in a "Yes" or "No" style of question, based on your response the AI will answer on how they feel of the topic as well. Usually being rude results in a rude reply, or even worse if you're too mean, an automatic disconnect from the server. Resulting in a game-over style of screen, there’s not much to it besides the slightly confusing terminal. But not like it takes away any of the game, since you'll be more interested in her- I mean it- screw it. I honestly feel like "it" is a, even though she's an AI, she's truly one that you'll be feeling for every step of the way.\n\nIn all honesty, this is probably the first Indie game that actually took me by surprise by how entertaining and good it was. As I was wrong and probably should have looked into it more before judging it to be a dating game. The only drawback I can think of it is the length, it's quite short and be able to finish it in an hour or two. For one play through, and probably won't have much reason to go and read-through it all again. Unless you're willing to just for the different endings, of course there are multiple saves, but it's honestly worth it to read through it again to hear about their lives and what Hyun-ae has actually been through. An amazing game for a small $10 price, even if it is a bit short. I still love it and can't wait for the sequel.\n9.0/10 A near perfect title\n","June 18, 2013","true","8.3"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","2"

Like Digital, the entire game is presented on a computer screen, though Analogue is a lot more futuristic while Digital is set on a retro 1980s computer.\nYou learn about what happened on the Mugunghwa, a lost colony ship in space, through reading various logs from a dystopian era - its last days. Parallel to uncovering these details, you interact with the two remaining AIs on the ship who help you discover more logs, add commentary & befriend you.\nA very well made game - it even has a reference list, showing that a lot of research was done on the Korean Joseon era. It touches upon themes like Transhumanism (humans living with & relying upon technology as a necessity), Traditional Marriage (concubines & polygamy), Loneliness, Interpersonal Relationships & (in one set of logs) Gay/Lesbian issues.\nIf you liked "Digital: A Love Story" (& optionally; "don't take this persoanlly, babe, it just aint your story") then you'll most likely like this game too. It presents a setting & a centuries-old era that you learn about through two forms of interaction (reading logs & interacting with AIs) whereas Digital was more about trying out the internet for the first time & getting involved in a hacking-conflict-love-story. If you haven't played Digital, this game will still hold up with its fascinating story.","June 20, 2014","true","7.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The huge amount of text and confusing names you have to go through sounds overwhelming at first, but eventually you begin to understand the story behind it all, and it's a very satisfying feeling. I only wish the game had more freedom in how to discover the plot. As it is, the sequence of reading a letter and showing it to the AI becomes kinda repetitive.\n\nBut, well, the most important part is the story itself, and on that front, the game does not disappoint. The setting created is very interesting, with this fusion of futuristic and medieval, and the themes the story present are well-developed. The revelations in the end are dark and heavy, but adequate to the tone of the story.\n\nHowever, some moments were not - some of the dialogue becomes too much like a dating sim, and it's kinda jarring. To choose the ending I was most comfortable with I also had to pick a not very intuitive sequence. The binary system of choices is used to good effect at parts, but it fails at others.\n\nAll in all, it was a very, very worthwhile experience.

The story is told via the ships' logs being revealed from this communication with the AI. In addition, there is a small amount of (sometimes timed) interaction via a terminal interface, akin to DOS/UNIX operating systems.\n\nThe story is decently told and interesting, if containing a bit of distracting and extraneous detail at times.

The story is told mainly through text logs of letters, diary entries and such with some input from the AI personalities that exist within the computer, *Hyun-ae and *Mute, both representing opposing views on the matter of how the ship's society operated. *Hyun-ae is the woman who hates the ignorance and cruelty of the men and women who blindly accept the traditions and world views forced on them, while *Mute is the maiden who sees no problem with the world and happily agrees with and is very protective of the old gender roles.\n\nThe themes are quite mature and depressing, much more so than what you might expect looking at the screenshots. The people described in the logs are mostly awful people, if not by choice then by simply not understanding the opposing point of view, and reading through their entries was really painful at times. I could practically feel my stomach churn as I read the final log.\n\nAs for the VN itself, the way it tells its story is quite interesting, as it's mostly you simply investigating the past, with very little new story details introduced. The reactor malfunction part is somewhat infuriating if you just came for the story, but that's about the only complaint I have. Outside of that, the story and presentation is fine and unique enough to set it apart from most other VNs out there. There isn't as much artwork as most other VNs as it all takes place inside a holographic interface or something like that, but I'm fine with that. After all, the story is the important part and not the graphics, but what little there is of it is pretty good. There are multiple paths to take and I would strongly suggest you explore them as well just to get a bigger picture and see how the viewpoints of the two AI personalities conflict.\n\nI'd recommend this VN to people who are a fan of the medium and maybe even those new to it.

It’s so short and I wish it wasn’t because the characters, matched with the soundtrack, just becomes haunting. Once finishing the game you just sit there and muster over the options you’ve chosen and wish there was more to experience with these characters you’ve come to love.\n\nThis isn’t a dating sim, it’s hardly got to do anything with actual romance, but more of a story being twisted between two AI women. You’ll follow these two women, collecting information from them (as you’re assigned to) but all the while you’ll come to know them on a personal level, so much so that you’ll become impacted personally (as your character) by these characters. Their personal stories will break you.\n\nYou’ll have to make sacrifices after you’ve come to terms with Hyun-ae and Mute and that’s the hardest part.\n\nGameplay wise, it’s very smooth and the soundtrack was very enjoyable. It got stuck in my head within just an hour of playing. (I even had to go hunt down the OST online.) The controls are easy, of course it’s just a point and click visual novel, nothing too complicated there. The artwork is nice, the characters show reasonable amounts of emotion at necessary times; nothing too childish or over exaggerated.\n\nIt’s got a good bit of humor, mixed in with a whole bunch of despair, but not so much to ruin the flow of the story.\n\nIn short, if you get this game and play through it fully, you’ll be haunted by how great the story telling actually was. It isn’t just another junk RPG dating game but it actually has an enjoyable in depth plot.","January 11, 2015","true","4.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nebucadnezar/recommended/209370/","nebucadnezar","DIO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nebucadnezar/","254 products in account","Analogue: A Hate Story is a visual novel in which you try to uncover what happened to a lost spaceship and more importantly, it's crew. The story is presented via numerous documents and two A.I.s who also serve as pursuable love interests, all the while trying to influence the player's decisions. The experience is quite short-lived, which feels weird, considering that the story is clearly trying to emotionally influence you and centers around some fairly dark themes. More often than not though, these are presented in a pretty hamfisted way and the addition of extremely stylized characters makes for quite a mixed-bag overall.\n\nApart from an input-based sequence I encountered right at the end, there really is not any gameplay to speak of. The soundtrack served it's purpose as background music for you to read notes too but that's it. And finally, there are several different endings and achivements to obtain.\n\nMost of this should not be news to any Visual Novel aficionado out there but rather maybe serve as a warning to anyone looking for a different experience. So for anyone interested in a decent enough VN, I would recommend getting this game on sale because even considering possible replayability-incentives, it's a very short-lived tale. Overall though, I will not recommend this game to a general audience which is most likely looking for more game and less novel.","October 30, 2014","false","3.5"," 40 of 73 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","40","73","0","0"

I do remember seeing the trailer, and being intrigued by the thought that there was more to this story than there seemed to be.\n\nI wasn't wrong in the least.\n\nWhile I don't have a solid basis for comparison, I do think that the minimalist style, smooth animations and unobtrusive soundtrack really complement the game. The focus is on the story that your A.I. of choice is telling you, and nothing else...with the possible exception of the A.I. themselves. The differences between *Mute and *Hyun-ae are profound, and only become more so as you spiral down into the mystery of the ship. While ultimately, the story here is *Hyun-ae's, *Mute's perspective provides a counterpoint essential to seeing *Hyun-ae's actions in the right light. When you're reading the story told by both women, captivated by the pieces of the puzzle falling into place, the mood can turn rather intense.\n\nThough there is humor here, too. *Mute is remarkably crass, given her programming, and the levity her sass lends some serious situations is appreciated. *Hyun-ae is playful in her own right: should you befriend her enough, she will display different outfits for you, letting you use the in-game terminal to play a limited form of dress-up.\n\nSpeaking of the terminal, that and a Yes/No dialogue wheel will be the principle ways you assert yourself in-game. It's actually a nice mechanic. There are several times where the terminal comes in handy, and it's pretty intuitive to use. I also found the UI - probably due to that minimalist feel - comfortable to pick up.\n\nAll told, I couldn't find much wrong with Analogue. It was a wonderful introduction to the visual novel genre, and I plan to pick up it's sequel, Hate Plus. Might look into other visual novels as well, if they're half as good as this one.","March 26, 2015","true","9.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As a data collector sent out to download the logs of a long abandoned space ship, you soon discover that the ships AI is still perfectly opperational and in fact is inhabited by two AI who each have different takes on the history and life of the ships former inhabitants.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game is using the DOS style command terminal and using it to solve some neat ways, which are unfortunately a little scant. It's a nice touch however and really immerses the player in their role as a data collector.\n\nThe most important thing of course is the story and it doesn't disappoint. The two AI's are distinct and well developed in their motives and personalities and the story that unfolds around them is, at times, quite sad, tragic and even infuriating (but in all the right ways). I found the plight of the former inhabitants to be most interesting, although sometimes it can be hard to keep track of their names.\n\nThe presentation, while nothing mind blowing, is very nice too and the art for both AIs is very well done and the interface is very well constructed.\n\nSo if you're looking for a visual novel with a little something different, then this is for you. I think the regular price is pretty good for the 4-5+ hours you can get out of the game.","July 3, 2015","true","4.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You are a glorious Korean guy (or girl) sent to a glorious-but-deserted Korean ship to figure out which of Kim Jong-un's long-dead engineers needs to be dug up and killed a second time. The North Korean government will pay you mad ₩₩₩ for your efforts even if you only manage to download a fifth of the ship's files, because I guess they have low standards or something.\n\nWhen you get there, you meet the resident meganekko A.I. *Hyundai (because Nii-san went out of fashion after Japan fell), who you can dress up but not drive for some reason (?). Later you also meet *Mute, who can talk (???). With the help of these two kawaii desu anime girls, you completely disregard your job, cause nuclear meltdown, and read about lesbians.

Everything in Analogue is made so that you get used to, addicted to even, knowing more about the setting and the characters. As a game, Analogue teases you, makes you care about Hyun-ae with the sheer force of its information flux. It hides and shows and you want to unfold the mysteries even if you're not particularly attached to them. This is Christine Love strongest point.\n\nThis is, however and of course, her biggest shortcoming.\n\nEvery choice is a moral dichotomy and a very obvious one at that. *Mute is not a character you can relate to. She was not made to be relatable, I suppose... she's more like a storytelling prop. Analogue asks you if you think women are inferior and, if you're sane, you'll say no. Choices inevitably lead to Hyun-ae. The only way to get *Mute's route - if we should call it that way - is through a conscious, rational effort. But this is when the string behind the puppet appear and you play the game knowing its rules, doing things because you need to and not because you want to. So there's depth to the game, but you don't submerge.

After having a look at all the good reviews it had here on Steam, I decided I would give it another chance. And that's exactly what I did. It's not your usual game (if you could call it that), and probably not your typical visual novel either, but it narrates a very interesting story, which surely won't leave you unmoved. Some tips, just so you start with the right foot when playing the game, or if you are thinking about buying it:\n\n- Do you enjoy reading and books in general? This is definitely important, because 99% of the game is just reading. I'd recommend that you start playing whenever you don't feel like smashing enemies and just having a quiet, relaxing evening.\n- Do not pay too much attention to the family trees. There are way too many characters which only appear mentioned once, So yeah, try not to feel overwhelmed: there are only a few characters you should really focus on.\n- Do some detective work! The story is original and very compelling. Even if I thought both of the game's AIs were way too cartoonish for my taste, it's pretty easy to understand them as characters and be moved by their reasons and actions, as well as by all those different stories that take place in the logs of the korean ship where everything took place. It's not really neccessary to think too much about what happens next in the story as you play through it, (you are told about everything at one point or another)  but be sure to use your logic and common sense and you'll be surprised when you find out what really happened in the story  way before you even get to read it.\n\nDefinitely a very original and compelling game/story/book. It'll keep you entertained for a few hours, as well as its story will probably stay in your thoughts for a few days more. Btw, I loved the Ender ending. :-)\n\nPs for the devs: One AI per core? Why can't I disable one of the AIs and enable the other one, if both are in the same core? C'mon! It only makes sense, and that way you would be able to get one of the achievements without breaking the 4th wall.

This is a VN of sorts, but instead of classic VN style, its stylized as a computer within a game, within your computer. Its an interesting twist that ends up working well, as your job is to read old stories and present them to the AI characters.\n\nWhich brings up the overall plot of the game, and what the ending is like. As I said, it is like a VN, so there are multiple endings, depending on which character you choose, and there are good and bad endings as well. I counted five or so different ones I think, so plently of variety. Story wise, it is very deep and complex, following the patriarchial ways of an old family, and uncovering what caused them to go downhill. It is a very dark tale, one frought with passion, and deception. Very well written.\n\nAs for length, a single playthrougth could take an hour to complete at minimum, or near 5 hours for each log to be collected and examined. Which is not bad, but is not good either, the main enjoyment comes from reading the stories of the past people and what caused their ultimate downfall.\n\nThose are the only things I can not as of now that I have a problem with, but for a video review that I would say sums up my thoughts on the game, see here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mecz9Xxf0SM\n\nI would recommend it to anyone who like anume, is into reading stories, and gossip as well as intiguing plot twists and information.","June 26, 2013","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198121799462/recommended/209370/","76561198121799462","Erwin ``Kongou`` Duffmel","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198121799462/","86 products in account","The world would be a better place if all visual novels had the depth of Analogue.\n\nIn the past, I've had extreme misgivings about delving into the realm of visual novels, whether for the fact that they relied too heavily on the visuals and neglect the storytelling, the gameplay was monotonous or a carbon copy of a dating sim rather than an actual story, or there was simply a lack of defined gameplay in the first place, but Analogue seems to avert all of those pitfalls brilliantly. With highly interactive gameplay, a compelling and non-linear narrative, and character paths that seem to unfold as a natural consequence of the gameworld rather than constantly reminding you of the need for a primus inter pares (though there is at least one point where you are asked directly to choose, the urgency comes not from the characters but from the plot itself), Analogue hands you the reins of a techie drifting in space some unknown millenia from now who contacts the Mugunghwa, an ancient space vessel whose purpose was to establish a colony somewhere far from Earth, to learn from the ship's AI that in addition to all of the inhabitants being dead for some six hundred years, society aboard the ship prior to extinction had regressed to an intensely feudal patriarchal design.\n\nBoth of these factors in the narrative allow the story to texplore relevant and controversial issues such as male dominance in society, sexual repression, homosexuality, progressivism and reactionism, class economics, loneliness and the desire to be accepted in a society, even touching on Stockholm syndrome, in a deeply personal vein as the reader is constantly reminded by the AI and the content of the logs themselves that each entry you read is from the private diary of a real person, or an exchange between real individuals. The game allows you to interact with these topics in such a way that it never quite feels as impersonal as collecting the files of the 600-years deceased should be, drawing you into the mystery to the point that the game allows you to actively support or condemn different aspects of society on the ship.\n\nNo amount of snooping in diaries and reading other people's mail will reveal to you exactly how this society could have gotten like this, however, so your immediate concern is finding out how and why all traces of life on the ship were extinguished suddenly in the ship year 322, and downloading as many files from the ship's log as can accurately explain the phenomena is your ultimate mission (in reality, the topic of how the ship got that way seems to be the subject of the sequel). Previously touched upon, the gameplay is presented in an archive format, wherein you navigate different logs and emails, showing messages to the AI when you want to know more about a given topic, and ultimately deciding on the importance of your growing relationship (or lack thereof) with one or both of the AIs rated against the necessity of simply completing the mission.\n\nAs mentioned, there are two AI personalities that can be activated (never at the same time) to help you in this endeavor, marked by an asterisk (*) before their name to signify their role as an artifical intelligence on the ship. It is blatantly obvious that the game heavily favors *Hyun-ae, while *Mute is considered the less conventional, "Why would you pick this option?" character path. I, for one, Hated that aspect of the game, because while Hyun-ae is more amenable by modern standards, I didn't like the way she was written (demure and tragic) compared to Mute (confident and functional) and was forced to side with the ship's inhabitants in order to get Mute's ending. One can, however, break Hyun-ae's heart while showing Mute that the ship's way of doing things is incorrect, but both of these are considered unorthodox and not what the average player would do. Anyway, moving on.\n\n*Hyun-ae appears as an extremely polite dark-haired girl with glasses whose knowledge of the ship's inhabitants is limited in scope. She is extremely conscious of the schism between modern (real life) society and the way of life exhibited on the ship, and seems to suffer deep trauma concerning the ordeal, making her the more progressive, detached partner as you read through the logs and examine them from a modern perspective. She is extremely glad of your company after 600 years of isolation, and is more than willing to share her thoughts and hobbies with you (one of the more prominent being cosplay) once she feels you are trustworthy. Pursuing her path and exploring her trauma allows you to see the events of the ship as you might listen to the story of a kidnapping victim that has recently been rescued from a terrible tragedy, and her path is deeply connected to the events of the extinction. In terms of character design, she is the taller and more well-endowed of the two characters (which makes *Mute seem younger and possibly a lolicon), wears a schoolgirl outfit by default, and exhibits all of the stereotypical poses of buxom glasses-wearing anime lasses (one hand on the hip with the other adjusting the glasses, crossed-arms with one hand adjusting glasses, pretty much just trying to accentuate the glasses 24/7 when she's not cosplaying).\n\nMute, on the other hand, is incredibly knowledgeable about the personal lives of the ship's inhabitants, owing to the fact that she was more well-adjusted to society on the ship and talked often with people from each family. Knowing as much as she does about the ship's inhabitants, she is Hyun-ae's foil in that she is intended to remind you of the intrinsic humanity of the ship's inhabitants, referencing the struggles of daily life on the ship, and considers the ship's denizens to be just as victimized by their own society as Hyun-ae. Though seemingly reactionary, she speaks fondly of the few progressive events and inhabitants of the ship, going so far as to call one of them the "closest thing [she] had to a husband", and is constantly showing the reader that she and many other conformers on the ship were at least vaguely and sometimes painfully aware of the inqeuity in their society. Taking Mute's path allows you to see the events of the ship through the eyes of its general population, or the abductors to Hyun-ae's abductee, and she views the extinction itself as being a greater tragedy than her society's flaws. Mute is small in stature with short blonde hair, wearing a lavish hanbok and well-ornamented headress. Her mannerisms are generally assertive and matter-of-fact, but are almost always blushing, revealing a self-conscious side.\n\n\n\nAll in all, the game boasts poignant main characters, a deep story laden with social commentary and cultural significance, and an amusing interface that ties it all together in a way that shows its understanding of the fact that it is, after all, just a game. The content of the game, however, distinguishes it as something more, and as more people play it, will hopefully help distinguish the visual novel genre itself as capable of weighting its content with cerebral designs while remaining accessible to the general audience.","February 16, 2014","true","8.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No real cliches here, not really weeb ♥♥♥♥, just tells a good story and happens to be an anime game.\n\nBecause the story is actually good, I'll warn that spoilers follow.\n\nIt is a visual novel, just told using interesting mechanics, and player choices are abundant, so I'm okay with it.\n\nEpistolary novel -- story told through series of documents, letters, and text entries. A narrative is made clear by reading accounts given by other people of events. Also uses the unreliable narrator mechanic, the persons giving you information and exposition withhold information and hint at things to be discovered later. I like both of these things.\n\nYour character is an investigator or mercenary of sorts investigating a ship that was lost contact with thousands of years ago. It was apparantly a ship holding an entire society meant to establish the first colony in another star system. AI on ship *Hyun-ae greets character. Many documents, letters, and diary entries detailing life on the ship before everyone died give the player a sense of what was going on.\n\nThe story revolves around the character 'The Pale Bride' which is mostly a tragedy. A young girl, the 'Pale Bride', of 13 on the ship was put in cryogenic stasis b/c she was dying and they figured those in the future would have better medicine on the ship.\n\nStasis pod is shattered, she awakens to a deeply backwards society resembling ancient China, Japan, or Korea, one of those. Complete with emperors, family dynasties, and deep misogyny, the new society does not at all have the means to heal her, and rather intends to have her married off to the 'emperor'.\n\nThe character protests at first and maintains her own free will, but is slowly degraded and controlled. The girl's real name was apparantly Hyun-ae, the name of the supposed AI on the ship.\n\nThe last diary entry revealed details the girl refusing to be married to the emperor, only to have her tongue cut out by her adopted father for speaking against a man. Her description of the scene is rather disturbing and you'll quickly come to be horrified by and hate the society she's awoken to.\n\nEveryone on the ship has been dead for 600 years apparantly. The security AI on the ship, *Mute, entirely accepts the backwards beliefs of the ship's culture, but reveals things to the player about what happened to the ship. Primarily, she reveals that *Hyun-ae is responsible for everyone's death.\n\nWhen questioned, Hyun-ae will reveal a diary entry where she had become a submissive, dehumanized wife of the emperor, having almost entirely forgotten her past identity and sense of self. During a visit to her adopted family, her 'father' says how happy he is with her, as she used to be so protesting and angry, but that she's really surprised them all and become a success.\n\nUpon hearing this, she suddenly remembered all that had happened, how she had lost herself, her identity, and now that her adopted father was actually praising her for how she had become dehumanized and made into an object, she wanted nothing more than to kill him.\n\nShe could not bring herself to stab him with the knife she held. The player will recall an earlier entry where it is detailed to 'The Pale Bride'/Hyun-ae that the password to the emperor's shipcomputer is her birth name, as a sign of appreciation. This is willingly revealed to her b/c it is assumed that women couldn't ever use a computer. Using this, she accesses the computer and disables the ship's life support and downloads her consciousness onto the ship through some sci-fi absurdity.\n\nOf course, there are many other details and sub-stories, but that is the gist of it. There are five endings allowed for the player depending on their choices. The easiest is to simply gain the password to the computer, download the ship's files, and leave the AIs behind. The four other endings require a more thorough search and understanding of the narrative.\n\nI started the game not expecting it, but I must admit that the game is dark/disturbing, tells good stories, is not plagued by awful cliches, has good music, requires player agency and choice, and has multiple ways to complete it.\n\nI recommend this game.","December 29, 2014","true","3.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If it were told in realtime, it would be a horror novel.  But by setting most of the action well in the past, it allows the player to discover a happy--or at least happy-ish--ending.\n\nIf you like murder mysteries or period dramas, or crazy little love stories, give this Visual Novel a read.","January 6, 2015","true","5.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Considering the game's length, it is easy to pick up and finish in one sitting. You'll be hooked regardless, so there is no need to worry. There is some basic puzzle solving and you most certainly must have the ability to read in order to fully enjoy this game. The themes are rather mature, so I would not recommend that younger audiences play this game. Now with this out of the way, let us delve into it. Let us delve into the past.\n\nYou are a simple pilot investigator flying in space when you come across a ship. The ship has no life on it; however, you decide to connect to a computer terminal where you meet an artificial (yet cute) inteligence named *Hyun-ae. She greets you with much respect seeing as she hasn't had contact with anyone for over six-hundred years. The game works as a series of log files that are shown to you by *Hyun-ae, and you simply read them and talk to the artificial inteligence to listen to their responses. The AI will ask you a few questions and you'll have the ability to modify values in the terminal in order to change your story path accordingly. The concept may seem simple and boring; however, it is far more interactive than it seems. What really makes this game special is the content itself, which for emphasis, I will add, is what really takes the cake.\n\nIf you're a fan of seeing characters develop, you are most certainly looking in the right place. What really stands out though is this game's reoccuring theme regarding sexism, sexuality, and sex. The game itself portrays these themes in very unique ways, but I would just recommend playing it since there isn't much else I can say about the game's story. The themes displayed in the game are even more than just that, though. The game explains much more and will require your experiences to interpret them. There are multiple endings that allow for the players to experience each theme in a different light and perspective. Analogue: A Hate Story does not disappoint, and I highly recommend that even people who are not fond of visual novels pick up the game.\n\nHonestly, this one is a life changer.","December 2, 2014","true","6.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tahulk/recommended/209370/","Tahulk","Tahulk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tahulk/","191 products in account","I’d like to start off by saying that I believe this game is very much a hit or miss sort of title, with little deviation into more lukewarm territory.  In other words, I believe you'll either really like this game or really dislike this game.  As you can see from my thumbs up right there^, this game was certainly a hit for me, but as Visual Novels aren’t for everyone, I cannot guarantee that it will be for you as well.\n\nAnalogue: A Hate Story gives you, a deep space investigator, the task of sifting through the written records of the now dead inhabitants of a long lost (and now newly re-discovered) colony ship with the help of the ship's two cute and (mostly) friendly AIs.  As you read each document, you’ll slowly piece together a fuller story of the ship’s ‘not-quite-right’ society, and the events that lead to its ultimate demise.  I found the story tastefully dark and engaging enough to keep me flipping the pages (as much as you can flip pages in a Visual Novel) until the very end.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is the lack of a difficulty setting.  Granted by definition Visual Novels don’t have much gameplay to them that could be altered by a difficulty setting, but in this VN in particular, there is one section where I would have enjoyed a bit more of a challenge.  With only mild spoilers, suffice to say that you are given too much time to complete a certain task that anyone with any sort of experience with Command Prompt will fly through in a quarter or less of the allotted time.  A difficulty setting that decreases that time would have been a nice addition.\n\nRelatively minor discrepancies aside though, I believe this game is definitely worth a shot if you’ve ever got $10 (or $3.39 if you’re buying during a super-sale like I did) to spare, whether it turns out to be a hit or a miss for you.","June 28, 2014","true","8.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

You log into the ships computer and with the help of 2 AI, Hyun ae and Mute, you must uncover the truth of the colony and why there is no one alive on it anymore.\n\nYou will have to do some basic programming to find all the info you need so there is input despite all the logs you'll have to read, some go into 6 pages in length so prepare your reading glasses and pay close atention to the details, you will be quizzed by the AI girls at intervals during your investigation to get your opinions on some of the things that you read in these logs and possibly get them to give you more logs.\n\nYou will read a number of different stories that happened during the final years of the ships human life, you may be shocked, you may be disgusted but it will make you want to read on and find out the whole story.\n\nThis game would take about 5 hours to complete one playthrough, but there are 5 different endings including a special harem ending (Yes they may be Computer programs but if you so choose you can agree to get married to them)\n\nI give this game a solid 8/10, the interface isn't perfect but it does it's job and it gives you a little extra input and involvement than other Visual Novels, so if that sounds good to you it'd be worth your time to pick up.","December 12, 2014","true","6.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","5"

Visual Novels are completely different than what is considered to be a game so my expectations will change according to that, meaning I am looking for a decent story over anything else. If you don't want to read everything I have to say for whatever reason, skip down to the very bottom to read my overall impressions.\n\nA short summary on what the story is about:\n- Basically, you are an anonymous space investigator sent over to a deserted space vessal named the Mugunghwa to recover log files left behind by the ship's inhabitants in order to discover the reason for the ship's disappearance. You log on the ship's main computer and meet an AI named *Hyun-ae who is suprised to gain external contact after 622 years of idling so she is willing to help you recover as much data as you can before departing from the Mugunghwa for good.\n\nNow I shall move onto my opinions on each of the following sections:\n\nThe Story:\n- Personally, I don't like to read a lot of visual novels because to me, most of the stories they provide feels very similar to one another with the primary goal is getting to know a group of girls and ultimately pick one to be your lover. This however makes me feel like picking one of the two AI's (or both if you somehow cheat the system) is more or less a side objective to me that I will eventually complete, but aside from that, saying anything else for this section will make it more of a generalization of the whole novel with the possibility of leaving out important details so moving on...\n\nThe Theme:\n- This is pretty interesting to see topics like misogyny and conservative politics based on the Joseon Dynasty to appear in this form of media. Now after reading that first sentence, some people might think it has extreme views of feminism, but after reading through all of the logs, I never though it went to the point of being extreme, but also enough to make me open up and think about these topics in more detail. I will warn you some of the logs have some sexual themes, but thankfully no images.\n\nThe Characters:\n- When meeting the two AI's, you will notice they both possess the typical tropes you would usually see, in addition to having completely different political views and backgrounds, with *Hyun-ae from a more liberal background and *Mute from a more conservative background, leaving the investigator with a personality that is based on yours. Personally, I find both *Hyun-ae and *Mute pretty interesting to say the least. Other characters mentioned in the novel will only be read though log files and there are quite a bit of people to read about so I'm just going to let you find out who they are for yourself.\n\nDecisions:\n- There are five endings to reach and the choices made throughout your playthrough will determine what the AI's think of you (the harem ending requires you to cheat to some degree, which is pretty funny once you manage to do that). The questions you need to answer will mostly involve yes-no type questions. If you decide to pose as a woman, *Mute's dialogue and opinion on you will completely change, but *Hyun-ae's opinion will remain the same since you really never tell her any general information about the player.\n\nLength:\n- One playthrough might be around 4-6 hours average if you took your time to read. For something of that length, I could care less because I really enjoyed the story and the topics it presented.\n\nThe UI (User Interface)\n- Looking around in the terminal can be a bit troublesome at first, but you will eventually figure it out and the UI is overall easy to navigate.\n\nThe Soundtrack:\n- I would say the soundtrack is pretty decent and fits the mood for every scenario you read.\n\nWhat is my conclusion? I had a very intriguing experience that gave me traumatizing thoughts that will stick with me for the rest of my life. In my opinion, it is definitely worth full price in addition to the soundtrack composed by Isaac Schankler and of course, definitely worth having a look at. Don't pay any attention to the official Metacritic score simply because after reading them, it felt as if some of them were judged a little unfairly becuase they just didn't like the story and of course the novel was judged by ONE person with a total of five people from different publications reviewing this novel making the score completely skewered making it seem not as good as everyone says it is. If you are still skeptical despite everything I said, there is a demo for you to look at to see if you like what you have read so far. Hopefully we can actually have more people initiating proper discussions on these topics and not resort to yelling at one another with ignorance and hatred.","July 29, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

WIth them, the simple style ultimately reinforces the limited ability to properly tell the story, as additional art could have smoothed certain flaws and enhanced the feeling of discovery.\n\nThe few puzzle elements were neat and fun, but far too restricted in scope.\n\nFinally, the low-key but non-critical references to common Visual Novel traits unfortunately undermined the core thematics somewhat.","April 29, 2013","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Male readers may find the story slightly too much aimed at a female audience, but, hey, you kinda had that coming after every other non-yaoi VN ever. Regardless, *Hyun-ae is an incredibly compelling character who also has proper emotional reactions for a teenager-- isntead of just being treated as a small, cute, naiive adult.\n\nWhere it really shines, though, is how it has a completely unique narrative style-- you progress through the game by reading letters and then showing them to *Hyun-ae or *Mute-- it feels like a cross between Phoenix Wright and Nabokov's Pale Fire. And while you can argue that the story isn't as good as either of those, the fact that there's even an argument to be made between this and a novel routinely listed in lists of top 100 novels ever written shows soemthing amazing about it.","September 24, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a good idea to keep a notebook and pen handy, or a tablet to take notes on.  The story is fragmented like a puzzle that is put together piece-by-piece.  The game is very unique in that regard and it's unlike anything I've ever played before.   I've played a lot of games with great storylines, including the  Final Fantasy games that provide a story where you just sit and play through like a movie.   This game is the opposite of a Final Fantasy game where the story is something that isn't just given to you, you have to unlock it piece by piece and then realize how each piece fits together like a puzzle.   Very cool idea and I'll also note that this game has multiple endings, just like Chrono Cross/Chrono Trigger or any of those other very famous SquareSoft story-based games.  That alone is worth taking a deep look into this game.","June 27, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

These elements it shares in common with most tragic real-life tales, and lends this particular story a great deal of potency.\n\nIf you share in common with me an incredibly high level of emotional sensitivity, do not play this for long stretches of time, no matter how engaging the story may be.

Though as for Analogue, it does have a little bit of interaction, you pick what to read, you sometimes answer questions and the ractor meltdown scene actually requires some fast thinking and pseudo-hacking.\nAnaogue also does not really have any nudity or sexual themes, though the story is definitely dark and not something lighthearted. I like things that are based on moral and the darker sides of existence, so that is definitely a bonus point.\n\nI know there are many people out there who deem VN players as creepy, but it's like nearly everything in life: There will always be creepy people in all genres and places, but that doesn't make what they fancy necessarily bad. Take it with a grain of salt, sit back and enjoy the positive sides, of which Analogue has some to offer in my opinion. Not everyone who is playing these games kisses his/her monitor.\n\nOne of the things that annoys me about this game, as banal as it may be, is the fact that the game has 'negative achievements' which dismisses all thoughts of trying to get the achievements, which indirectly lowers the replay value.\nAlso the game is pretty damn short, and the personalities of the AIs do feel somewhat shallow, so personally I'd recomment to only buy it during a sale, which is just what I did myself.","August 9, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Colony ship was sent from Earth to distant stars but disappeared without a trace. Six hundred years later it was found drifting through space. Player’s task is to download ship archives and logs, but soon they will find out details behind tragedy that took place on board and led to ships demise. Two AIs could help the player, but each one is unreliable narrator.\n\nThis title holds special significance of being the first visual novel released on Steam.\n\nVisual novel is a very niche genre and arguments are still raging if they can be considered "games" at all. Typical VN does not have much of "gameplay" but require a lot of reading; user input is limited to selecting one of answers in dialogues. On top of that, Analogue is very minimalistic graphically: it has only two drawn characters and mostly clean white backgrounds. However, Analogue provides additional means of player interaction - a computer command line in which you type to "hack" the system, gain access to various logs and move the story forward; it has even timed sequence when you have to prevent ship's reactor from exploding.\n\nNot too lengthy, with nice music and intriguing mystery story this can be excellent entry-level visual novel.

The plot may be quite simple, and some character interactions are predictable, yet there is so much beauty and sorrow in this earnestness. Analogue is at its core a vulnerable, self-aware tale; one of redemption, repression, and the very human desire for someone to legitimise your beliefs and your actions. If you give it credit, and go into it realizing that it has two faces, you will find a pleasant intelligence in both its seriousness and self-referential humor.\n\nThe creator has also consistently delivered solid games, and several of them are free, so if you do enjoy Analogue, definitely try them out.","November 18, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Male readers may find the story slightly too much aimed at a female audience, but, hey, you kinda had that coming after every other non-yaoi VN ever. Regardless, *Hyun-ae is an incredibly compelling character who also has proper emotional reactions for a teenager-- isntead of just being treated as a small, cute, naiive adult.\n\nWhere it really shines, though, is how it has a completely unique narrative style-- you progress through the game by reading letters and then showing them to *Hyun-ae or *Mute-- it feels like a cross between Phoenix Wright and Nabokov's Pale Fire. And while you can argue that the story isn't as good as either of those, the fact that there's even an argument to be made between this and a novel routinely listed in lists of top 100 novels ever written shows soemthing amazing about it.","September 24, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a genre I typically avoid, but I'm thinking I might just be addicted to it at this point. This isn't the sort of game for everyone, and some of the dialogue is unexpectedly irreverent, but this will remain a personal favorite of mine and a fun replay once a year at least.","February 19, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has two enjoyable characters and a large amount of written content. I went into it knowing that it was pretty dark but I was not prepared for how dark it turned out to be. Don't get me wrong, this is definitely a mixed-content sort of visual novel; it has some comedy in there too but when it gets dark it goes pitch black.\n\nThere was a point in the game that was deeply traumatizing to the point where it left me in a mild state of shock. When it happened I had to stop playing immediately but it held onto me and followed me the whole next day. Thoughts of what had happened and a strong desire to play the game again consumed my thoughts until I was able to come home from work and beat the game. Even then it followed me for another day until I managed to get what I thought was the "best ending". At the time of writing this I've only played about 3 hours. I am not the same person I was before I played this game.\n\nI still haven't read all the content in this game, even at my very quick reading pace. This is definitely the kind of game where you want to read carefully. One day perhaps I'll get the other endings and read the rest of the content.","January 10","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's definitely gameplay-light, almost at a text adventure level, so it's definiltely not for people who can't play a game without shooting things.\n\nAs it's largely about reading through the logs of a Korean starship, it's initially extremely confusing to Western eyes, as it's very hard to keep straight who all the characters are.  The logs are written like you're just overhearing a few other people's conversations, and so it's often filled with references to people who never appear in the logs again, or are important, but at the start, it's hard to tell what is or isn't important.\n\nIf you bear through it for a few hours, however, you find it's largely focused upon a tiny handful of individuals, and is an extremely personal story.\n\nThe funny name of this game is an inversion of Christine Love's first (and available for free) game, Digital: A Love Story. (Get it? It's a love story, but it's written by someone named Love, so it's also a Love story! Ha... ha... Anyway...) While Digital was set in the past, and its themes were about how people looked to the future, Analogue is set in the future, and about a society that wants to send itself back to its past.\n\nThe author, Christine Love, has, and puts in everything she makes, strongly-held and strongly-expressed ideas about women and lesbians in particular.  Korean (and by extension, Chinese,) traditional patriarchy clashes brutally with these themes.\n\nInversely, the AIs the player deals with are almost too colorful and anime-esque for the drama in front of which they are standing.  The 'real' action is long since passed, and the player really only has a choice of taking one or the other (or why not, take both!) along with him or her.  It's a minor issue here, and a much worse one in Hate Plus, but the story in the logs has an entirely different mood and themes than the one the player actually participates in with the AIs, which is far more about describing yourself and your point of view to the AIs.  In essence, if you took out the log reading, it's just the player flirting with girls in a standard Visual Novel with an unusually large number of choices.","August 4, 2015","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did enjoy the system of recieving new logs, it really makes a feeling that you're talking to an AI instead of just browsing through data. The characters were really well made, both the visible ones and invisible ones. I liked that I could learn about the historical culture in a fun way (I know it'smeant to be the future, but the facts were historical). The attention curve was done right, by presenting you with enough fresh infromation to keep you entertained throughout the game.\n\nMediocre: The music was okay, but it started getting repetetive after some time, at least it didn't disturb me too much. There were som cliche parts of the game, but most cases they fit rather well in.\n\nBad: Apart from the AI character art and few ending art cenes, there really wasn't much to look at.

The logs, in my opinion, are both a good and bad design choice. It’s good because it’s up to your imagination to process what is going on. On the other hand, it feels like I’m reading a history book all over again! Maybe it’s all the dates and charts that makes me feel that way, but I think it could have been handled a little better.\n\nThe game did not need player choices since the backstory mattered more than the characters, but it was neat that they included that. One player choice in particular had such a good and elaborate setup that I consider it most memorable moral choice in any visual novel I have played so far. I’m not going to spoil what it is, but you’ll know it when you see it.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to both visual novel fans and people who have not played a visual novel before.\n","December 10, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So I'm going to be as honest about the game as I can, without discrediting the creator.  First things first, I LOVE Digital:  A Love Story.  It was immersive, engaging, and overall a nice game to play.  I liked the characters, I loved the setting, I seriously loved that that game.\n\nNow, Analogue:  A Hate Story on the otherhand...  This "game", takes inspiration from the first, but is more story oriented than gameplay oriented.  Well, let's be honest, there wasnt any real "gameplay" in either itteration.  It's more like an interactive story than anything.  So to be clear, the first one had you doing stuff and actually let you connect the dots in the story.  While this one is a WAY more self explanitory story.  Anyway...  I finished the first game.  But this one couldnt keep my attention.  I found myself getting bored with it, every time I tried to play.  The story wasnt bad, but it just didnt resonate with me.  I felt like the story was becoming a little agressive in the way of the creators politics.  It became almost like I was reading a strongly opinioned blog that had nothing but agression towards the "Patriarchy".   As a man, I kinda started feeling like this story wasnt for me, and was directed towards a "certain" audience (like a fox in a henhouse kinda feel).  And after each story, the caracters kind of pressure you into choosing the "right" answer.  Choose the "Wrong" answer, and things will take an OBVIOUS turn for the worse.\n\nI stopped about 3/4 of the way in, and just lost interest in it entirely to the point where I uninstalled it.\n\nWould I recommend this game?  That depends...  None of my friends would like this kind of game anyway, so I cant say for sure.\nSo dont let my thumbs down discourage anyone else from buying it.  I just didnt like the story as much as the first one (and the first one was free).\n\nI will say this though.  I praise the graphic artist for such great work on the character models.  They fit wonderfully with the characters personalities.\n\nStory:  Meh/10\n\nGame Play:  Reading/10\n\nArtwork:  School Rumble/10  (This is a good rating :3)\n\nOverall Verdict:  Feminism/10  Would fight patriarchy again.","March 27, 2015","false","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It holds itself together well, has a fairly decent story pacing and the mood is quite pretty, in its somberness. Allow me to emphasize, it is a dark game, if you have trouble with the idea of exploring some rather dark elements and events, then this is not a game for you. If for some reason you have do not like visual novels, then I actually wonder why you’re even reading this review, this game is not for you, nor will you find it enjoyable. I won’t spoil anything, but the game has several endings and is worth at least three playthroughs to get all of the information and story, along with the separate endings.\n\nIn short, if you like dark visual novels with some minor dating-sim elements, buy it, you will not regret it. If you don’t like visual novels, reading or dark events, then this is not a game for you. I recommend it glowingly, it is a fine game, especially for the price.\n","December 14, 2013","true","12.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/urganite/recommended/209370/","urganite","Urganite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/urganite/","233 products in account","TL;DR: The story, and perhaps more importantly the storytelling, are both excellent, which are absolutely critical for the genre. Good soundtrack, excellent attention to minor details. I only wish the game itself was longer.\n\nI've decided to write this review before playing the expansion, Hate Plus, so that that experience wouldn't color my impressions of this game.\n\nNo synopsis, that would just be repetitive, not to mention rude. Play the demo. After decades of exposure, I've lost a lot of interest in the manga style, but I tried the game anyway and was oddly drawn to it in a way that is difficult to relate. Perhaps not being Japanese played a role in getting me to give it a shot, I'm not sure. The music is good, but there are not many pieces in the soundtrack. That stuff said, let's just focus on what sets this game apart.\n\nThe game itself is one part first-person narrative from the perspectives of many people within the setting, you know, 'before the incident', and one part interaction with one of the two main, interactive characters. If you were to add a repetitive action game in the middle, you'd end up with a far better written and more mature .hack game. I was thankful for the silent protagonist role, having a pre-written stand-in to take on 'your' feelings and beliefs can be very immersion breaking.\n\nThe place where this game really excels is in the 'little things'. I'll not spoil what those little things are, but they make the characters that you can interact with feel a lot more believable and 'alive'. Clever use of game devices give the illusion that the interface is natural, which adds a lot to immersion. While some parts are extremely blunt (borderline shocking, considering the context), I felt the story and presentation overall had an alluring subtlety and mystery to it that is strangely devoid in most game stories and, well, from most books, music, and television shows as well.\n\nMy main complaint with the game is that it is short. While I don't believe in dragging things out for the sake of length, and there is certainly enough there to get the story across with the degree of completeness that I would consider necessary, I felt that the brevity left an empty feeling. A, 'But, wait, I like these characters! It's over already...?' feeling. It's actually a bit ironic. Loneliness as an underlying theme makes much of the hurried feeling in the dialog quite forgivable (even endearing), but again, there's still an abruptness to it that feels disheartening.\n\nRegarding the style and themes of the game, this is by no means a critique of the writing, which is excellent. But, without looking, I easily pegged who the author is as a person from just the story. For those who know, that is probably not too surprising, but I felt it was worth mentioning. The writing is highly indicative of that person's personal tendancies, experiences, and perspective, which do give it a richness that may otherwise be lacking. I would be very interested in seeing the author involved in collaborative projects (in part because the loneliness is just falling off the plate...).\n\nThe author appears to go to great lengths to give a feeling of neutrality overall, aside from the innate societal problems related to the mysterious transition back to the Confucian culture and Chinese writing system of the Joseon era. By the way, if you're on the fence about trying this game, it would be extremely helpful to you to watch the excellent Korean television shows Dae Jang Geum and/or Tree With Deep Roots (both extremely relevant, for different reasons), though I'm sure other Korean 'period dramas' set in the Joseon era would help spark your interest and understanding.\n\nBut, finally, the most important part of the game is the storytelling. In the end, the story itself is not as horribly complex as its made out to be as you go through it, but the way everything is revealed, piece by piece, has you drawing conclusions and asking questions that, of course, you cannot voice, but still feel more immersive and palpable than if you were to quietly come about them while reading the story as a plain narrative text. Having the characters play as guide and co-discoverer with you give a feeling of 'togetherness' that is traditionally difficult for games and books to thrust upon their users.\n\nIn closing, I can't wait any longer to play Hate Plus, and I hope to see more material from this game's author in the same vein.","February 14, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is by no means a game for everyone, but if you like reading books that do not shy away from heavy subjects and social issues, this is probably a game for you.\n\nThis story explores a real period of history with extreme gender inequality, but puts it in a science fiction setting. The start is a little hard to get into, but soon enough a highly compelling mystery story emerges, touching on topics as surpression, marital problems, abuse, forbidden love, and having to adapt to a society that is not your own. It is not pretty and some parts may be hard to read, but the interpersonal, psychological, and sociological aspects of it are very deep and realistic, and the pieces of the story come together in a horrifying yet unique and captivating way.\n\nIf all of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend playing/reading this interactive novel.\n\nAlso, be prepared that due to "technical issues" in the computer system of the space ship Mugunghwa, the AI will at times force you to give overly black and white answers to questions that really need a third option. When that happens, remember that in the story your possible answers are formulated by the AI, and as such are colored by their own way of thinking, not that of the protagonist.\n\n\n\nPS: if you want to experience almost all the story the game has to offer AND not spend a lot of time on multiple playthroughs, I have a small tip with only a very minor spoiler: At a certain point in the game you will be asked to confront the AI *Hyun-ae with questions.

There are cute anime chicks involved, as well as the ability to choose chat options with them in between reading.\n\nIn this story, you are a solo space traveler on an apparent contract job. (No you don't get to fly the ship.) Your job is to find out what happened to an old asian colony ship. With the help of the old ships AI(s), you have to dig up as much information on what happened to the crew through reading logs and eventually download the information for your client. While reading logs, the AI will ask you about what you read, or make a statement about the character(s) or problems involved with the entry, allowing you to get a bit more insight as to what happened. This gives a unique environment where you feel as if you are reading along side an AI, and can at times really get into the story.\n\nIt does not take long to get through the game, but expect a ton of reading. Purely a virtual novel at heart, but with a 'choose your own story' ending, thus creating a much more interactive environment than other VNs like the Sakura Paradise game (Where you really have no control over the game besides watch and hit next).\n\nThis story has a very large dose of maltreatment of the sexes... specificly the fairer sex, and points towards cultures that used to, and still do, treat them very poorly. The game is rather obvious fairly quickly in showing their agenda to create a sense of oppression which may be quite real in the world, may still be unwelcome to some players. So you have been warned if that is of little or no interest to you.\n\nAfter the game is done, there is little replay value besides getting the achievements, all the endings, and/or all the entries, yet the game does give you a feeling of completion and does not leave you 'in the dark' about anything, aside for what happens to your character and the AI after the game ends... but that is what the sequel is for.\n\nHope this review helped some of you make a decision on this game~","December 12, 2012","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game does, however, present itself in a different manner - the player must access archives that are slowly unlocked in order to learn more about the ship's sordid past, and what lead to its eventual dereliction. You do this with your sidekick AI partner *Hyun-ae.\n\nI cannot comment on the story for fear of spoilers, as this game is very story-centric indeed.

It has a good couple of side stories as well, but the main arc is where all the meat is at. You also have a second AI partner who you encounter (or not) after a certain point.\n\nOverall, I feel that Analogue manages to vary the visual novel platform enough to attract people that would otherwise not liken the visual novel structure.

There are cute anime chicks involved, as well as the ability to choose chat options with them in between reading.\n\nIn this story, you are a solo space traveler on an apparent contract job. (No you don't get to fly the ship.) Your job is to find out what happened to an old asian colony ship. With the help of the old ships AI(s), you have to dig up as much information on what happened to the crew through reading logs and eventually download the information for your client. While reading logs, the AI will ask you about what you read, or make a statement about the character(s) or problems involved with the entry, allowing you to get a bit more insight as to what happened. This gives a unique environment where you feel as if you are reading along side an AI, and can at times really get into the story.\n\nIt does not take long to get through the game, but expect a ton of reading. Purely a virtual novel at heart, but with a 'choose your own story' ending, thus creating a much more interactive environment than other VNs like the Sakura Paradise game (Where you really have no control over the game besides watch and hit next).\n\nThis story has a very large dose of maltreatment of the sexes... specificly the fairer sex, and points towards cultures that used to, and still do, treat them very poorly. The game is rather obvious fairly quickly in showing their agenda to create a sense of oppression which may be quite real in the world, may still be unwelcome to some players. So you have been warned if that is of little or no interest to you.\n\nAfter the game is done, there is little replay value besides getting the achievements, all the endings, and/or all the entries, yet the game does give you a feeling of completion and does not leave you 'in the dark' about anything, aside for what happens to your character and the AI after the game ends... but that is what the sequel is for.\n\nHope this review helped some of you make a decision on this game~","December 12, 2012","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Through the eyes of the impotent and the weak in a society, Love teaches about the corruption inherent in absolute power and the evils of paternalism.\n\nMuch like Margaret Atwood (especially in her "The Handmaid's Tale"), Love here very obviously takes a side, but unlike Atwood, Love exercises subtlety in her approach and refrains from meandering tracts meant to score political points against straw men. In Atwood's work, the message might as well have been duct-taped to an anvil and dropped on the reader's head, but here, the effect is just as shocking, but nowhere near as heavy-handed.\n\nThe art and sound are also excellent, more than enough to serve their purpose in delivering the story.\n\nWatch out, this one's got a wicked bite.\n\n== LambdaScores ==\nStory: 8/10 | Art: 7/10 | Sound: 7/10 | Engine: 7/10 | Overall: 7/10","December 2, 2013","true","5.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

This was written by a white Canadian and actually makes much more sense in the canlit tradition than it does in the visual novel scene. Cultural imperialism much, Ms. Love? But anyhow, it's basically the same idea as the Handmaid's Tale, with a dystopia that brings Old Sexism back quite abruptly. It even has the lesbian thing going.  So zero points for originality, sorry.\n\nBut honestly, it isn't as bad as I make it sound. The storytelling is compelling, in spite of the fact that it's essentially just 80% Outlook Express. And I certainly would rather read this than anything Atwood has ever written. And I'd love to see more visual novels making it on to Steam too, so we can encourage this for that reason alone too.\n\nStill, by visual novel standards this could be called 'mediocre at best'.\n\nThough by CanLit standards it probably would be termed as being 'pretty great'.\n\nTake that as you will.","November 9, 2013","true","2.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Like in its free predecessor Digital: A Love Story, Analogue's interface is immersive despite its abstraction. What you see before you is the same UI that we can suppose your character, a sort of detective-historian, is engaged with. Piece by piece, you uncover and read pieces of a chilling story, a tale of over-the-top (yet disturbingly believable) patriarchy, of dashed hopes, of bitterness and revenge. There are a handful of puzzles to contend with, some roleplay decisions to make, and different endings to seek out, but mostly, you read. Thus visual *novel*, natch.\n\nI had a few odd quibbles with the game; there's one highly important decision to make for determining which ending you get, but it's not apparent until after the fact that you've made that decision. Thankfully, playthroughs aren't terribly long, especially if you're a quick reader, so it's easy to flip back through and try again.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who likes to consume their reading with some interactivity alongside!","June 25, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it suceeds in this effort, its presentation and side game mechanics make it somewhat of a trying experience to play. Reading ship logs and diary entries, after all, is something you do in an atmospheric first person experience game like Ether One or Dear Esther, and the lack of any kind of eye popping visuals (or at least, immersion) makes this more akin to reading the Codex entries in Final Fantasy XIII (*shudder*). The hacking sequences were a good change of pace and would've helped make this a better game had they been more fleshed out and frequent.

There are a few images here and there (the images consist of two different AI characters, both show different emotions during the story), but other than that it's all text. And at times the player is asked to use some sort of command prompt. It's all fairly basic, but if you've never worked with command prompts it can be a bit tricky I guess, especially since there's a time based event later on in the 'game'.\nLike I said, there's a whole lot of reading. In daily life I rarely read so it took a bit of adjusting for me. It can be boring at times, even though the story is solid. Just don't go and expect a proper 'game' here. It isn't anything like that. But if you like a good read I suggest you give this a try. You might just be surprised.

While it suceeds in this effort, its presentation and side game mechanics make it somewhat of a trying experience to play. Reading ship logs and diary entries, after all, is something you do in an atmospheric first person experience game like Ether One or Dear Esther, and the lack of any kind of eye popping visuals (or at least, immersion) makes this more akin to reading the Codex entries in Final Fantasy XIII (*shudder*). The hacking sequences were a good change of pace and would've helped make this a better game had they been more fleshed out and frequent. Overall, this game does a decent job of what it set out to do, but could've done more to make it replayable. 6/10","June 12, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The sortyline is interesting, well written and absolutely intoxicating. The developer always manages it to make you wonder  "How will it go on ? What the heck happened here ?" And - at least in my case - the ending, or the solution to what happened aboard managed it to trigger something like a slight feeling of dismay.\n\nOkay, but what is this game acutally about ? You´re playing as some sort of investigator, checking on a derelict space craft. Or to be specific a generation ship. You´ll manage to get in touch with the ships AI system and start exposing the dark secrets which finally led to the crews downfall.\n\nIf you´ve never played a visual novel before - what exactly are those  ? Aren´t they these strange japanese porn games ?\nNope. You can imagine it like one of the old choose your own adventure books. Depending on the choices you make during the game, you´ll see one of several endings. Hm ... where have I seen that before ?\n\nRight ! Take one of the Telltale Games, substract most of the animation and replace it with some anime-styled pictures, add the point that most your choices will have an actual impact on the ending et voila - you´ve got a VN.\n\nSo, would I reccomend this game ? Hell, yes - i´d even go further: go and buy the sequel "Hate Plus" as well ... it gives some nice information, what happened before the story you´ll unfold and the story is as good as in the first game.","June 21, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Since you are using a remote connection, there is also command-line interface, which may entertain some, but it isn't really various or important.\n\nThe main things you need to know:\nThere are only two different AI, and, to be honest, you can count them as 1.3, since second is nearly broken and hard to interact with\nMain story is basically about gender unequality, and there isn't much else there\nAll names in story are korean, thus long and may be difficult for some to quickly adapt\nInteraction with AI is done in really special way, by showing them logs and responding to their answer to uncover more logs\nWith above said, it has nothing at all to do with dating sims\nMusic is decent, but there is a little of it\nLimitation of command-line interface may surprise you at some point (Althought i agree, not everyone plays VN's to fiddle with consoles)I completed it in 2 hours (it mainly depends on your reading speed), and while i am satisfied with storyline, i think it could have really been much better. Second AI, *Mute, is boring and i lost any interest in her storyline, just because it required re-reading nearly all previous logs (that isn't fast at all with leisurely log UI). When i tried to do interesting trick with switching ai near the end - guess what? - console simply given me error message, it cannot be done. Inconsistency of quality and that unexplained limitation really worsened the impression.\n\nOverall, this is a good game, but i believe many would expect much more from game which have "Overwhelmingly positive" rating, metascore says it.

Analogue will not give an adrenaline-rush game with action and things constantly happening. What Analogue does provide is a remarkable story far above what most any other game provides, an experience that is not easily brushed off, and in my opinion is one of the best games out there on steam.\n\nThe gameplay of Analogue isn't even what everybody would consider "gameplay." You read through the journal logs of people you don't know, skipping around between people. Between some of the reading, you converse with one of the two AI, mostly about them, yourself, or what you just read. Just about the entire gameplay experience is reading, and while this may seem boring Analogue is a game that shines when you really stick with it. At first, it does feel rather boring, and you find yourself not caring about what you are reading. But as time goes on, you really start to get deep into it and it becomes a remarkable story that you really feel invested in. The story itself is very dark, and at times gruesome, but never feels ridiculously so. The anime art style gives a major contrast to the dark themes in the story.\n\nThe game itself isn’t without its flaws. It really does take time to start to care about the logs, and there really isn’t anything to switch up the reading, save for answering some questions and a short and extremely easy cmd segment. Furthermore, one of the endings gives you a major moral choice, posing an extremely difficult question that is very hard to choose. However, if you choose one of them, it gives you essentially the same ending as a "game over." Technically you have completed the game, but it gives a sense that your moral position was "wrong" which is not appropriate to make a player feel like when you give them such a hard moral question and they respond with a perfectly valid and understandable answer. Some of the "dialogue" with the AIs can also feel unimportant and pointless at times.\n\nWhile the game isn’t perfect, Analogue: A Hate Story is still clearly a phenomenal game. It goes beyond what most games do, and delivers not only a great, deep story, but also one that has more impact than most any other video game story out there. It leaves you really thinking about morals, but more than "right-verses-wrong. Rather, it covers hard topics, such as self-preservation, revenge, guilt, manipulation, betrayal, politics, murder, oppression, women's rights, and domestic abuse. Some may compare it to a book because of the lack of control you have over what happens and the sheer amount of reading, but I disagree, as I feel no book could quite deliver the same impact as this game does. Overall, Analogue is a game that I highly recommend, and one that is worth the time to get invested in. It is a dark game with massive impact you will not soon forget, and I doubt you will regret purchasing if you really take the time to care about the brilliant story.\n","June 19, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And I say product because this doesn't necessarily qualify as a game. I was on the fence with this for a while because I wanted to expand my gaming genre horizons a little bit and decided that a visual novel would be a pretty big expansion. I downloaded the demo, tried to rush a little gameplay in before bed, and was surprised at the fact that there was none. I finally picked it back up on another day, when I could actually read without worrying about the time and actually got into the text. I was hooked instantly.\nI want to use the new Steam Review Feature, so I'll make a quick overview of the visual novel here.\n----------PROS\nNice Sy-fy setting\nUnique form of storytelling (I haven't seen it presented this way very much)\nPleasant art-style\nDeep subjects\nInteractivity\nMultiple endings\nKorean culture\n----------CONS\nLots of reading\nMinimalistic artwork\nShort Storylines\nKorean Culture\n\nI can't think of anything really bad about Analogue: A Hate Story, just know that it isn't a game. It's called a visual novel because there is a lot of reading. If you do not enjoy reading you probably would not enjoy A Hate Story. Another potential problem is that it has more "mature" topic matter. Nothing EXTREME, but it would most likely bore children since it has deeper subjects like ethnicity and sexuality. I haven't finished all the endings or found all the files yet, but so far I've only found 3 pages that might cause a problem. The worst in here is the word breast so far, and I don't think anything is going to get any worse.\nI don't like how each ending can be played in one sitting, but there are multiple endings so you could at least squeeze a few more playthroughs out of it.\n\nThe product features Korean, mostly only in the names. It won't be a problem though, because Analogue: A Hate Story goes as far as to give you a little cheat sheet so you know how to pronounce all those names. The downside is, the names are really confusing at first but that only helps make the story more submersive later on. If I remeber correctly, it's got full Korean support, so that's a plus too. If anyone is trying to learn Korean this is definitely something they should look into.\n\nThe interactivity is hard to explain. One thing over people seem to have problems with is visual novels with only the words and pictures and scenes. This isn't the case, and you'll need to do a lot of clicking and typing to complete stuff. (Keep in mind that that's all you do gameplay wise.)\n\nIt's got an anime/manga artstyle, but it's not intrusive and it shouldn't scare you away if that kind of stuff isn't your thing. There could have been better artstyles, but the manga one conveys the message well. It conveys the story better than a more realistic approach would for me, and it keeps in line with most visual novel styles that I know about.\n\nWhen I started it up and actually read everything, I wasn't expecting anything too good, but I kept reading and got interested in the plot. When the demo ended I bought the game instantly and kept playing. If you aren't sure about this product and haven't tried the demo, I highly recommend it.\n\nIt just blew me away personally, and it made me want more. I'm definitely going to try to read everything in this and the sequel. The best part is, it sparked my interest in the Koreas and Korean, and I'm wanting to try to learn more about it.\n\nWell, I'm tired and should be in bed as of the time of this review being written. I hope I could at least help someone.\n\nRECAP\nThis will be good for people who are new to the visual novel genre or want to try to get into it.\nThis is good for people who enjoy reading.\nThis will be good for someone who wants to think about the deeper meanings of things like politics or ethics.\nThis will be good for people who want to get into Korean and Korean culture.\nThis will be good for people who enjoy space-agey novels and such.","November 29, 2013","true","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And I say product because this doesn't necessarily qualify as a game. I was on the fence with this for a while because I wanted to expand my gaming genre horizons a little bit and decided that a visual novel would be a pretty big expansion. I downloaded the demo, tried to rush a little gameplay in before bed, and was surprised at the fact that there was none. I finally picked it back up on another day, when I could actually read without worrying about the time and actually got into the text. I was hooked instantly.\nI want to use the new Steam Review Feature, so I'll make a quick overview of the visual novel here.\n----------PROS\nNice Sy-fy setting\nUnique form of storytelling (I haven't seen it presented this way very much)\nPleasant art-style\nDeep subjects\nInteractivity\nMultiple endings\nKorean culture\n----------CONS\nLots of reading\nMinimalistic artwork\nShort Storylines\nKorean Culture\n\nI can't think of anything really bad about Analogue: A Hate Story, just know that it isn't a game. It's called a visual novel because there is a lot of reading. If you do not enjoy reading you probably would not enjoy A Hate Story. Another potential problem is that it has more "mature" topic matter. Nothing EXTREME, but it would most likely bore children since it has deeper subjects like ethnicity and sexuality. I haven't finished all the endings or found all the files yet, but so far I've only found 3 pages that might cause a problem. The worst in here is the word breast so far, and I don't think anything is going to get any worse.\nI don't like how each ending can be played in one sitting, but there are multiple endings so you could at least squeeze a few more playthroughs out of it.\n\nThe product features Korean, mostly only in the names. It won't be a problem though, because Analogue: A Hate Story goes as far as to give you a little cheat sheet so you know how to pronounce all those names. The downside is, the names are really confusing at first but that only helps make the story more submersive later on. If I remeber correctly, it's got full Korean support, so that's a plus too. If anyone is trying to learn Korean this is definitely something they should look into.\n\nThe interactivity is hard to explain. One thing over people seem to have problems with is visual novels with only the words and pictures and scenes. This isn't the case, and you'll need to do a lot of clicking and typing to complete stuff. (Keep in mind that that's all you do gameplay wise.)\n\nIt's got an anime/manga artstyle, but it's not intrusive and it shouldn't scare you away if that kind of stuff isn't your thing. There could have been better artstyles, but the manga one conveys the message well. It conveys the story better than a more realistic approach would for me, and it keeps in line with most visual novel styles that I know about.\n\nWhen I started it up and actually read everything, I wasn't expecting anything too good, but I kept reading and got interested in the plot. When the demo ended I bought the game instantly and kept playing. If you aren't sure about this product and haven't tried the demo, I highly recommend it.\n\nIt just blew me away personally, and it made me want more. I'm definitely going to try to read everything in this and the sequel. The best part is, it sparked my interest in the Koreas and Korean, and I'm wanting to try to learn more about it.\n\nWell, I'm tired and should be in bed as of the time of this review being written. I hope I could at least help someone.\n\nRECAP\nThis will be good for people who are new to the visual novel genre or want to try to get into it.\nThis is good for people who enjoy reading.\nThis will be good for someone who wants to think about the deeper meanings of things like politics or ethics.\nThis will be good for people who want to get into Korean and Korean culture.\nThis will be good for people who enjoy space-agey novels and such.","November 29, 2013","true","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The description makes this look like some kind of dating game (a very small, neglectable part is though), but instead, you get a deep and exciting story.\nAnalogue: A Hate Story is a visual epistolary novel, kind of an e-book with interactivity. The 4 to 5 hour story (you can 100% the game in about 7 to 8 hours if you set the right saves) centers around the events on a space colony ending up in an disaster killing everyone on the ship, including a girl put in stasis for centuries waking up in a deeply misogynistic society and the two AIs who hate each other and have been alone in the system for 600 years. The goal of the game is to find the saved logs and explore them, revealing the scandals, secrets and connections leading to the fall of the Mugunghwa.\n\nVERDICT: Very short, but great game if you are okay with having to read a lot and not having a "real" game.

Not as linear as a VN but that's to its benefit. The story is pretty interesting and the two characters you interact with both have plenty of personality. Even if it's entirely possible to go an entire playthrough barely talking to one of them, which is a bit silly. One complaint is that the event that determines which ending you get is... kind of hard to figure out at first since there's no indication of what specifically locks you into an ending, it just happens out of nowhere. Other than that though... dialogue is good, art style is good enough for the medium.

It'll take you about an hour to finally get a handle on who is who.\n\nThis game has a lot of choices.  I'm a fan of the visual novels with three choices max.  Each creating a separate ending.  Having too many choices makes you start second-guessing whether or not you made the right one.  Unless you're aiming for a certain achievement, most of them don't matter.\n\nAnd finally, there are some minor inconsistencies.  For instance, you have a multiple choice user input because text translation is not supposed to be working.  And yet you are still able to use the text field to find specific records.  If you go out on a limb and believe that the text field is directly linked to the underlying command line operating system and not to the AI generated user interface, then it makes sense.  But it's a complicated explanation and there's no implication that that's the case.\n\nOverall this story tells a tale that makes you decide which side is right and which side is wrong.  But there are some stunning reveals contained within both sides that make you realize that your first conclusion was wrong.  So if you get the game, check out both sides.\n\nThen try and figure out whether or not the perpetrator of the Mugunghwa's final moments were justified.","January 25, 2014","true","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not as linear as a VN but that's to its benefit. The story is pretty interesting and the two characters you interact with both have plenty of personality. Even if it's entirely possible to go an entire playthrough barely talking to one of them, which is a bit silly. One complaint is that the event that determines which ending you get is... kind of hard to figure out at first since there's no indication of what specifically locks you into an ending, it just happens out of nowhere. Other than that though... dialogue is good, art style is good enough for the medium.

You control what information you get when, and you'll have to play at least twice to get all of it. The story sucked me in completely, and I actually gasped and teared up at some of the revelations that were uncovered. And I love the secret ending.

While the former is your average girl, the latter is a deeply misogynistic "tsundere" kind of girl. Themes of the story include feminism, patriarchy and misogyny without the usual distaste surrounding these topics in addition to the ones mentioned on the store page.\n\nGive this game a go, it may surprise you, after all it did manage to surprised me!","February 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you don't agree with it, which you get the option to do like once because the game is 95% reading, the game just ends. So play this only if you don't mind huge factual distortions and bias.\n\nThe author doesn't pay much attention to the facts of Joseon Korea on which its society claims to be based. It is breathtakingly bigoted to simplify 500 years of Joseon Korean culture, society, history and upheaval into TYRANNICAL PATRIARCHY. Essentially, this Hate Story is a feminist diatribe against a society which the author knows sweet dang all about. You get the privilege of paying to read it.\n\nThat said, if you can get past the head-bashing insistence with which the author cries THESE GIRLS ARE SOOOO OPPRESSED, the game holds up as a functional sci-fi flick with some Korean elements. If that's quirky enough to get your attention, give it a try by all means, but please take what it says about Joseon society with a huge portion of salt.","June 23, 2015","false","2.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","1"

The art is nicely down for the characters.  And...well, it's quick.\n\nCONS: This visual novel has many failings.  The two female AI's are both rather unlikeable, both their actions beforehand and after.  They try to give a sympathetic reason to make their actions acceptable, but it fails.  The story is relatively dull, and the endings don't really feel satisfying.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS: Relatively simple, no real problems getting any of them.\n\nFINAL: The visual novel's failings are it's major downfall.  Some could enjoy the more moe designs they try to go for, as well as the tsundere, but it's not something I will be returning to.","February 27, 2015","false","5.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This tale needed to be in this interactive format and shines as a result.\n\nOn top of all this, the game is startlingly well researched.

Since much of the game is made up of reading diaries, you would think that a bug like this would have been ironned out.  Sadly, this was just the start of the games problems.\n\nI can't remember the last time I had such a hard time following a games plot.  I've played through other visual novels with tonnes of characters and questionallably translated JRPGs, but this is just the worst.  The plot revolves around three families living on a spaceship with a society that mimics medival Korea.  There's the Ryu family, the Kim family and the... Smith... family.  The problem is all of these characters have Korean names (even the Smiths), but no one outside of the two AI characters gets any art.  You'll be spending a lot of time backtracking through older diary entries trying to remember who's who.\n\nThe game is just a pain to play.  Wait for the price on this turdpile to hit $2.50 on a Steam sale if you're genuinly curious, but otherwise stay the hell away.","February 3, 2014","false","0.6"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","1"

This has to be the best visual novel ever! What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWell, just about everything because this game is something that belongs to every social justice warriors game collection. Game is practically a tool for feminist (and I mean feminist in the bad way, you know what I mean) propaganda, is filled with (the usual) half-if-at-all thought and contradicting morals and values that are pushed right down your throat in every single turn possible. Story completely ignores both cultural and individual differences, has no place for a voice of reason or common sense and throws all middle grounds out of the window. In this game you are either a sick monster (you know, a white male heterosexual) with your opinions or a liberal fairy without a gender identity.\n\nThings we learn from the story are that\n1) having a gender is a bad thing\n2) marriage and family is even more so\n3) tradition is always bad and should just be erased along with everything not fitting into anarcho-liberal thoughtbox\n4) all men perceiving themselves as males are evil and/or stupid drunks and the only one worth your feelings are those puffs that "surprise you every day" with agreeing to everything you say\n5) all women are stupid slaves (and of course evil) unless they think the way script writer does\n6) having a child is the worst that could ever happen\n7) good women enjoy sex with strangers and try to be lesbian while cheating their husbands if possible\n8) it is OK and fine and recommended to perform a genocide, killing thousands of innocent men, women and children, if you have been treated like ♥♥♥♥ at some point in your life\nYes, seriously.\n\nThere are multiple endings (for a person in his/her right mind, perhaps only one) but they are not that rewarding. Story ends, you'll get an ending screen with some vague nonsense and credits and that's it. There's a few concept art to be unlocked and the trophies but they really are not worth subjecting yourself to the stuff you will be fed.\n\nIt's a shame really as technically this was pretty good for a visual novel. It had its moments and a decent writing. The other AI in the game, *Mute, was perhaps a little more sane than the main character. Actually the moment with her was probably the best part of the game I think. I'm pretty sure there is some ideology pushing behind her too depending on the choices you make though. Also, the override terminal was a fun little addition and a change to the otherwise static experience.","June 6, 2015","false","5.7"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","8","19","2","0"

Second, you will not have fun playing it. In fact, you will be appalled, /horrified/ by this software at times. As more and more information is revealed to you, you are told a story about thoroughly contrasting values, misogyny and arranged marriages in a society where people are ignorant of the very environment around them and women are treated like things, not like people. With all this said, though, it's worth going through it, because it invites you to think about how society can regress into archaism when it doesn't find a way to progress and, apart of the misogyny and arranged marriage dilemma, it also offers a question: When computers become advanced enough, what makes them different from humans?

The tales told are very gripping, and based on cultural values and traditions upheld during the Joseon-era of Korean history.

Real sexism is much more nuanced and subtle and complex, and that's what makes it such an interesting and powerful subject. The game is none of those things. It also never explains why a highly-advanced sentient AI which is obviously capable of extremely large calculations would develop misogynous beliefs based on confirmation and statistical bias, or why a patriarchy would suddenly arise in a sovereign society that is free from warfare, predators, disease, natural disasters, and economic scarcity in the first place.","November 20, 2014","false","3.1"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","15","34","0","0"

Reading through the logs while your AI side kick gives you information about the people who wrote those logs and trying to uncover the mystery which led the space ship mugunghwa to its current state, this game makes you question what is right and what is wrong. Make you wonder if there is really something called "right", while you read through all the text it gives you. Reading happy memories, tragic events, scandalous diaries just makes it all the more interesting. It is as if such a community existed there and you really are reading memories of their daily life.\n\nAnother different point of this game, for me at least (I don't know if there are other VNs featuring this kindof stuff since I didn't play so many Vns), that it introduces you a different viewpoint about computers and AIs. To make this review spoiler free, I won't go into detail, but you interact with AIs as if they are humans, and deal with their personalities.\n\nOf course there were things I didn't like about the game. The most obvious one was the lack of things you could do with the console. I think if we had other events other than a certain one to really rely on the console. Again, for the sole purpose of not giving spoilers I won't go into detail, but I can say this, it is as if the whole console is just there so you can use it when it is necessary, and further playing with it won't be very useful. Especially given that it can cause bugs in the game.\n\nOverall, I liked the game as it is, but I could have liked it more, what's more, the game has a sequel, which I am currently playing, and it just add to the spice of the story. I recommend this game to everyone who wants read a good story with good twists and characters, to people wants to have good visual novel experience with a different way of story telling, and to everyone who wants to have a change of pace and try something new by giving a go for visual novels.","January 13, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But boy was I amazed. The stories that are fleshed out in this game are a interesting mixture of emotions and events. The typing in the console felt like playing a hacking sim (... one can dream, right?). And the ship AI felt interesting (later in the game even more so).\nThere is a some-what of a dating sim vibe that some of the interactions create, but the story keeps everything quite serious and thus even more emotional. No childish stuff (if your looking for that ... look elsewhere).\n\nThis adventure has one goal - download the data. . .\nBut do you want to do that when you have the possibility to continue exploring the past of the Mugunghwa's last generation?\nI guess in the end it's all up for you to decide.\nBut I can honestly say that this game is worth trying out.","January 14, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it's obvious that reading texts is the core of the premise of that kind of game but the complexity of the story definitely didn't captivated me.

Analogue: A Hate Story  is a game where you, a freelance investigator, delve into the archives of a long lost spaceship in an attempt to uncover the mystery behind it. Throughout this task, you recieve the help and company of the ship's two AIs, each with their unique personality. I strongly recommend this game for anyone interested in a short (2-3 hour) story filled with mystery, despair, loneliness, and love. Be prepared, however, as the game focusess heavily on reading. Do not expect much action, although there is a certain point in the game that will keep you on your toes, so don't be too relaxed either. There are 5 different endings, and different choices to make throughout the game, so it definitely has some replay value.\n\n9/10 for a good short game with likable characters and a heart-warming(and wrenching) story.

Looking past its very typical anime presentation, there is a really intriguing story and compelling mechanics. There are a couple of cringey fan service moments, and there is a bit of silly romance in there with the AI you spend a lot of the game interacting with, but for the most part you will be trawling through archives of diaries and letters on an abandoned space station, filled with family fueds and intrigue, and you will eventually learn what happened to the station and the people on it. Because you're reading through people's very personal writings, you get a very intimate perspective on the whole story that works wonderfully to make the long dead characters come to life again.\n\nIf you're interested in playing games with good stories, I would recommend trying this out, and it's very accessible for people who haven't played visual novels before.","December 30, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Analogue: A Hate Story doesn't disappoint- it touches on many mature themes such as sexism, homosexuality, and more. It also paints a unique picture of an ancient fuedal-like society aboard a sci-fi space station, meshing the old with the new. The writing is spot-on and makes for a great read.\nThat is, if you like reading- this is a really simple sort of novel in that there is little to no scenery change, and only a decent amount of interaction. Additionally the user interface is not the easiest to get used to, mainly the command console- you will very likely at some point seek a guide for the command you'd like to use for a certain section. Otherwise the UI is fine, if plain- take a look at the screenshots, as it's what the entire game looks like.\n\nAside from those very minor gripes, if you get this game you're in for some great and thoughtful reading. It's a great story, and will take more than one playthrough to really understand and see everything.","December 31, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, it's obvious that reading texts is the core of the premise of that kind of game but the complexity of the story definitely didn't captivated me. Anyway, when you put the multiple elements apart and pay exclusive attention to the objective part of the novel, it's certainly unique in a sort of way, so in my opinion, this game deserves a thumbs up.","November 29, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Analogue: A Hate Story doesn't disappoint- it touches on many mature themes such as sexism, homosexuality, and more. It also paints a unique picture of an ancient fuedal-like society aboard a sci-fi space station, meshing the old with the new. The writing is spot-on and makes for a great read.\nThat is, if you like reading- this is a really simple sort of novel in that there is little to no scenery change, and only a decent amount of interaction. Additionally the user interface is not the easiest to get used to, mainly the command console- you will very likely at some point seek a guide for the command you'd like to use for a certain section. Otherwise the UI is fine, if plain- take a look at the screenshots, as it's what the entire game looks like.\n\nAside from those very minor gripes, if you get this game you're in for some great and thoughtful reading. It's a great story, and will take more than one playthrough to really understand and see everything.","December 31, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't have to make choices based on what you think the characters want you to say; doing so won't necessarily lead to a "bad" ending.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will sometimes make you feel conflicted, sad, angry, curious and happy all at once, I recommend it :)\n\nBasically, wouldn't say it's "the best game EVAR" but definitely worth a play if you're into the "style" of game that involves a lot of reading/story and decision making; as part of that genre it's a gem.","December 3, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(The name is a play on a previous game, Digital: A Love Story.) As you read the various logs, you also discuss them with the ship's two AIs to get the full picture.\n\n(This is all from the early part of the story to avoid spoilers. If you don't want to see story, skip this paragraph.) The story that unravels revolves around a sick young girl in a culture much like modern Korea who is placed in a stasis pod in hopes that future technology can cure her. She is instead woken up far in the future where culture has actually regressed several centuries, and not only can they not cure her, but they instantly arrange a marriage against her will to gain status for the family.\n\nThis is a very sad story, but powerful and worth reading. It's not for kids, though.\n\nThere's not a ton of gameplay here to judge. The music is pretty nice, and the soundtrack isn't a bad purchase. Ultimately, the value of this game hangs entirely on its story, and if you're not interested in reading it, then this game has nothing for you.

The actual visual novel elements are solid, giving you plenty of room to make different choices which heavily affect your relations with the ships two main AI's- Hyun-ae, and Mute.\n\n- Characters -\nThis might fall short, considering there are only three actual characters in the game, including yourself. However, I found the ships two AI's to be both unique and well written, each in their own way. I can't say much for Mute herself, as I went with Hyun-ae's route, however the limited dialogue I had with her was... Well, certainly interesting. As for Hyun-ae, she happens to be my favorite part of the game, being extremely likable and interesting right from the start.\n\n- Story -\nThe story is sort of in the backround, but no less involving and important. As I mentioned before, you uncover most of it through the ships various documents, and through talking with both the ships AI's. It seems to be a take on a post-apocalyptic (sort of?) take on japanese culture mixed with a lot of science fiction elements. Confusing, right? Nonetheless, it tells a surprisingly human and very thought provoking story, on morales, cultures, and general humanity as a whole.\n\n- Final thoughts -\nOverall, I had a lot of fun with this game, dispite it being a bit short (about four hours, but I'm a fast reader), it tells a compelling story, has some great characters, and is overall a generally good experience. Definately would recommend.\n\n***9.5/10***","January 15, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically all of Christine Love's work is, but these are just amazing.\n\n\nI actually like Hate Plus more in some ways and Analogue more in others. So I'm torn as far as which is better, but I can safely say that they were both well worth the effort. I have like 4 hours on this game, but I actually played it through multiple times--I read insanely fast--and can safely say that I'm glad I did so.\n\nWriting: Best part, honestly. Love's writing is able to be expressive and emotional with ease. Characters have their own voices, their own personalities--and with this many characters, you better believe that's a feat. Nothing is over wrought or underwritten. This is an episolatory Visual Novel, and it works.\n\n\nGraphics stuff: I liked the interface. The console part was the least impressive, and some people might find it rather hard to believe considering the advanced tech--though keep in mind that the ship is only a few hundred years ahead of us in its origin--but its a callback to Love's earlier freeware game, Digital: A Love Story and reminded me a bit of the Amie interface. The two AIs are Animu waifu material. No way around that. The art is good quality, though, and their expressions are both endearing and rather genuinely funny. Mute's a bit more expressive, but that fits the character.\n\n\nMusic: It's good! However, it's far from amazing. Digital: A Love Story's soundtrack was PERFECT and I want it rather badly--Analogue and Hate Plus's is decent and I wouldn't mind paying a few bucks for it. There were a lot of good chances to use music to set scenes that were passed up.\n\n\nAll in all? 10/10. Yes, it's not perfect, but a 10 isn't for perfection. It's for games that leave me either thirsty for more ad infinitum or games that after I play them I turn the computer off, stumble into bed, and think lots of big, scary thoughts. This game and its sequel do both.\n\n\nTry it. It's only $10.\n\n\n(Also, if you're still unsure, try Digital: A Love Story and "Don't Take it Personal, Babe, it just ain't your story" which are both free and by the same person.)","March 7, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because what Analogue really is, is a multi-faceted adventure story that you, the protaganist, can only read about - except of course, when it comes to life around you in the form of a ship's AI who was there at the time. The two AI, Hyun-ae and Mute, are gorgeous in their differences, and humorous in comparison, one showing somethings while hiding others and vice versa. And it's a good thing you've got these two (ONLY two? In a VN? But but... yeah. This is no ero story :P) chirpy and/or eager-to-please starbabes to guide you through the diaries of  the Mugungwe's last days because... Everyone will read something different into the historical world created, into the character of the Pale Bride, and into how everything comes to a conclusion. I, for one, fell helplessly in love with a fake AI in a game... so there's that.\n\nHowever you choose to enjoy the game, as an explorer, as a route seeker, as a completionist, there are hours of... entertainment, I won't always say enjoyment. Some messages are uncomfortable to hear and Christina Love does, once again, a wonderful job of giving us a rude awakening to things we might rather ignore.\n\nRead like a novel, this is harrowing and heartfelt. Read in role-play, truly reacting to and feeling with Hyun-ae... it'll darn near break your heart. All the recommends.","March 7, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those people are, I think, completely missing the point of Analogue: A Hate Story. It's not a dating sim. Sure, there are elements of that format, and you do have the ability to manipulate the story somewhat through your responses. However, this game is more of a visual novel in the purest sense: it invites you to uncover a story. Apparently there's 59,000 words of text in this game, so if you're feeling unfulfilled by finishing subsequent playthroughs within ten minutes like one of the top-rated negative reviewers, you're doing it wrong.\n\nTo be fair, Analogue is a short game. There's not a huge amount to it, and it doesn't take a significant time investment to complete. However, what is there is charming and thought-provoking, with a surprisingly interesting - if slightly two-dimensional - story to be dug through. I'm sure if you were to put the game into Skip Mode, you probably could get the best ending in ten minutes, but you'd be totally missing the point. Experience this game as if it were a book, for after all, that is what a good visual novel is intended to emulate.","March 7, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not one where you pit your -supposed- skills against computer- or human-controlled opponents. It offers a fairly refreshing twist to the way stories are normally told.\n\nFirst off, let me say upfront that if action is all that matters to you (and/or you're not a fan of visual novels), don't even bother looking at this game - you're entirely incompatible with it and simply won't think much of it, so save yourself time and don't bother with the demo (or reading the rest of this review). In fact, the screenshots on the game's page are all you will ever see in the game, the rest is up to your imagination. You won't see the Mugunghwa or its interior, nor your own ship's. There is no voice acting, and all you will ever interact with are two AI individuals, and an override terminal through which you can switch between the two and perform some other tasks.\n\nHowever, if you are willing to look beyond that, the storyline is actually pretty interesting. It's really hard to explain it without spoiling anything, and I think the description on the game's page does a fairly good job of explaining the context. I recommend giving the demo a go, it's well worth your time if you're willing to look deeper than the seemingly simple first impression - I was already captivated by the storyline in the demo, and so much so that it successfully persuaded me to get the full game.\n\nUnfortunately, if you're still unfamiliar with the names, the questions the AI occasionally asks of your opinion will sometimes catch you off guard as you struggle to recall who they're talking about, and the inability to refer to the family tree at that juncture only serves to compound the problem.\n\nAt some point in the game, the override terminal will temporarily become an integral part of your story, so don't forget how to use it (although it should be easy to figure out how). It would be nice if it supported tabbed commands (i.e. pressing tab to autocomplete partially entered commands) and command history (i.e. using the up and down cursor keys to speed up entry of repeated commands) just like its real life counterparts, since at the abovementioned point in the game, you'll find yourself typing largely the same commands over and over.\n\nAll in all, a piece well worthy of your time.","April 30, 2012","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the Mugunghwa you find two AI's in charge of the logs of the ship. The gameplay is pretty simple, read the logs, show them to the AI's so they can help you find more, and repeat until you are satisfied. Maybe you can get one of the AI's back home, maybe not, or maybe both.\nBut what makes this so amazing is the backstory behind the Mugunghwa, its people and its tragic conclusion. Saying anything about that would be considered spoiler, so if you want to know what happened, either buy this, try the demo to catch a glimpse, or get spoiled somewhere else, I'm not talking anymore about the heartbreaking story.\nOnly found a pair of problems with this game. First, sometimes it's possible to get "stuck", specially during the meltdown sequence. That's not neccesarily bad, but can get frustrating. The other problem comes with the specs. Even if my computer can move this, sometimes it lags a little bit. It doesn't affect the gameplay, but can be annoying from time to time.\nSo overall, this game is simply pure love, 9/10 on my opinion. It's entertaining, enjoyable and fun, yet it can make you sad, or even have people lose hope in mankind. How's that possible?

If you're not, you should pick it up anyway, or be lame and wait for a sale. Either way, Analogue: A Hate Story is a game that on paper sounds terribly boring, and yet it is one of the deepest games I've played, and kept me hooked an entire weekend. In this game, you are not important. You are investigating the sudden reappearance of a long lost colony space ship. Hundreds of years later, it's entire crew is dead. The only intelligent being left is a very lonely AI, who you encounter when attempting to access the ship's mainframe. With her help, you investigate the ship's logs, and peer into the inner most thoughts of the ship's occupants. It's amazing how Cristine Love brings them to life. It starts innocent enough in attempting to solve the mystery of the ship's access codes, but then becomes a mystery: What happened to the ship's occupants turns into Who is the Pale Bride, and what happened to her? Then, your heart breaks. I highly, highly recommend that you try this game. If you've ever enjoyed a visual novel or an adventure game, there's a good chance you'll love it as much as I did. Christine Love is a master of story telling.","February 16, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it would be like Japanese Visual Novel. Nevertheless, I gave this game a chance, and start interacting with the AI and read the message on and on.\n\nAnd guess what, I got sucked in so deep to the story it unfolded--the way these message presented its novel, it just makes me hunger to find out the truth. Different AI provided different point of view and revealing different story and scandal. I must take it all back that I feel dissaponted with this game.\n\nThis game is really good, with highly addictive story in the form of message and interactive AI. Yes, it is different from the normal Japanese Visual Novel, but different doesn't mean this game is not enjoyable.\n\nIf you love a good story filled with emotional torrents, and two cute AI to interact with, then give this game a chance. Trying playing its demo first if you must. And in the end, I guaranteed you that you will get addicted to the story that you cannot stop playing... it's like you need to keep on going for the desires of finding out the truth of what really happened on that spaceship.","February 16, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, based on novel, and games, and any other form of story-telling, this game holds it's own. To me, it feels like uncovering the lost lore of the fallout universe, paired with a rather well done romance system, that leaves you wanting to play the game until you've gotten every ending.\n\n*very minor spoilers*\n\nThe story begins with you being told to go investigate the wreckage of a ship, and download as many data logs as you can find. When you go to access the main console, you are told that you need a password to be given administrator access in order to download them. However, even after finding the password, you're not going to download the files and leave. The AI commentary, and the story behind the ship being wrecked are absolutely rivoting, and at the end, you'll find yourself a little depressed if you didn't find %100 of the ship's logs.

While rather short - about five hours - I thoroughly enjoyed it. It gets rather emotional, and even more so if you allow yourself to be immersed into the setting. It took me a while to make sense of everything - probably about half an hour - but once you understand who all of the major players are, and start to grasp the setting, things really get awesome.\n\nSadly, the emotional impact was diminished quite a bit whilst trying to achieve the alternate endings. Going over documents I had already read just wasn't quite as stimulating as the first time, although ocassionally I'd stumble over new content that would make me laugh (or cry, as it were).\n\nAnyway, if you like the concept of video games as art, I think you'll absolutely love this game.

There are very limited choices when it comes to the visual novel genre on Steam, but this is well worth the find. You play as a lonely investigator sent into deep space to sort out the mystery of a ship in which the entire crew was murdered. It might sound like the plot of a horror game, but believe me it's nothing like that. You start out typing commands into a computer prompt, figuring out how to maneuver through the operating system. Later you'll come to meet the two remaining members of the ship: two AI girls known as Hyun-ae and Mute. The two have very different opinions on what happened; and their conflicting stories will add to your dilemma. You spend the rest of the game rather tediously sorting through encrypted ship logs one by one...the only boring part of the game, really. Reading each log is immensely interesting, though; like reading a rich novel filled with romance, political intrigue, drama and suspense. You will also interact with the girls a lot; who you believe, the choices you make, what logs you decide to show to them and how you answer your question will guide the story to it's conclusion.

It's also a bit more accesible than Analogue: A Hate Story, so in general it's a good place to start to see if you even like Love's style before spending money on a more involved and intense story.\n\nNow, when I say Digital has a interesting execution, that isn't to say Analogue doesn't. It is similar in many ways, but it's different - which is good, really. The interface of both games fits the story and setting. Analogue does feel more like a visual novel, though. But probably because it's longer and there is quite a bit more reading. However, it's a complex story, and told in a way that is engaging. It also manages to deal with many serious themes. Patriatrcy, sexism, sexuality -- to name a few.\n\nSo, try Digital: A Love Story and if you like it, then chances this is a game for you (mind you, this is... well it is called "A Hate Story"). Or, just buy this first and find out and then go back to Digital! And forward to Hate Plus (which I haven't played yet. But it did just come out about a week ago, as of writing this..\n\nAnd to repeat myself, I think, be warned: this contains mature themes and the story may trigger some people, as it deals with abuse and more.","August 24, 2013","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you start up the game, you will meet Hyun-ae; a lovely AI that will be your assistant throughout the novel (based on your actions). In order to get into the mood of the novel, it is a must that you develop a feeling for the AI, for they have feelings towards you as well.

In the game, you are investigating a generation ship that disappeared 600 years ago and has just been found. You’re tasked with finding out what happened by reading through the ship’s logs. The ship has two AI which can help you with your mission, though they aren’t particularly reliable narrators.\n\nGameplay mainly consists of reading through the ship’s logs and asking the AI about them, who may then open up new logs for you. The main interface for accessing the logs is slick, attractive, and very easy to use. There is also a Linux console interface which you use to perform certain actions on the ship, such as enabling or disabling the AI, or downloading the log files. As someone who has never used Linux I found this interface a bit puzzling at first. It’s the first thing you see when the game starts and it took me a few minutes to figure out what it was expecting me to do.\n\nThe most exceptional part of the game is the writing. The logs, written as diary entries are enthralling. There are multiple authors and each one has a clear and distinct voice. They paint a picture of a spacefaring society that has somehow regressed into a medieval patriarchy. You don’t get access to all the entries though, and often get things out of order, so you need to piece together the story for yourself. Depending on which AI you have active, you may learn some parts of the story but not others. It’s quite well done.\n\nAs for the interaction with the AI though… ehh. One AI is a giggly, cosplay-loving schoolgirl. The other is a casually misogynist and homophobic security program.  If I had known nothing about the creator of this game, Christine Love, I likely would have written the game off as sexist drivel and quit before I got too far in. However, I assumed that there was probably going to be a bigger point or message to the game, so I continued.\n\nI haven’t played a ton of visual novels before, the most similar experience I’ve had to this was Long Live the Queen. An aspect of the genre I find hard to reconcile is that I want to see multiple endings, but the process of replaying and trying new things to get to those endings is exceedingly tedious. Careful use of saves can reduce the amount of repetition, but it’s hard to know exactly when the important branches take place and I find myself mindlessly clicking through things I’ve already read/seen way more than is enjoyable.\n\nVerdict: Recommended for those who like the genre. The writing is strong and the story is compelling. While I personally don’t enjoy the repetitiveness required to experience all of the endings, I think this game will appeal to fans of visual novels.","November 27, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a nameless, genderless, ageless space investigator sent to read the logs of the long-dead in order to understand what happened on board the generation ship, Mugunghwa. You do this with the assistances of two AI, *Hyun-ae, a young woman, and *Mute, the ship's security system. They are the powerful personalities that make this game worth playing, and if you're anything like me, you will fall in love with them both.\n\nWarning: the logs deal with physical and emotional abuse aimed towards children. It also explores homophobia, speifically towards lesbians, misogyny and classism. Forgive me if I spelt any of those words wrong.\n\nAnalogue's gameplay is entirely text based. You will be reading log after log after log. Initially, the logs aren't that interesting, but very quickly, I was drawn into the game. The GUI is sleek and actually does feel like a futuristic computer. It's simple and easy to use, and it's unlikely you'll ever get lost. The most confusing it gets is when you need to prompt the AI to search for more logs by clicking on logs written by the particular person you wish to investigate.\n\n(I hope that sentence made sense).\n\nThe real focus of this game is the AI, although Analogue focuses more on *Hyun-ae then *Mute. (*Mute's game is Hate Plus, the sequel to Analogue, which I also recommend you buy). I won't spoil anything, but through these women, you're confronted with some serious moral ambiguity. Actions and beliefs that are objectively terrible are rationalized, and suddenly you're not sure what to think.\n\nThe minor characters are basically every person you'll read about in the logs. They all serve their purpose; no-one is focused on so extensively that they over-shadow everyone else. Moreover, they all feel like real people. The logs are well written and feel genuine...although I do feel the lesbian sex between too women was written in more detail then strictly necessary.\n\nYour choices matter in this game, btw, particular when you're finally given the option to stop being a genderless and ageless entity. Whether you select male or female will influnce one AI significantly.\n\nOverall, this is a very good game. It's heart-felt, its well-written, its fascinating, and its cheap.

You play as a lonely investigator sent into deep space to sort out the mystery of a ship in which the entire crew was murdered. It might sound like the plot of a horror game, but believe me it's nothing like that. You start out typing commands into a computer prompt, figuring out how to maneuver through the operating system. Later you'll come to meet the two remaining members of the ship: two AI girls known as Hyun-ae and Mute. The two have very different opinions on what happened; and their conflicting stories will add to your dilemma. You spend the rest of the game rather tediously sorting through encrypted ship logs one by one...the only boring part of the game, really. Reading each log is immensely interesting, though; like reading a rich novel filled with romance, political intrigue, drama and suspense. You will also interact with the girls a lot; who you believe, the choices you make, what logs you decide to show to them and how you answer your question will guide the story to it's conclusion.

Haven't gotten around to the second game in the series at the time I wrote this post, so my review is based on only this first one and what I've completed of it thus far.\n\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nFor a low priced VN (9.99) the graphics were pretty amazing. I wasn't expecting the graphics to be were they were, so it was very nice to be surprised by this.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nProbably one of the most interesting things about this VN. It is a VN, so don't expect 3D action, but man were some of the puzzles and choices intruiging. The puzzles were not hard, but not necessarily easy. One of them even gives an alternate ending, which is interesting. I also like the computer aspect where you have to type in the information via the keyboard. Over-all. it was an interesting style and I would love to see more styles like this.\n\nCharacters: 7.5/10\nThe characters were also quite interesting. Both girls had their own unique personality, making you either hate or like them (I liked both personally). The design for both of them were also nicely done, adding more to the uniqueness of them. I didn't rate an 8 due to the fact that only one of the 2 had a in-depth background while the other was given some, but nowhere near as much as the other. (Might change after getting rest of trophies)\n\nStory: 7.5/10\nThe story was really, I mean really. interesting. It took place in a spaceship out in space. You have a possibility to end up with 1 of 2 girls (or both if you get the harem ending) or obtain the bad ending. This much is common in most VNs, but the uniqueness of this one is the files and history. Both the files and certain options you make will give detailed information about the past of the game's story. Then there's the fact that the story of the second game is determined by what ending you got in the first one, a little twist not seen in most. Put simply, a wonderfuly (but short) storyline with interesting twists.\n\nOver-All: 8/10\nI would most certainly recommend this to both begginers and advanced VN readers.  =(^,.,^)=","November 16, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celisasu/recommended/209370/","celisasu","Celisasu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celisasu/","246 products in account","For those not familiar with them, this game is a visual novel.  There's not much action and everything is about telling the story.  Your decisions effect where the story ends up.  The mechanics are a bit different than other visual novels.  You're in the future studying the logs of a Korean generational ship trying to find out how everyone on it died.  You find this information with the aid of two AIs via reading the ships logs and it covers a couple of different stories, some connected directly, some indirectly.   The "game" such as it is doesn't take long to complete as can be told by my relatively short playtime.  I've acquired two of the endings.  One good one and one bad one.  There are others that I intend to go and get.  The story itself is actually quite good.  Fair warning that it's a sad one and there's no way to make it happy.  Bittersweet is about the best you can get out of the ending.  I really can't give many more details without blowing it.  Also there's a minigame of sorts involving using commands in an old command prompt style terminal part way through the game and it is timed(although they do give you a generous time allotment to do so) so be ready for that when it comes up.  Some people will probably dislike that part of the game but it honestly adds a lot of flavor to the whole game as it also forces some of the important decisions you had to make.   If you like the visual novel genre this game is a must buy.  If you're not sure how you feel about it, this is a good game to test the waters with.","July 1, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is more a visual novel than it is a game - which means, it is about reading things, imagining things, and talking to characters in a usually pretty linear and uninteractive fashion. Analogue is in this regard pretty innovative, since it is highly non-linear - it lets you decide which documents to read - to some extend, that is.\nHowever, it's not just reading that you do, and I don't want to spoiler too much in this regard.\nThe two characters you talk to, namely the AIs Hyun-ae and Mute, are written in a very understandable and non-artificial fashion (despite being AI constructs). It is very nice to see that the author refrained from using many of the long-standing archetypes that are commonly involved in nowadays VNs - which makes it all the better.\n\nOverall, I would say - if you like VNs, buy this game.","August 24, 2013","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pick it up if you see it on sale.\n\nReview (Very light on spoilers)\n\nStory\nThe story without spoiling much is that you travel to one of the first space colony ships that has broken down and is just floating around in space. Your job is to download the datalogs to find out what happened to it.\n\nGameplay\nA lot of reading through log dates, while interesting can put a lot of players off. It has some minimal dialouge choices with the characters you talk with that does impact your ending. Imagine if you read a book and once in a while a friend pops in to ask your opinion on what you read.\n\nMusic\nThe music is fitting even if it does leave some desire for more. As standalone music I would listen to it while drawing for example. A cake that could have used the cherry on top.\n\nArt\nThe game gets a lot of points here, while simple in design they look rather good and while the animation is on the simplistic side that's not the focus of the game. The focus of the game is on the beckground story and the story of the characters you meet.\n\n","June 12, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Strangely, this is set up more like a JRPG Dating sim in that you have to confer with the two of them on topics ranging from sex to murder, leading to some....interesting conversations.\n\nIf you don't mind reading a lot, the story is actually pretty well written, and the dialouge (Besides some of the love parts) are pretty well written.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039766894/recommended/209370/","76561198039766894","ETHAN BRADBERRY [Vin]","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039766894/","185 products in account","Word Count: 59,000 words\n\nSetting: Set thousands year into the future, a pre-FTL colony ship from the 2000's, the Mugunghwa has been found.  As it's disappearance is an unsolved mystery of history, you are assigned to retrieve from the derelict any and all logs that might reveal what happened to the ship.\n\nRemote accessing the direlect's central computer, you meet two AI who help you navigate the logs, left behind by the long deceased crew.\n\nGameplay: Like you would expect from a NV, the game is HEAVILY text-based.  The opening has you interfacing with a really basic computer interface (the override terminal), where you have to type out the commands; for example "enable_ai [name]."\n\nFrom there, the game proceeds to a slick, minimalistic interface.  The currently active AI stands to left, and on the right are buttons to talk to the AI, access the log documents, and return to the override terminal.  (It also contains recently read messages and the "Exit" and "Options" buttons on the bottom right).\n\nDialogue with the AI is handled through "chat bubbles," while your responses are limited to two choices (typical of a "yes or no" or "agree or disagree" variety).  The majority of the game, however, is spent reading the logs, letter, diary entries, ect, of the crew.  Only a few of these logs are initially available.  But you have the ability to show these logs to the AI's, to which they will give a response, often unlocking related material.\n\nAnother thing of note is that during conversations with the AI, *Hyun-ae in particular, the "chat bubble" will often proceed to fill up with text, only to have the "bubble" suddenly flicker, part of the text gone to replaced by something different.\n\nMy overall views on the interface is that it does it's job.  It's clever, minimalist,and streamlined, allowing you to focus on the story itself.\n\nStory aka the part when the review really begins\n\nWhile being set far, far into the future, the story is actually about history.  To be more specific, it is about the the civilisation of the crew which, having been separated from any outside influences for hundreds of years, have adapted a Joseon Dynasty-like society.  (It should also be noted that all the crew are descendants of Korea)\n\n\nThe story can be divided into two what I like to call "arcs," (the correct terminology might be "path,"  but I feel the word "arc" better expresses how I viewed them), the *Hyun-ae Arc and the *Mute Arc.  Each arc is the sum total of the logs that particular AI provide and the input they give concerning those logs.\n\n*Hyun-ae Arc:   What I consider to be the primary arc, this Arc focuses on the Pale Bride and the Kim family, to which she belonged.  To be blunt, I didn't really enjoy this arc all this much.  It relies heavily on culture shock and plot twists, to shock the player into having the desired emotions of disgust, sorrow, and empathy, and to communicate the ideas and thoughts behind the arc.   Unfortunately, I already have had a general knowledge of this type of culture, and I found myself able to predict the major plot twists well in advance.  As a result, I never felt any shock (although I will give the story credit for momentarily making my sick to my stomach when I realized what the last plot twist was).\n\nThis problem compounds with the issue that the arc really has only one character, the Pale Bride.  Almost all the logs in the arc are there only because they mention the Pale Bride (or were written by her), and the arc's AI, *Hyun-ae, only really humanizes the Pale Bride, only giving generalist descriptions of the other characters involved.  That is fine, that's what this arc is about, the Pale Bride and her alone.  But the problem is, to truly enjoy the arc, you need to sympathize with the Pale Bride.  But the only way the story makes you sympathise with the character is via shock, once again bringing us to the issue stated above.\n\nOverall without that all important shock factor, this arc felt try dry and uninspiring.  It is, however, very detailed and realistic in its presentation of the ship's society, and it proves to be a fairly interesting experience (it caused me to lose a night's sleep, in fact).\n\n*Mute Arc:  This arc focuses on the Smith family, and *Mute's relationship with them.  In contrast to the *Hyun-ae Arc, this arc focuses on humanization of its characters, something it pulls of wonderfully.  As a close friend of the Smith family, much of *Mute's dialogue focus on trying to get the player to better understand the members of the Smith, to not only see the bad in them, but also see the good.  Via *Mute's feedback, each life.  They were all flawed; many of them did horrible things; but it also made you realize that they weren't necessarily people.  It made you better understand the circumstances that accompanied their actions, their feelings, their motives.  It is this humanization that made me love this arc.\n\nSummary & Recommendation: A slick, streamlined interface; a story with a highly detailed society based on an actual society in our past; a "primary" arc that relies heavily on a shock factor, without which the arc is uninspiring (but still fairly interesting); and a secondary "arc" that does a great job of humanizing it's character, of presenting characters that are deeply flawed but not necessarily bad people.\n\nAnalogue: A Hate Story is a fascinating and entertaining experience.  If you are looking for a good story, this VN comes with my full recommendation.","February 17, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s sort of like an interactive mystery novel with pictures (be prepared fod for a lot of reading). The reason I liked it is because the story is, shockingly, pretty interesting. It also introduces enough game elements to prevent it from being nothing more than a pure text adventure and the length is just right.\n\nYou play the part of a salvager who is trying to uncover what happened on a derelict generation ship, which is one of the theorized ways humans might be able to explore the galaxy. The way this story goes is how I think such an attempt would end in real life, too (I’ll stop here before revealing any spoilers).\n\nThere are different levels of depth to be discovered to the story as well as multiple endings. What you uncover depends on what questions you ask and how deep you dig. The game is also timed, in a way, so that after a certain point certain endings become impossible depending on what you’ve done so far. Thankfully, the game’s length is paced excellently so right around the time you are getting tired of reading the text, you’ll find yourself near the end. You’re also able to speed through much of the text on subsequent playthroughs to see different endings, which is nice.\n\nI liked the music a lot, too. It sets a very appropriate mood throughout the story. I played this with headphones on and I’d recommend that. It greatly increases the immersive feel as this game is best enjoyed with a couple of hours blocked out and no distractions to take you away from it, not unlike reading a book.\n\nIs it worth $10, though? That’s a tough call and will depend on just how much you like this sort of thing. It will only take you 2-3 hours to get through this and considerably less to view the alternate endings, if you even care about doing that. And once you beat it, there is little reason to play through it again. I bought it during a Steam sale, though, and am content with what I paid for it.\n\nI will say that the music and writing are above average and the artwork is well done. This is essentially an adventure game that removes all of the pointing & clicking and walking around aimlessly through the same maps.

It's also a bit more accesible than Analogue: A Hate Story, so in general it's a good place to start to see if you even like Love's style before spending money on a more involved and intense story.\n\nNow, when I say Digital has a interesting execution, that isn't to say Analogue doesn't. It is similar in many ways, but it's different - which is good, really. The interface of both games fits the story and setting. Analogue does feel more like a visual novel, though. But probably because it's longer and there is quite a bit more reading. However, it's a complex story, and told in a way that is engaging. It also manages to deal with many serious themes. Patriatrcy, sexism, sexuality -- to name a few.\n\nSo, try Digital: A Love Story and if you like it, then chances this is a game for you (mind you, this is... well it is called "A Hate Story"). Or, just buy this first and find out and then go back to Digital! And forward to Hate Plus (which I haven't played yet. But it did just come out about a week ago, as of writing this..\n\nAnd to repeat myself, I think, be warned: this contains mature themes and the story may trigger some people, as it deals with abuse and more.","August 24, 2013","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because what Analogue really is, is a multi-faceted adventure story that you, the protaganist, can only read about - except of course, when it comes to life around you in the form of a ship's AI who was there at the time. The two AI, Hyun-ae and Mute, are gorgeous in their differences, and humorous in comparison, one showing somethings while hiding others and vice versa. And it's a good thing you've got these two (ONLY two? In a VN? But but... yeah. This is no ero story :P) chirpy and/or eager-to-please starbabes to guide you through the diaries of  the Mugungwe's last days because... Everyone will read something different into the historical world created, into the character of the Pale Bride, and into how everything comes to a conclusion. I, for one, fell helplessly in love with a fake AI in a game... so there's that.\n\nHowever you choose to enjoy the game, as an explorer, as a route seeker, as a completionist, there are hours of... entertainment, I won't always say enjoyment. Some messages are uncomfortable to hear and Christina Love does, once again, a wonderful job of giving us a rude awakening to things we might rather ignore.\n\nRead like a novel, this is harrowing and heartfelt. Read in role-play, truly reacting to and feeling with Hyun-ae... it'll darn near break your heart. All the recommends.","March 7, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those people are, I think, completely missing the point of Analogue: A Hate Story. It's not a dating sim. Sure, there are elements of that format, and you do have the ability to manipulate the story somewhat through your responses. However, this game is more of a visual novel in the purest sense: it invites you to uncover a story. Apparently there's 59,000 words of text in this game, so if you're feeling unfulfilled by finishing subsequent playthroughs within ten minutes like one of the top-rated negative reviewers, you're doing it wrong.\n\nTo be fair, Analogue is a short game. There's not a huge amount to it, and it doesn't take a significant time investment to complete. However, what is there is charming and thought-provoking, with a surprisingly interesting - if slightly two-dimensional - story to be dug through. I'm sure if you were to put the game into Skip Mode, you probably could get the best ending in ten minutes, but you'd be totally missing the point. Experience this game as if it were a book, for after all, that is what a good visual novel is intended to emulate.","March 7, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played a few like it but most were free online games that were not very good. Picked this game up on a steam sale and it has gotten me interested in this genre. The gameplay is pretty much reading through letters and journal entries,  trying to understand what caused the death of the ships inhabitants. The best part of the game to me would be the two A.I. programs, the soundtrack, and the way you interact with the game.\n\nThe game introduces you to the two A.I.s and they are fun to be with. Sure they play up to some stereotypes and some people will get upset that the choices you make with them basically boil down to being nice or being rude with no gray area. I like this because if the relationships in the game were as complicated as real life then it would be frustrating. The two A.I.s are fun enough to listien to and interact with. I did not find a single time that I found myself wishing that they would shut up (though to be fair I only went through the game once and so have limited experince with one of the A.I.s.) The tedium of reading letters and journal entries are broken up by showing the letters to the A.I.s and getting their view of it which can be radically different depending who you show it to. This fleshes out the story while allowing you to get to know the A.I.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is fun to listen to. It re-enforces the space theme of the game and changes at some of the more important parts. I can't say much more about the soundtrack since I am a pleb with little knowledge of music. All I can say is that I love music from video games that I can listen to in the backround and this serves that purpose. It is a soundtrack that I do plan on buying.\n\nFinally I enjoy the way that you interact in the game. You start the game at a computer terminal, typing in commands. The rest of the game is spent going through screens, reading journals and interacting much the same way you would if it was actually your computer. I have not played a lot of games that used this set up so it may just be the novelty speaking but I felt less disconnected from the game than other games I have played in the similar vein (again, a very small pool.) The computer interface is used very effectively about half-way through the game in a way that was loads of fun.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game. Is it worth 10$? I can't answer that because I bought it for less and am new to the genre and don't know the average cost of these games. I enjoyed it and if you can get it on a steam sell I would suggest you do. I had fun and there is some replay value with the multiple endings. So to me it was worth it and I might pick up the sequel at full price with the soundtrack.","February 21, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an emotional roller-coaster from start to finish that swings everywhere between playful fun and horrified disbelief.\n\nIt is hard to summarise the story without spoiling anything, but I'll try doing so by saying that it's a story about the devolution of society as we know it now into complete and utter patriarchy where the women themselves believe that their rightful place is in the service of their husbands. The only exception to that is our heroine who provides most of dialogue and commentary on the individual files.\n\nSpeaking of files (and correspondence), those are the primary narrative tool that Christine Love employed to tell the story. That is perhaps the most unique aspect of Analogue, when it comes to the storytelling. Instead of exposition through dialogue, which is the most typical form of exposition in visual novels, we are greeted by a wonderful system which makes the game feel more like a literary work when compared to its run-of-the-mill counterparts and allows you to form your own opinion on the matter, rather than forcing that of the characters on you. Dialogue of course is in the game, but the amount of characters is minimal and they mostly provide commentary in which they express their own personal stance on the situation explored in the entry.\n\nThe file system, though, was also the source of my biggest problem with the game. It may be due to my own incompetence, but I did manage to get myself stuck at a point where I was clueless as to how to gain access to the rest of the files, which was also the reason why I had the game sitting on my hard drive for months only 2/3 finished, because once I lost track of the story, it was a bit of a challenge to get myself back on track again. Today I finally gathered enough courage to try and get back on the story-train and I simply blitzed through it. The story left a deep impression in me and for those unsure about buying this game, yes, it was worth every penny.\n\nPS: Can't wait to start finally playing Hate Plus!\nPPS: Christine Love, your Twitter is one of the coolest places on the Internet!\n\nEdit: Spelling","February 5, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is because the way the game is structured; it's difficult to recognize characters, especially since they all have foreign names that, to my eyes, all look the same.\n\nOnce I completed the first story line, it was actually pretty dull to do the other ones for the achievments. Felt like a whole lotta grinding.\n\nI'm only recommending this game for the story (and the sci-fi setting), not the gameplay. You'll want to play this before Hate Plus though, since the story is connected.","February 23, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, despite the lack of subtlety, this game really gets you thinking about its center topic (sexism) a lot, so I gave it a pass.\n\nWhen it comes to mechanics, this game really knows how to create an immersive experience. Most of the things you see on the screen are diegetic so you might as well turn off the lights, put some headphones and pretend you are in the vicinity of a derelict spaceship, trying to learn its secrets through a computer terminal on a ship of your own.\n\nThe only thing that really bothered me, was that while using the terminal, I found myself pushing tab or the arrow keys the way as someone using UNIX or Linux would and though there's no real reason for the game to behave exactly as these systems it's kind of nice to have it respond to you the way you'd expect. It makes it for an easier and more comfortable interface.\n\nAnyway, this game was a very interesting approach to visual novels and I really enjoyed playing it.","February 24, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having some of the most indepth characters, fantastic music, and more philosophical themes than your body can handle, Analogue: A Hate Story is a story that will leave you intrigued to the very end...if you are an avid reader and like philosophical stuff.\n\nPros:\n\n- The themes it deals with are some of the most unique and untouched upon subjects I have ever seen in any game to this date. Dealing with interpersonal relationships, LGBT, transhumanism, and loneliness. It certainly isn't cliche.\n- Isaac Schankler is one of the most musically talented people I have ever had to pleasure to listen to. Buy the soundtrack, now.\n- Other things that would delve into spoilers.\n\nCons:\n\n- If you're not a person that reads books often, prepare yourself for a problem. See, Analogue isn't a traditonal visual novel focused around dialogue and art. No, it's more minimalist. Being next to only text. It's litreally wall after wall of text. This isn't a bad thing, but if you're not an avid reader it will be daunting at best.\n- Not an ideal entry point as your first visual novel, no I have better things for that.\n- Could've been maybe just a tiny bit longer.","February 24, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If, instead, you're interested in this sort of thing or is willing to try something different out, read on.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, WOW is Analogue good. Probably one of the best things I've tried out on Steam recently! It's about you, a space investigator, attempting to find out what happened to a ruined spaceship (the Mugunghwa). A simple premise, but the execution is amazing.\n\nTo start off, let's talk about the presentation. The entire story is told through old logs written by the ship's inhabitants, as well as conversations with its AIs (*Hyun-ae and *Mute), and all of this is seen through a single computer interface. Again, it's simple, but it works perfectly while also being quite unusual, so I really liked it. It does a very good job at delivering the plot and setting by simultaneously giving you a lot of information while also allowing your imagination to put everything together by itself.\n\nAnd speaking of the setting, that's where Analogue truly shines! First off, it's based on Korean culture, which is... not something that you see very often (if at all), so it's refreshing to have something like this. Second, I really appreciate the research that was put into it. As the author explains in the bibliography, society aboard the Mugunghwa was based on a certain period of Korean history, and knowing that things like this actually DID happen at some point in history adds so much more weight to the story, as well as having the secondary benefit of making it educative without feeling forced.\n\nBut what about the story, huh? There's no easy way of explaining it properly, but it's a wild ride. The horrible things detailed in some of the logs really leave an impression on you (sup Block 1), but you also have things such as *Hyun-ae dressing up in a maid outfit and being adorable or *Mute being tsundere, and the contrast between the serious and easygoing parts causes both to be even more impactful. In addition, though the narrative is mostly direct, it still sometimes leaves little hints about certain things here and there, so that you can put everything together in your head before seeing it explained in a log or something, and it's great.\n\nOther things to talk about... the art, while not the best, is still pretty good, and does its job well. Same goes for the music, pretty much. And I really enjoyed that one puzzle involving the reactor and a command-line interface.\n\nBut of course, Analogue is not without faults, and I find that most of those can be found in its technical side. It's annoying how you need to wait a second for buttons to work after you change pages, and there are some problems involving event flags, such as the one involving decrypting Block 3... but really, those things are pretty much insignificant in the grand scheme of things, not managing to be anything more than annoyances.\n\nBottom line: if you don't mind reading a lot and is interested in learning something about Korean history, definitely give Analogue a try. I certainly didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be.","December 4, 2013","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm loving to see that there are more and more of these visual novel style games popping up on steam. There are just some times when I want to play a game, but don't want to play it necessarily for the challenge. I just want to be told a good story and have an influence on it, like a choose your own adventure book.\n\nThe Good: Good story that becomes a great story. I loved the two main characters. They both had their own personality and beliefs. They were very deep charcters, but we also got to see why they were the way they were. The game is mainly played from reading diary entries from the ship's crew. Through that you gain insight on what happened on it. You spend a little bit of the game in a DOS style console. It's not hard or as complex as DOS though. Both the message reading system and DOS part of the game are really well done.\n\nThe Bad: The only small nitpick I have with the game is that it was hard for me to keep up with the characters with no sort of way to just click a name and have their bio pop up (or at least what I know about them so far). There isn't really any bad parts to this game unless you don't like reading or you want something with a little more interaction like you'd get from another genre.\n\nThe Ugly: N/A No bugs, no crashes, just a clean game.\n\nSummary: If you like to read and you want a good story buy this. If you like this buy Hate Plus as well. It puts a nice bit of icing on the cake to complete the already awesome story.","December 4, 2013","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a Visual Novel with text based directives, and holds a prfound story no matter your choices (minus downloading everything from the getgo or killing yourself). The story is extremely dark with only the 2 interactable and loveable characters to lighten the mood that this burdens the reader with. It's a harsh and realitsic story of how ♥♥♥♥ goes wrong. It's not for the faint of heart or of the younger age as this gets very explicit at the end (very graphic mention of lesbian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and intercourse). In general its a great story, an excellent food for thought and how we take what have for granted. Also you may enjoy copius amounts of "cosplay" or all the potienally laughable gender-confusion related "deres". I highly reccomend it for anyone looking for a good story that mixes harsh darkness with a cast that you can freely choose on whether to love or hate, as you may find something to hate in everyone.

You can play it and understand it, but it would be better for you to play that before you play this, at least to get the gist of what Christine Love is about with her writing. But anyway, here's my review of the game, trying to prevent any spoilers to the best of my abilities:\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe time is... Very far into the future. After the horrific events of "Digital: A Love Story" that took place in the alternate future of 1982, we are introduced to the idea that a machine that the government created had a slight knowledge constrainment complex. The computer decided to split its components to learn the most about the one thing that it could not comprehend: Human emotion. Therefore, the one thing the computer tried to emulate was humans; some capable of something the computer, affectionately named "Mother" by the seperate constructs, had not been prior: Love.\n\nMuch later in time, humanity has developed brilliant technologies: one of them being the fact that you can travel through space with Light Speed and beyond, with several colonies set up around the galaxy. However, the thing is, colonies had to be set up the hard way years before: Generation Vessels. A Generation Vessel is a huge vessel capable of containing an entire society for literally generations while they head for the next planet to colonize. However, there's a problem. When society is contained in such a way that leaves the beurocrats, the power-hungry and the overall morons to run the ship, eventually people forget things. Things that might be important. For instance, why you're even floating in space to begin with. And so the sad tale of the Mugunghwa begins with, ironically, it becoming lost in space for years.\n\nThis is where you come in. As a freelance worker, you get a job from the Museum after the Mugunghwa suddenly appears out of nowhere, completely derelict. As you enter the console and try to log in, you realize you can't obtain the files you require to complete the mission without help. Good thing there's an AI in charge of the ship named *Hyun-ae who's more than willing to help you find the password... Or maybe a little more, especially since there's a discrepency: an AI named *Mute is supposed to be in charge of the ship, not *Hyun-ae, and the fact that a recurring character by the name of "The Pale Bride" keeps appearing in the log documents... What link does she have with what happened to the Mugunghwa?\n\nSTORYTELLING:\n\nI would like to point out that the storytelling in this game is fantastic. It's perfectly paced, however you need to take one thing into consideration: The logs that appear are not in chronological order, until others are unlocked. Speaking of which, how you answer questions reveal different logs for you to read, as well as the different logs you show *Hyun-ae, the different logs you would recieve if you showed the same to *Mute. Aside from the jumbled chronology, it's really well done, and I commend Christine Love highly for it.\n\nPlus, when you actually get to spend some time talking to the AI themselves, I found myself wishing that I could actually be speaking to them, Cortana style. (Actually, if someone blends the Cleverbot program with this thing, that would be awesome) They are rather life-like, and that's fantastic. It made me care about the characters, and that is really awesome, especially for a game.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nAh yes, this is something that shouldn't really even be an element in Visual Novels, should it? Kind of goes against what the Visual Novel thing actually is. But in this, I must say, when you have to step in and make big decisions -- and there are several, and some will make you sweat -- you really have to think about them. There is some actual gameplay in there, so it isn't a glorified clicking or space bar simulator, or anything, though the "gameplay" is really just a console you have to wrestle with. There was one point when the game... Well, I will abstain from the details, but I felt legitimately relieved, intelligent and glad I love Sci-Fi afterward. It's awesome, and it is one of the things that makes this game awesome.\n\nSOUND:\n\nThere are no voice actors, much unlike Steins;Gate, Chaos;Head or most other Visual Novels, which means the only real sounds are the generic button sounds and the soundtrack. Now, the generic button sounds are actually quite good, and I quite enjoy the sound that plays when you show a log to the AI. But the real thing that I enjoy about the sound is the music. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and I highly reccommend you buy the Soundtrack with it. It's really well made, and it conveys what is happening perfectly. It's very atmospheric, and I quite enjoy it.\n\nREPLAY VALUE:\n\nThere is no linear plot. It has something of seven different endings, meaning you are going to get a bucketload of replay value in this. Plus, there are tons of achievements and tons of logs for you to unlock!\n\nOVERALL:\n\nWhat can I say? You can dress *Hyun-ae in a lab coat and she makes a Steins;Gate reference. You can't go wrong with this game. However, if you do not like Visual Novels, I might play Digital: A Love Story first.","February 22, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
