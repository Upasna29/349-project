They're angry, see.  And they aren't ordinary birds, no.  These birds, they're in space.  And there's these space piggies, like mean green little space piggies up in the sky.  And these birds, the birds in space, the angry ones, they see these mean green piggies, and I kid you not, I see them fling themselves as the piggies.  It's the most goshdarned thing I've ever seen through my telescope.  And that's not the crazy part.  The crazy part is, I don't think they're just in space.  I think they're on other planets, too.  And these birds, they can fly.  No, I mean, really, really fly.  Not like birds down here, the ones that flap around like la la la la la, or just soar around, you know the eagles and falcons and the like.  No, these birds, they don't seem to like gravity.  They just kind of float and bounce.  But the planets, see, they like the planets, and they fly down to them.  Sometimes it makes them miss the piggies, and they gotta send more birds in.  And sometimes, the birds smash into blocks of ice and wood and stone and stuff, and I swear I saw one fly itself into an asteroid, and it broke into a million jillion like bits, good gravy!  Now, now, I mean the space rocks, not the birds, no.  Never seen a bird in space blow up, before.  Until I saw this one bird...naw, shouldn't talk about that.  You might be eatin' your supper.\n\nSo, thought I should tell you.  There's birds up there, you know in the Good Lord's heavens.  And they're angry.  Not sure what they're angry about, but you outta know about it, in case you go sticking your head up in the clouds or flying in one of the danged Virgin Galactic deathtraps or whatever.  And warn those NASA fellas, if you can.  Don't want no space shuttle runnin' into no birds on the way to Venus or something.","December 3, 2014","true","17.7"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","77","20","26","23","1"

There might be more of a challenge here, but you've got to slog through dozens of levels worth of mind-numbingly easy gameplay before you get to it. Compared to the original release, this installment doesn't really do anything particularly ground-breaking, basically simply adding an alternative physics system and a couple new shot types. That said, if you're a fan of the original Angry Birds, you'll probably find plenty of enjoyment here. Conversely, if you're not an Angry Birds fan...

After playing for a while it feels as though you have actually been to Space.\nThe player will be drawn into the Angry Birds fantasy world from the moment the opening sequence bursts onto the screen, and the game won't let go, not even after finishing the quest. This game is simply the most complete experience of any game ever made, making Angry Birds Space the game I've always dreamed of playing.\n\n10 / 10 - Platinum","December 23, 2013","true","5.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","2"

How can you say anything bad about it? But honestly, the game does have a couple glaring flaws.\n\n1: Excessive 3-star Scores\nYou've just managed to destroy everything (and I do mean everything), with two birds, and you even get 10k bonus points for having a spare bird. You still don't get that third star. It's at this point that you realize you're going to have to repeatedly restart that level after you launch your first bird. Again. Again. And yes, again. I'm no logistics expert, so this is more often an exercise in awkward shots where you hope beyond hope that everything goes perfect, with chaotic randomness going in your favor 1% of the time. It eventually works, but it's extremely frustrating when you realize your spare birds are useless. At least on the less demanding levels you get to try more than once before hitting the retry button.\n\n2: Stop Showing the Pigs!\nYes. YES! I know! They're there. So stop jerking the controls away and showing me the pigs. Okay?! It's extremely irritating when you're retrying a stage again and again only to have 1/10 attempts (or more) slowed down or even ruined by the game wanting to show you the pigs. Sometimes I'll be trying to get ready to launch and the camera jerks me around so much that the bird gets launched in some wild direction. >.<   Every Angry Birds game seems to be like this. Unless you leave the level and come back later I don't see any point to showing you the pigs unless you manually push the view over there yourself. It's pointless and irritating, especially in the excessive 3-star levels I already mentioned.\n\nSo there you have it. Two flaws. That's not bad really.\n\nThis particular Angry Birds title changes things up a bit by adding a new bird that can freeze objects it hits (it expires with a freezing explosion), gravity zones, and 'clinging' structures. The clingy structures can either be interesting, challenging, or just downright annoying. Arches in particular. Clinging structures are very difficult to destroy because their pieces stick together and they are often rooted at multiple points.\n\nThere's a lot of gameplay (200 levels), replayability due to hidden secrets (that you'll likely miss the first time through) and rescoring. There's nothing quite like the mindless destruction of poor little green piggies with explosives, falling blocks, and well placed shots of perfect chaotic destruction. So if you like satisfying explosions, demolishing structures (often structures of a hideous and pointless design, but still...), as well as the comical pigs and birds that are ever present in every Angry Birds game then I believe you'll enjoy this one.","May 6, 2014","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I felt asthough they were my children too, I have to admit I cried a few times throughout the game especially when he failed to get his children back after having sacrificed so many lives to get them back.\n\nIt also has lots of challenging levels that really test the players skills and abilities.

It's quite fun and can be somewhat challenging on some levels.  If you like Angry Birds, you'll like Angry Birds Space.\n\nPros:\nThe game is child-friendly.  The birds are memorable and very popular on clothing, even amongst people who aren't fans of the video games.  The controls are simple, allowing anyone to play the game without much effort as long as they can use a basic computer mouse.  The game has a lot of levels and will provide many hours of entertainment if you like the game in the first place.\n\nCons:\nThe cutscenes are not entertaining and are poorly animated. I wish it had more of a story and also less repetitive music.  It would also be nice if the game didn't use the scroll wheel for navigation and instead let us zoom out on the menu like it does the levels.  The zoom feature is also broken on some levels, and the camera likes to move on its own too much.  Some of the levels are too easy while some other levels seem to be easy but give you only 1 star for some unknown reason.  It is unclear what the goals are on some levels.  Once you beat a level, there isn't much reason to replay it.\n\nOverall recommendation:\nIf you want something casual, this is worth the $5.","April 11, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Levels are well thought out and really challenge my kids.

Hip gangster wannabes.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erraticcookie/","126 products in account","Angry Birds Space is one of those games that provide a love hate relationship and perhaps even trust issues. Much like in Duck Hunt, where the Dog snickers at your lack of skill, little green pigs snort at your inability to understand basic and guided physics of a slingshot and various birds as your ammunition. As you should grow a full on feeling of ire towards the mocking pigs, you really just grow to hate yourself and begin to take it out on the tiny birds, inevitably blaming the quality of your electronics for obviously not working properly since children a third of your age have beaten this game and you're sending birds off into space rather than defeating little green space pigs that are nearly a straight shot away. Little green snorting space pigs that are judging you for every mistake you make.","June 22, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
