The main issue I am encountering is CRASHING, it is constant and makes the game totally unplayable, very disappointed and am hoping for an update soon as I wish to spend more time playing!  Cannot reccomend at present as unplayable otherwise pretty fun for Rugby fans (although not the polished article).  3/10.\n\n**UPDATE** - Shall re-trial the game to see if I can get rid of the crashing issue and the report back. Original game was a lot of fun so hoping that re-installing will remedy the issue!","September 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","27","31","3","0"

Why would a game that is using the licenced logo of the rugby World cup not have the correct team lists?  Also I can't pass using my controller and there doesn't seem to be anywhere to change the controls.\n\nThis game cost $39.99, not worth it if it cost $3.99.  My advice is wait for Rugby Challenge 3!","October 7, 2015","false","1.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","0"

Using a gamepad, which is working really well. The graphics are decent; the gameplay is fast-paced and enjoyable; and the controls work really well. It is easily the best rugby game I have played, despite the many negative reviews. Compared to other rugby games, this seems to give much more freedom to actually play rugby properly and to execute a fast-paced running game. The controls for rucking are another highlight, I believe, actually allowing for slight errors to result in penalties (as opposed to just deliberate actions).\nOne or two people have suggested that you may need a decent working knowledge of the sport to enjoy this game, and I can see how that could be true. Even so, I would still strongly recommend this game.","December 22, 2015","true","18.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","0"
