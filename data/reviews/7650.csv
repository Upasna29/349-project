There was only one thing left to do: BUY. IT. NOW.\n\nAnd, thanks to my parents (and me being a good boy around xmas ;)) I got my hands on a copy of this\ngame. I still own the original box, floppy disc edition.\n\nI played this game at least one week per month for about a year and a half.\n\nIt's now 2014, and I still haven't found a game so compelling since. Everything in this game pulled me\nin, and would never let me go. The music. The atmosphere. This always present feeling of dread. The pressure put on your shoulders when trying to save as many civilians as possible during a Terror mission without sacrificing your favorite soldiers.\nAnd, above all else, the incredible depth of the tactical options that were offered to you throughout the game. Both in combat situation and on the Geosphere's more laid-back, strategical planning.\n\nThis is the kind of game that involves you so much that you start to create your own stories about your pixelated soldiers. I knew their names.I knew what they were capable, or uncapable of doing while on a mission. I knew them, and losing any of them had some kind of impact on me. "They were my soldiers. my mates. They were good soldiers, and I'll never forget them."\n\nTo me, X-COM: Terror From the Deep defines the word "classic" when it comes to Strategic planning and Tactical\nCombat.","July 15, 2014","true","0.2"," 130 of 139 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","130","139","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitthiX/recommended/7650/","KitthiX","KitthiX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitthiX/","1461 products in account","TL;DR: I was raised on this game. It will forever be my favorite PC game of all time.  I would hide under my covers, way past my bedtime, as my older brother played through the night. It gave me horrid nightmares as an 8 year old. :)\n\nThe following is an excerpt from an email I wrote to my older brother on 8/26/11: (spoilers below)\n\n"Over 15 years ago we began an extermination of an alien threat known as the ‘Terror from the Deep.’ I am proud to inform you that our mission was completed in a “Superhuman”-ly fashion at 0100 hours this morning.\n\nCAPT KDW “Da Bomb” lead a team of advanced X-COM aquanauts through the abyssal depths of T’leth. CDR Leviticus, LCDR Sigourney Weaver, and LT Tommy Lee Jones destroyed the final life-support pillars and personally escorted the alien mastermind to the gates of hell.\n\nIt took 11 months to research and build the Leviathan. In the final month of December, 5 to 12 USOs were detected and engaged daily. From January 2040 (X-COM’s formation) the aliens conducted twice-per-month artefact sites, shipping routes, terror sites, and X-COM base assault missions. Though an alien colony was eliminated for every month beyond June, the entire globe was littered with half a dozen known sites.\n\nThis wasn't my first attempt. The original X-COM had a glitch that reset the difficulty to Beginner. The true Superhuman difficulty makes TFTD pretty darn difficult. Add on the fantastic modifications from XCOM UTIL, you face a formidable foe. Here are some of my most notable struggles:\n\n**Base defense, first month.** Initial layout is nearly impossible to defend. Aquatoids use Mind Control. Thermal tazers are required to neutralize your own soldiers. Calcinite (deep sea diver) take 20+ rounds of Gauss Rifle.\n**Terror attack, first month.** Live Deep One or BUST. Period.\n**First Lobsterman encounter.** I am convinced that it is impossible to kill a lobsterman with gauss technology. They take a minimum 2-3 rounds of Sonic Cannon.\n**First shipping route or artefact site.** Even the weakest alien soldiers have better than 100% aimed shot. The cyberdisk (bio-drone) and triscene (dinosaur) are by far the biggest challenge in the game. I have never seen either one miss and both can fire 5+ shots in a single reaction or turn. I’m not sure if they can be mind-controlled (I never broke 100+ MC skill) but they both can move across the entire map to destroy your squad. The bio-drone’s death explosion is lethal even with Mag. Ion Armour. The triscene is probably the most rare creature in the game, fortunately. No exaggeration here: the triscene will absorb 20+ rounds of sonic cannon before it dies on Superhuman.\n**Medium to Very Large USOs.** Basically requires Sonic Oscillator. Barracudas often get blown to bits or can’t keep up. Without the advanced weaponry, this effectively ends your game within the month they begin appearing.\n\nThere were other difficulties; most of them dealing with Molecular Control / Research / Financial. So – what was the ultimate secret of my success?\n\n1.       Hand-to-Hand. This was the best tactic and the ultimate key to my success. Half my squad was equipped with Sonic Pistol / Thermal Lance. The thermal lance costs about 8 TU’s, has 100% accuracy, and turns lobsters into meatloaf. The sonic pistol is extremely underestimated and in my opinion the best overall weapon in the game.\n\n2.       Research. Weapons, Armor, MC, Submersibles. Proper order is essential. If researched improperly, you cannot complete the game.\n\n3.       Manufacture. Technicians can make certain items (Gauss Cannon, Particle Disturbance Sensor) for profit. With a permanent manufacture base, money is never an issue, only sponsorship to avoid losing the game.\n\n4.       SWS (Tanks). They die so easily, but they are by far the most effective scouts. Plus replaceable!\n\n5.       Aquanauts. I hired over 300 soldiers over the course of the game. Every initial statistic should be over 40, especially reaction, otherwise your soldier is just cannon fodder. MC strength needs to be a minimum of 80. Any soldier vulnerable to mind control was sacked or sent into USOs with primed sonic pulsers.\n\nInstead of having a full squadron armed with cannons, I found diversity is best. There is no reason to leave anyone in the ship, ever. MC specialists (as many as possible!!!) should be equipped with pistols and following your scouts. When in doubt, nothing beats the old elevator trick or blasting away entire ships with the Disruptor Pulse Launcher. I was surprised to find that the traditionally difficult Tentaculant (STINKIN’ BRAIN) were relatively easy to kill. Their only real threat potential is their knack for sneaking around the battleground unnoticed. Once you’re well equipped, or have mind control, the game is simply an endurance challenge, regardless of difficulty."\n\nSoon, OpenXcom will release TFTD support. I'm anxious to jump back into this game and try some of the truly difficult challenges: No Psionics, Ironman, Aggressive/Sneaky AI, the works. Thanks for sharing in my passion. :)","May 12, 2015","true","7.9"," 89 of 93 people (96%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","96","89","93","21","0"

The plot is that Earth is being invaded by aliens from the sea who aren't hesitant to kill anyone preventing them from their main goal: Taking over the entire planet. The player's job is to be the Lead Commander of the whole X-COM facilities. The player is given a simple job: Stop the aliens from destroying the world. Now, when I saw "Lead Commander", I mean exactly that. The player controls everything that is given to it, such as sending out patrols, whether to attc\ack aliens or not, buying/selling materials, hireing people to work for you, and a whole lot more.\n\nThis game is, like I said, a big strategy game. It involves lots of numbers, and money is extremely important. If you don't have enough money till the end of the month, the world governers shut down X-COM and the aliens win. The player has to make the right choices on what to manufacture, patrol, construct, attack, and most importantly, research. I have to say, researching is the key factor of getting the most out of this game. Without research, the player will have to stick to harpoon guns which don't do that much damage at first. But with research, the player can have better weapons that deal more damage, and I mean a LOT of damage.\n\nThis game is pixelated, so it's graphics are kinda poor. But the strategy, thinking, and the numbers all come together in this, so the player needs to really take everything into account when it invovles money. Battling is pretty intense too. The battle system is based around the player having it's turn to get it's men together and plan an attack. Most of the battles are under water, so it's pretty dark at first. But when the player starts moving it's men around, the environment starts to pan out and you have a good look on the battleground. Once the player has done it's turn, it's time for the aliens turn. The aliens basically do whatever the player can do: move, attack, or run away and group up. It's all based on strategy and knowing what aleins have what, cause it's not just one kind of alien attacking Earth. There are many species of aliens and all have different capabilities than other aliens.\n\nI fully recommend this game for the strategic and brain power one has to use, and is my dad's favorite game, so after watching him play a lot, and after me playing a while myself, I've come to fully enjoy this game. I hope you will too.","February 12, 2014","true","513.0"," 52 of 54 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","52","54","0","2"

My X-COM operatives have fought their way into the middle cabins on the deck of the tanker. Three units are grouped together, preparing to breach another room. Suddenly, one of the three is taken under molecular control but opts not to shoot the other two and instead runs into the unexplored room. Now I face a decision: do I enter the room knowing that I will likely be fired upon by my own unit or wait it out, leaving her inside with unknown terrors?\n\nI decide to wait. As soon as my aquanaut comes to her senses she is blasted repeatedly by a Bio Drone until she drops unconscious. Now I face another problem as the room is quite small and there is nowhere I can safely fire upon the Bio Drone without getting caught in its death explosion. But I have a wounded soldier that needs help ASAP so I burst into action. One unit dashes into the room taking only time to grab the unconscious body of his comrade before rushing back out. While the door is still open the remaining aquanaut pulls a grenade off his belt, primes it and throws it right at the base of the Bio Drone before retreating a short ways. The blast from the grenade blows out the walls, yet still hovering in the smoke is the Bio Drone, now able to see my exposed grenadier. Fortunately his Ion Armor absorbs most of the shots that rain down on him leaving him a little shaken but with no fatal wounds. Suspecting that the alien can't take much more punishment he sets up and fires back. He connects and this time the floating death disc goes down in a fiery explosion even bigger than that of the grenade. My shooter is ok but a poor civilian gets caught in the edge of the blast and is killed.\n\nThe fighting is over in this sector but there is still drama left. My unconscious warrior is bleeding out but the nearest medic is several rooms away. The medic and the aquanaut hauling her limp form sprint toward each other. Will they make it in time to save her? Yes! He patches her up and pumps her with stimulants to get her back on her feet. Now weaponless, weak and in need of a few weeks off to recover, she is out of the fight; but she is alive.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nX-COM has the ability to create moments like these that are wholly your own. This episode felt like something out of an action film to me. It's complete with heroics, suspense, mad dashes, aliens, hard decisions, explosions and a nameless citizen as collateral damage. Combine the combat side with the also enjoyable base management and research side and Terror From the Deep is truly an excellent game.\n\nHowever, taken in context of its predecessor, UFO Defense, it is a weak sequel. It is largely just a reskin with some tweaked stats for equipment and aliens. The biggest additions are new environments to fight in and a bit of alien lore. Ultimately it's more like a standalone expansion than a true sequel.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention a few gripes I had beyond the weak sequel issue. First, the game has a few pretty bad bugs, mostly within the research tree. Fortunately there is a small, free, fan made fix for these bugs called XcomUtil that is popular enough that you shouldn't have trouble finding it. And finally, the last place you invade at the end of the game, T'Leth, is just awful. The 2nd and 3rd portions of this mission are seemingly never ending slogs through linear winding corridors and rooms with relatively sparse alien resistance. My units were constantly out of energy from all the running. To top it off you cannot save your game during the final (3rd) portion which made for a marathon of several hours to finish both the 2nd and 3rd maps in one sitting. It left a definite bitter aftertaste lingering after completing this otherwise fantastic game.","September 14, 2014","true","51.7"," 44 of 45 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","44","45","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aarontu/recommended/7650/","Aarontu","Aarontu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aarontu/","449 products in account","Terror from the Deep is the sequel to X-COM UFO Defense that puts you back in charge of the international global defense organization, X-COM, except now the classic stereotypical alien/paranormal encounters have been replaced with aquatic Lovecraftian horrors and B-movie sea creatures.\n\nThe basic gameplay is very similar to X-Com: UFO Defense. In fact, you could call it a simple retheme with new graphics and not be too far off.\n\nI prefer the setting, charm, aesthetics, and difficulty balance of the original, but the sequel does several things that I find to be nice improvements on the formula. There are a number of small gameplay improvements vs UFO Defense; for example, when you destroy an alien base, the game gives you a message saying so, instead of you having to abort the mission before seeing for sure that you destroying every base control panel section. You can also open doors without moving through them, a definitely useful feature. The terror sites in the original all used the same urban terrain set, while the terror sites in Terror from the Deep can use one of four different terrains (seaport, island resort, cruise liner, cargo ship), which is nice for variety. Alien sub designs are also more intricate and complex than the UFOs in the original.\n\nAlien base assaults are a bigger ordeal, with 2 parts to the mission; first, you have to fight through the well defended surface entrance to the base, and then explore the comparatively empty inner levels. Melee weapons are fun and new to the series, and are very effective against some tough enemy types.\n\nThe biggest difference, though, is the atmosphere. The homage to Lovecraft is obvious throughout the game; even the general theme of "ancient mysterious aliens came to Earth many eons ago and are coming out of their hidden places in the deep parts of the world to reclaim it" is basically Lovecraftian. The alien architecture is reminiscent of Neo-Victorian era style science fiction and depictions of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea era submersible technology and similar; there is a lot of brass looking riveted metal and almost steampumk-ish looking alien equipment. There are also hints at other undersea myths like the lost city of Atlantis, and the Gill-Man/Swamp Creature and other aquatic B-movie monsters. Compared to UFO Defense, the enemies are tougher, deadlier, and scarier, and the environments are darker and architecture more complicated. It's now harder than ever to keep your soldiers alive, which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe game is difficult. Very difficult. Terror from the Deep was designed to be hard for people who thought X-COM UFO Defense was easy on 'superhuman' difficulty. Weapon clips are much smaller, there are no infinite ammo weapons, and all weapons are designed for underwater use. Some of them, like torpedo launchers (Terror from the Deep's version of rockets) don't work at all out of water (terror sites). The fact that there are no land only weapons to use (like regular firearms) is annoying and makes the game more difficult, for sure. Speaking of water vs land weapon use, grenades can be thrown underwater as if through air. This may annoy you if you take notice of unrealistic physics in games.\n\nI've mentioned that base assaults are long 2 part missions. Terror sites on boats are also big 2 part missions. You will have to kill A LOT of aliens to complete a boat terror site; it's quite an endurance test. Alien bases in particular are heavily defended and almost always deep enough underwater that the environment is dark regardless of the time of day. They can be brutal.\n\nNow for as for the game's flaws; the fact that most of the game is underwater makes a lot of the environments feel a bit too similar, even though there are a variety of underwater terrain types. The colors blue and yellow are a bit overused and make the game's aesthetics a bit garish, especially when compared to the pleasingly colorful original X-Com.\n\nAlso, the game features the same somewhat cumbersome user interface and many of the same bugs as X-Com UFO Defense. The difficulty bug from the original is not present here, but the disappearing ammo bug still is (in the DOS version, at least. The Windows version fixed it). Aliens also like to carry around melee weapons, but they don't ever use them. Worst of all, if you research a couple things in the wrong order, it can make your game unwinnable by making some required research unavailable. Even if you don't screw up your research path, the research tree is more convoluted and requires more live aliens than that of UFO Defense, which can be frustrating because it's not obvious which alien types you need to research to unlock other techs.\n\nMaps are, in general, larger. Bases and boat terror sites span across two separate maps instead of 1, and even UFO crash site maps are larger than they were in UFO Defense. The 2 part terror missions can be pretty tedious, and they can drag on forever. The boat maps feature more rooms and more complicated architecture than usually seen in X-Com games, and as a result, there will often be aliens standing around somewhere waiting for you to find them because they won't ever leave the room they started in. It makes for very long missions, and an overall long and drawn out game.\n\nMODS:\nYou can play the game by itself, especially if you have the Steam version that comes bundled with DosBox (The Steam version also includes the Windows version, in the 'TFTD' subfolder in the game folder). I recommend some mods, though. XcomUtil is a great simple mod that works for both UFO Defense and Terror from the Deep. It gives Gauss weapons infinite ammo (like lasers in UFO Defense) and fixes other bugs.\n\nTftD Extender is a bit more extensive, and makes the game more playable, in my opinion. While much of it overlaps with XcomUtil, it also has options to make boat terror sites only 1 part missions, sub crash site maps a bit smaller (more like UFO Defense size maps), there are optional alternate tech trees, aliens can use melee weapons, and you can tell engineers to make and auto-sell equipment, among other features. With some tweaking, you can run both Xcomutil and Extender at the same time. I HIGHLY recommend using TFTDextender if you are going to play the game nowadays.\n\nCONCLUSION (TL;DR):\nIf you've always wanted to try a tactical turn based strategy game where you fight Lovecraftian horrors underwater, or if you are a big fan of the original X-COM UFO Defense and would like a very similar game with additional challenge and variety, then you should definitely try it. I prefer the original UFO Defense, but this game is unique and worth experiencing, in my opinion. (Don't let the difficulty scare you away; if you are very familiar with the first game, this game isn't much worse, except for the alien base assaults, which are absolutely brutal.)","July 5, 2015","true","0.7"," 42 of 46 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","42","46","0","7"

On the one hand, it's X-Com! On the other hand, it's X-Com... but 4x harder! For all intents and purposes this is X-Com 1 with a few important tweaks and changes.\n\nThe first change you'll notice is that everything takes place under water, with the exception of a few terror missions. Thus you cannot place bases on land. It's essentially the inverse of the first game. It's no big deal, but it's worth noting that some weapons do not operate on land, you cannot use flying suits on land, and some aliens only appear on land while others only appear in water.\n\nClips have been reduced *drastically*. Powerful cannons are now limited to 10 shots, with full-auto removed on heavy weapons, which I think is a good, though perhaps overly punishing change. Sonic weapons should be limited, sure, but I feel the Gauss weapons should have retained unlimited ammo, or at least given much more generous clips. At least the limited Sonic Cannon ammo is somewhat offset by the fact that you'll find Sonic Cannon clips up the wazoo when all aliens start carrying them.\n\nEnemies received some interesting changes. Remember how Chryssalids became 100% non-threatning as soon as you got flying suits? Not so in this game. Tentaculats will float across the ocean floor and happily devour your brains wherever you are. Hallucinoids and Xarquids don't explode upon death, unlike pesky cyberdiscs (however Bio-Drones do, but they're relatively rare), but they appear much more often.\n\nTFTD introduces my possibly favorite weapon, melee drills, particularly the lowest level drill. If you turn a corner and face an alien, these drills make short work of them using barely any time units with unlimited ammo. Bloody brilliant, and highly effective against lobsters. Blaster Launchers and Mind Control are as effective as they were in the previous game, so roughly the same tactics apply by the endgame.\n\nProbably the biggest change and single worst feature about the game is how massive the maps can be. They're not just huge length an width-wise, but they span multiple stories high. I loathe the start of the next month, where shipping route attacks occur. The abominable ships take forever to search, and the disturbance scanner doesn't work if the aliens don't move. Alien bases equally suffer. Go ahead. Take a peek inside one, I dare you.\n\nExacerbating the problem is how quickly your soldiers run out of energy. Your poor energy bar doesn't replenish nearly enough to cover that much ground in reasonable time. It does allow for more time units to be retained for reaction fire, but I'd rather have my troops be able to move into better cover instead of saving up TUs for reaction shots. For this reason, it may be a good idea to take a few Displacers/Coelacanths to scout for you on those gratuitously large maps.\n\nThe research system in some old versions of the game are somewhat buggy. I believe the Steam version does not have this problem, but it is something to be aware of, just in case.\n\nI admit it; I'm too scared to try this game without save-scumming. Even then it's still challenging, and the large maps are still tedious. It's fun, though not as fun as the first game, and the charm goes down very fast because of the problems. Ultimately, if you want a harder X-Com 1, this is it. I rate this a 7/10.\n","August 24, 2015","true","22.7"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","33","35","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zed-avatar/recommended/7650/","zed-avatar","Zed.Avatar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zed-avatar/","261 products in account","I purchased a copy of this game in the late 90's for DOS. It was the first X-Com game I owned, but not the first turn based strategy. I still have not completed it, as I never played it on an easy difficulty. What is the fun in that? It remains one of the best games I have ever played. And I will tell you why:\n\n- This game, unlike the original X-Com and the new X-Com offers nearly limitless tactical combat. Every part of the environments you fight in, except the base ground itself, can be utterly destroyed. My favorite tactic was to equip all my soldiers with high explosive weapons and literally blast the landscape apart. You cannot destroy certain parts until you unlock technologies later in the game, but eventually you can destroy pretty much everything. The best armor has a hover option like the others. You can use motion scanners to map out enemy movements and plan your strike room by room. You can use motion detecting mines to lock down/minimize enemy flanking movements. You can equip a stunning melee weapon and charge unprepared aliens. If you encounter an unwinnable situation you can recover as much gear as possible and evacuate your remaining troops. Even light plays a factor, you can use flares and phosporous weapons to reveal enemies at longer distances, night missions are horribly difficult.\n\n- The AI is fantastically brilliant, for the most part. Sometimes Aliens will seem to wander randomly, however, once they "know" you are there, they are deviously adept at tearing apart your troops. It really takes a strong tactical strategy to take them down when on a ground mission. On the overworld, the UFO sightings are not random, they are actually building forces, completing objectives, and growing in power over time.\n\n- The research projects are wonderful, they are complex enough to require a serious effort in maintaining a technological paralell with the enemy, while not so overburdened to make useless items.\n\nIt isn't a perfect game, there are some notable issues:\n\n- There are bugs with the research tree that make the game unwinnable if not researched in the right order. There are in game fixes to this but they are near impossible to figure out without a guide. Research these before you seriously play the game, or get a community-made patch that fixes it.\n\n- Sometimes you may click the wrong spot or accidentially click as you are examining the battlefield and your soldier performs the wrong action or leaves himself horribly exposed. This is an unfortunate side effect of the way the engine was made. Save often.\n\n- This game has a hard hard learning curve. You will have to restart several times a-la Dark Souls to actually learn how to play the game.\n\nYou should play this game. Do it now. :)","September 30, 2014","true","38.7"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

I'm still giving this a positive review however because there are people who swear by this game and prefer it over the original. It plays fairly similar to the previous game in the series except it's all underwater now, which adds a few unique mechanics, such as a few guns which can only be fired underwater. This game is also exceptionally more difficult. The enemies at first don't seem all that much different but soon into the game you'll start to encounter really tough enemies. Also instead of hunting down alien bases and eliminating them, there's some story behind what you're doing. There's also A LOT more two stage missions than the first game. I recommend this game for people who that the original X-com was too easy, and for those others who just want a challenge.","February 19, 2014","true","13.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

Needless to say I was hooked but I would not see this game again until a couple years later when I found it at an outlet store...and boy was I in for a surprise.\n\nTerror from the deep turned out to be much more immersing then I had previously expected and within just a few hours of playing XCOM:TFTD became one of my all time favorite video games on PC.\n\nWhere do you start with a video game that is so expansive?! I guess at the beginning. From the onset it's all about decision making. Where is your location going to be, what type of research are you going to work on, how many weapons do you purpose you need to go into battle? These are all decisions that  are up to you and from the gate I've personally never experience such huge responsibility in a video game before. Throw the fact that you only have so much money to do this with then your really in for an intense decision making situation and we haven't even gotten into any gameplay!\n\nThe games plays on a 24hr(fake time of course) time globe(that is right a globe) that charts everything on a day to day basis so a mission can happen at any moment. There are two types of battle situations. The first situation arrives from alien ship intercepts where you send your weapon fighter space jet to battle with a spotted UFO. These encounters don't last but for a few seconds but it is from this you continue to appreciate the significant amount of detail this game has to offer. From this you may destroy,  damage, or retreat from the engaged aircraft and as a result you may just be in for a very tough battle ahead of you.\n\nEnemy ships can crash, or land safely upon the ocean floor and from there the real battle takes place. As it was from the start every decision you make from fitting your squad with the right amount of armor to positioning them in the right area for combat are critical to your overall success in these missions. The gameplay is turn-based and somewhat similar to moving chess pieces across a board, only, in this case your pieces can move a lot more and pack fire power a plenty.\n\nAll the while an eerie soundtrack is playing as you move your players across an uncharted plain uncertain of where the enemy may be. The decision making, the uncertainty, the sheer adulation of a successful mission where everyone of your crew makes it home safe, these are the experiences that make up Terror from the Deep.\n\nThough this is not the more popular game of the series XCOM-TFTD was my first foray into the franchise and the experience was definitely worth more then the price of admission. Though recently the series has found its self on the next gen platform, I recommend you experience this classic masterpiece that once gave me hours of pure on the edge of your seat fun...and its a strategy game people how much more convincing do you need?!!!\n\n\n","September 12, 2013","true","31.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

X-COM: Terror From the Deep is a complex, difficult, turn-based, strategy/tactical game. Terror From the Deep was developed by Micro Prose and released in 1995.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=443213499\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Generally speaking the story is the same as X-COM: UFO Defense; you're humanities last hope, as the head of the X-COM project, all of the major world governments are funding you to keep the world safe from the extraterrestrial invasion.\nThe big difference about this game is that it's more polished and now you're fighting underwater and everything is underwater themed.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517395764\n\nGameplay: The controls are the same as X-COM: UFO Defense, so coming into the game, if you can successfully learn the first game, you can learn the second. The strategies do change somewhat, but fundamentally the game remains very similar to the first game.\nThe most note worthy changes I noticed were sound related. (The community for the classic X-COM games is really outstanding: there have been mods created to help make these games easier/more-user-friendly to play. However, I don't like modding games right away... I prefer to just suck it up and learn how to play it in it's native format)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=517396228&fileuploadsuccess=1\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for these kind of games. Just playing this game unlocked a self proclaimed title called “I can play a retro video game, and not completely stink at it”.\n\nPrice: X-COM Terror From the Deep is priced at $4.99 this is a fair asking price for a game that is quite old, and will easy pass my “dollar for every hour” played value system.\n\nConclusion: I personally a adore playing classic video games, and I especially have a softspot for games that were played on PC DOS. I recommend this game to Gamers who enjoy: DOS games, strategy games, and retro video games.\n\nOther Related Reviews Reviews coming soon\nHere's the URL to see my review for X-COM: UFO Defense\nHere's the URL to see my review for X-COM: Apocalypse\nHere's the URL to see my review for X-COM: Interceptor\nHere's the URL to see my review for X-COM: Enforcer","September 17, 2015","true","5.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","11","15","3","2"

Recently, MetalCanyon, from Slovenia, was playing through it on YouTube, and I had such a good time watching that I started it up again.  The graphics are simpler, but still fun, and it will run on just about any computer, with DOS Box or indirectly through Steam.\n\nAll the early X-Com games would occasionally develop a buggy saved game and crash, but all I've ever needed to do is go back to an earlier save and move forward.\n\nTerror from the Deep is considerably more difficult than the first game.  The tentaculates are more a threat than the chrysalids, as the tnetaculates can reach all levels. We can't avoid them by flying (swimming, in this case).  And the wonderful smart missiles don't work on land.  At least the tentaculates aren't found on land, either.\n\nThere are maybe more little hiding places in Terror than in the first game.   It really pays to systematically search the map, keeping a lookout so an enemy doesn't sneak back into an area that's been searched.  It can take a while, but it beats endlessly searching the same areas again. This series does teach some basics of small unit tactics.\n\nThe previous game is also well worth a look, with perhaps the most beautiful maps.  The next game, Apocalypse, has a real-time option that I prefer strongly, and MetalCanyon, who really likes turn-based, enjoyed it.\n\nThis series is available for very little money, and there are good Let's Plays on YouTube.  So many people love this series that a seriously updated remake is doing well.  So I think you'll find the old series well worth a look and a try.","November 28, 2013","true","541.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would say it was more of an expansion pack than a new title. Again, the port is phenomenal. Sounds are actually more consistent than the original, and all the scaling and UI interactions are perfect and functional. And again, much like the port being equally as good, the game itself is just not doing it for me as a newcomer to the X-Com franchise. Now I’m sure pro alien fighters will tell you all the groundbreaking improvements TFD brought to the the table, but to me it felt like the exact same game migrated into the oceans. As the name implies, the aliens are from the ocean rather than space. In place of interceptor fighters, one dispatches interceptor subs. The one good thing is that from my experience with UFO Defense I was able to get into the actual combat faster; sadly that combat was largely the same and just as frustrating to me fighting with the interface. If you’d like to learn a bit more about my qualms with the way the game plays then just check out my review of the original game.\nMy conclusion for X-Com number two remains the same: newcomers to the franchise will be frustrated and put off but those with childhood memories of the game will find this port to be gorgeous.","March 4, 2015","false","1.6"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","21","40","2","0"

I am writing this just moment’s after playing terror from the deep and I wanted to have a clear view of the game, so without further a due.\n\nThis is, without a doubt, THE MOST INFURIATING GAME I HAVE EVER HAD THE MISSFOURTUNE OF PLAYING!!!\nThis game did the impossible; it managed to be harder than UFO defence! HARDER!\n\nRight, lets go through this in a bit more detail.\n\nThe year is 2040, and the world is still recovering from the first alien war. alien technology from the first game is now available for all.\n\nthis has lead to countries dividing, wars waged, and a widespread of brooding synthesizers accompanying dirty cops in trench coats roaming the streets of neo-japan, looking for the dame who killed that hooker on kitaueno drive!\nwho was she to her?\nwho was she working for?\nwas it a crime of passion?\ndid she hire her and if so, why?\n\nAll these questions and more WON’T be answered because that’s now what this games about.\n\nRecently there has been alien activity going down under the sea, and now entire cruse ships are going missing, so now its up to you; the commander of the newly formed X-COM navy to find out, who these guys are, where thy are coming from, why are they attacking and most importantly, who they think they are messing with humanity (F@CK YEAH)\n\nThe Story is rather reminiscent of lovecraftian horror or rather an old doctor who episode. (The gill men are basically the sea devils) take this as ether good or bad, its really up to preference, personally I think its rather good, unlike the gameplay. Somehow, MicroProse took X-com UFO defence’s ball-breaking difficulty and managed to make it MORE DIFFICULT! The aliens cheat. There’s no other way of putting it; they are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing relentless. The levels are more diverse, now including seabeds, ports and sunken pirate ships! But this just leads to more opportunities for the aliens to bend you over the table and ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ YOU IN THE ♥♥♥! GODDAM HEARTS!!\n\nConveniently, all technology acquired from the previous war doesn’t work underwater. (I suppose we now know where mass effect 3 got its sense of logic from) so the tech trees have been changed to submersive technology. Seeing as the game takes place mostly underwater, this change is to be expected, its also pretty cool to see all the new underwater armour, weapons and even underwater TANKS!!!\n\nPRO TIP: research gauss, IMEADEANTLY! Gauss is essentially the underwater equivalent of the laser technology from UFO defence. Gauss rifles are powerful; they look cool and sound cool, especially on land.\n\nSince the gameplay is directly lifted from UFO defence, what good that comes is closely followed by the BAD. As in UFO defence, games can slow to an agonising crawl, more often than not with the “shipping route terror attacks” where you must sweep a cruse ship of aliens, while trying (and flailing) to keep as many civvies alive as possible. “Well that don’t sound to hard now” I hear you cry. Believe me, these ones are like sticking your ♥♥♥♥ in a vat of boiling ♥♥♥♥ with a fresh dollop of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and salt! ♥♥♥♥ING HEARTS!\n\nThe graphics are pretty much the same besides the sailors now look like crash test dummies but there are some cool creature designs, like the deep ones, the gill men and the lobster men.\n\nSpeaking of.\n\nF@CK THE LOBSTERZ!

You have been warned!\n\nThe music is more melancholy this time I have to admit but it suites the atmosphere quite well. It gives the feeling of a monstrous enemy remerging from a distant memory of a past war, for the first 5 minutes, then it starts to get really annoying, especially when on really frustrating missions.\n\nLike I said at the beginning, this game is not, repeat, ♥♥♥♥ING NOT A BAD GAME! “But you’ve been complaining about it more that praising it, Asum, if its not a bad game then what is it?” you say. That’s a Good question, and its one I’ve been trying to answer myself all the time I’ve been playing terror from the deep. But I now have the answer!\n\nTERROR FROM THE DEEP IS THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLE OF AN X-COM GAME, AND THE GREATEST CHALANGE FOR A STRATAGY FAN!\nThink about it; ridiculously hard levels, cheating enemy AI, an adversary with an unfair advantage and a THOUSAND WAYS TO ♥♥♥♥ UP! (Oh screw you hearts!)\n\nThese are all things X-COM is universally praised for, by critics and gamers alike!\n\nAnd no X-COM game is as brutal and sadistic as Terror from the deep! But, it is because of this, this is the game to put all strategy aficionados to the test and most likely break them!\n\nSO THERS YOUR REASON TO BUY TERROR FROM THE DEEP!\nIf you’re a masochistic turn-based strategy, or real time strategy fan who wants to get sectioned, then click “add to cart” RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!","May 29, 2014","true","95.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Read my review of XCOM Ufo Defense if you want the dirt, because this game is nearly identical to that one, except it has new content and setting. Underwater based instead of land based, with new guns, aliens, etc. Some things are obvious reskin/renames, some are new. Because of the derivative nature this game will always take a slight back seat to the original but it remains a classic in its own right, as the clausterphobic nature of deep sea tactical battles against unseen aliens is classically compelling.

But in the black-and-white rating system I must give it a thumb down. It is not that the game is not good, it is because the game is unnecessary hard on places it shouldn't be. Also we must remember that TFD is always compared to its predecessor Ufo Defence, which is The Game of its genre, even over 20 years after its debut.\n\nThe TFD is basically a somewhat tweaked Ufo Defence with all the loved features and "hated" enemy arch-types. But it also has one of the most hated missions ever: the attacks on ships. These two-level missions have a lot of places for the aliens to hide and I mean hide. It hasn't been one or two times to spend hours to snoop every crank and closet on a ship, only to find that there is another level waiting you to scrutine it as thoroughly. Second mission type with same flaw is the Alien Base assault missions. First you need to infiltrate an elevator with brute force (seriously, you need a lot of firepower if you want to succeed at all and even that can turn against you) facing the most fearsome enemies there is. Then your survivors face another level with lots of places to be ambushed and an enemy that can withstand enormous amounts of firepower (the infiltration is the key to success here). Honestly, two mission types with two levels is too much of a grind. It doesn't need to be a walk in the park, but neither a climb to K2 mountain.\n\nOne huge flaw (at least in the original cd-version) was in the technology research. You had to research the vital research in just the right order or else you were stuck. This happened to me more than once back in the days, when I had assaulted the 15th alien base with my pajamas, because I did the research in the wrong order. Another flaw in here is that if you don't manage to capture certain alien in certain timeframe, it becomes almost impossible to obtain it ever again. It could be only couple of mission where you have the chance to capture it and it is vital for your research. Don't know if that has been resolved for this one, but I am not taking any chances ever again.\n\nAlso I dislike the games ending. It was really anti-climatic after brutally beating the game for two weeks, grinding missions as I concentrated all my efforts on fast-researching the final technologies. For the last minute I waited somekind of Cthulhu-class monster to appear, but nothing like that happened.\n\nI recommend this game to those enthusiastic Ufo Defence players who want to experience something little different but still the same. But be warned, it won't be pretty. I myself won't be touching this game for a long, long time and rather play the Ufo Defence over and over again.","March 23","false","18.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

The gameplay is challenging and rewarding, although it is very clunky. I didn't realise how much the atmposphere meant to me until I played this game. TFTDs music is nothing short of horrible. Remember the music that played before a terror mission in UFO? It was just what you needed to get hyped before the mission started. In this game the music sounds like a 1950s low budget horror film. The starting items are confusing as all hell, I mean what is the difference between a dart gun and a harpoon gun? What does a partical disturbance grenade do and how does it differentiate from a magna-blast grenade?!? In UFO defense you could easily understand an items function by looking at its name.\n\nIt's due to stuff like confusing names and a game breaking tech tree (researching projects in the wrong order can render the game unfinishable) that you will almost certainly have to rely on a guide if you don't want to restart this game constantly. This isn't even taking into account how difficult the game is which oddly enough is one of the few things that they did right. After getting a hang of the basics and researching some good gear, UFO defense got very easy. The game also feels a lot buggier. I occasionally see a 3 tile long river just floating in the blackness outside the map. Terror missions seem to take place in a village located in bizzaro land where the houses are built into the side of never ending hills. There are 1 tile wide tunnels dotted around the map that exist for no other purpose than to make the mission harder.\n\nThe only postive thing I can say about this game is that the combat feels a lot better and is more challenging. However I think it sacrificed too much for it.\n\nIn conclusion, just play UFO defense with mods. The atmosphere as a whole is better and the bugs aren't game breaking.","February 29","false","7.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Well it uses DosBox but has it configured better than others, but not by much.  No keyboard support, a magical 3 or so frames per sec on the geoscape, and terrible sound syncing in missions.  Alt tabbing is risky.  I've had a crash or two.  I should mention I'm playing on Windows 8.\n\nWith all that said this version of the game is playable and is probably the most playable one I've seen on new systems, but once you're playing with all those negatives, you're actually playing Terror from the Deep which is a horrid sequal to a great game.  Giant maps on small ships?  Slow movement?  Low accuracy, low ammo, and panicks?  You bet!  (This gun does not fire outside of water!)  Then why let me equip it?!  Have 2+ people standing close together?  Enjoy getting grenaded on your first mission.\n\nUntil the Open Xcom boys actually support Terror from the Deep you're better off avoiding this one, and its very understandable why they wouldn't want to waste their time on it.","January 3, 2015","false","4.9"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","2"

I personally love it, but for most people this game is going to be an exercise in beating your head against a brick wall and trying desperately to achieve results.\n\nThe combat is exceptionally difficult, research and development takes a very long time, and everything relies so heavily on randomized elements of the game that it is literally impossible to beat the game in most play throughs. Generally your budding organization will get wiped out before it gets very far into establishing itself at all.\n\nYou play this game to challenge yourself and see how far you can get before the systems in play destroy you.

Myself, I can finish the original x-com with any difficulty level, with few if no reloading at all: the game is very punishing, but if you start to know the kind of maps, of enemies, how to dispose your men, which equipment to use, how to snipe from afar and eventually destroy covers... There is a lot of tricks and knowledge to apply in an x-com game... But in this one...\nUnfortunately, TFTD just bring everything to frustration, ruining the perfect balance and gameplay (which was already difficult to be honest) of its predecessor. Aliens have so much life and such accuracy, and could hide for rounds behind a sea weed because of some graphic bug before you find them, or be invisible behind a cactus without any of your 14 men realizing anything untill a granade drops killing everybody: such things might happen also in the original xcom (which in the end is the very same game), but rarely not every time in every single map. It is really embarassing how they got worse every single aspect of this game, exacerbating the defects of x-com without adding any improvement at all and making it look more confusing and clumsy.\n\nSo, whoever you are, a gamer that does wants to discover this epic serie or a hardcore gamer looking for a challange, just skip this and play the original x-com. If after masterying it and finishing it you will still want more you can give this terror from the deep a try, but you will probably go back to the original, which is really better in every single aspect, from gameplay to music and graphics.","December 18, 2014","false","8.1"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","3","15","0","0"

Whereas the original was 100% gameplay addiction, this one added supense through music, setting (underwater...  creepy), and harder difficulty, bringing a natural next "phase" to the human war on the alien menace.\n\nThough it is now not as accessible as current renditions such as XCOM or Xenonauts, it has a unique setting and compelling gameplay that keeps me coming back 20 years later.\n\nRuns well on modern systems via DosBox (included in Steam version).","August 13, 2014","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember sitting down and watching my Dad play this game for hours when I was little. I barely played it at the time but I always wanted to play it again. Now I have the chance. I purchased it for $4.99, which is a complete and utter steal. This game is worth at least 10x that amount. Graphics are nothing epic, pretty basic and simple, which is okay with me. I like simplicity. The gameplay itself is really smooth, no lag of any sort, and so far I have yet to experience a bug/glitch. Of course every game has some, no game, like a person, is perfect, but I've been fortunate to never have a bad experience with this game. The worst I've had is reloading the game here and there because one of my Aquanauts died. Other than that, it's smooth sailing.

I remember my first expirience with XCOM.  A buddy and I came acrross a a Demo disk for TFTD (Terror from the Deap).  It was 1 mission which we played over and over on night till we understood the game.  It quickly became a must have and was purchased (DOS).  After playing it what what seems to be several months I finally beat it and moved on to the Original XCOM Enenmy Unknown which was the first of the series.  TFTD is my favoirite of the two but I'm sure thats just because it was my first XCOM experience.\n\nI had been using DOS BOX to play them long before I found them on steam.  When I saw them I was so excieted because I thought Steam had them recoded them to work in the later versions of windows.  I was a little disapointed to find out that I payed for something I already had since I had already discovered how to set them up in DOSBox.  Steam does take the trail and error out of setting up the DOSbox and getting all the sound and stuff working so I still Recomend buying them when they go on special, especially if you want all the Games.  Almost 20 years later I can still play XCOM now I find myself explaining to my wife and child why this game is still better that the newly released XCOM games (which I own and have beeten) nothing made these days takes the same kind of time and effort to beat.  Back in the Day we would buy a game for $30-$50 and have it take almost a year to beat.  No $50-$60 buys you a game you can complete in 20 hours or less of play. :-(","November 5, 2015","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Disturbing and compelling.  The game shines in the underwater areas, the cool alien subs and interesting alien technology.\n\nUse Xcom Util to fix the game-breaking bugs.  I never cheat, but this tool allows you to.  I also always play "ironman", so no save-reloading, and I always play on the hardest difficulty.\n\nMy personal tip for enjoying this game is to skip (arrive, but leave immediately) the cruise-ship missions unless you've got a lot of time.  You will lose score (not always a bad thing as the game gets harder the better you do), but better than losing your sanity, do well in other missions, and you can beat the game even when you skip them.\n\nPro-tip:  Buy/build submersible weapon systems, use them as scouts, snipe from afar.\n\nAn interesting relic from a long time ago, and one of my favourite games of all time.

The second tries to do more of the same, it is basically an underwater re-skin of the first. Of course it falls a bit short of that goal, but it's still an atmospheric and fun game.\n\nThe gameplay is identical, but the atmosphere, the "feeling" of the game, is different. Most of the negatives should really be positives, but they don't quite work our. The main problem is that the maps are much bigger, which leads to many missions turning into a "where's Waldo"-version of alien hunting. One terror mission took me about two hours to complete, compared to maybe 30 minutes in the first game, and about half of that time I spent just running around an empty ship looking through each cabin after the lone hiding alien.\n\nThe difficulty is also severely ramped up from the already difficult first game, the difficulty teeters on the edge of frustratingly impossible, however, it would have been worse if it was too easy or easier than the first.\n\nOverall, good game, but only get this if you have already finished the superior first game and is looking for more of the same, but with an increased challenge.","April 17, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

While labeled as a sequel, this would be more accurately described as an expasion or perhaps even a mod.  Practically a reskin, while there are new enemies and new weapons and bigger maps and all that jazz, if you look past the surface similarities, not too much has changed between this first game and the second.  I'd even go so far as to say that the changes in map size make the game more annoying if anything, since now hunting down that last alien can be a real trial in map awareness.\n\nIf you liked the first game a lot I'd recommend getting this on a deal.  If you didn't, you should probably pass.

This is, to my mind, one of the ultimate sequels in gaming history.  It takes the gameplay of the original, but improves the AI, changes the gameplay just enough to keep things fresh, and builds on the original strengths.\n\nThough many criticise it for being too similar, I find this to be a strength.  If you played the original, it added a more atmospheric and darker story, with maps and creatures pulled from the nightmares of H.P. Lovecraft.  Whereas the original was 100% gameplay addiction, this one added supense through music, setting (underwater...  creepy), and harder difficulty, bringing a natural next "phase" to the human war on the alien menace.\n\nThough it is now not as accessible as current renditions such as XCOM or Xenonauts, it has a unique setting and compelling gameplay that keeps me coming back 20 years later.\n\nRuns well on modern systems via DosBox (included in Steam version).","August 13, 2014","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember my first expirience with XCOM.  A buddy and I came acrross a a Demo disk for TFTD (Terror from the Deap).  It was 1 mission which we played over and over on night till we understood the game.  It quickly became a must have and was purchased (DOS).  After playing it what what seems to be several months I finally beat it and moved on to the Original XCOM Enenmy Unknown which was the first of the series.  TFTD is my favoirite of the two but I'm sure thats just because it was my first XCOM experience.\n\nI had been using DOS BOX to play them long before I found them on steam.  When I saw them I was so excieted because I thought Steam had them recoded them to work in the later versions of windows.  I was a little disapointed to find out that I payed for something I already had since I had already discovered how to set them up in DOSBox.  Steam does take the trail and error out of setting up the DOSbox and getting all the sound and stuff working so I still Recomend buying them when they go on special, especially if you want all the Games.  Almost 20 years later I can still play XCOM now I find myself explaining to my wife and child why this game is still better that the newly released XCOM games (which I own and have beeten) nothing made these days takes the same kind of time and effort to beat.  Back in the Day we would buy a game for $30-$50 and have it take almost a year to beat.  No $50-$60 buys you a game you can complete in 20 hours or less of play. :-(","November 5, 2015","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
