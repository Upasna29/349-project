I think I've clocked a good 100+ hours on this game, so believe me when I say, that I do not regret a single bit of it. Roguelands is currently in Early Access as you may already know, this means that there are plenty of new and exciting content that is yet to be implimented in the game, with that said, I do indeed love indie games as much as I love the next.\n\nFrom what I've noticed during the gameplay there are couple of pros and cons that are to be pointed out, though many other reviews have probably already covered it:\n\nPros    Fairly simple mechanics to work with\nA variety of unique recipes\nMultiplayer feature is always a plus\nCons    Bugs, though there are literally bugs in the game but I'm talking coding wise\nSince the game is in an Early Access state, much of its content is yet to be released\nThe death penalties (this one is just my opinion cause I'm an angry player :P)\nWith all that's been said, sure there are plenty of other indie games that are like it e.g. Terraria and Starbound, both of which are pretty great indie games to kill some time on but even then each game has its own special features which keeps the game interesting, keeping in mind that Roguelands is indeed still in Early Access, it is a given that the game is bound to have bugs and it's up to community to spot such problems in order for Roguelands to progress and become a better game. I recommend that you should try a friends copy if not buy one yourself and support the developer as well :D\n\nI hope this review helps in regards to your choice of purchasing Roguelands or not.\n\nEDIT\nInitially the game was perfectly fine until the developer released a couple updates, which caused for an abundance of bugs to appear, which you'll notice in the forums. I did recommend Roguelands in its previous state, however, there are just one too many bugs to deal with the current build, that it'll throw your gaming experience for Roguelands in shambles. I do not recommend playing the game as it is at the moment or another option is to test the waters of Roguelands and report your bug findings yourself.\n\nEDIT 2\nSo at this point in time, I've clocked almost 300 hours on this game. Everything is a hella lot more stable now, plus there have been an abundance in updates with new items, misc, npcs, etc. since my last review update. Nevertheless, after all this time, I'm still enjoying this game as a solo player but I enjoy it the most when you muck around with friends in multiplayer. The ultimate weapons and armor update piqued my interest the most because your favourite weapon or armor can get reskinned with better stats. Roguelands is a definite go to indie game if you're looking for a fun, moderately fast paced game to play with friends.\n\nOne negative aspect of the game that has bothered me the most so far, is that the save files aren't saved onto a server, it is local based, meaning you can't take your character and ship progress with you, should you decide to play from another pc.\n\nEDIT 3 (This one is more of a personal opinion from a Roguelands player standpoint)\nNow that I've hit the 300+ hours of gameplay milestone, it is safe to say that bugs will be there until the full release but even then, should there be updates for new content, expect bugs. Not every player are the same in terms of playstyle, preferences, thought process, etc. I thought that I'd get bored after 300+ hours, at one point this was true but then I remembered that there is A LOT OF CONTENT yet to be released, as matter fact, Sean still have plans for new "Combat Chips" which I'm definitely looking forward to.\n\nThere's always that one guy who doesn't think the review is helpful, feel free to message me on what part of the review that you disliked and didn't find helpful, I'd be more than glad to take an opinion and discuss it. Then again, they're probably just jealous cause their review isn't top //dramatic hair flick","May 1","true","711.9"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","33","35","5","1"

For a 9,99€ game you can spend more time playing it and enjoying youself than you could with a 60€ Game that after a while you might get bored!!\n\nDifficult?\n\nThis game is not easy, I have to say this! YOU WILL DIE A LOT!!\nI don't wanna spoil it so much so i'll just say that it's EXTREMELY HARD!\nAnd also if you die you lose your items and your character level will RESET but the items in the storage are SAFE! So as long as everytime you go to the spaceship you place your items such as loot, extra weapons and everything else you don't need at that moment in the storage, dying will not cause much harm!!\n\nFun?\n\nYes.\nLike any other game, playing solo isn't so much fun as playing with your friends so if you want to have fun make sure to play with other people because no one likes to play alone! NOT THE SAME\n\nChallenging?\nIt doesn't mean that being is hard is challenging however in this case the game is HARD AND CHALLENGING because it's a matter of dodging and trying to hit the enemies and you also need good gear to progress!\n\nSo if you don't have this game yet, GO BUY IT NOW !

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedTheBaconSaint/recommended/364420/","RedTheBaconSaint","Microsoft Powerpoint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedTheBaconSaint/","103 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPicture this: You're transported to a mysterious planet with three fellow space cadets, sent to retrieve that last rare resource from the plants that reside within so as to create the mythical weapon of your dreams. As you arrive, you are greeted with an army of wild beasts ready to rip your bones from your body, and the planet itself seems like it's trying to destroy you.\nYou fight your way through horde after horde, mining ore and collecting resources along the way, all of you barely scraping through as you narrowly avoide the swiping claws and chomping jaws of your enemies. You all make it to the top of the world, out of reach from those below you, but barely alive. You pass around the last health potion each as you ration out your supplies and prepare to harvest the plant in front of you.\nFinally, you and your fellow space cadets are ready, and move to harvest the flora, before hearing a mighty, bloodcurdling roar that seems to echo all around you. The four of you turn around to see a gigantic, shadowy figure hurtling towards you, appearing almost as big as the planet itself.\nYou ready your weapons, let out a battle cry of your own, and charge towards the fierce beast.\n\nRoguelands is an incredible 2-D multiplayer rogue-like RPG set in space except not always in space and most of the time on foreign planets rather than space itself.\nDid that grab your attention? Great, because it gets better from here.\n\nIf you played Magicite (an earlier game from the same developer; Sean Young), then you will feel right at home with the combat and the controls in general. However, Roguelands still brings fresh, new experiences and features to the table that not only offers great new content, but also enhances the already simple-yet-fun style of Magicite.\nIf you haven't played Magicite, then so long as you've played basically any 2-D platformer before, then you're sure to feel comfortable as the style is very close to home, and it will not take you too long to develop a feel for the controls.\n\nRoguelands offers perma-death, as any rogue-like will, and features procedural generation of worlds, as any rogue-like will. Obviously, this is not an easy game, and you are certain to die time and time again, especially at the start of your Roguelands experience. So if a challenging game is not for you, then do not bother with it.\nRoguelands also offers 4-player online multiplayer with a drop-in/drop-out feature to allow seamless interaction between players. I must say, as much fun as this game is, Roguelands truly shines when you're playing with your friends, and makes the experience all the more enjoyable.\n\nThe game is only in early-access now, and does not have an extravagant amount of content, but it has so much potential, and is an incredible amount of fun nonetheless.\n\nGameplay: 7.9/10 (Lost points as it is still buggy at the moment, but this is Day 1 of public release at time of posting - expect this to rise as the game progresses.)\nGraphics: 8.5/10 (The 2-D nature is very enjoyable and pleasant to look at it, and is nostalgic with a touch of modern design making for a great mix.)\nSoundtrack: 8.5/10 (w.Flux has done an amazing job on the music, and really captures the wild, unpredictable nature of the various worlds in the game.)\nOverall score: 8.3/10 (It's only in its very early stages of development, but holds an amazing amount of potential, and is a lot of fun even now, despite the various bugs that are present.)\n\nThanks for reading!\n~RedMasta","November 8, 2015","true","17.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

The developer has taken everything great from his first game and expanded upon it in this new space age style rogue RPG.\n\nThe combat system has been given a sleek new look with its own combat screen and skills menu, which gives fighting monsters some added intensity.\n\nAdditionally the foraging mechanic has been amped up by the introduction of droids or bots which harvest resource nodes for the player. This seems like a little change, but speeds the pace of the game significantly as you now have the option of multitasking which has been unseen in the likes of many other similar themed games.\n\nRelated to the foraging, the crafting is vast and will leave you itching to find out what other combinations you can make.\n\nThe visuals are stunning and gorgeous, and the music is beautifully composed and matches the beauty of the scenes. This is almost unheard of in early access indie games and is a great treat.\n\nAlthough this game has many Pros, it does have its downsides. I can see the gameplay becoming stale after a while, much like its counterparts, but I believe that just comes with the genre of these games.\n\nThe game can be frustratingly hard and leave you feeling cheated with some of the current enemies and environmental hazards. Not to mention it is a bit of a pain to play with friends, but that is to be expected with an early access.\n\n\nOverall, Roguelands has great potential and will bring you hours of fun, whether you are exploring by yourself or playing with your friends.

The game has promise.\nIf you liked Magicite, you'll be right on-board for this one.\n\nAction, adventure, RPG... harsh penalty for death.  If these things sound good to you, you might be at home.\n\nThe one thing I will say though, is that at this point in time, there is a lot of things that are unfinished. Beyond the first 4~ zones/biomes of the game, they are all barren and void of enemy life.\n\nAdditionally, there isn't a "driving force" behind my actions in the game. I just go to some planet, kill some things, loot stuff, make gear, then rinse and repeat until I inevitably die.\n\nI'll change my review as it progresses, but as it stands right now, I would advise people who are on the fence to wait a while for the weekly updates, then make a decision.\n\nIf you care to see some more videos of the game, I have posted a few on my channel:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ax2J_YVnzUw","November 8, 2015","true","9.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatacorker/recommended/364420/","whatacorker","Buzz Corker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatacorker/","88 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLove it. Even without any friends.\n\n...\n\n;-;\n\n\nEdit: On a more serious note though, the developer(s) (I'm really not sure whether it's a small team or just one man, so excuse my ignorance please) are constantly bringing more, and more content incredibly frequently via updates to the game.\n\nThe game is a fun rogue-like experience, yet the use of being able to store your items in a HUGE chest which stay there even after death (the only things you lose upon death are the items on you at the time) makes this game a lot less frustrating than you may expect it to be, as you keep a lot of your things. A lot of people may be glad about this, while others, who are looking for a more serious rogue-like game, will probably find it too easy for a rogue-like genre of game, but my personal views on the matter are mixed. Without the chest, you would be able to replay the game from the beginning and have a different enjoyable experience every time, while it being more of a classic rogue-like game. Whereas the usage of the chest means that you can 'complete' the game ('complete' meaning get the best gear possible as there is no 'end game' per se) a lot easier than if there were no chests, meaning the game will last a lot shorter amount of time overall. However, dying does delete your character, meaning that you have to make a new one and start from level 1 again and gain all of your stats back.\n\nThe last thing I want to touch on is the fact that you are able to build your own ship... well, customise your own ship. It's a very basic, yet fun, addition to the game which allows you to make loads of cool rooms where you can add more machines or hang the badge/poster/photo things that you can receive from killing enemies - even bosses - on the walls of your ship (it's a rare drop but looks like a sort of photo of the creature in a frame which you are able to place on the walls in your ship or sell for a hefty price. Pretty neat).\n\nThe developer(s) are going in the right direction with this game and it's updates; they are always adding new weapons, armour, biomes and bosses for the user to battle - making the game a lot more fun and giving the player many more things to aim for with each update.\n\n8/10 - Better with friends, but still a heck of a lot of fun on your own (and a lot more challenging).","April 8","true","23.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","13","15","13","0"

After you succesfully complete each level you go to a safe level where you can buy items using credits, store items on you and either teleport back to your main ship or carry on going. If you go back to the ship you can craft new emblems to get new gear and use the alchemy station to combine items for health packs, mana packs, stamina packs and droid fuel (droid fuel is currently useless).\n\nThere are different tier emblems and when you combine 3 different emblems of the same tier (tiers 1-4) you can get new armours (helmet, torso and shield) new weapons (staves, gauntlets, guns, cannons, swords and lances) or new droids (look different but do the same in build 0.4.6).\n\nTo get these emblems you combine 10 of the same item (10 flutterflies for a flutterfly emblem for example).\n\nSo essentially the first planet you're on is for gathering every resource you see and cautiously killing everything launched at you to level up and get more powerful. The further into the game you get the better gear you get but each biome can gradually get harder. Desolate canyon being the easiest imo and hollow cavern being the hardest imo of the 3 currently playable.\n\nThat's all for now.","November 6, 2015","true","10.3"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/recommended/364420/","deadjackfr","Deadjack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadjackfr/","898 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou tried Risk of Rain and you still feel cheated?\nBinding of Isaac was a bit too random for you?\nNuclear Throne was a nightmare?\n\nTired of punishing games?\n\nWelcome to Roguelands dear players... this is the game we've been waiting for!\n\n\nPlot: You embark on a journey through the universe to fight a deadly enemy. Will you and your friends have what it takes to save the galaxy?\n\nGraphics:In the same vein of Nuclear-Throne and other retro styled games. Reminds me games on Sega platforms back in the days but much more varied and colored. Clear enough to see everything, only combat mode reduces a bit your line of sight and it's tricky when dangers are moving around.\nAnimations are great and levels are all different. Pictures of characters around your ship are nice too.\n\nMusic:From a calm ballade to more "punchy" tracks, the game offers nice musics that fits perfectly this type of game.\nSound effects are correct.\n\n\nGameplay:As a fighter and an exploratory, you venture on planets filled with monsters, peaceful creatures and resources.\nRogueland is based on very tight controls and dynamic fights. To support you in your quest you will have to farm components and discover new recipes to craft powerful gear (every characters have a robot that collect resources). And it's where this game is great: the fact that even if you will die ALL THE TIME, you can store your gear if your leave your current level.\nIndeed, each level has a teleporter that you can take to access a safe area with a Storage , few peaceful creatures to kill and get money/ resources and few platforms where you can trade cash for items. After having explored the area you can continue in another level or return to your ship (where you can retrieve storage, crafting stations and even npc that you may have saved).\n\nRogueland forces you move everywhere, using your dash and jump movements to dodge dangers and enemies.\nThe limit of your mobility is your stamina (which regen with time) and your skills that use your mana (that you can restore with orbs from enemies or regen packs bought or crafted).\nSo if you learn enemies’ behavior and prepare your character's load-out or stats without killing him (there is no respawn, so you must farm with low level heroes and protect your best ones) you will be ready for bosses.\n\nBosses, another aspect of the game which is delightful!  They can be summoned if you kill a certain amount of "required" enemies. I've only beaten the first boss. To start the fight i had to kill few worms and the boss spawned. A huge worm very fast and powerful. Before the struggle i prepared the area by cleaning every monster and note the movements of orbiting rocks (yes gravity on other planets is strange). I also crafted few potions to last as long as possible. And i made it!\n\nDon't take me wrong but in a game like Nuclear Throne where bosses spawns anywhere, weapon drops are random like nearly everything in this title... it's A REAL pleasure to have at last a game that gives you more options and forces to be smart instead of wasting hundred of hours in desperate attempts.\n\nAdd to that the fact that you can host a game and bring some friends to fight together (not each other) and you can guess that Rogueland is a must.\n\nLife Span:Even if it's an early access, the game has a lot of potential (3 levels for the moment with 1 boss and around 50 recipes) especially if you bring some friends or want to try new classes. Can't wait to see future updates, the next one prepares loots that you can discover upon the death of your character. Dying has never been so funny!\n\n\n\nTO CONCLUDE:\n9 bucks for a game that shines high above Nuclear Throne and others. With multiplayer, perma-death but perma storage between characters. Tight controls with tight fights. Hundreds of recipes and items.\nDozens of characters classes (the 2 stats you choose at beginning gives you an archetype and an orientation of gameplay), you can even choose a race and have chances at a certain level cap to unlock others with stats bonus. Add to that skins, factions, costumes, combat chips (that enhance directly your skills), helpfull npc to save....\n\nSTOP\n\nAmazing early access that will surely shine in the next few months. A must.","November 11, 2015","true","5.9"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","15","21","3","12"

I was so hyped when this game was about to get released.\nRoguelands earlyaccess is finally out.\nThe suprising thing is that i am not disapointed by it.\nOk this is roguelands right now---\n1. Gameplay\nIt has extremely similar aspects from magicite. Maybe even too much.\nYou enter a stage and you walk gathering stuff and killing creatures. When you are finished you go to the stages ending. The stages are longer than magicites, But when you reached the end you get 3 options to 3 different planets. No suprise this idea is straight from magicite, Theres alot of more similarities between Magicite and roguelands. But Roguelands has(shall) ALOT more.\n2. Crafting and stuff---\nMagicite has a bunch of armors and weapons. The weapon types are Lance, Sword, Cannon, Gun, Gau ntlet, and staffs for now. There are different tiers of these. Whenever you craft some gear it has a chance to have different tiers. Wellmade and blabla. I guess you know the deal. You craft things out of emblems. You make emblems out of 10 out of the same material. Then you combine 3 different emblems to get a new thing. But a big difference from magicite is that you CANT combine things in your inventory. You can only make things when you are in the base. So you have to prepare.\n3. Graphic wise---\nThey are really nice and pleasing. The places you visit has a nice feeling.\n4. Uptate wise---\nYes this game will be uptate every week on thursdays! So that will keep the game always fresh. Even when the game is out of early access the dev will still uptate. I do feel kinda bad for the creator in mind of he is going to work all the time on this game. I hope he likes making games (which he does).\n\nThere isnt too much to say really. The game just got released and all the things arent here just yet.","November 6, 2015","true","96.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","17","25","3","2"

However, to think I have logged 15 hours with only 3 Planets and minimum features, I know this game will have a vast amount of potential. There are currently 8 Planet sprites in the navigation menu which means I could look for around another 25 hours of game time at this rate? Mind you this number is without:\n\nDroid Functions (besides resource gathering)\nCombat Chips\nVarious Unlockables (Races, Uniforms, Augments)\nNPC Recruitment\nRandomly Generated Scenarios\nWeapon Combining\nNeed I go on? This game will only get better and SmashGames already has put out a great game (Magicite), proving that they can do it. By the time v1.0 comes out, this will certainly be on my short list.","November 9, 2015","true","46.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

It’s also a luck based game as your items stats depend on the item being magical, as a magical item enhances the original skills the normal item has.

It's very similar to magicite with a few differences that completely screwed me over for the first few rounds before I got slightly better at the game. It's extremely difficult but very fun and I recommend it for all people who played magicite. You might want to wait a bit though. The game is rather buggy at the moment and the content is kinda lacking. Maybe wait a month and it'll be in better shape.\nAs of the moment I'd give it a 7/10. This is likely to change later though\n\n-edit: After playing it for a bit more, I found the empty levels everyone was talking about. There was no music and no life. And it eventually started to go where there weren't textures made for the places. Sean, you need to fix this.\nAlso, there's no real need to unlock higher tiers of weapons. I went through all the levels with tier 1 stuff and didn't have any problems.\n\n*edit\nMuch content has now been added. As of today, the last planet so far, the Molten crag is being finished. It's very fun now and I'd change my review to 8.5/10\n\n*What? Another edit? Whenever this game gets updated, it gets better and better. It now has plenty of content that will keep you collecting and exploring for a while. The perma-death feature isn't too bad EXCEPT WHEN YOU LOSE YOU LEVEL 101 CHARACTER TO THOSE DARN SLIVERS!","November 9, 2015","true","47.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It's essentially an improved version of his last game, Magicite. Content is added weekly.\n\nIt's a very easy game to learn and great fun with friends from the short amount of time it takes to do a run.\n\nI have a lot of faith in sean to be able to do very good things with this game. However, it seemed like magicite was left high and dry, and is no longer recieving the updates it had claimed to and I hope the same won't happen again.\n\nIf you're on edge, it might be best to wait a little bit to see if the game continues to be added with enough content to make it worth the price point, but if you can grab it on a sale, I highly reccomend picking it up.\n\nMy copy was given by the dev, however it did not change my stance on the game.","November 19, 2015","true","2.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","9","14","3","0"

However, once getting a hold of the very comfortable control scheme and crafting system, you start learning the real challenges Roguelands has to offer. The game offers plenty of constantly updated planets that progresssively get much more difficult. Once you feel like you have a firm grasp of the difficulty, Roguelands offers to increase the difficultly to 3 more times whilst offering better loot if you're willing to sacrfice some in-game currency. This adds tons of reason to wanting to keep playing. However, no matter how many hours you pour into one character, death is inevitable, but there is alwasys something to learn with each death..\nAlthough, this game obviously runs into some bugs, and many balancing issues I feel need to be worked out, it does not handicap the overall amazing experience you will get from Roguelands for just $10.","May 2","true","42.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After beating the first lvel, you have the option to either go to the next level, which will be harder, or cash in and head to your ship. You then improve with your items and go back for more. Improving each time to go farther. A few notes. Perma death is a thing. Your ship, unless you reset your save, always saves and you can store items in it. No time limit in levels unlike in magicite. No crafting outside ship. A LOT more RPG like and will just become even more. No controller support and finally, a lot of unfinished content that might turn some off like no stat armor, horrible bugs, unfinished biomes and all that stuff. If you want, wait for 1.0 when no unfinished content is there.=)\n\nPROS\n- Sci-fi RPG with rich gameplay\n- Very grand in all enviroments and feels epic.\n- Crafting is unique\n- Unique UI for combat\n- Creative progression\n- Awesome soundtrack\n- Dank Multiplayer\n- Early Acess excitement\n\nCONS\n- Early acess bugs and unfinished content\n- Harder than some may expect\n- Hamachi Multiplayer (seans trying man)\n- Very limited content and gets easy in late game.","December 11, 2015","true","111.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

The background music of : ( sorry can't remember is name, But you are so damn cool man) and the art of Sean. It's just perfect.\n\nThe combat system is awesome, fast-paced, lot of weapon choices, differents enemies, traps everything you need really.\nAlso the adition of skill( combat chips is gonna be awesome)\n\nI also really enjoy the difficulty( even thought I find it a bit easy) I know a lot of people are saying the game is too hard but guys, this is part of the fun :D ( it's like dark souls just mash your head on the wall until you succeed)\nI'll probably do video later to show some tips and tricks\n\nOf course the game is in Early acces so there's only 3 Biomes tou can visit at the and there's just a couple of items.\nAnd some items that are not supposed to be there but it's normal, It's early acces\n\nReally I can't wait for the final product, please Sean we need more!!!\n\nHere Somethings you could add:\n- a key to swap 2 weapons while in combat to creat differente combat style ( ex: lance with magic gauntlet)\n-Lore, I Demand Lore!!! Please sean give us a story!\n-Unique encounters.\n-Something so we can see what's the influence of each stats( when we put our mouse on it or a book on the ship)\n\nAnyway, As a solo Developper I thnik Sean is realy great and I believe that once Rogueland achieve the 1.0.0 build it could be as good as Fez or Braid or Super Meat Boy ( the Kings of the Indie genre)\n\nGood Job Sean, Your Awesome and Thanks for the awesome game :D Keep up the good work\n","November 7, 2015","true","146.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VolcanicGamingSarge/recommended/364420/","VolcanicGamingSarge","[1]Wilko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VolcanicGamingSarge/","168 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRoguelands is a multiplayer 2D RPG. It has platforming elements much like Magacite but still manages to be satisfyingly unique. Developed and published by SmashGames we all knew we were getting into something fun and exciting. This game seems highly influenced by his previous game, Magacite and you can definitely see that. Sean, the developer of SmashGames, states he has not abandoned his first game, Magacite and in fact will be updating the game just as soon as Roguelands reaches version 1.0. Sean continues to update this game weekly and will be for a long time, he keeps his buyers up to date with information on the upcoming patches and can be easily accessed just below the page on Steam. Currently the game is priced at £6.99/ $10.00 and will presumably stay at this price. Hosting servers either requires: LAN IP addresses, Hamachi or other 3rd party programs or port forwarding. There might be other ways of creating severs but so far these are the only 3 I have found. Be sure to check you can do one of the above before purchasing this game to play with friends.\n\nEnough of that, let me tell you the pros and cons about the game. Let me start out with the positives. So far I have played this game for 15 hours, I can see myself playing it for longer as it is just really enjoyable. This game is more fulfilling on your own but I have had a great time playing it with my friends as well. It offers a lot of different options to make your play style unique to the other players around you. The game has several different races to choose from, every player starts with the first one and by doing different things through your play through's you can unlock other races. Each race has 2 or 3 stats that it's dedicated to, weather it be dexterity and magic or strength and faith. All of these offer different weapons some using melee, others using ranged attacks including magic. Then the different weapons in the game also increase a specific stat and getting a prefix on the item can increase this set stat. Each stat has gives you a different weapon strength is a sword, dexterity a gun, magic a staff ect. For example, the Aether Blade which is a strength and dexterity based weapon gives you +1 Strength and +1 Dexterity.  I really like this mechanic and it was slightly used in Magacite but has been massively progressed in Roguelands. When you luck out in this game it is incredible, weather it be if you get yourself T4 legendary armour from a mystery box or if you ship droids give you a high level emblem. It has awesome art and design, the style of the game makes you want to keep coming back as it is just harmlessly addictive. It is very fast passed so you're never bored and it gives you non stop rewards. It offers lot's and lot's of replay-ability and combined with it's beautiful sound track, you can try not to, but you'll always come back for more.\n\nHowever, every game must have it's bad side. Roguelands so far is not a hard game, the initial challenge can be slightly hard to get a grip on but as soon as you learn game mechanics the game becomes very easy and starts too become repetitive, grindy even. There are several different worlds for you to explore on your own or with friends but most of them just feel like re-skins of the other worlds and code seems to have been taken from Magacite. When playing on your own the game requires a bit more skill as the damage of enemies and the swarms of them can become overwhelming, this can result in a quick death. But if you've learnt how to play and dodge (q and e) then the game becomes a lot simpler and it can be quite easy for you to make your way to the end within an hour. When playing with friends, assuming you stick together, the worlds are very easy and the challenge of fighting off the enemies get's taken away as you have a lot more fire power and the enemies, so far, don't seem to scale with players and damage. That was a massive disappointment for my friends and I because there was no real skill required. After achieving level 30 the game becomes very grindy, but not in an exp sense. I made it all the way too level 99, level cap, and that didn't take a long time, 2-3 hours maybe. However what is grindy is the resource you need to collect to create weapons and armour, I think it is a good idea for the player to collect resources but when crafting gear and weapons you will want the higher stats and if you just get common tier this can result as being very irritating. Going back and forth for resource just to get an uncommon/ rare/ legendary prefix. That is like much other Rogue-likes so I don't really see it as a problem but for some people it might be. As for bugs, the game seems to be okay for bugs so far but there are a few things you need to know. If you are on multiplayer and are in the middle of a world and the host quits without saving all character progress for the other players get's deleted and only the host keeps his profile. When finding this it was very irritating and my friend and I had to recreate our characters and start again, although we were very quickly carried because exp is shared equally. If you wish to kill yourself to unlock new characters you will lose your battle chips (small bonus' and abilities that use mana) however, you can just drop them too your friend and they will give it back to you. That is a bypass and personally I don't think it should be available.\n\nI rate this game a 7/10, with more development this game would offer a lot more entertainment and could easily make it's way to be one of my favourites. I could see myself playing this for hours if there was just a little more content.","February 21","true","25.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Very challening and fun especially in multiplayer!  Early access so expect bugs but creator pushes weekly updates and works closely with the community to recieve and squash bugs!\n\nLOVE THIS GAME!  Backed it, been playing the alpha and it's all worth it!!  It's amazing to think that this game has been developed by one guy!!!

It's is a rogue-like so when you die you lose everything except items that are kept in a chest that is preserved.\n\nI think if there was a minus it would be these things\n- No cloud saving\n- Some may think it's repetitive\n- Not local multiplayer\n\nI did want to say, on the repetitive note, however there is enough reason to "grind" through some of the repetitive stuff.

But if you just want to support its development, buy it, and it won't disappoint you.\n\nSince there are already enough appreciations on this game, please let me talk about the negative sides. My friend who played Magicite with me recommended this game, and I bought it right after I saw the store page. But after spending half hour on this game, I feel I'm totally deceived. The store page doesn't show much content--I understand since it's early access--but the game has even less available content than the store page shows.\n\nPlease notice that I'm not complain about the game itself. Roguelands is awesome: it has awesome graphic, awesome music, awesome crafting and awesome difficulty. However, at present, this game has VERY LITTLE CONTENT and is far from playable. Till this review on 9-11-15, Rouguelands only contains 3 charactors and 3 playable maps. The whole playable content can be covered within 10 minutes, and the giant worm is the only challenging monster. There are lots of things to craft and the crafting system is amazing, but it's meaningless since there's no place for you to use them.\n\nThe good thing is, its developer(s?) is working hard, and releases update weekly. To be honest, I don't know why this game is on the Steam store page now, but since it's already there and it does have potential, let's just wait and see what happen next.","November 9, 2015","true","182.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

No risks taken here. Could easily pass as an expansion of magicite. Though the game gives you much more mobility. Though the combat is much more clunky, being in its own seprate mode activated quickly my right click. The game is very Sci-Fi themed. Instead of having your own pickaxe, you have a little robo  baby  miner thing. This loveable scamp will mine ore for you. The enemies in this game are much more threatening than they were in magicite. Seemingly innocent plants break into lethal worm-like creatures. Large beetles swarming into your area, annoyingly attacking you.\n\nPROS:\nUnique.\nThe game is somewhat unique, though that may be because I haven't played too many rouge-likes\nForgiving, yet hard.\nYou can put your items into chests. So that any items stored may be kept save for the next run.\nPotental\nSean, the developer, showed us what he could do with magicite. I predict that this game will be another favorite of mine CONS.\nStill in development.\nUnfinished content such as barren biomes and emblems that are supposed to come from those emtpy areas are common.\nSomewhat confusing\nPerhaps a byproduct of the ladder. It took me a few minutes to learn how to craft, return to ship, not die, esc.\n\nSo far, its a soild 5/10 though I don't blame the game. I'm sure with enough TLC this game will become an 8 at least.","November 13, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its AMAZING! First off, I have quite a bit of time in game with the content thats already there, I cant imagine how much Ill enjoy this game once the updates start expanding.\n\nPros:\n-good mechanics\n-many weapon types for early access\n-3 randomized maps that can be very challenging at times\n-half of the recipes are already available\n-multiplayer is tons of fun\n-can mix stats to make a class from the combo\n-combat chips to further help you build a unique character\n\nCons:\n-bugs (duh its early access)\n-sometimes repetitive, but thats because there arent enough maps yet, but thatll come in time\n\nIf you look at this game and say "oh I should just wait to get it when it reaches 1.0" dont wait, watch it grow, because I assure you if you like rougelikes and rpg aspects you will love this game.\n\nNote: After you start getting rarity level gear, the game gets easy and grindy, fun, but still grindy.

I'm extremely happy that this game kept the crafting like magicite in the sense that you have to learn them yourself by trial and error. The soundtrack is lovely and the maps are cute, enemies are great and can even be challenging.

If you die, you lose your items, but unlike most rogue-lites, you can create a base so that you don't lose everything when you die, just whats on your person. I think that this a great game because you can play with friends, and there is tons of content to do. The developer is very down to earth and if you find anything wrong with the game, you just post it in a forum and it gets fixed quickly.

Sean has been super great as far as regular updates to the game and responding to feedback from the community. So buying it in early access, here's what I like about the game so far.\n\nWhat I love:\n►Challenging gameplay. You need to play smart and careful if you want to survive.\n►Cafting system. No recipes to memorize, rewards experimentation rather than memorization.\n►Better multiplayer. Magicite was a lot of fun in multiplayer, but had many bugs with syncing, enemies disappearing, warp glitches. Things have been much more stable in Roguelands.\n►Roguelike but also persistent. The way the game works is that each character you create only has one life, however you can bank items on your ship to be used in future playthroughs. The plan is also that you'll unlock new classes, races, and abilities as you play as well (not implemented as of v 0.4.6 though so can't really say much on that).\n\nThat's all for now, can't wait to see where development goes for this, but I have been very impressed with the quality and responsiveness in each update so far.","November 6, 2015","true","41.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And everything is gone once u die, unless u saved them in your game chest.\n\nIt has Crafting, where u use materials harvested to create potions (so far i only got to potions), and there are like a few pages of recipe available waiting for u to unlock them by trial and error. (It's like permutation in math, that the order u place ur materials does matter).\n\nAnd ofc u can craft awesome weapons and armours, and abt 10 pages of them, each with different stats and effects and looks. And guess what, there are chances that u will craft weapons and armours of superior quality, better stats!! That is just AWESOME! But be careful not to die, or ur awesome gears will end up in the void. Oh yeah one thing, once u unlocked a recipe, u can auto-craft a bunch of them easily by simply clicking the recipe.\n\nThe game could be hard when u just started, i died dozens of times without finding how to complete the first ever stage, and how to store my resources in my game chests. One suggestions for new players is that try ur best to locate the exit as early as possible, then once u get used to safely moving around without killing urself too easily, rush to the exit first, then farm for resources which are near the exit, and once u face trouble or danger, take the exit and go to the safe zone to store ur resources. Well the game is hard, but not until u farmed out hundreds of materials for potions.\n\nThere are multiplayer features in this game, i guess that would be a lot more fun, but havent touched in that yet.\n\nSo far thats what i have to say. The game is awesome, I'd love to see it develop and grow! Oh btw, the developers are real efficient as they promise to update every week if im not wrong.\n\nSo try it out, you wont regret it!","November 7, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

When I played this game, I compared this game to Magicite a lot, since they are from the same devoloper and they have simular looking.\n\nTo tell the truth in this game a lot of machanics are the same in Magicte, you go through a level (biome) after a level, kill monsters to get upgrades, and collect things from each biome and craft potions and amor, lastly, you lose your charactor after you die (sometimes click retry will prevent this.)\n\nHowever, there are some new features in this game: First of all the theme is around space, you get to expolre 9 different planets ( in Magicite you are in different biomes on earth) Secondly, the way you control your charactor has become more advance, you get jump how many times you want (unlike double or triple jumps in Magicte) and dashes stays the same( with stamina) Most important, this game gives monsters that are harder to beat from magicte, the crafting system become more advance and variaty. There is no village in between levels, and your friends can instantly revive you instead of 3 seconds.\n\nIn conclution, I think Roguelands is more like an upgraded Magicte, but same as Magicite, it is very attractive. This game added more RPG elements and space theme features. You get a home base now to craft your staff and store them! The price comparing to Magicte I think is acceptable thinking of the new features, and multiplayer is really fun.","November 7, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And honestly it did it was a fun challenging sci-fi roguelands (the multiplayer is worse somehow but that's besides the point). However it became repetetive, boring and overall too easy, it lost the challenge that magicite had. The weekly updates were really cool until they also became boring, constantly adding new weapons and just terrible content instead of further expanding the gameplay. Like the enemies attacks are boring and most of the enemies just feel like reskins of each other. The landscape is always the same. It is was too easy to become stronger and gain items.\n\nDon't get me wrong i like the game but it's heading in a directions i do not like at all.","March 18","false","31.1"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","3"

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

You can see how this is a recipe to get you hooked on the game forever, and it works. The game is addicting, you always want to go on one more run because you're so close to being able to make that piece of gear ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it! The actual minute-to-minute gameplay is great as well. The jetpack is very cool and create great dynamics to dodging and platforming. Weapons have good weight and learning the timing of sword swings is satisfying as ♥♥♥♥. Character models and portraits are attractive and well drawn. I could go on here, but the point is: It's good.\n\nOn the topic of Early Access: Look, I ain't gonna ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you guys, Early Access games have burn many of us. But Sean Young has a good track record of finishing games he started and SHOULD be given the benefits of the doubt. HOWEVER! I can absolutely understand if you want to hold off on buying a game that isn't finish yet. But at least keep this game on your radar. The potential this game has, the goodwill that Mr. Young has garnered over time all points to greatness. You don't wanna miss out on it.\n\nThanks for reading!\nIf you liked the review, consider hitting the thumbs up so more people can see it, and join my Steam group in order to be notified everytime I review something, as well as meeting and interacting with new people.\n\nSubscribe to my Youtube channel, where I cover new, obscure games in video format.

Yeah I groaned at how generic the title is, too, but then I played it and time flew by and I was reminded of how special and fun Magicite was. But don't get it twisted, Roguelands is definately its own game.\n\nNow this is fairly early access, so while there is totally a playable game, some elements in-game are placeholders (its that kind of EA, for those that are familiar). There is supposed to be one update a week.\n\nEssentially, you have a base that is a ship where you can store stuff from your adventures. On the ship, you can also craft, upgrade stuff, and chat with other people. You gear up and venture off onto planets to go on missions to level up and find stuff. One thing I always love, which is present here, is permadeath with meta-game building elements. Upon death, you lose what is on your character, but not what you smartly stored on your ship. This totally adds in that risk/reward kinda stuff.\n\nPros:\n+Gameplay is sooo addicting, similiar to Magicite. When you first start its hard-as-nails, and then you slowly learn enemy tells and such, and get better.\n+Artwork, music, and sound effects are very polished, and look gorgeous.\n+Lots of items and mechanics to learn, even at this point.\n+Character creation allows for many different builds to play the game with (three major ones at this point, which is enough, but plenty more are coming from what the other icons on that menu state).\n\nCons:\n-Some of the stuff like post-level loot chests are not finished yet (I am excited!!).\n-No controller support which everybody whines about, but honestly, I don't think it would be good for a game like this (lots of mouse aiming).\n-Its very hard. You have to enjoy learning, as in all good roguelikes/lites.\n\nYeah this is totally worth it. I will get tons of hours out of this - they probably should have charged twice as much, even in early access.","November 7, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","4"

It is absolutly amazing.. the graphics are like top grade and the game contains so many things that no other game can put in!!! Running on walls, cool score streaks!!! Many diffrent choices of specialists! Anyone who plays CS;GO is missing out cause this game is for the hardcore gamers because it has so many difficult boundries in it. I am impressed! I love the story line as well! SPOLIER: I love how the story mode puts in like everything about black ops.. how theyve includes world war and zombies and the future AND BLACK OPS 2 story line ALL IN ONE!!!! They certinly know how to make a man wow'ed! Keep it up guys!\n\nBad stuff: Few glitches of texture and stuff here and there but no glitches that ruin gaming performance.","February 16","true","15.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","3","7","4","3"

Another thing to review is the world generation, it seems as if they are all the same apart from some small changes here and then. On top of that, i fell as if the game takes place in a cavern, it doesnt feel open, that's just my POV. The mobs are really cool looking and have great mechanics, it could be improved a little bit, but still a exellent job. I havent discoverd the whole game but looking at what you can unlock, this game seems to go really far! The game is dammands dedication as you need to acquire lots of knowledge to level up, gain better armor and really get into the game.\n\n9/10 "Great Pixel graphics game"\n\nItsDaFizz","December 16, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I get that you want a story but there should be an explanation before I choose.\nWhy does it zoom in when you are in combat mode? That's so inconvenient especially on the FIRST LEVEL.\n\nFirst level:\n-Why do I have a bunch of rock going through platforms? That's very fair. Make it rain rocks that deal damage do you (which is also bs). With this, you can hardly dodge the hoards of enemies coming at you from all sides. Then you have your crew calling you telling you about bs bosses that come in randomly. I'm on the FIRST LEVEL give me a break!\n\n-The health is hilarious. You start out with less than ten. "But storm! Aren't you supposed to start out with low health?" That should be the case yes, but I somehow find that a problemin this game. The enemies deal 1-2 damage to you with each blow. You get hit 5 times, your dead. No crafting stuff in your inventory either (if you can, well I haven't found out yet. NO EXPLANATION). But wait! Isn't there a bunch of floating crap coming for you? That does 1 damage also. Might as well have NO HEALTH BAR!\n\n-The enemies on the FIRST LEVEL consist of flies that follow you and worms that come after you when you 'trigger' them by walking on a plant bulb thing. There's also a mini-boss that shoots projectiles at you THROUGH WALLS. How much wall phasing can there be? Not to mention all the crew bs as well. Keep in mind, this is the FIRST LEVEL (I'm sorry but this point is too good to not stress). This means you HAVE to fight these enemies to level up. If you don't you'll be destroyed at the next level. So good luck clearing the entire level without getting hit more than a few times!\n\n-The weapon you get is crap. It's a sword that has a little delay on it and mediocre range. I find myself not being able to hit them because I'm so paranoid about losing health! I always back away while the sword charges up with the attack because I can't find the pattern the enemy uses (to move towards you). "How many hits does it take to kill them storm?" A decent amount. You have to get up in the face of death of numerous enemies numerous times.\n\n-What do the resources do anyway? I was never able to get back to the ship to use in anything. Even if I did, I'm pretty sure I would not have enough! I'm a new-comer and have NO IDEA how the crafting system works!\n\nSorry for the complaints. I hope (and know) it will be a great game soon. The devs work hard but I wanted to vent somewhere xp. Love you guys at SmashGames!","May 2","true","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The art style and gameplay share similarities, but there are also major differences. These differences, however, are so unique, that the game stands on it's own and in many ways, it's an improvement. In the game you play as a 'space cadet' of your own creation, via a character creation system similar to Magicite. Earth has been destroyed by humanity's carelessness and you're now floating around in space in your ship exploring the universe. Immediately, you'll notice differences from Magicite. You no longer craft on the go, but instead everything is done on your ship. The emblem system allows you to now craft and save equipment on your ship for later plays. To gather the necessary resources for said emblems, you have a collecting robot that follows you around and gathers resources for you. Like Magicite, you aim with your mouse and move with the WASD keys. However, unlike Magicite, you now use number keys as hot buttons when you want to perform an action. Want to collect a resource? Aim at it and press 1 to send your little robot to go get it. Attacking is also a bit different, as you now switch between exploration mode and attack mode with a right mouse click. Overall, this is an improvement to the crafting system as collecting resources is not only easier and smoother, but crafting means not losing items right away if you die.\n\nHowever, the difficulty is also greater here. You no longer have the ability to craft on the fly, as mentioned, so whatever you go in with, you're stuck with. Just as well, there are now greater dangers. Not only do you contend with tough enemies, but you must also contend with some large environmental hazards, as large meteors and rocks fly from all directions. This is actually more frustrating than fun. While fighting enemies, which are often challenging enough, you must also contend with these rock hazards. At times, it becomes impossible to avoid damage, and with such limited health, you can find yourself quickly dying. As you progress, you gain the ability to craft greater equipment, but getting there is an uphill battle. Many times, as fun as the game can be, it gets frustrating. Suffice to say, if you can't handle the punishment of challenging rogue likes, this isn't a game for you. But if you enjoy them, or you were a fan of Magicite, you will find a fun game here.","November 6, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As a spiritual successor to Magicite, a game which I've had countless hours of fun in, Roguelands exceeds expectations.\nThis review is as of Early Access v0.4.6, but even so, the game is simply joyful. Like Magicite, Roguelands is a 2D adventure platformer, and is one of the best of its kind by far. Running around, jumping, shooting, narrowly avoiding weird flying centipede things - all of these elements are what makes this game the exciting venture that it is. The game has a long way to go, and there are still plenty of bugs and glitches, with a substantial lack of features. However, the potential is limitless, so don't be afraid to buy this game. Join me on a journey of development, fun, and unforgettable tales.

This is not a bug, it is unfinished content that the Dev has decided to just leave in.\nMultiplayer is very buggy, unresponsive/'moody', and players can sometimes spawn in without equipment. Which means unless you already have gear in the storage box, you're boned.\nYou will have to redo the lobby repeatedly till this changes.\n\nI will say that the combat, so far, seems solid.\n\n\nAnalysis, game is not worth buying until the developer pulls together more content. A lot more. Give it time, hopefully they will get lots more done to test.\n\nEarly access as of 12/31/2015 is graded to be a: 2 out of 10. (I got a refund)\nDon't buy it for a while.

If this game becomes anything like its predecessor, it would be amazing, but at this point in development (November, 2015), I would not recommend this game for entertainment (yes I understand it is in early development, but the game isn't fun from what I have seen). The absolute biggest turn off in my opinion is the lack of tutorials in any form. If you press the "esc" key, you see key bindings for how to move around and attack, but it doesnt have any information about game mechanics such as crafting or gathering materials (which I am assuming is a big part of the game, but once again I can't really tell whats going on half the time). For new comers who are interested in this game, I would simply recommend magicite instead. That game is polished and solid in terms of gameplay, and pretty fun with friends.\n\nIn conclusion I would only recommend this game if you want to support the developer and witness the growth of this game over time, otherwise I would check out magicite or wait a couple months (or more). More early access purchases would obviously speed the development of this game, so if you really want to see this game shine, then buying this game is also a great option (contingent that THIS developer doesn't become anything like the developer of "The Stomping Land", who simply made a partial game, then dissapeared off the face of the planet after he received a large sum of money from all the early access purchases, which consequently led to the removal of "The Stomping Land" from steam; yes, this means "The Stomping Land" is incomplete, and will most likely stay that way for all of eternity).","November 8, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 58 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","11","58","0","3"

Rougelands impliments the good aspects, and a few bad ones but its early access so Ill let it slide, of Magicite mixed with a very Sci Fi feel. The Crafting system is much better in my opinion though the grindy ness of emblems is a bit annoying but not unbearable and the storage across character is very nice. If you are looking for a rogue-like game though this isnt fully that. Yes there are Rogue-like aspects of the game and yes if you die you lose all your progress and have to restart but it also feels like a normal RPG just with higher consequences. The game isnt finished and during me and my friends 4 hours run of the game we did notice alot of bugs mainly boss issues and areas that werent finished. Over all it is a great game for Early Access and if you enjoy rogue-likes or RPGs this is a great game to pick up.\n\nPros\n-Better Crafting\n-More Balanced Combat system (Atleast from Magicites ;-; )\n-Very good Multiplayer and Singleplayer playability\n-Great storage and character creation mechanics\n-Dashing/Jumping system. Amazing Mobility something that Magicite lacked if you didnt have the Jumpy Slime\n-Spiritual Successor to Magicite (2nd Favorite rogue-like behind RoR)\n\nCons\n-Un-finished (early access so meh)\n-Rock Worm? eggs very inconvient\n-Can't exit level in multiplayer unless everyone is alive (Personally hate this when one guy is left and Urogorak/Hivemind is chasing him)\n-Weapons kinda dull, Esspecially magic ones. Needs more flash or ability for higher tiers\n-Emblems are kinda Grindy\n-FLUTTERFLIES ARE TOO FEW. NEEDS MOAR HEALTH POTS ;-;\n\nOverall a good game and I hope it gets better as time goes on.\nEarly Access Rating: 9/10\n\nEdit: Also 10/10 would solo Urogorak on my craptop with a trackpad again >.>","November 27, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One major problem though is that you can only play with your friends or someone you get to play with you.

The game's idea and story in a sense will come around as the game developes, and for now it is important to realise that the game will have bugs, and a lot of them. The main developer (or only developer I don't know) Sean Young has asked the community to report all bugs to the email listed at the top of the home screen, every time i've reported a bug he has repsonded within two hours saying to me things like; "thanks for telling me" or "thanks for letting me know". So this shows he is willing to listen to the community in what they have to say in order to better the game.\n\nThe game as far as gameplay wise, amazing in my opinion. The game is giving me a sense that survival and collection of resources will greatly better me in the upcoming updates and that the game is a great rouge-like in it's permanent death and unique combat system and diverse enemy AI fighting patterns for different planets.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge to survive and thrive, by themselves or with a couple of friends. This game is truly one of a kind in the rogue category of games.","November 24, 2015","true","70.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although I have some points to make. I understand that the servers need ports to keep them secure but it would be good if you made it clearer. Like when you add a server you need to click it but it doesn't tell you why you can't join the server. There should be a button you click that says 'Join Game' or something along those lines to make it clearer. Another thing would be the connection when you play with friends. It does lag a bit but it isn't too bad. Overall Its a great game and I can't wait to see what updates are planned for the future! This a very good exciting game that I would recommend to anyone!

There are updates almost every week and they always have new things to enjoy. My only wish is that the dev. does more with the factions in the future, as of right now they do almost nothing.

The combat, while similar in appearance to games like Terraria and Starbound, offers a layer of depth in the form of weapons with specific limiters. Each of the currently available races start out with a different, distinct weapon: Wanderers have a sword that swings in a typical arc, Centurions with a sword that only jabs forward, and Royalites with a wand that shoots out slightly delayed projectiles, while other weapons are currently obtainable through the game's crafting system. Assumedly, future races will also feature their own special weapons.\n\nThe game itself was surprisingly difficult with constant environmental hazards complementing enemies with otherwise simplistic attack patterns forcing us into dangerous situation while leveraging the limitations of our arsenal. There's lots of resources to collect, which is then fed back into crafting tables back at the players' hub.\n\nAt the time of writing this it is Build v.0.4.6, and right now the game is VERY "Early Access," with many zones still barren/under construction. From our experience last night, it seems that only a couple of the areas have enemies/resources fully implented, but, if the current content works as a clear indicator for how future zones are going to be designed, I have high hopes for this one.\n\nTL;DR The game's pretty cool but it's early access so don't buy it expecting a 100% finished game. DO buy it if you want to participate in the game's development or if you want to try it now and pick it back up in a year or two.\n\nAlso, v0.4.7 is slated to release today at (hopefully) 5 PM EST. ( https://twitter.com/SeanYoungSG/status/664803713270304770 )\n\nIf you want to watch our first look at the gameplay you can do so here: ( http://www.twitch.tv/roodleypoodleydoodley/v/25423742 ) The other voice in this video is my friend Zololi ( www.twitch.tv/zololi ).\n\nIf you want to watch my stream LIVE, you can do so @ ( www.twitch.tv/roodleypoodleydoodley ).

The game's idea and story in a sense will come around as the game developes, and for now it is important to realise that the game will have bugs, and a lot of them. The main developer (or only developer I don't know) Sean Young has asked the community to report all bugs to the email listed at the top of the home screen, every time i've reported a bug he has repsonded within two hours saying to me things like; "thanks for telling me" or "thanks for letting me know". So this shows he is willing to listen to the community in what they have to say in order to better the game.\n\nThe game as far as gameplay wise, amazing in my opinion. The game is giving me a sense that survival and collection of resources will greatly better me in the upcoming updates and that the game is a great rouge-like in it's permanent death and unique combat system and diverse enemy AI fighting patterns for different planets.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge to survive and thrive, by themselves or with a couple of friends. This game is truly one of a kind in the rogue category of games.","November 24, 2015","true","70.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rougelands impliments the good aspects, and a few bad ones but its early access so Ill let it slide, of Magicite mixed with a very Sci Fi feel. The Crafting system is much better in my opinion though the grindy ness of emblems is a bit annoying but not unbearable and the storage across character is very nice. If you are looking for a rogue-like game though this isnt fully that. Yes there are Rogue-like aspects of the game and yes if you die you lose all your progress and have to restart but it also feels like a normal RPG just with higher consequences. The game isnt finished and during me and my friends 4 hours run of the game we did notice alot of bugs mainly boss issues and areas that werent finished. Over all it is a great game for Early Access and if you enjoy rogue-likes or RPGs this is a great game to pick up.\n\nPros\n-Better Crafting\n-More Balanced Combat system (Atleast from Magicites ;-; )\n-Very good Multiplayer and Singleplayer playability\n-Great storage and character creation mechanics\n-Dashing/Jumping system. Amazing Mobility something that Magicite lacked if you didnt have the Jumpy Slime\n-Spiritual Successor to Magicite (2nd Favorite rogue-like behind RoR)\n\nCons\n-Un-finished (early access so meh)\n-Rock Worm? eggs very inconvient\n-Can't exit level in multiplayer unless everyone is alive (Personally hate this when one guy is left and Urogorak/Hivemind is chasing him)\n-Weapons kinda dull, Esspecially magic ones. Needs more flash or ability for higher tiers\n-Emblems are kinda Grindy\n-FLUTTERFLIES ARE TOO FEW. NEEDS MOAR HEALTH POTS ;-;\n\nOverall a good game and I hope it gets better as time goes on.\nEarly Access Rating: 9/10\n\nEdit: Also 10/10 would solo Urogorak on my craptop with a trackpad again >.>","November 27, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WIth and intresting mixture of item storage and permadeath, there is lots of strategy involved in when you put items on your character, and how you create your character. With the ability to name your character, choose it's race (changing its appearence and stats), and the ability to change your character's specialties, you can customize your character extensively. Also, as the races are unlockable, there is a lot of replay value.\n\nUnfortunatly, multiplayer can be a burden, as I am pretty sure there are other programs you need to install, but the developer had to do this for server privacy.\n\nIf you like Terraria, or similar games, you may enjoy this game.\n\nIt is also nice how the developer updates the game evrey week, so there are always new thing to explore.

But if you bought this game in hopes of having a multiplayer RPG/platform experience... well, forget the multiplayer. Because the method of which to even access multiplayer is too convoluted and doesn't work for the half the people that follow the process. And the creator of the game says he doesn't plan on fixing it any time soon because oh well.\nWhich sucks because it was the main reason I even bought this game.\n\nBut if you are only in this for single player, go ahead. I'm not far in it but so far it's fun.","April 13","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We start the game die, die some more, and die. It's a good game overall you can play with friends kill monsters and level up pretty much like Magicite. But the game also needs some new updates like friends being able to customize another friends ship with their permission. Also please developpers if you are reading this LET US KEEP OUR COMBAT CHIPS!!!! Good game fun with friends 10/10 would buy again :D","April 20","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love that it becomes easier with multiple people playing, but it is also possible to play it easily in solo mode. You can customize the layout of your ship the way you like and there are many different places to explore and learn. As you play you get chances of getting stuff when you die depending on what you do. It is really fun and has lots of playability.","May 29","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
