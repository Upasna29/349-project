With so many games released on steam greenlight that makes you go...what?, Quantum Lock seems to aim to be and is one of the better games to pass greenlight. The developer is easygoing, knowledgeable , a true adult and not a Criticism baby (qualities not every dev on steam has),\n\nQuantum Lock for the Win!","December 14, 2015","true","4.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tezuni/recommended/411720/","tezuni","•҉Tezuni's Wifi Hell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tezuni/","147 products in account","There're two teams: Anti-Virus and Rogue Programs.\n\nThe Anti-Virus must tag all the programs before time runs out. Each team has multiple classes to choose from, each with 4 unique abilities such as lasers, missiles, warp fields, mines, and turrets. Overall this is a visually stunning game with amazing gameplay.\n\nIt does need some balance tweaks though. And make sure you have a friend or two to play it with, because there aren't usually online games up.\n\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 9/10\n","February 6","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A game you can pick up and play at anytime. Fast paced, rewarding skill abilities, and an ever changing game difficulty.

It has that nice casual appeal to enjoy with anyone that is also having a great time with the game. Using your abilities to cause a laugh or strategically is entirely up to you!

Once you learn how your AV and Rouge Virus works, the game comes down to tatics rather then who can move faster.","January 8","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's simple and clever, I just wish I could get into a game with more than just my little group of friends. I'm not sure why I can't see any games and have to host and invite friends through steam but it is really fun anyway.","January 17","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
