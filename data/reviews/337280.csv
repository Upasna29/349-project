Forget No Man’s Sky, this is the only procedurally generated Universe to be hyped for. Moving Star Fox’s hallucinatory postcards at Faster Than LSD velocities. And written with a postmodernist prose inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow, full of subversiveness and perverted jokes\nFew philosophical subjects are as effective in drawing inspiration for artistic creation as the concept of a vastness and ever-expanding Universe. And some of the most complex reasonings created by the human mind, like the image of a God, has been sustained in trying to discern what lies behind the devastating idea of an infinite Universe surpassing the limits of our knowledge. Maybe there are some Greek divinities playing strip poker with the human destinies. Or maybe, like in Planetship, you can find an ancient extraterrestrial civilization whose minds were destroyed by the overuse of drugs.\n\nTraditionally, in the sci-fi genre there have always existed two radically differentiated approaches to create the lore and own rules of a fictional Universe.\n\nOn the one hand, you have the boring approach of trying to look at the current scientific theories by giving at your creation a mathematical basis. Perhaps by also looking at some classic sci-fi novels to create a common ground of recognizable references. I remember to be expecting No Man’s Sky until I began to see some of its most recent video footage. So you have epic space battles with generic and conventional ship designs inspired in Star Wars and another hundred of space operas, checked. You try to sculpt the surface of a distant planet, lost in the boundaries of a never-imagined before Universe, by adapting Earth’s geographical elements like mountains and seas with a different color palette, checked. And you try to invent new and exotic life forms by putting some dinosaurs and of course, the always necessary robots, also checked. I have no doubt that No Man’s Sky will be a great game, and I love the ambition of its concept. But nothing in No Man’s Sky is able to excite my imagination.\n\nAnd on the other hand you have artistic creations that use the concept of an infinite Universe that is beyond our current understanding as an excuse to sculpt an imagery outside of any past knowledge, pushing the limits of human creativity beyond God’s own creation. You can think in the final trippy sequence of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that surpassed any previous attempt in given a visual form to the boundaries of the Universe. And you can also think in the surreal architecture and evocative landscapes that can be found in MirrorMoon EP. Serving as a vivid example of the new frontiers that has reached the videogame medium in the last decade, in its attempt to become a field for artistic creation.\n\nThankfully, Planetship is most closely connected with the creativity-infused spirit of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey or to MirrorMoon EP than to another conventional space opera between the hundreds of recent attempts made in the sci-fi genre. But it also takes a clear reference point by looking at a fascinating past, being a love letter to the 50’s pulp novels, comics and magazines. In a postmodernist reinterpretation of the genre using a humorous take, that resembles Tarantino’s reimagining of classic blaxploitation movies. The same post-punk and pulsing spirit.\n\nEvery single element in Planetship irradiates ingenuity, showing the artistic ambition of sculpting an own Universe that has never been imagined before.\n\nBecause in the Universe of Planetship there are no LCD panels, and the old rounded tube televisors are constantly broadcasting schizoid fragments of early cheap sci-fi movies. Its combat system seems like an open world prototype created for a never released Star Fox, discarded by Nintendo for inciting the kids in the use of mental drugs, with some enemies being pirate Galleon ships. It has a crafting system as well balanced as the seen in Don’t Starve, but that is based on a Periodic Table with hundred of invented elements. There are collectibles, like in any modern videogame, but the collectibles are old 50’s pulp novels telling evocative but at the same time absurdist stories about ancient civilizations vanished by their addiction to Half-Life 3.\n\nOne of the most brilliant aspects of PlanetShip comes in the form of an experimental use of narrative. Contrary to other games in the genre, you can’t explore the surface of the planets but you can make contact with some generally disturbing alien races. Sometimes, you need to use a voice decoder by selecting the grade of obscure obscenities used in the topics of conversation to translate every new language. At other times, you need to select between some devastating choices for establishing diplomatic relations that at the same time can lead your crew to insanity. And all of these text fragments, including the collectible sci-fi pulp novels, are narrated with the use of a postmodernist prose inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow, one of the landmarks in contemporary American literature. Including his same degree of subversiveness and joyful games stretching the limits of language. A distinctive writing style that is highlighted with a cryptic an always intelligent sense of humor.\n\nBut the aspect that truly set Planetship apart from any past, present of future attempt in sculpting a representation of an entire Universe, given shape even at its unimagined limits with a mystical approach, is its use of light as a creational element. Prior to Planetship, the most ambitious attempt in synthesizing the entire Universe in a single art piece, was the architecture sustaining the early French Gothic cathedrals. Art pieces that relied on the idea of creating a representations of the Universe through the use of light. To suggest ethereal spaces that can contain an uppermost ideal of Divinity.\n\nLike in a French Gothic cathedral, Planetship is not about the construction of concrete and figurative shapes. It’s all about the use of light to create differentiated spaces or galaxies. With each one suspended in its own reality and suggesting a concrete mood, thanks to a diverse range of luminance variations and tonalities. Becoming a fascinating experience that truly makes you feel navigating through the edges of a never explored before Universe. That is populated with ancient and mysterious civilizations who are experts in the synthesis of hallucinatory drugs.\n\nA creative use of light for imagining dreamy landscapes that works in conjunction with a mesmerizing electronic soundtrack composed by Casino Versus Japan, the artistic name for Erik Kowalski. Who reveals himself as one of the greatest musicians in the current avant-garde panorama. Thanks to a memorable selection of surreal and dissonant melodies, resembling the distinctive sound of one of my personal favorite bands, Dirty Beaches.\n\nAnd if you don’t feel in the mood for crafting or doing boring management tasks, don’t worry, be trippy. Planetship shows all its love with a Chillout mode without combat, crafting or survival elements, only centered in the pure joy of exploring the Universe under the effects of some exotic plants.\n\nAn Universe that thanks to its dazzling beauty and unusual ambition, serves to confirm the videoagames as the most interesting field in the current artistic scene for experimenting with new concepts and ideas. By stretching the limits of human creativity thanks to its interactive nature.","November 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 82 of 90 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","82","90","7","6"

And some of my favorite Sci-Fi authors, such as Isaac Asimov and Philip K ♥♥♥♥. Flying around in a planetship is excessive fun, though your mileage may vary.\n\nThere's a kind of crafting system in this game, where you utilize the periodic table (disclaimer: You don't need to know anything about science, though it might help as the game is very intuitive science-wise. Ex: You'll find gasses in nebulous clouds, heavy metals in asteroids, etc). With crafting, you can make things or conduct research with the available elements.\n\nThrough research, you can affect the lives of those inhabiting the planetship. Research also interacts with events that occur outside of your ship. For instance, I researched something that increased repopulation exponentially. While flying around, some of our food supply got infected by a fungi. I could have dropped it, or the option I chose: Try it out as a food source! It had a reaction with our reproductive breakthrough, which allowed for spores to grow and detach from their parents to become offspring. Offspring who doubled as a food source.\n\nSometimes you'll come across old satellites from Earth, endlessly broadcasting whatever video footage was placed on them.\n\nThere's so much more. Infinite cubes, hostile planets, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off space moths, suns that you can fly into (or thru), black holes, worm holes. And so on.","February 7, 2015","true","32.5"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

The "Death Stars," the girders in the massive comets/asteroids / dead planets, and the Fast Travel minigame?! Every time I play Planetship, there's some new content to see. And it's all ♥♥♥♥in' brilliant.\n\nEDIT 2: I found space pirates hidden in a huge hive-like asteroid. I translated alien languages and then bartered with them. I blew up gas clouds, crafted drones to fight beside me, set up an Embassy on an alien planet. And I saved my game.\n\nPlanetship is now less a diversion and more of a game what could have time and effort beyond the now invested in it, especially with the overhaul of the map. It's still in its infancy (relatively), but now there should be no hesitation in getting Planetship.\n\n\nI guess I should actually write some sort of review, going back and striking through a lot of the old one.\n\nYou are a brain in a jar on a spaceship that is some sort of planet.\nYeah, Planetship is real "out there(, yo)." The text-events are farfetched enough to entertain even after the seventh time you've read them (there are lots of different events, but of course some are more common than others) but not enough to alienate the reader. There is lots of imagination on display that should satisfy both a certain niche audience as well as scifi fans in general.\n\nYou start with a population of 10... million? Billion? Something. That number steadily declines over time, but after playing for about six hours straight, it was still hanging around 7-8 b/m-illion (and I was making bad choices intentionally). There are also events and equipment you can craft that increases your population.\n\nYour ship runs off Food, Water and Fuel. You have a pool of energy for boosting and firing (recharges pretty quickly). You have a shield that recharges independently of that.\n\nZoom through space, scanning planets. Each has six factors: the three resources (Food, Water, Fuel) and three hazardous conditions to watch (such as Surface Temperature). Each planet also has a label (Neutral, Hostile, Friendly, Research, [Element] Source, etc.). You can send shuttles to planets, to extract resources, to attempt to make contact, to try and trigger a random event.\n\nThere are several different... anomalies/setpieces/(")static(") objects. Space-cubes, clouds and "meshes" that you fly through while your scanner identifies Elements. Fields of asteroids you can destroy for Elements. Satelite-Televisions that you can float beside and watch. Pulp books that you can collect and read later. Black holes that take you to Bizarro Systems. Wormholes that take you to different systems.\n\nYou use Elements in crafting. There are things that increase the birth rate with a chance of mutation, alter your population with metal teeth for times when food is scarce, increased weapon power with increased energy consumption, etc.\n\nThe goal is to find a habitable planet.\nI've yet to.\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nWow. Please, dear developer. Please. Pack this game with more content (as in text) than I could ever hope to possibly read.  That  (AND THE LACK OF A SAVE FEATURE) are the only causes for hesitation I mean there are legit novel(la)s included within the game!!!, but I'm talking about the random Encounters. I just dread the thought that the infinitude of space might hold several of the same encounters with only the highlighted text changed.\n\nGame is in Early Access; them's my two cents.\n\nAlso, please release this game on disk so I can buy three; one for me, one for time capsule, one to shoot up into the cosmos like that one ship that has the DNA from the (")elite people(") like Hawking and Jo Garcia (the Immortality Drive).\n\nTo myself/us all: I/we absolutely recommend this game. Gameplay is so simple (I/you deduce after .5 hrs playtime) but Mr. Lawrence's dedication to this game emanates from the Planetship.\n\n[Don't want to get too far into the game, lest I have to play forever to keep the progress. Once a save feature is implemented (IF ONE IS GOING TO BE - unsure how to take that intro text) I will be all over the game and will probably be able to write a review that far exceeds the character limit]\n\n\nEDIT: I posted in http://steamcommunity.com/app/337280/discussions/0/610574394236247951/ and the dev subsequently friended me. Again (as will always be the case) no fraternization (i.e. free copies) between dev and me. I just faun over good indie games - going all out with the positive ramblings - and some of them appreciate it (while the other gamers don't, nyeh).","April 10, 2015","true","17.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","15","19","3","14"

I love the various encounters that my crew can get into when I send them down to planets. I think it needs a little more time to cook in Early Access, though - there's not quite enough going on "under the hood" to keep me enthralled while I go from system to system and occasionally shoot things.\n\nWere I the developers, I would improve the navigation system and map, so that I can tell where I'm going and where I've been a bit more easily (my strategy thus far has been to go willy-nilly towards whatever jump gate has "???" above it, until I run out of one of the supplies and backtrack frantically looking for a planet rich in that supply). Perhaps a listing of scanned planets could pop up when you hover your cursor over an explored system on the map?\n\nIt takes a loooong time to earn an upgrade, which is fine as long as I'm excited to continue the grind. I'm not certain there's a way to save at this point, which makes grinding less palatable.\n\nIt also seems a little arbitrary which supplies your crew come back to your ship with. I'd like an option to go for particular supplies, or at least a system that automatically put more emphasis on needed supplies.\n\nI don't want to sound like I'm complaining.

If you pay a reasonable amount of attention it's not difficult to stay alive, and there's even a "chill" mode that makes the game even easier (and a harder difficulty as well), so there's significantly less stress than you might expect from the genre.\n\nThe meat of the game is 6 degrees of freedom movement through a bunch of psychedelic procedurally generated solar systems, collecting resources, encountering random events and stumbling into lots of B Movie sci fi stuff played mostly for humor. Lots of the events are pretty funny, though the randomness factor is pretty high.\n\nThe game can feel a bit *too* random, there's an extremely large number of crafting resources given seemingly at random, and aside from building shuttles (an important resource), what items you can craft feel pretty random and minor as well. It doesn't matter all that much when you're playing just to chill, but attempts at more directed play could be a bit more frustrating.\n\nI did not ever manage to actually find a habitable planet yet (two 1~ hour runs). A "run" is rather unfocused in this game and can take quite a while, but that doesnt' matter too much IMO since this game is better played as something to sit back and relax with than trying to "win" a la Binding of Isaac.","October 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I actually tried to get rid of the coupon, but since I couldn't, I used it instead. And I regret nothing! Despite the early stage, the game already feels nice and unique in its own way. I mean, which game will offer you control over a psychedelic worldship (or planetship, it's all the same in concept) to travel through a colorful, unpredictable universe to find a new suitable planet? Not only that, but there are very cool references to old school (and I mean old school) sci-fi books and films, as well as funny jokes regarding how humanity thought space travel would be back in the 60's-70's.\n\nSince the game is in early access, I won't give my usual pros and cons, but instead I'll point out what I like so far and what I think could make it better.\n\nThumbs up:\nUnique, psychedelic style\nReferences to old sci-fi movies and books\nA collection of public domain/Creative Commons sci-fi books in game, which can also be collected through gameplay\nController support feels incredibly smooth\nDevelopers are responsive, respectful and care for the customers -- so much that when my XB1 controller wouldn't work with the game, one of them went out of his/her way to get hold of an XB1 controller and patch the drivers for the game\nResources management has potential\nResearch topics are interesting and funny\nGreat immersive soundtrack\nWould be nice:\nA deeper resource management system where minerals could also be found on planets\nTechnology progress -- as in, natural research tier unlocking rather than relying on exploration findings to unlock new opportunities\nWorldship/planetship enhancements -- some already exist, but I mean visable changes that could also affect gameplay, such as satellites which could increase scanning time and expand mineral radar radius, among other things\nSome sort of starmap -- I think that could be difficult considering space has no up and down, but some sort of orientation system to let us locate galaxy portals easier would be great\nMore variations of "random encounters" -- currently it feels like there aren't many of them since I started two playthroughs and got a lot of repeated encounters  -- as well as a better specification of how/when/where they're triggered\nThe possibility to save your progress\nAchievments\nI couldn't figure out how exactly I should find a new home planet, but I'm also stubborn and refuse to look at guides and such unless I'm in a real struggle. The exploration part, however, is relaxing enough to make me not care that much about "finishing" the game. Considering it's on early access, it's quite worth the full price cos it already has enough of what makes it unique, also because the developers are respectful and responsive -- here's hoping this will last even after the game reaches 1.0!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jspace74/recommended/337280/","jspace74","jspace74","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jspace74/","39 products in account","I really wanted to like this game based on the trailers, my appreciation for abstract science fiction, and some of the review comments but there's too much of a disconnect between the game play and the aesthetics for me.\n\nIf a game wants to indulge in trippy visuals, I would prefer it to limit both the amount and complexity of information that needs to be digested in order to make choices in game. For instance, trying to evaluate planets requires reading descriptions and bar graphs of several different attributes while the text is moving around on the screen and often in and out of view.  That sounds nitpicky, but the effect is like trying to read while in the back of a car on a bumpy road. Moreover, the more demands that are made of the player to process and monitor information make all the otherwise interesting background visuals and noise into distractions.\n\nI'd have preferred if the spontaneous (and seemingly arbitrary) random encounters had a similar feel to the introduction story (something more like 2001 or Solaris) but the reference filled humour felt out of place with the premise that had been set up.\n\nI can appreciate the need for trial and error as part of the learning curve for games (particularly procedural generated games) but there is a serious lack of breadcrumbs as far as some basic mechanics in this game: The single screen with instructions informs players of how to operate weapons on the ship, yet pressing the mouse key did nothing when the planetship was under attack. A few hints as to how to scavenge food and replenish resources would be appreciated\n\nSome tutorial levels and more guided instruction as opposed to the single panel prior to gameplay would have helped.\n\nOverall, a good idea and premise with some interesting visuals that's bogged down by overly rigorous game mechanics for my taste. I'd be interested in considering future amendments to this game or other offerings from the designers based on what caught my interest with this game, however.","March 2","false","0.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/337280/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","IntroductionPlanetship is one trippy experience. It might not be an experience for everyone. You play as both a planet and spaceship and your goal is to maneuver yourself through a not-so-endless galaxy in search of a new planet to settle on. It’s weird. It’s unique. But more importantly: is it any fun?\n\nGameplay(I’ll try my best to address as much as possible but Steam’s character limit doesn’t help so forgive me if I can’t address it all or if I can’t go into more detail than what’s written here.)\n\nAs I already mentioned you control a planet that is also a spaceship - or vice versa, whichever you prefer – and you’re dropped into space, in a rather large galaxy, and the main goal is to basically find a new planet for mankind to settle on. You do this by freely moving around while at the same time scanning planets, sending shuttles, collecting materials and evading or destroying enemy forces.\n\nScanned planets show a small menu with data that is important to determine if the planet can be used by humanity, but also to see if there are valuable resources that you can mine for your spaceship, like fuel and food, which decrease when you move around.\nYou can send shuttles to mine materials and it’s done with the press of a button. It then returns to your ship when it’s done. Couldn’t be more straightforward.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539166579\nThere’s also a counter in the bottom left corner that displays the amount of people currently still living on your planet. Get attacked by enemies or run out of food and this number starts to drop. If it reaches zero then it is game over, but during my few tries it never even got close to zero. I hope it becomes more important later during the development because right now it feels like ‘just a number’ and the game also doesn’t pressure you into keeping this number as high as possible.\nIn fact, since it’s basically a (quickly) decreasing number there’s no real tension to the whole situation at all. I know that the game is not meant to play like a survival simulator or anything, but to me it’s just a meter on the HUD. I can’t relate to the people living on my planet because I have yet to see a human being appear anywhere, rendered or drawn. I know it’s a weird game, but that doesn’t mean that it should be completely illogical.\n\nAnyway, the game has a psychedelic, very ‘drug-like’ look. It feels very crowded even though it really isn’t and I’m not a fan of these sorts of visuals, unless it’s for a short period or if I feel that it actually adds something to the game. There are plenty of other ways to show ‘weird’.\n\nWhile exploring you will sometimes come across enemies. Sometimes as small spaceships, sometimes as a part of a planet. You can try to destroy the smaller ones by simply shooting them, but for the bigger planets it’s wiser to either avoid them or think of a strategy first.\nYou can’t shoot freely, by the way; the cursor changes whenever you can shoot an enemy or object (like meteors). If your cursor doesn’t change you also can’t shoot it. Simple as that. Simple, but limited. Very limited even. And disappointing, in my opinion.\nYou will also have to use warp holes to get to other parts of the galaxy. These are first shown as ‘???’ but once you’ve traveled through they will be marked with a name so you will know where you’ve already been and where you could go to next.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539166542\nYou can also craft extra shuttles or a shield, for example, among some other stuff. You can do this by collecting materials (shown as chemical element abbreviations) that appear whenever you destroy enemies or meteors, or by exploring specific areas (like weirdly shaped cubes). After that you bring up a menu, press a button and voila, you have crafted something. Easy and simple, but talking from my own experience it’s currently also very limited in what you can craft.\n\nWith a press of a button you can also bring up a map. The map shows you possible habitable planets as well as dangerous planets. I had some trouble navigating myself as I was frequently going in circles. But I’m sure I’ll get used to it if I put some more hours into it.\n\nRandom events will also show up from time to time. This is also a part that needs some work. Like with the population I didn’t care about what was happening. This is because all you are shown is a dialog window with a little story and then a few options you can choose from. Because it’s so limited in setup people will not be able to relate to things that have just happened or will happen. ‘So what if this happens?’ Everything is shown from such a distance that as a result no one will care about what happens with your population or other parts of the universe that your choice(s) might affect. There’s no connection whatsoever.\n\nAudio & VisualsThe sound effects consist of a lot of retro voice ‘samples’. See it as random sentences spoken from 50’s or 60’s movies. It has a specific vibe and tone and while I don’t see the connection to many of these spoken lines (yet), they do sound pretty cool.\n\nJust take a look at the screenshots and you’ll see that the developer tried to imitate/emulate a psychedelic look, similar to taking drugs (I assume), combined with a bit of a retro sci-fi vibe. Unfortunately it’s too crowded with too much stuff going on. It doesn’t look half bad, though, technically speaking, but it won’t win any prices either.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539166612\nLength/Replay ValueThe current version of the game can be completed in a few hours and if you haven’t completed it then it’s likely you will have seen most of what the game has to offer in about two or three hours of playtime. Fortunately the asking price isn’t too steep.\n\nConclusionAt this moment I wouldn’t recommend Planetship unless you’re a big fan of psychedelic looks or if you’ve read the game’s description and thought it might just be what you’re looking for. For everyone else it’s highly recommended to wait for further updates that add both more content and polish. It’s a cute game in some ways, but it might currently not be enough to entertain for hours. I would personally grab it during a sale.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Good controls\n+ Exploring is kind of fun, but limited\n+ The generated galaxies are pretty big\n\nMixed:\n+/- Not everyone may like the trippy visuals\n+/- Restrictions on using your cannon\n\nCons:\n- Lacks a lot of polish in the UI department; it looks very rough and the font size is sometimes just too inconsistent\n- Random events are a good idea, but as of now it doesn’t feel like they have any (major) impact and it looks cheap (because of the UI)\n\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher.\nRating: 5.7 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nPlease feel free to join my group, DJ’s reviews, or follow me directly as a curator.\nDon’t feel like it?

I played for a solid two hours before I got a bit bored/got to what felt like I'd experienced most of what the game had to offer. Definitely has a great amount of trippy stuff,  nice colors, and nice effects, though they are a bit far in between ( as are some of the random events)  if you're expecting one after another visuals. There's a library, which I feel adds a good amount of background to the game, though I wish that effort was placed into more random events (even if the event didn't do much, it would be nice to just change the pace a bit. Loved the sattelites with old radio/shows.\n\nLots of cool effects, for example flying into gassess/waters floating around which definitely seems cool. and is great for the first time, though I got a little tired, but I was on my 3rd hour. I think if you could rotate the camera that would definitely be a fun implementation, though I'm not sure how hard that'd be, but it would make flying through the asteroids much cooler ( this was one of my favorite features)\n\n\nThere's a slider you have to do to translate with aliens, I'd say it got a little tedious. All in all, fun game. Hopefully the beta has more events, because I feel like those are the bread and butter of space games. Also, maybe a sandbox mode much like the chillout where you can change your speed to go very very fast, how many objects (such as the trippy/cool visual ones like gas clouds, toggle effects such as bizzarro or the visual effect I can only call drunken? (It's like a wavy thing).","August 22, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I also found "books" in space and when I went to the main menu, I found out that these were actual 80+ page retro science fiction novels that you could read within the game. The writing is quirky, and funny and the music is 10/10. I'm going to play this some more once it's finished.","June 20, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is no real direction and it can go on infinitly. Its really a trippy solo player game, I like how your planet and the sun pulse to the awesome music. There are lots of cool visuals to explore in every galaxy but they do get repetive.\n\nThis would be a fun game for kids to learn the periodic tables of elements symbols.","June 4, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

However, the early access shows; the game's star map is practically impossible to navigate, making the game feel more like chance. Also, I think it would be great if you could defend yourself better from enemy planets. But the game is witty and enjoyable! There is of course plenty of room for improvement, but the dev certainly has the right idea.","April 26, 2015","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
