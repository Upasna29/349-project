The game style blends elements of point-and-click adventure games, resource management/economy games, and role-playing games.  It is extremely casual (I don’t even think you can lose) and relaxing, but also is rewarding.  I can see how some people may find it monotonous, but I personally found it addictive and gratifying.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to underline the casual and simplistic nature of this game.  I can appreciate an epic, immersive, huge-budget AAA title as much as the next guy; but I also really enjoy casual games for those moments when I want to get my Zen on and play something “lite.”  This game is great for that kind of situation… but if you are someone who prefers the AAA epics, Hero of the Kingdom likely won’t tickle your fancy.\n\nThe game plays as a point-and-click adventure, essentially— with an inventory and a narrative.  In order to progress (i.e.: complete quests) you must pass inventory checks that determine if you have enough of specific items.  Thus, playing the game boils down to growing your inventory in two ways.  By finding camouflaged objects on the screen and clicking on them.  And by bartering with the NPCs; there are numerous profitable NPC-trading loops that can be used to make money and buy inventory items you need.\n\nThe narrative is extremely light; there are very few total lines of text.  While it isn’t bad, it also is easily forgettable.  But it does a good enough job creating a feeling of advancement and incentive as you complete quests.  There are also a lot of well-spaced achievements (both in game and on Steam) that pop-up often to keep the game feeling rewarding as you progress through the campaign.\n\nFor those who seek more intense gaming experiences, you may find this game somewhat tedious.  However, if you like tranquil, addictive games that are rewarding, there is a good chance you will enjoy Hero of the Kingdom.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","October 18, 2015","true","5.0"," 96 of 110 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","96","110","2","2"

Its an easy-to-get-in-to point and clicker game in a medieval fantasy setting which you will play through in a day or two. Took me 6 hours to complete, and i was achievement hunting so dont expect a long story and the replay value of the game is close to zero as its going to be exactly the same. And you cant really fail in this game, its very much story driven by a somewhat unintresting story.

No, do you derive intense pleasure from pressing a mouse button and watching numbers go up, for the sake of then being able to click a few more things and have those same numbers go up even faster?\n\nHero of the Kingdom in almost every respect is a cleverly disguised iteration on the bizarrely addictive idle games that have been devouring souls since it was discovered people on the internet will do absolutely anything to pass time. The main change is that unlike Cookie Clicker or Candy Box, Hero of the Kingdom doesn’t run by itself and has a (mostly) definitive end, tapped together with what could almost be considered a story and some minor exploration.\n\nBeginning on a secluded farm, you take up the mantle of the world’s premier errand boy, poking your nose into everybody’s business in the hopes they’ll set you off on another menial task they couldn’t be bothered to do themselves.Hero of the Kingdom, in everything it does, is a personification of every tedious fetch quest you’ve ever done in an RPG, stripped of everything but finding and delivering the item and then being patted on the head and told you’ve done a great service to the kingdom.\n\nI don’t think developer Lonely Troops had any doubts about what they were making though, and have deviously engineered the perfect loop of turning mundane tasks into accomplishments. Thanks are given for every small deed you perform, unimportant numbers are always going up, and the achievements pour out like candy letting you know no matter how simple the job, you did a damn fine job clicking your way through it!\n\nAnd then before you know you’ve constructed a profitable trading cycle, picked the country clean of mushrooms, and risen up in the ranks to where no one would dare refuse your prying questions. Hero of the Kingdom would almost feel nefarious if it didn’t have a clear ending, so adept is it at roping you in and making it feel as if the entire game isn’t just cleverly disguised busywork requiring no skill and barely any effort.\n\nBut for something that is fine letting you go after a few hours, I was fine indulging Hero of the Kingdom and its exploitation of a basic human need for self gratification. I don’t think it’s a good game, but it’s an easy way to waste some time that won’t hold you hostage past the point of some mindless fun (for lack of a better word).\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 17, 2015","true","3.7"," 77 of 93 people (83%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","83","77","93","24","6"

It's a very unique game. Basically you're presented a top-down isometric screen that looks a little bit like Age of Empires 2 or HoMM3 or something. You click through text prompts on the screen in a sort of combination text adventure and hidden object game. You become a hero of your kingdom by moving through screens and helping people out. Maybe someone lost their son, so you hidden object find him. Nothing is difficult, it'll just be like you see a patch of mushrooms, and you click it so you get mushrooms added to your inventory. Or you are on your boat and click a barrel underwater to salvage it. So not really hidden object, more like click-to-acquire. Maybe a farmer needs someone to go to town to sell his flour, so you get flour, click to switch screens to the town, and sell the flour to a merchant. Your inventory has dozens of different types of commodities that you manage, flowers, eggs, swords, handymen, antlers, pearls, etc. Across the world various merchants buy and sell various commodities. There's no actual difficulty in that it seems like it's impossible to make a bad transaction. If you just keep buying and selling stuff and foraging and fishing and hunting you'll eventually get enough of what you need or enough money to buy what you need. I really can't compare it to any other game I've ever played. I had a fun time playing through it. I guess I wasn't really playing. Just kind of clicking everywhere.\n\nI also laughed every time I'd go into some big climactic battle and my guy would be like "We scored a crushing victory over the Dark Goblins. Oh and all of my soldiers died. We will miss them." and then -10 soldiers in my inventory. Hahaha. Made them feel very disposable.\n\nOne flaw: The game autosaves and when you beat the game it erases your saves, meaning that if you want to get all the achievements you should do so BEFORE fighting the last boss (the last boss is clearly marked and identified).","February 8, 2014","true","4.2"," 59 of 71 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","59","71","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/recommended/259550/","jipearce82","Senno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jipearce82/","755 products in account","At first glance your average gamer might dismiss Hero of the Kingdom as an oddity, a curious game with minimal feedback and graphics and could be considered a time-filler, a placeholder title to play in between longer and more involved gaming sessions. To do so would be a disservice to the gamer and to Hero of the Kingdom, as there is a lot more under the surface than what first appears, and through the course of a short story, you will become, the Hero of the Kingdom.\n\nIf you enjoy your gaming more casual, and less intense, Hero of the Kingdom definitely has a lot to offer. The game interface is simple and intuitive, and yet it is also never obtrusive. All gameplay is directed by mouse clicks. The action takes place on simple overhead maps, and your mouse clicks naturally will flow as the story and the gameplay layers on.\n\nThe complexity of Hero of the Kingdom comes in its economy and the use of selling items of value or to trade for items of usefullness. Should your character require to pass a bridge that is broken, they may need to sell unrequired items to obtain the help, rope and other necessities to move further on. You will gain skills such as fishing and hunting, with simple mouse clicks taking all guess work out of the equation. You either have the equipment to do the task, or you don't. There really is no challenge here.\n\nThis laid back notion is continued with the minimal music and sound effects. Both are equally pleasing, but ultimately forgettable. There is nothing about the game, from the gameplay, to the audio, that really stands out. It is all as inoffensive and flavorless as can be possible.\n\nIn many ways, Hero of the Kingdom feels like a slightly improved Facebook game, without the social interaction. Certainly the gameplay harkens back to that mindset, and without any kind of graphical flourish, could easily be mistaken as one. Where it succeeds is that it layers on additional systems through hunting, fishing and flower collecting, while telling a simple story about a long forgotten evil that is uniting various minion cliches in order to hunt down the good people of the kingdom.\n\nHero of the Kingdom is a fun diversion that requires so little of your attention and so little of the gamer that one could forget that they were actually playing a game here and not an interactive click-a-thon. There is enough gameplay here to recommend to the casual gamer but only to this subset of gamer might there be some enjoyment found.\n\nHero of the Kingdom is by no means a bad game, in fact, I rather enjoyed my short four hour journey. But there are a great many alternatives for your gaming dollar that demand more from the gamer, and the gamer should demand more from the creator. Hero of the Kingdom wouldn't be out of place being hosted for free on some website, perhaps with a banner ad - there just isn't enough gameplay to fully justify a purchase.\n\n5/10.","November 29, 2014","false","4.1"," 93 of 132 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","93","132","2","11"

As you progress you'll end up with something in each corner, as follows:\n\nHints - Bottom right corner\nInsta-travel Map - top left\nInventory and health - bottom left\n\nWhat I really can't figure out is what kind of game this is.   I can't pigeonhole it in a single genre.  It has RPG elements, in that your character learns new skills and abilities as you progress; there are useful items scattered about on every screen, which is reminiscent of a hidden object game; and it's an adventure with strategy elements... What it's NOT is a click-fest.  There's no chaining, and no rush.\n\nAs I mentioned above, some items just need to be clicked on, hidden object-style, something I didn't realized until about eight screens into the game.  "I need (x-item), why can't I find someone to buy them from??"  The answer is that you need to gather them yourself.  New abilities will allow you to find new items in your environment, so you'll want to revisit scenes often, and be sure to click on anything that looks unusual!\n\nWe lose energy (health) when we do tasks, and this energy can be restored by staying at one of the available camps.  At each camp you'll eat a different type of food before you go to sleep, and this means a varying amount of health restored.  At one point I had over 30 health, so I don't there's a cap on how much health you can have.\n\nDon't be thrown off by how easy everything is early on.  The game is pretty isometric when it first begins, but once you've explored a few screens, you start to have some freedom to choose your own tasks. Will you just chase the main storyline, or will you explore every nook and cranny and do all of the side-quests?  Will you try to get all 38 achievements, or only do what's necessary?  The choice is yours!  Once you finish the game, you CAN go back in to try and get those awards, which is really nice.\n\nHero of the Kingdom which took me about 8 hours to finish with all of the achievements, and I absolutely enjoyed my time in the game.

It uses an isometric 2D view with a bit of animation in there as well. The story isn't all that fancy, or important, but it fits the casual nature of the game.\n\nIt's kinda hard to explain the gameplay because it involves a lot of clicking. You'll be accepting quests where you have to find certain items scattered across the map, defeat enemies, build things, sell things, buy things, you name it. There's plenty to do here, but remember, it's all about clicking stuff, so you will only use your mouse. Besides the isometric 2D view there's not much to look at.

It is most certainly one of the top 3 which I eagerly gave myself an auspicious pat on the back for buying. At $1.49 (75% off) it is money well spent. Completion only took me two days totalling 8 hours or so (didn't bother to quit game when taking dog for a walk). The game play is therapeutic and healing as even with a generic storyline, the long but seldom arduous line of quests are gratifyingly addictive. If you enjoy RPGs as I do and rarely skip side quests as it is half the fun, then I highly recommend this title.\n\nThe controls are as easy as can be and I can't honestly admit this is a strategy game as it does not give the player a chance at failure as you will see if you play it. It isn't a game to test your gaming skills but a chance to relax from more demanding games. Out of games you can use to relax and enjoy like you used to enjoy games as a child, it never feels like a waste of time or is uncomfortable to play in terms of time or effort of lack thereof.\n\nHero of the Kingdom is my idea of a perfect holiday.When I first booted this game (being my silly little self) I truly believed, despite the title being "Hero of the Kingdom", that I would be taking care of Father's farm for the duration of the game play as the atmosphere was immediately soothing. Luckily, this tranquillity is carried onwards as there is no concept of time and you can go as expeditiously or leisurely as you fancy.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS, GUIDES & TIPSDespised styles of achievements that I have become quite feverish about are those consisting of sending a player on wild goose chases where the goals lack relation to, or impact on the story. Luckily, this game is short, straight forward and sweet with every single achievement. You don't feel like you've wasted time getting achievements for the sake of achievements as it tend to be with some games which take away from the enjoyment. You will have to finish close to all of the activities provided in-game to finish all the achievements. I dislike looking at guides so am usually much slower than other players at finishing any set of tasks in-game but this game didn't need any guides at all. There are easier methods of finishing the game which you will eventually find out on your own but every feature and quest is well thought out by developers that you will not have to look at any playthrough or spend an exceedingly long time pondering variations of.\n\nSpoiler Hints (It’s likely you’ll realise on your own like I did so won’t need the info, hence the  format): You can buy grain, convert grain to flour, get bread from flour and sell that bread to a farmer's wife for minimum profit which will accumulate. Check this well written guide by The Fox in the community hub if you’d like to know more. When you progress farther and get to town you'll find a smuggler (in town to the right of screen with no indicating icon) which you can click on to buy poison from them, afterwards selling said poison to a master hunter in the woods also reachable at a later stage. This is a faster way of earning a profit through the market. The prices of items vary depending on who you're buying from/selling to, so keeping note of price ranges will add to the fun. When you start finding more treasure and jewellery which you can end up selling to one of the shops in town, you will no longer need to trade as much. Once you get to the "let's hoard money" part of the game which urges you to trade, it will ultimately feel less fun for obvious reasons (repetitive trading to add gold) so don't use it too much until you absolutely feel you need to.\n\nYou will need to find a very small number of hidden characters that are in plain view, just without icons near them which you will have to manually activate (click on people and sometimes they'll talk back with no warning ;D ). There will be new items available to find across the map in the form of "hidden objects" so if you enjoy hidden object games, this will be a blast and quite easy. I have enjoyed my fair share of hidden object puzzles so it was extremely easy to keep an eye out for various types of items that I needed to find to finish achievements. It's different for each player but you may end up lacking 1 or 2 items of a kind etc and spend some time looking for them. This is only natural as it is with all hidden object games. The last or last couple you're looking for are hardest for you to spot which is why they'll end up the last ones. Don't fret and go through the map slowly a few times. Click on various areas that you'll become accustomed to as "loot points" on the map such as forests, cliff sides and lakes away from camps and village areas where people are stationed or reside in. It is definitely a game where you'd want to finish the achievements for the added content at least as the game itself is short. The challenges are not always a walk in the park especially if you do not use the easier trading methods for extra gold but you will undoubtedly complete them like the way a fantastic game like this should be played. Btw, the blacked out parts are spoilers, not cheats as they do not exist and are thankfully unnecessary in this game (not that any should ever be used for any game). I do not finish any of my games quickly so the fact I finished it in two days adds to the realisation now that it was neither tirelessly demanding nor boring enough to put aside for a while like the majority of my library. It was such a simple yet entertaining 8 hours that I started writing this review after I finished it which also says a lot about how much I enjoyed the title considering my crowded backlog of games awaiting review (the majority of which I evidently did have fun playing). When the words "The End" reached my screen, it crossed my mind that this game felt like a demo for it's sequel, Hero of the Kingdom II. That's how much I enjoyed it and how much I am ready for more.\n\n\n- Edited grammar","March 30, 2015","true","8.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","2"

You won't be hard pressed by timer to complete quest, can be done at your pace. There's a grinding involved to get gold, and admittedly it's a bit boring to do quest repeatedly but I think it's a minor problem in a bigger picture. Basically it's just collecting resources like meat, flavor, fish, gold etc and turn them in for rewards and next objectives.

Part adventure game, part trading game, part hidden object game, it has a simplistic charm and a complete lack of urgency that makes it a joy to fool around with.\n\nYou play as some hapless farm kid whose father goes off to market. Bandits burn your farm down and kidnap Dad so its up to you to journey all the hell over the kingdom to save him. This involves a bit of fighting and a lot of trading goods, building things, and helping the mostly useless peasants out with their problems. The game plays out on static screens that look rendered right out of the Stronghold HD engine. New things to do appear as golden icons and can be anything from talking to people, hunting wildlife, gathering herbs, camping, scouting, battling, and so on. Every activity has a requirement in terms of energy (replenished by sleeping), gold (earned from jobs and such), and items found or bought. There are no time limits, no RNG, and every trade seems to at least break even for you, so there's no way to fail anything.\n\nThere's a huge amount of stuff to do as you progress, because you can earn yourself new skills that give you access to new activities. There's also a hint of hidden object game to it, because each screen has little collectibles like eggs and crates to click on for bonus resources. You can hunt for lots of "secrets" in the game that take the shape of items, quests, and even hidden parts of the map. It's not a terribly long game, maybe 3 hours or so to beat, but if you want to go completionist on its many achievements you'll get another few hours out of it. Hero of the Kingdom was a perfect way to wind down between more involved games and I'm definitely going to pick up the sequel sometime.\n\nOh, and there's a demo if you're still on the fence after reading this.

You move from one screen to another, interacting with characters, accomplishing quests and gathering various resources all over the map.\nStory is simple and naive, but there lies its charm. Young man, whose farm was burned by bandits, is trying to take revenge on this thugs and find missing father. This story offers no surprises, but develops logically and well designed.\n\nThere is open world, you can more or less freely move around the map. On the other hand, the world is very small and it is impossible to get lost here. Quests do not shine with diversity, they just fit into formula "find something somewhere and bring it for someone". There is no variations in dialogues and you can not choose answers of your character, events are completely linear. But, as i said, story is well designed, it is interesting enough to follow the storyline and completing the quests gives you a nice feeling of progress.\n\nThere is a lot of quests and sometimes i really missed something like journal where it would be possible to see the list of active quests and their description. On the other hand, as i said, the map is small and you can walk through locations in seconds so, if you forget what people asked you to bring, it is not difficult to find active characters again and re-check what you need to do.\n\nSometimes, game lacks logic. For example, to kill a boar you need a dagger. You do not have a dagger but have a sword and bow with arrows? Well, then you can not kill the boar, go and find yourself a dagger. Why i can not hunt this poor pig with arrows? Game offers no answer.\n\nEventually, your character will learn skills to collect pearls, hunt wild animals, gather algae and so on. There is plenty of hidden items that can be collected and sold to merchants - eggs, mushrooms, treasures, crawfish... all this objects are very small and usually are well hidden, so gathering turns into annoying and merciless pixel-hunting. This is bad for eyes for sure! Fortunately, if you do not want to complete all achievements then it is not necessary to seek for hidden objects.\n\nThere is no way to lose the game, i just can not invent a situation in which you can get stuck. Abundance of resources means that you will always find something that you can sell and earn some coins. Storyline can be completed in four or five hours but, of course, if you want to collect all the mushrooms, then pixel-hunting can detain you for long. After you had finished storyline, you can continue to play and solve incompleted quests and achievements. But there is no random events, enemies and resources do not respawn, so game offers no replayability.\n\nAnyway, game is very well designed and i can safely recommend it to anyone who seeks for relaxing and casual gameplay.

It's basically a point and click adventure game, but instead of puzzles, you have resource management.  You find/collect various resources in the world and use them to create/craft/barter for other items that may not be as easy to come by.  As the story progresses (a simple story, old as time, but it moves things along), you open up new areas of the map in which to hunt, forage, and take on side quests for various NPCs.\n\nAll of the backgrounds are static, with icons representing the types of activities available - picking flowers, hunting bear, fishing, and combat animations are little more than a few 2D sprites wobbling back and forth.  But that doesn't detract from the enjoyment.  There is just enough of a "new stuff to get/see" drip, and the pacing is done well enough, that it never gets boring.  You may find a vendor selling things you don't know what to do with yet, but it won't take long until you figure it out, or the story progresses to the point where it makes sense.  There is a bit of a grind at the end of the game if you want all the achievements, but it's not a big deal.\n\nThe major story beats are advanced by having the right amount of particular resources - soldiers, healing potions, a weapon of some sort - to take on the battle or quest in front of you.  Sometimes, finding the right resources is a little troubling because the map doesn't identify where anything particular is; however, the loads are fast enough, and you backtrack enough that you get used to where the crucial stuff is anyway.\n\nIt has a demo, so I'd check that out.

It's a bit odd to describe it, as the game wants to seem like an adventure but it comes out as something fairly unique. You start as a simple farm lad trying to find where your father went off to after bandits ransacked your farm, and end up being, as the title says, the hero of the entire kingdom.\n\nTo achieve this end result, you must click, and click, and click! This can be from anything as simple as delivering a letter from clickable person to clickable person #2 to defeating various armies of villainous foes by gathering troops and supplies. There's also objects in the background that, when clicked upon, give various items relating to what they are. These can be very helpful for trading for what you need or selling to get extra gold, though none of them are necessary typically and are just there to make the game last longer.\n\nSpeaking of length, it took me 3.3 hours to beat the game, including all my clicking of the extra objects (of which I got about 95%). I was somewhat annoyed to find that I couldn't go back and clean up the last few objects I needed once I had beaten it, but this will only affect you if you're a completionist or achievement hunter. If you are, just be wary of that.\n\nThe story is very basic of course, even just basing it on the summary I gave, but it's a quaint little adventure-sorta game. At $7 (and cheaper on sales presumably), this is a nice choice for an interesting game to check out.","November 29, 2013","true","5.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

The game was developed by Lonely Troops, a Slovakian Indie studio consisting of 2 brothers.\n\nSTORY\nWithout going too much into detail, the story is pretty generic weak-boy-saves-the-world material. Bandits burn down your house and kidnap your father, so you set out on a quest to rescue him, find out what the bandits' motives are and put an end to all evil to make the kingdom a peaceful and safe place again. Add magic, ghosts, talking frogs, goblins and lizardmen to that and, well, there you go. Nothing spectacular or innovative there, but gameflow-wise it keeps the boat afloat, so that's at least something.\n\nVISUALS\nGraphically, the game may as well be from the 1990's era of simulation games such as Anno 1602 or Age of Empires, which isn't a bad thing at all. The enviroments have loads of details that you often only see at a second glance and it's quite cool to discover new things in areas that you have already visited many times. However, do note that the enviroments are absolutely static - they are basically drawings with quest/action markers on top of them, so you won't see cows eating grass, fishes swimming around or anything like that. The best you get is some minor animation effects for water and smoke, but that's about it. If anything changes in the enviroment like, say, a NPC is moving from A to B, he slowly fades out on A and then slowly fades in on B, so there aren't any actual animations for anything. While that's no deal-breaker for me personally, it surely would've been awesome if the game felt a bit more alive and actually more like a sim rather than a P'n'C game with rendered backgrounds.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe game is basically a Hidden Object game where you can freely move around between the various locations to explore them and hunt, collect and harvest goods that you'll eventually need for quests, trades or tasks. All items that you gather will be put into your inventory and you decide whether you want to sell them for gold or trade them for other items that you might need for a certain quest.\n\nAll interactions such as hunting, fishing, harvesting or fighting cost resources in the form of knifes, arrows, bowls, fishing rods, swords, shields etc. and if you have a bow but no arrows, you can't go hunting. While the various tasks require various resources, all tasks require a certain amount of health points (similar to Action Points in turn-based games). They basically represent your stamina and if you have depleted your health, you can't finish any tasks until you replenish it again. This is easily done by taking a nap in a tent, camp or inn. The different resting places require different resources: while you need fruits or meat to sleep in a tent or a camp, you need hard gold to sleep in an inn. In return, you get rewarded with the most health points out of the 3 resting places because it's more restorative to sleep in an actual bed rather than in a tent, obviously.\n\nGenerally, managing your resources is an important part of the game as you need to think ahead and estimate whether you might need certain items later down the road. If you sell everything right away, you most definitely will have to re-purchase the items in order to complete tasks or quest. On the other hand, if you keep absolutely everything in your inventory, you might not be able to purchase required items that are only sold for gold - simply because you didn't earn any gold by selling stuff you do not need.\n\nOther than that, it's basically back and forth tracking between the different locations to look out for new or updated quests and new activities, which often only spawn after certain quests are completed.\n\nPLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITY\nBeating the story took me roughly 5 hours, however, the largest chunk of playtime is dedicated to finding the large amount of hidden objects/resources and doing various tasks to gain even more resources. The actual story itself makes only a small piece of the pie.\n\nFor me personally, the game has only very little replayability. Once you've beaten it, you've beaten it. There's no real point or incentive to come back to it again, especially since it's easily doable to get 100% of the achiements in a single playthrough if you just take your time and don't rush from quest to quest.\n\nCONCLUSION\nHero of the Kingdom isn't flawless, but the visual appeal, the relaxing atmosphere and the simple yet interesting gameplay makes this a decent game for a casual evening when you're not in the mood to shoot and kill things on the screen.","October 1, 2014","true","5.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

I was pleasantly surprised by Hero of the Kingdom, and was happy to have given it a chance.\n\nIf you like super casual, short, adventure games that are less action-oriented (the game's main mechanic is item/resource management), then you will enjoy this game. It is easily beatable in less than 2 hours, and within 4 hours I had farmed all of the achievements.\n\nThe aesthetics are nice - the backgrounds are well-done and the menus/feedback are non-intrusive. The music and sounds are good, adding an appropriate feel to the atmosphere. The story and pacing of the game allow for a very mindless, non-taxing gameplay experience. After playing through a lot of time-intensive, mind-numbing games, having casual alternatives like Hero o the Kingdom is always appreciated.\n\nThe controls are extremely simple, as everything is done through mouse clicks. The tutorial is quick and painless, and the learning curve is mostly minimal - the most difficult element being proper item/resource management. It is pretty challenging to actually "fail" in the game, as there are always options for you to acquire more resources, even if you find yourself suddenly depleted of everything.\n\nGameplay is mostly linear and follows a straightforward formula - in order for you to progress to area X, you need items Y and Z. Item Y can be obtained by either buying it directly with gold, or by harvesting and crafting components A and C, Item Z is a side-quest reward. Variations of this formula occur, but the general concept is to have the appropriate items for each mission. Any form of resource harvesting (ex: farming, hunting) requires health points (and usually some other item(s)), and you are able to accumulate an infinite amount of HP if you keep resting.\n\nFor achievement hunters, this game is pretty easy to achieve 100%, however, a large amount of time will be spent finding small objects (mushrooms, crates, etc) on the screen. I had to do this in bursts, as my eyes and brain would get tired of searching through each level.\n\nIf you want a casual, non-demanding break from your typical games, then definitely give Hero of the Kingdom a try. I've played web-based games on sites like Newgrounds and Kongregate since I was a child, and this game has similar appeal as the quality titles you can find on there.\n\nI normally try not to mention game price in my reviews, however, I would recommend most people to wait for this one to go on sale, or at least be bundled (as it happens often).\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","November 12, 2014","true","5.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","3"

No side quests, no way to change the ending, you just do a lot of clicking and searching for small, nearly-unnoticable items. It's kinda fun, and a way to kill time for a little bit, but if you see it and think it's a multiple playthrough game don't bother. If you see it on sale, at least half-off, I'd say it's worth that.

First of all, it can save you hundreds of dollars spent on a psychologist. Really, this game it's so simple and makes you so chilled that you forget about everything while playing it. However, I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. Let's see it in more detail:\n\nThis is a game unlike others This is the kind of game that you think about playing for a couple of minutes to give it a chance and before you know it, you have been 4 hours in front of the screen. Also, the soundtrack is pretty awesome too. I don't know why people haven't commented on it, but I liked it a lot since it goes really well with the game. Basically, the game is a point&click where you must help your father that has been captured by a bunch of thiefs and save the kingdom in the process. It's simple, it's linear, it's athmosperic and it's awesome.\n\nIt's not for everyone, though The problem with this game is that it may be too simple for some people. There's no much variety on it, you can't die and there's nothing particularly astounding on the dialogue. It's a simple game. You need to know it, because if you expect an awesome RPG full with dialogues and choices you will get disappointed, but if you don't hype it and play it for what it is, you will end up liking it. You should also know that this is a short game, I'm sure you can complete the whole story in about 4 hours and I personally collected all the achievements in about 9. And trust me, after you played it and collected all the achievements, you dont't want to play it again. It's basically the same thing over again, so the replay value on this one is about zero.\n\nSo, should I buy Hero of the Kingdom?Only if you are not looking for a challenge. This game offers just a nice, calmed, short story that can be awesome in it's own way. Want to chill out a bit from action games? This game offers that. Give it a chance and it might surpise you. The demo is free so you won't lose anything.","July 8, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The storyline is memorable, but not necessary to follow and the puzzles are simple enough that you will most likely never have to start over or figure out what you are missing.

You also have to watch your health to ensure you have enough strength to accomplish the chores, fights, and quests that you need to accomplish.  This is casual at the very heart, but it mixes up the genres very well.  I highly doubt anyone will ever die or get stuck in this game as it can definitely hold your hand throughout if you let it.

Who, as the game progresses, evolves into the Badass Errand Boy *gasp!* Hero of the Kingdom! But no, seriously, if you dislike "fetch quests", then steer clear of this game altogether. There's no avoiding those.\n\nTo sum it up, the entire gameplay consists of jumping between the chunks of the world map, helping the elderly, picking up pretty flowers, hunting for pixels, wild animal genocide and occasional Bad Guy slaying. That's it, really. The (heavily linear) story is like something straight out of a children's book geared towards ages 5-7.

Is it worth $6? No. It's far too short to be worth $6. But if it is on sale, definitely consider it.\n\nHotK is a very casual point and click experience that is reminiscent of old multiplayer browser games like, "Wild West" i believe it was called. If you don't appreciate casual storytelling experiences, then do yourself a favor and leave this game's store page immediately. There's not much to explain about how the game works other than that you click on some icons that represent activities, spend or acquire resources by doing so, and progress in the story or progress in acquiring the resources you need to progress. That's all the game is. Do story missions, run out of resources, do side activities for money and resources, rest to replenish HP, and repeat. To be very honest, this formula grows stale around the ending, even if it is a short game.\n\nSo is HoTK worth playing? Yes. There are no major points to review as pros or cons really and it is literally absent of bugs from what I experienced. If the features appeal to you then pick it up today. The FINAL VERDICT will be based on its status as a GAME, not in comparison to Triple A titles that obviously out-do it. And for that verdict I'd give it an 7/10. It wasn't perfect, but it was fun. If it could have been a bit longer and had some extra gameplay mechanics it would have been better. Note you'll get about 3 hours out of it if you stick to grinding story alone, maybe 4 if you go for acheivements.

I saw it for almost nothing during a sale so I grabbed it and went into it basically blind. I have no regrets.\n\nI found myself unable and unwilling to hop off the game once I got started and finished it in the same sitting. It took me around 6 hours from start to finish inclusive of all achievements. For an older game with a very basic art / game play style I found Hero of the Kingdom to be a fantastic little adventure even when the story became very cheesy towards the end. Everything requires minimal thought and I breezed through the game satisfied at all times with the progression and events.\n\nIf I had to point out any flaws I'd say the difficulty and the lack of replay ability. Honestly though, for what I paid I feel as if I've ripped the developers off. It was a great game and worth every penny. If you find yourself in the mood for a simple adventure / RPG / point and click game. Look no further, this game scratches all those itches. 8/10\n","January 6","true","8.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After your farm gets burned down by bandits, you set out to find your father, helping people across the kingdom and becoming the adventurer you always dreamed of being.\n\nPros: This game is a light straightforward adventure. Each quest or encounter requires you to assemble a certain amount of money or equipment to accomplish. As you successfully accomplish goals, additional parts of the maps are revealed, allowing you to go to new location and get additional quests. You also advanced through three level of hunting, fishing and gathering skills, each stage revealing new resources on the map, giving you a reason to go back to locations you didn't need to access anymore.\n\nCons: The entire game is a linear adventure, save side quests. If you have the required items for a combat, you will win that combat, no action or strategy involved. The game is void of randomization: people are there where they're supposed to be, resources can be gathered once or twice and do not regenerate, enemies or hunting game don't respawn. There is no replay value to this game.\n\nVerdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you\n\nHero of the Kingdom is simple, straightforward, and short. Surprisingly, I almost played through the entire game in one sitting (it wasn't intense enough to keep me up at night, but I finished it the following morning). It's a fun little idle game with just enough production value to mandate it's rather low price. It barely gets my recommendation, but it does get it.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","April 5, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's actually the most apt title you could give a game with such a children's novel story. The game itself, however, is quite unique.\n\nIt's difficult to explain the 'gameplay'. It's primarily resource management and questing. It takes pieces of RPGs, photo hunts, Anno-style management, and exploration and merges them all together into this strange concoction. I'll admit the Age of Empires II style art is what originally drove me to it. There's no real difficulty here, just relaxing puzzles.\n\nI don't know whether or not to recommend it because I think that's impossible to determine.

I have not even bothered to look at the trailers.\n\n'Adventure' 'rpg' says two of the descriptions - oh really? Graphically screenshots looked more like left overs from age of empires. Wrong - this game is 'hidden object hunting combined with strategy'. It also neatly re-defines what or who a hero is. In this game the hero is not a guy in shining armor being all angsty and killing eveything - instead he is a crafty man who hauls ♥♥♥ around the map and does chores, builds stuff, helps people, hires people to do jobs and manages inventory, gets some sleep and gets up early to continue where he left off - All of this 'working' allows him to progress with goals. For example attacking a bandit stronghold is quite different to what it's in games like this usually - first you need to make preparations and have the necessary people found before you can try it.\n\nIt took some 5 hours to get all achievements in this game.\n\nTry it out.

If you like all manner of quests -- main as well as  side quests -- and you like point and click games, then this one might just do the trick.\n\nTrue, the graphics are quite simple and nothing to shout about. The level design is really not that tough and the only real challenge is seeing how much of the map you can remember and where resources and items are located. But the soundtrack is very soothing and I found myself playing for a lot longer than I planned and completing the game in 3 hours.\n\nIt is a very short game and you can zip through it very quickly so best if you buy this when it is on sale and not full price. The story is also pretty straightforward and you are playing it as the son-hero on the classic hero's journey.\n\nIf you have some time to kill, need a game in between games that will relax you and not stress you out at all, this is the game for you. Probably great for younger gamers as well.

I hadn't heard of many games in the bundle, but it was cheap and I wanted to try buying some games that I wouldn't normally play and see what happened. Out of all the games in the bundle, I thought this one would be the least interesting, because at first glance, it seemed like one of those stupid games they put up on Facebook or something. Honestly, though, I'm quite surprised at how much I like this game. It's just a simple point n' click adventure, but it still incorporates elements to make it seem like a RPG, too.\n\nYou start off as a farmer, but a group of bandits burn down your farmhouse, and you end up going on a huge adventure and become a hero. Unlike other games of this type, you  don't become said hero by just fighting a bunch of monsters. You have to trade with people to get the proper items to help other people. It's a nice way to show that not all heroes have to be big and brawny or do huge tasks to be considered a hero.\n\nI've read some of the others reviews for this game, and it seems that a lot of people would agree with me when I say that this little game is surprisingly addictive, and most don't regret playing it. The only negative comments I have about this game are that the music gets a bit bothersome after a while, and the game could've delved a bit deeper in order to make the game last longer, but other than that, I think it's pretty solid.\n\nPros:\n-Addictive\n-Simple\n-Nice perspective on heroism\n\nCons:\n-Music gets bothersome\n-Could've been longer/more in depth\n\nScores:\nGameplay: 8/10\nSoundtrack: 5/10\nStyle: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nAttractiveness: 8/10\nOverall: 8/10","September 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Hero of the Kingdom feels like a game that you might find on facebook. But it is actually an interesting little gem, with quite a lot to offer, a fairly interesting storyline, beautiful, but simple, graphics, and on top of all that a pretty neat collectathon going on. Many of the achievements are linked to collecting certain items within the game, so it becomes a bit of a search and find game, which was fine by me since I love that kind of thing.\n\nHero of the Kingdom isn't just an adventure game, you can trade between different people in different locations to make a decent amount of money, and you have to balance the amount of money you have as well as the items you have in order to complete certain quests.\n\nI have 100% all of the achievements in the game, as well as completed all of the collections and all of the side and main quests, and have done so in just about 4 hours. That's the only complaint I have with this game, it's far too short. But the amount that it cost is, at least in my opinion, worth the amount of time you're going to get out of it.

The graphics are very nice, the storyline is ok if not exactly very imaginative. For younger players it is an ideal game to live an adventure. Achievements add a little zest to the game. You do need sharp eyes to see everything that needs to be picked up and sometimes (my eyesight) only aimeless, repetitive clicking helps to find those last few eggs :-). If you can get the game on sale, go for it. It does have some surprises and I spent a couple of pleasant evenings with the game, now I will let my 6 year old son have a go at it.","December 8, 2015","true","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a rather interesting storyline, plus it's fairly easy to figure out. It's click based, so you select the items to complete tasks and collect other items to complete other tasks.\n\nI actually found it interesting and fun to try and find all the hidden items that were in the map areas. Eggs in a nest, different types of mushrooms, fishing, finding lost crates or barrels and even hunting some animals.\n\nMaking sure to have the required things to do a task, like the right amount of health, the tool or weapon and such is a good idea, as it would be easy to try and go after something with low health if you don't check it.\n\nOverall I found it rather enjoyable, a fair game to play here and there without having to commit hours to it and it has an end. Far too many of the games I play, don't have an end in sight. They are MMORPGs, so this game was a fun casual romp that offered a break from the far more intense gaming sessions.\n\nHope you found this helpful in some way and if you like hidden objects, give it a look.","December 9, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What is remarkable about it is the good balance between the gameplay aspects.\n\nLong version:Hero of the Kingdom is a resource management strategy game– something that fits well to the portfolio of the Slovakian development team– with a fantasy adventure theme.\n\nThe goal is always to gather enough resources to pass the current objective. This requires a careful management of gold (for tools to gather the resources with) and strength (which serves the role of time units). There is no combat or levelling: if you have the resources to pass an obstacle, you automatically do so.\nThe mechanics are decent, but not perfect: there are exploits to get infinite gold and strength (although slowly), and it is easy to get confused by the variety of required resources by the end.\n\nThe story is fairly basic: find abducted relative, find bad sorcerer, kill bad sorcerer. This simplicity works to its advantage though as it lets the game put more focus on the dozens of side quests, giving it a classic RPG feel. Still, most players will likely reach 100% completion status within 4-5 hours, making Hero of the Kingdom a short, but fun game.","April 27, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

He gets to do all sorts of jobs from woodcutting to burning to healing wounded people. Gameplay is simple: clicking a marker will give you a short written description (no voice-over here) of your character's thoughts, what you can (and therefore should) do and what you need to accomplish that. You need many kinds of resources in the form of food, vitality, gold and tools.\n\nWhile the gameplay is a casual adventure, you also have to manage the said resources. You'll gain vitality by resting, which requires food that is acquired by foraging or hunting, which in part require tools and skills. Many parts of this chain could have been removed to smooth the gameplay: with them, however, it is an adventure RPG game, not just a barely visual novel.\n\nThere are also many details in the areas that turn out to be significant later on. Some of them are "hidden", though, meaning that you just have to click them to see if they react: stuff like collectable mushrooms and lootable barrels form this category.\n\nThe narration is casual and easygoing, containing little to no fancy words. In effect, it would be quite suitable to be played with young children who can't read yet, assuming English proficiency. Like so, the story is rather traditional with the evil dark wizards and all. It's still nice enough to keep in its grip for the while it lasts.\n\nFull completion would have lasted about 4 hours, but I went for all the achievements. This added about an hour to the playtime because I just couldn't find several last mushrooms and hidden caches. While challenging, I was irritated to check the same areas ten times just to find those last missing items. Anyway, this is amended, as I really enjoyed the leisure style.\n\nReplay value, IMO, is meager though. Once played through completely, there isn't much more to accomplish. That said, it is rather alright an experience for its price.","February 5, 2014","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's simplify those into a 5 hour long game point n' click game." While the idea might not be as brilliant as it sound, but the execution in Hero of the Kingdom proved that the idea is simply refreshing.\n\nThe game is linear. There is no way to lose the game.

The best part is that this game is one of a few that provide entertainment & stimulation for the intellect while not being too taxing for those with physical limitations.  The characteristics I most appreciated in the Hero of the Kingdom game is that it was story-driven yet you have free choice of direction and resolution.  The pace is slow (by that I mean there is no "need for speed" or required talent in manual dexterity & yet the game never lags and manages to remain mutable enough to keep it fresh, with minimal manual interactions.  The achievements are challenging yet still realistically acheivable.  The game is adequate in length & not over-long.  The only things I would add to my wish list for the sequel would be a few more dashes of wit & whimsy (along with additional humorous dialog throughout & perhaps an Easter Egg or two). All-in-all it was a great game & I send my thanks & congratulations (on the Greenlight for the sequel) to Lonely Troops.

It's easy to play, even while distracted. And thus definitely well-suited to a casual player, or someone who wants to play a little something that's not-too-engaging with a little free time.\n\n=Complete Review=  (TL:DR version and Conclusion at the bottom)\n\n=The Story: 3/5= You play as a farm boy with dreams of grandeur, of who's father has left you to take care of the farm while he takes care of some errands in town. One day, while you're out repairing the old lookout tower down the road from the farm, bandits set your father's farm ablaze. Not even raiding it, just raizing the whole thing! Now with no home, you must set out on a quest to find your father, who has not returned, and find out why the bandits destroyed your home.\n\nThroughout your adventure, you find many people in need of your aid. Some who also were hassled by the same bandits who burned your farm to the ground. And soon find that there are much bigger things at work than just the bandits.\n\nThe story is engaging enough to encourage playing it through to the end, but simple enough to allow players to take a break if need be, with no pressure or timers.\n\n=The User Interface: 2/5=  The interface is barely there, which is nice for those who prefer a minimalistic UI. At each of the four corners of the screen, there are buttons to bring up the actual UI or to serve as a function of their own, of which they tuck themselves out of view when not moused over.\n\nMy only real complaint is how cluttered the inventory can get, but.. I figure one easy fix would be, I dunno... Cleaning it out?\n\n... I've got a problem with playing pack rat, yes...\n\n=The Gameplay: 3/5= The gameplay is pretty nice and simple. The layout is from a overhead view, and you click on what you want to interact with. Arrows at the edges of the screen indicate that you can move in that direction to another screen. Typically little icons will hover over things that need to be, or can be interacted with.\nBut, as you progress through the game, there's more things to interact with that aren't highlighted. Hidden objects of a sort, if you will. Of which result in some very nice resources in-game, and achievements if you find a lot of them.\n\n=The Graphics: 3/5= The graphics are nice, sweet, and to the point. They're well done, and it's not often that there's sprites or the like that overly clash with the area. Everything blends well together, and doesn't have severe drops or increase in certain objects' quality, thus looking like they'd logically exist in the same setting.\n\n=The Audio: 3/5=  The music serves it's purpose decently. The music is nice, without being overly repetitive, and matches the settings quite well. But it's also not the kind of music you'll be finding yourself listening to when not playing the game. The sound effects are nice, and also serve to give a idea on what's in the current scene. There's not much of this employed though, sadly. And I do hope that's addressed in the sequel.\n\n=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=\n\nPros\n- Decent storyline.\n- Easy to play casual gameplay.\n- Nicely done graphics that don't look out of place.\n- Music and sounds that fit the location.\n- Good amount of Achievements.\n\nNeutral\n- Minimalistic UI is only there when you need it.\n\nCons\n- Fairly short game.\n- A bit too casual for those wanting something more from their game experience.\n- So... Much... Backtracking...\n\n=The Conclusion: 6.5/10= A simple game to fill a simple need, Hero of the Kingdom is best suited for the casual gamer, and suits them well. The asthetics and gameplay are well done and serve their purpose. The game is seemingly well crafted despite it's simplistic nature, and doesn't seem to suffer from a lack of quality, inciting that the developer put much love in to this game and didn't make it to purely be a cash grab. Which is nice to see.\n\nIt's definitely a good game to pick up on sale, which just so happens to be right now as of me writing this. So if the game sounds good to you, it would be a nice thing to pick up for a couple bucks.\n\nThank you very much for taking your time to read my review.","December 12, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wasn't expecting that. Resource managament RPG in an open world experience with a good story. Yeah, it actually feels like open world, since you go fort and back all the time for the quests, loot and trade.\n\nSince the sequel is almost completed, I'll have some ideas for the 3rd one.\nI think the 3rd one should focus more on an open world experience with some more activities like bread making(industry) as in the 1st one,(baker, blacksmith, tanner, brewery  etc.) different kind of mining/crafting options, random encounters and the map in the 3rd one should be at least 4 times bigger than the 1st one. (Maybe 4 different kind of maps etc.)\nAnd also nicely balanced 150+ achievements please.\n\nI really enjoyed this game. A pure gem with a very nice combination of different ideas.

It's easy to play, even while distracted. And thus definitely well-suited to a casual player, or someone who wants to play a little something that's not-too-engaging with a little free time.\n\n=Complete Review=  (TL:DR version and Conclusion at the bottom)\n\n=The Story: 3/5= You play as a farm boy with dreams of grandeur, of who's father has left you to take care of the farm while he takes care of some errands in town. One day, while you're out repairing the old lookout tower down the road from the farm, bandits set your father's farm ablaze. Not even raiding it, just raizing the whole thing! Now with no home, you must set out on a quest to find your father, who has not returned, and find out why the bandits destroyed your home.\n\nThroughout your adventure, you find many people in need of your aid. Some who also were hassled by the same bandits who burned your farm to the ground. And soon find that there are much bigger things at work than just the bandits.\n\nThe story is engaging enough to encourage playing it through to the end, but simple enough to allow players to take a break if need be, with no pressure or timers.\n\n=The User Interface: 2/5=  The interface is barely there, which is nice for those who prefer a minimalistic UI. At each of the four corners of the screen, there are buttons to bring up the actual UI or to serve as a function of their own, of which they tuck themselves out of view when not moused over.\n\nMy only real complaint is how cluttered the inventory can get, but.. I figure one easy fix would be, I dunno... Cleaning it out?\n\n... I've got a problem with playing pack rat, yes...\n\n=The Gameplay: 3/5= The gameplay is pretty nice and simple. The layout is from a overhead view, and you click on what you want to interact with. Arrows at the edges of the screen indicate that you can move in that direction to another screen. Typically little icons will hover over things that need to be, or can be interacted with.\nBut, as you progress through the game, there's more things to interact with that aren't highlighted. Hidden objects of a sort, if you will. Of which result in some very nice resources in-game, and achievements if you find a lot of them.\n\n=The Graphics: 3/5= The graphics are nice, sweet, and to the point. They're well done, and it's not often that there's sprites or the like that overly clash with the area. Everything blends well together, and doesn't have severe drops or increase in certain objects' quality, thus looking like they'd logically exist in the same setting.\n\n=The Audio: 3/5=  The music serves it's purpose decently. The music is nice, without being overly repetitive, and matches the settings quite well. But it's also not the kind of music you'll be finding yourself listening to when not playing the game. The sound effects are nice, and also serve to give a idea on what's in the current scene. There's not much of this employed though, sadly. And I do hope that's addressed in the sequel.\n\n=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=\n\nPros\n- Decent storyline.\n- Easy to play casual gameplay.\n- Nicely done graphics that don't look out of place.\n- Music and sounds that fit the location.\n- Good amount of Achievements.\n\nNeutral\n- Minimalistic UI is only there when you need it.\n\nCons\n- Fairly short game.\n- A bit too casual for those wanting something more from their game experience.\n- So... Much... Backtracking...\n\n=The Conclusion: 6.5/10= A simple game to fill a simple need, Hero of the Kingdom is best suited for the casual gamer, and suits them well. The asthetics and gameplay are well done and serve their purpose. The game is seemingly well crafted despite it's simplistic nature, and doesn't seem to suffer from a lack of quality, inciting that the developer put much love in to this game and didn't make it to purely be a cash grab. Which is nice to see.\n\nIt's definitely a good game to pick up on sale, which just so happens to be right now as of me writing this. So if the game sounds good to you, it would be a nice thing to pick up for a couple bucks.\n\nThank you very much for taking your time to read my review.","December 12, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has you playing the son of a farmer whose farm gets destroyed by bandits. What happens next is the start of your adventure into this interactive story.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty basic, but for a casual game its a lot of fun! The fetch quests, and other various side quests are pretty much what you would expect from an RPG game.\n\nThere are a couple annoying features such as not being able to buy/sell items in bulk, and running out of strength after a couple battles, but this doesn't deter you from enjoying the game. The one feature I would like to see in the sequel is for the collectible hidden object side of the game, they need to add a completion meter for each map so the player is not having to use a magnifying glass to find the last couple of missing items.\n\nThe game is short and can be completed in about 5 hours if you are trying to 100% the achievements.  If you just play the story its about a 2-3 hr game. Great game for the money! I give this a solid 8/10!","December 31, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And even though the main gameplay consists of gathering, trading and doing quests, the inclusion of some objects hidden cleverly in plain view makes for a game that keeps you engaged.\n\nThe story is pretty standard, but it's not bad by any means. And whether or not you're into the tropes of RPGs, the simple beauty of the graphics will certainly sway you.\n\nI don't know why it's so charming, but I don't care really. This is a good game. And it's certainly worth five dollars. But if you're unsure, get it on a sale. If you like these kinds of games, you'll not regret it.\n\n\nEdit::\nI still recommend this game for its simple charm, but I should warn you that it's a very casual game. I managed to beat it in about three and a half hours, and earn the remaining achievements in 15 minutes. Granted, I'm the kind of guy who used to pick up Dark Souls and play it casually, so take from that what you want. Still, my point stands: This is a fairly easy game. But that doesn't make it bad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UWSTopGun/recommended/259550/","UWSTopGun","Blank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UWSTopGun/","292 products in account","I absolutely love this game. A mix of point and click and adventure with great story that leaves you wanting more with every newely discovered area. There's fishing, gathering and hunting to be done. This is a well paced game with a spot of what I would consider "open world" that branches off into several sidequest that tie in quite nicely with the main story.\n\nPro tip for beginners: When you can buy fruit from the fruit seller, make sure you spend all your available gold on fruit and backtrack to the Farmer's Wife and sell all of your fruit to her. If you do this for a while you'll be able to afford tools, food and other various items you need in the upcoming areas. One reviewer said that he barely had enough money to get to new areas but the whole point of the game is to see it from the character's perspective, he has to go between villages and barter to make a profit to continue on his journey. It's not lazy, it forces you to play the game the way it was meant to be played and not find a loophole past everything.\n\nUpdate: Having completed the game a couple of days ago, I am satisfied with it's ending. All of the loose ends toward the last couple of hours of gameplay finally came together. My only grief with the game is that there wasn't enough clashing during the important end game battles, the sound effects could've been extended a bit longer to emphasize how intense and important they were.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone looking for a casual well paced game. The point is to follow the story and be taken on the well told (albeit short journey) of a young man who's on a quest to find his Father while being unknowingly whisked into an age old battle involving the Dark Wizard.","November 26, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although the storyline is a bit hackneyed, I still found myself getting into it.  The text based narration was decent and the sound effects were well done.  Finding all the hidden goodies throughout the game felt like a flashback to Where's Waldo books.\n\nCons:  Don't expect a lengthy game!  I beat it twice in under 10 hours for all the achievements.  The entire game only encompasses a small group of tiles, so not much exploring.  The harvesting can be tedious when combined with the constant need to rest and exchange for supplies.  Most of the harvesting is only used to monotonously build up money instead of crafting or building.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to relax and kill a few evenings, it will do well.

What's more, you can buy and sell some stuff, and do some simple side quests. game is for 2-4 hours.\n\nThe biggest con was unsophisticated story - and that's all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gyumaou/recommended/259550/","Gyumaou","Gyumaou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gyumaou/","2469 products in account","Hero of the Kingdom is a slightly unusual mix of point-and-click adventure and rpg. It looks like an old-school isometric rpg, but there is no character to control - instead all actions are performed by clicking on object like in a point&click title. The basic rpg premise is still here (slight spoilers!) - an ordinary boy on a quest to find his father turns into a hero that saves the land from dire evil. Yeah, like no one expected that, spoilers over. The boy learns skills during the adventure - hunting, herbalism, etc - in order to get closer to his goal. As if the mix wasn't unusual enough the game adds in some Hiden Object elements - there are treasures and extra items hidden around in the bushes, rivers, barrels.\n\nVisually the game has nothing to be shy of, it's a simple but well drawn style. Map elements are clearly distinguishible and even the hidden items are fairly easy to spot with a little practice. It's overall easy on the eye even for longer sessions. The audio is pleasant enough too, can't say much in detail about it personally but at least it feels right. Sadly, there is very little, if any, voice acting and that might diminish the enjoyment for some players - while lots of detailed text and dialogues can be enrich the world it might also bore the player.\n\nPersonally I find the mix pretty entertaining, then again I enjoy casual games so take what I say with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, the story moves at a good enough pace to keep boredom away and it's easy to enjoy this in bite-sized portions if so desired. Time-wise the game takes around 5 hours for a relaxed playthrough, dipping to maybe 3-3.5 for a speedy run and climbing to approx 8 for a single 100% run. At L5 that is pretty good value for anyone who likes a more casual adventure.\n\ntl;dr: At £5 it's a good mix of point&click, adventure, and casual gameplay.","February 1, 2014","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It isn't very dialogue heavy but the storyline is more than sufficient, and although it is essentially linear, it cleverly gives the illusion of not being so.  It is longer than you might expect, and tracks the story of a young boy  on his journey to save his father.  It's fairly generic, but the style of the game is rather unique, so this is easily forgiven.\n\nBe careful- you might read elsewhere online that you can get achievements after you complete the game by continuing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shane_o_mac/recommended/259550/","shane_o_mac","Shane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shane_o_mac/","466 products in account","Hero of the Kingdom is a game, I'd probably describe as a light, casual point’n’click-hidden-object-RPG-adventure, which happens to be surprisingly addicting.\n\nIt's basically a simple game, in which you click on certain hotspots on the map to interact with your environment (for example shopkeepers to buy or sell items, a camp to restore some stamina or quest-npcs to start or finish the main- or one of several sidequests) and move yourself through about 25 screens of a nice-looking medieval world, advancing in a (shallow and not really innovative) story of a boy from a farm saving his father and becoming a hero at the end.\nWhile you basically always do the same thing (just click on things), the objectives you have to fulfill are actually pretty diverse. Sometimes you have to kill stuff (animals, villians), find things hidden-object-style (eggs, mushrooms, sheep) or collect (and/or buy) the right resources to build buildings or equip an army. There are even some professions to master (fishing, herbalism).\n\nStill these things are so simple, that literally anyone could succeed to finish the game in a reasonable time. Optionally you can also try to collect all 38 achievements, which include finding a big portion of all hidden-object items.\n\nUnfortunately, even if you try to 100% the game, it only takes about 3-4 hours to do so. But that might even be a good thing, because otherwise the simple gameplay could get boring and repetetive after some time.\nAlso you have to know, what you’re getting with this game. If you’re expecting a much deeper, complex game, the game will most likely disappoint you. But fortunately there is a demo available to test the game and see if it is for you.\n\nOverall, I think, this is an awesome game, that can be fun for ANYONE: Casual players as well as actual ‘gamers’, who don’t mind simple gameplay and a shallow story, can enjoy an addicting medieval adventure with a decent atmosphere. Granted: The game might be short, but the price isn’t to high (6$), especially on sale. I encourage everyone to give this one a try (at least the demo)!\n\nOn a scale from 1 to 10 I’d give this one an 8.","January 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/259550/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Hero of the Kingdom is a hybrid between an RPG and a casual resource-management game. From the outlook, you may think it's like an old-school RTS, like I did. Reminds me of Stronghold.\nOnce you go into it, you'll realize that it's nothing of the sort.\n\nBasically, you travel around the land, buying, gathering and selling supplies, so that you can progress, by doing quests. It's... surprisingly compelling. On paper, I'd say this game wouldn't work! After trying it, though, it managed to keep me playing to completion.\n\nThere's an overarching story, but it's very cliché. It did nothing whatsoever to invest me, as there weren't any great characters or situations. It was just there.\n\nPresentation\nAs I said, it looks a bit old. However, I really like this graphic style. I love the way the how old RTS games looked, and this is basically an higher resolution version of that. The iconography in the game felt a bit out of place, at times, but it identifies everything well enough, so I won't complain.\nOther than that, the interface has a medieval feeling (especially the frames and the map) that fits the feeling of the game.\n\nThe sound-effects were a bit too sparkly for me. They didn't fit the rest of the game, being more suited for a children's game, with a cartoony look. Regardless, they're otherwise functional.\nThe music is open, I believe, but it was well chosen. There isn't much to say about it. It's pretty simple, fantasy-like background music, but it did its job of getting you into the game's atmosphere.\n\n\nThere were a few interface issues I've had, but I've later found out that most of them could have been avoided, with a bit more explanation. Basically, everything requires 2 clicks -- always. First, you click the objective or object you want to collect, and then there's some feedback, and a box appears with a "V" for you to click, to continue. This last step, in my opinion, was completely unnecessary. Also, the box appears in the object's place, so you'll often have to "backtrack" with the mouse, if you were ready to leave the screen, or something.\nThis is avoided by pressing SpaceBar when the box appears. That way, you can just press it and the box will go away, so it partially solves the problem -- this, however, was never hinted at, in the game.\n\nOverall, there are just lots of unnecessary clicks, in a game that's all about clicking. I believe that the visual and audio feedback was sufficient, but I may be wrong.\n\nStory and Writing\nAs I've mentioned, the story is completely cliché. Your farm burns, and you go on a quest to save your father and be an hero. Then, you find that there's a bigger evil on the world, and you want to eliminate it. That's about it.\nThere's isn't any real idea to be trasmitted by it, no interesting characters, nothing whatsoever. Bottom-line: don't play it for a story.\n\nThe writing also felt very amateur, in general. The game just feels like it could be written by a middle-schooler. It's not awful, but there's nothing, at any point, that will surprise you or even amuse you. The phrasing is very simple, with not character having any personality... Meh. You can easily skip it and you won't miss anything.\n\nStructure & Mechanics\nIt's hard to separate this from the mechanics. This game is a glorified spreadsheet, and it's almost all structure, and no mechanics.\n\nBasically, you have a character whose main attribute is stamina. You lose stamina with every meaningful action, and you'll have to sleep on a camp to recover it. There are many camps spread around the map, requiring different resources for you to use them. Some are town inns, which require money, others will simply require different types of food.\n\nThen, you'll also visit several towns that specialize in different things. There's alchemy, fishing, hunting, etc. Each requires different tools, which the townsfolk sell you. In those towns, there are also side-quests, that give you money, honor, and resources.\nHonor is basically used for you to unlock certain quests, that require you to be more trust-worthy.\n\nDespite the existence of several different occupations, they're all the same. Once you have a tool and skill (that you get from a quest), the maps will now have a new icon over the resource that you can gather. Then, you click it and there you go.\nThere's no crafting per se. There are some vendors that give you a potions for herbs though, for example.\n\nEach action will require tools/resources, and stamina. Some of them also require Hunters, Repair-men, Soldiers, etc. You can buy these (as if mercenary) to help you.\n\nAs you can tell, the whole game is about getting resource X and either selling or trading it for resource Y, so that you can do the next quest.\n\nHidden-objects Component\nIn every map, there are items spread around, but that are very small and often blend with the background. These are mostly optional, but they can also be useful. These include Mushrooms, Eggs, Lost Crates, etc. These won't be unlocked from the start, you'll unlock them progressively, when following the main quest.\n\nMap\nThe maps tells you nothing useful, but let's you fast travel to every location. So, instead of having to waste 2 minutes and 15 clicks, you'll waste 10 seconds and 2 clicks.\nThis is fine, and I think it helps the game substancially. However, it could have been much better. Has different areas have different vendors and quests, it would have been useful to have those marked on the map. Perhaps a little quest description and the person who gave it to you, the main vendors, etc. You can very easily get lost, since you take to memorize everything.\n\n\nCumbersome systems\nEverytime you gather a resource, hunt, etc. you'll lose stamina, and also have a chance to break your tools. If that happens, you'll have to go buy another. Eventually, I just bought every tool twice to avoid backtracking. However, it's very cumbersome, in general. Especially with the later tasks, everything may cost up to half of your stamina. So, you'll travel, do 2 minor things, and have to go back and get more stamina.\nI think it's mostly unnecessary, how you constantly have to go back and forward...\n\nIt never lets go of your hand -- Too Linear\nThe tutorial is very typical of mobile games. You have to click this very specific icon, or else you can't advance. This goes on for a while. While the game opens up a bit, it's also holding you hand.\nIf I had focused only on the story line, it would have bored me to death, probably. It's like the game tells you its story through instructions. "Do this. Now, do that. Good, now get that to achieve this! No, no that-- this! Here! This shiny button!" ... It's very, very restrictive. The sidequests help a bit.\nRegardless, it's never an adventure of your own.\n\nProgress and Achievements\nThis is the trick about this game. There's an achievement for every meaningless task. It's annoying and patronizing. However, it's one of those psychological tricks that keeps you invested. Everything feels like progress. Also, every field will disappear after being gathered "x" times, so there will come a point when you've literally completed the game. And I think that's the strangely compelling thing about this game!\nIt keeps you going for far longer than I'd have guessed. The game has nothing interesting about it, but it still grabs your attention, for those 3 hours!\n\nI would not recommend this game, in most circumstances. It's very bland, and has nothing interesting about it. However, it's still compelling. Besides, it provides a good formula. If you can integrate a good story, and some mechanics into it, perhaps a great game can be made!\n\nPlease, be very aware of what you're getting into. For what it is, it's good!","January 29, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although it wasn't mentioned in the tags it kinda fits that genre very well. So if you don't like clicking don't get the game and save yourself from posting a rant.\n\nThe story starts with the life of a boy living a peaceful life in their farm. But, things starts to get chaotic when your father went missing and your house being burned down to nothing leaving you homeless. Now the boy must embark on a journey to find his missing father and find out the cause of the attack. You will be meeting different people from small villages along the way and experience the life of a traveler as you earn fame and make a name for yourself.\n\nMy thoughtsThe game is overall fun. It is mainly about resources management and will make yourself analyzing and thinking but not to the point of frustration. There will be plenty of items in-game:this includes item such as food, weapons, crafting materials, and more. Acquiring items are earned by either completing tasks given by the NPCs or bartering with merchants. This works by giving a certain item from your inventory in-exchange of another of the same value. Ofcourse, the game also has a currency which will be a necessity later on.\n\nThere's nothing much to say about the game except for the fact that if you're not into too much action and just want to sit down and play relaxing game yet entertaining then, you should give this a try.\n\n--- This paragraph might contains minor spoilers. But, I'll put it here anyway for people who wants to know what to expect from the game. ---\nThe game starts with a realistic story of a young boy as stated above. But, things get weird when you suddenly need help of mages from the guild who *obviously* can use magic. You'll start getting items that is related to alchemy too and you will have to fight fantasy-ish creature not much like at the beginning where you only fend off wolves.\n\nNow this may come a surprise to some people but it can be either looked at as positive and negative. I was expecting the game to be realistic until the end when the boy matures enough. Instead, it turned out that the entire plot of the story revolves around a certain wizard and it gets cliche from then on.\n--- End of potential spoiler paragraph ---\n\nRatingGameplay: ★★★★☆\nGraphics: ★★★☆☆\nStory: ★★☆☆☆\nSounds: ★★★★☆\nAverage: ★★★☆☆","March 31, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's mostly a point & click adventure with some RPG-like quests and trading built in. I appreciated what depth it did have without having something convoluted or difficult built in just to try to extend the playtime. The story is not complex, and it's fairly typical of this type of game, but it provided enough to give a feel of progression. I completed the game in one sitting as I was completely immersed in it.\n\nI'm a big fan of this style of graphics. It has an older Ages of Empires or Stronghold feel to it. I enjoyed going between each area and completing quests just to see what all I'd see. The audio/music complemented the game well. It was just enough to make it enjoyable without being overbearing or out of place.\n\nThere is some backtracking to be done depending on what the quests require. Not everything is available the first time you visit a zone. The only annoying thing was the "Gather XX of Something" achievements. It just made it a grind and somewhat annoying, especially the eggs. It was like an Easter egg hunt without the color. Even so, I managed to complete the main quest and all of the other achievements within 7 hours.\n\nThe $5.99 price tag may be questionable for some.

It's one of my loved genre, but there isn't much games focused on that.\n- More and more things interactable on maps as you progress.\n- Lots of bonus loots hidden everywhere, for extra coins.\n- Map interface allowing you to travel anywhere you've been. It's helpful as you'll be travelling everywhere.\n\nThe Bad :\n- Remember, this is NO RPG or STRATEGY. All about handling resources and clicking tiny hidden things.\n- One playthrough's enough for all achievement. 3 hours for me to get them all.\n- Management gets too easy once you found out a way to make money.\n- You never know when you don't need tools anymore(Resource nodes will decay in one or two gathers, and are limited. But don't worry that you can BUY resources from NPCs)\n- Interaction effects. I'd really love to skip them.\n- Bulk purchase option needed. It's tiresome to click hundred times when shopping.\n\n6/10, Well worth the price, but not too great.

In addition to the obvious activity bubbles, there are also unmarked collectibles hidden throughout the world. These items for the most part are just another source of income but some also are part of crafting recipes. Everything is as simple as point and click, but rather than being boring it helps to keep the game from overstaying its welcome. The art and sound design is nearly flawless, with my only gripe being a strange soundtrack switch that happens occasionally when navigating through sections of the world and anything faster than a leisurely stroll.\nThe “campaign” in its entirety will only set you back a few hours, but I think it is well worth it for how much detail and care went into this game.","December 4, 2014","true","7.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I bought it at a good sale price, the single screenshot I saw looked nice, and I don't like to spoil myself with trailers or large numbers of screenshots going into a game. I was immediately put off, thinking that it was going to be an extremely boring hand-holding hidden object adventure. I'm not fond of hidden object games in general, and I hadn't really been expecting to play one when I started.\n\nI wasn't actually wrong in my initial impression--Hero of the Kingdom is a really user-friendly point and click adventure with hidden object elements. The thing about this game, though, is that it is the best casual point and click adventure. The game is beautiful, the music is both relaxing and adventurous (and a true pleasure to listen to), and the sound effects feel crisp and fit just right. Tons of polish all around, and you can tell that there was a lot of love put into making this game.\n\nDon't go in expecting to find a particularly detailed story, but what is there is enjoyable as well. Again, very simple, but it feels right. This is a game you can enjoy in small pieces, or devour all at once for a relaxing evening. Sometimes it's nice to play something simple and pleasant.\n\nAlso, the main character solving a lot of problems by being a pretty decent carpenter was oddly refreshing. It's a skill that doesn't really get a lot of serious recognition even in crafting types of games, and it's handled so reasonably and practically within the confines of the story that I couldn't help but smile at moments like finishing construction of the water mill.","January 3, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

To call it an RPG makes the original final fantasy look like morrowind.  It is basically one long trading quest, with a couple of little side trading quests.\n-It is not challenging at all.  I'm not sure if it is even possible to lose.  Maybe, if you were really incompetant you could squander all your resources.  Otherwise there is no tension, you will go into the final battle knowing you will win.\n-Randomly clicking all over the screen is a legitimate strategy.\n-The story is absolutely forgettable and generic fantasy,  House burns down, chase after bandits, help villagers, rescue family, defeat big evil.\n-Graphics are ok for a cow clicker, but there is no way you are going to be engrossed in the "battles"\n-It is very short.\n\nBeat it in one sitting.  Did I hate it? No.  Will I ever play it again? No.  I get the feeling this game is supposed to be padded out with "freemium" pay to play mechanics.\nThere simply isn't a lot of game here, and I can't reccomend it outside of it being heavily discounted.\n","March 21, 2015","false","3.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Good game for easy achievments, bad game if you pay more than 2 bucks.\n\nHero of the Kingdom is a point and click adventure mixed with a resource manager. You travel through different overview screens, visiting villages, mountains, forests and so on. On your way, you pick up items either by clicking (said "Search those 5 pixels"-moments) or by buying/trading/questing at NPCs. The more you progress, the more resources you have. For example you need Energy to fight (a boar or wolf costs X energy), which you replenish by sleeping. You can sleep when you pay gold at inns or in the wild, if you have enough food on you (different camping sites ask for different kinds of food). You can also carry items, which hold longer (Weapons and tools, though they might break sometimes)\nSadly, the system is kinda broken after a while for those, who notice how to milk endless gold out of the resource cycle. Maybe a patch would help here?\n\nThe artwork is pretty good, I expect the designer to give us a full course of his abilities in the future. Everything looks very detailed and alive and every screen carries a different kind of atmosphere with it The background music is nothing outstanding, but it doesnt kill the atmosphere either. "Generic" comes to my mind here.\n\nStill, seeing as this is an endless orgy of clicking and searching I can not recommend it at its current price of 6 Euro. Maybe some mini-games and riddles would have helped to add simply MORE CONTENT to this game. In the end I just played it to gather all achievments, having absolutely no interest for an ending (and there is only one. Why not make different endings, depending on how you choose to solve quests and stuff? A simple BAD Ending would even give more depth...)","March 7, 2014","false","5.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/recommended/259550/","PresidentSkele","Green Skeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/","1181 products in account","This is an RPG for people that hate RPGs (unless your favorite part of RPGs is clicking icons, then stop reading right now and go play this). In fact I'd go so far as to say that it absolutely isn't an RPG as it doesn't have any hallmarks of the genre, yet, the Steam store tags it as one. Let's run down what it lacks:\n\nIt doesn't have a levelling system and at no point do you ever need to grind against monsters to level up, you don't customize your character in any meaningful way and you certainly don't make any worthwhile choices. The story - which is usually the saving grace of WRPGs with the most of mediocre of gameplay - is incredibly generic. It has your blank slate character on an adventure to save your kidnapped father. (With the sequel being about you rescuing your kidnapped sister. At least familial disappearances is a running theme in this series.)\n\nOh you want more? Well there isn't any. The game lacks any kind of lore and what little you can get come from side quests that don't exactly help fill out this generic fantasy world in your head. For being a farmer that lives out in the middle of nowhere, you for some reason live really close to a whole kingdom.\n\nEven at a base level of writing, this game sucks, with such quality lines as "Now I know the weapon for the undead so I can kill them." or "Be glorious our hero!". With, ahem, *quality* like that and the main villain being known as the Dark Lord of all things, this must have killer gameplay at least, right?\n\nWell... have you ever played I,Spy or any of those other hidden object games floating around on Steam? Then you'll be quite familiar with what you'll be doing. At the outset, you sort of feel like you are going on adventure - at first - but that feeling comes crashing down once you realise you're on quite the linear track with very little in the way of divergence as you try to find the little pixels on the map to click and then add to your unlimited inventory - you realise then you're playing Busywork: The Game, cause you get the run around from Point A to Point B, clicking the golden exclamation points to add another list of quests you have to do, collecting enough of Object 1 or 2, then either sell them to buy Object 3 or bring 20 of them to another quest giver with the biggest penalty you'll ever have is your stamina/hearts, which you lose everytime you do something strenuous and you gain back by resting - but not even resting works the right way, because as long as you have enough food items at the designated camps, you can regain as many hearts as you want, never truly having to rest again.\n\nWhile on this ever important quest to rescue your father, at certain points you're just fishing, collecting mushrooms and hunting animals just to make ends meet - but it never feels like you're actually accomplishing these tasks as everything feels predetermined - and that's because it is, as the only thing you have to do is bring the listed required items to wherever to progress further, and outside of selling items, you never feel like you're in control of your own destiny.\n\nI don't know what else to say - you click, read some banal writing, click again, then read more bad writing. That's it. It's not even a management game like you would hope despite playing a farmer - you never really farm or even try to fix your farm house to then farm some vegetables or something. Just having a seed and crop system where you need to water them everyday would add so much. Hell, I'd take a mini game or a QTE at this point, anything that could cause me to fail, because this game is truly lacking consequences for your actions.\n\nTo all you people that complain about time limits, NPC babysitting, or any myriad of other things you whine about, well here's your alternative.\n\nThe Pro's\n+The graphics and music are relaxing\n\n+Clicking icons never feels broken\nThe Con's\n-Gameplay? What's that?\n\n-Atrocious writing that borders on hilarity\n\n-Not an RPG/False advertising\n\n-Very short even if you did enjoy it\n(Why does this crap have so many positive reviews again?)","August 3, 2015","false","3.5"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

There's a resource management aspect to the game (not hard to manage) and a series of "mini fetch quests" for the most part, again fairly easy.\n\nYou would think a game littered with "easy fetch this and fetch that" would be boring/tediuos.  This game has managed to strike a nice balance.  Just when it starts to get tedious the game ends.\n\nBuy it on sale.  One play through is about 6 hours.  There's no replayability.\n","January 9, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a fun, relaxing, "find and manage the resources" game where you can't die and can't dig yourself into a hole too deep to keep you from winning.  It took me about 7 hours to complete it with all Achievements.  At it's current $1.74 price, absolutely, definitely buy it.  Even at it's full list price of $6.99, it's pretty close to being worth it.

Even though it isn't a turn based game it has that "one more turn" feel to it as you progress through the game's lovely story. It isn't a long title, and there isn't a tremendous amount of replay value, but it is definitely worth a play through at least once.\n\nThe game is a point-and-click adventure that follows the story of a farm boy on what starts as a rescue mission and ends as a world saving quest. Through the entire thing you'll gather resources, hunt, fight and trade, all with simple mouse clicks. There are no mini-games to complete for any of the activities, and the game play is simplistic overall. That said, it is still enjoyable.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick, narrative-based game. Hero of the Kingdom gets the job done.","January 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After a precise moment, you wont need anything anymore, and the game becomes really easy.\nFor example, the food, passed a certain point becomes totally useless because you're just going to use gold instead of food to go to sleep.\n\nI personally finished the game in two hours but I still enjoyed it.

The player begins as a farmboy and goes on an adventure by essentially completing errands by interacting with various hotspots on a beautifully drawn map.  More screens are unlocked as one progresses through the story.  In addition to the main story, there are various hidden objects such as mushrooms or lost crates scattered throughout the game world.  These objects blend in well enough that they are not all immediately spotted, but if you should choose to find them all, it's by no means a pixel hunt.\n\nSomeone looking for an extremely non-challenging and casual gaming experience may enjoy this title.  In fact, I somewhat enjoyed it as something to do while watching television.\n\nHowever, I am unable to recommend this game because of its incredibly short length.  I was able to 100% the game in about four hours. Most of those four hours were spent backtracking.  For instance, while fishing, you may run out of energy.  You must then backtrack to the inn to rest.  You then return to the lake to continue fishing, and you run out of bait.  You must then backtrack to purchase more bait.  And then your rod breaks.  You get the idea.\n\nIn short, Hero of the Kingdom is not all bad by any means.  It's a decent little game that looks and sounds good, even if it is simplistic.  However, the writing is not so hot.  Unless you are absolutely in love with the genre, there's almost certainly better and more fulfilling ways of spending your time.","December 27, 2014","false","7.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Hero of the Kingdom is a point and click/resource gathering kind of game.  I gave it a thumbs down because you really aren't missing anything here. The highest positive review is out of his mind -  Amazing story? it's a real simple story at best, find your father and defeat evil wizard.  Amazing music? it's a midi track that gets repeated over and over, I turned down the volume and listended to my own music.  The biggest con is the game is almost completely linear until maybe halfway through where you can start doing random quests.  Gold farming was kind of annoying.  The game is short, but if you're an achievement hunter it might take you an extra hour or so to find the hidden items like myself.  If you're on the fence about this game, I say skip it. 5/10","January 9, 2015","false","7.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

In the tutorial the game asks you to chop down some trees with your axe to obtain wooden planks – standard stuff. But after that, the only option to get them is to BUY them – despite travelling through large forests.\n\nThe gold/inventory management is also an illusion, because you always have just enough total money to buy some required items and proceed. Even when you join the army, you have to buy your own weapons and armour. This is a capitalist's wet dream.\n\nYou basically click through the whole game and you can't deviate from the current objective or you'll get stuck with not enough money and no way to earn more (not that the game gives you such freedom anyway).\n\nIt's all just incredibly lazy.

It has a loose story but finding new items to gather or fight keeps this game interesting to close to the end of the game. The fights are about finding items to beat them. The game mechanic is basicly clicking to gather things while removing hearts that you need to sleep to restore.  There is a point where money may seem like you need to grind to continue. I would advise looking at the guides for getting money faster as its not very fun to grind in.

The gameplay wasn't at all what I was expecting, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  This turned out to be one of my favorite casual games in years.  The gameplay consists mostly of resource trading in the guise of quests, along with a very enjoyable hidden object aspect.  Both are really well executed, too.\n\n-Very relaxing to play\n-Outstanding music\n-Despite having no real challenge to overcome, completing quests and finding things somehow gives just as much a sense of accomplishment as it does in a full fledged RPG\n-100% frustration-free without feeling like it's holding your hand (at least after you finish the tutorial scenes)\n-The hidden object aspect is really well done.

This one though is fully in 2d, which I personally like a lot, cause it still manages to deliver more slick, more detailed and thin-lined drawings, opposed to 3d muddying of features caused by texture requirements and antialiasing. I'd argue that 3d engines still aren't capable of producing such fine lines as simple and clear as 2d drawing/sprite and this game uses that fact to the full effect. The visual presentation is, again, clear, colorful and full of small details.\nSo far I'd played for some 2 or 3 hours (ignore the Steam stats, I don't understand why it didn't record the last session) in one sitting and the experience was delightful, the flow of quests and tasks slick and satisfying and gameplay varied enough to still feel interesting, though in the beginning you solely click on few points on screen and manage few basic stats like food and building materials. Slowly you get involved with you character, though his actions aren't described in much verbouse prose, but later when he manageas to learn few skills and has some successful quests uder his belt you do start to care and do notice when he starts calling some officer HIS captain, since he recently enlisted in land's military. The progres from a naive farmboy to adventurer to ultimate hero is a familiar tale, but it's nicely done and somewhat beliveably depicted - in slow careful stages. In this case journey is more satisfying than the end and slow exploring of map, solving quests and "leveling up" (though the only stat connected to that is reputation) makes a nice calm romp.\nSo my overal oppinion is that it's competent and surprizingly fun casual P&C adventure. It has earned my recommendation fair and square, the same way as the annonymous hero will earn to be the Hero of his Kingdom.","October 3, 2014","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact it is extremely linear with very few options in terms of how you complete a quest only exacerbates matters. Either you harvest certain supplies you need, or outright buy them. I expect a certain simplicity with casual games like this, but this seemed to be a bit much in that regard. The story is very minimalistic with writing on par with a young children's story--just enough to make a point. It has very pleasing visuals and sound and the game length felt just about right from a completionist viewpoint.\n\nThat said, this is a game that would be delightful to play with children. The simple story, hidden-object elements, and resource management just feel like it targets more of a family video-game night and I am reminded of old adventure classics like Mixed Up Mother Goose I would play with my parents and friends when I was young.\n\nOther players looking for a light, relaxing gaming experience can just sit down and enjoy the story without any pressures or puzzling to do however, players wanting a game that provides a more thoughtful experience may end up disappointed.\n\n","February 27, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a very casual and relaxing game, albeit a repetitive one.  I got it for less than two dollars on sale, and to be honest, I wouldn't pay more than that.  There are a couple mechanics the game never properly explains to you, such as finding eggs, mushrooms, crates, and the like.  (You have to click on the tiny little pictures you see on the map; they don't have icons like almost everything else.)  On top of that, a game this simple could have benefited from a marginally more unique story.  I'm not saying you have to construct an epic tale, or anything, but man, you could have attempted SOME sort of a unique plot twist.  I mean, I guess there was one, kind of, but it was the sort of thing you've probably seen a million times before.\n\nOne of my biggest problems in this game was how hard it is to make money.  One of the hints I was given at some point consisted of doing tasks for people, which would have been all well and good, if it weren't for the fact that pretty much every single task required some sort of payment up front.  Occasionally, you'll get a somewhat sizable-seeming sum, but since everything is so expensive, it'll probably be gone very quickly.  Eventually, I ended up trying to gather and sell all the herbs and fish I could, but none of that stuff ever respawns, as it turns out; once you gather all the herbs and fish at all the fishing spots, it's gone forever.  So if you need that stuff later, as I did, you'll be buying them from the store.\n\nWhen I say I recommend this game, bear in mind that I only recommend it if you can get it for two bucks or less.  This is one of those "I have less than five bucks left in my Steam wallet, what do I do with it?" sort of game, not the kind of thing you should go out of your way to buy.","December 29, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a basic point and click RPG whereas you're a Farmer's son asked to look after the farm while he leaves to take care of business.  Of course tragedy occurs after a day, or so of your Father leaving the farm. You are forced to travel out into a strange and unfamiliar world with your simple farming equipment to help you along your way to Heroism.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is simply where to find what, or how to get what in the game and the balancing of money vs. resources. If you need a specific resource and don't have enough tools to farm it, you can buy it for a price naturally. *hint* the resources of this game is limited, so don't sell it all off if you don't need to.

When looking at the screen shots I got the impression this was going to be a medieval RTS similar to Strongholds, but more casual. I was wrong, but it turned out to be a good thing.\n\nHero of the Kingdom is a click your own adventure game. You start out as a never described boy that must make his way through an epic journey to save his father and ultimately the entire kingdom. You play within a static background and must click on various elements to get loot and proceed to other static screens. There are lite crafting elements. You get herbs and wheat and must turn these into goods for profit or to further the story. The quests are not linear. Yes there are some story quests you must complete to proceed, but not all the quests are that way. In terms of quests I would say there are roughly 20 to 30. I would say the average gamer would beat this in 4 hours, but total play time should not exceed 6.\n\nThe story is mediocre, the writing is actually kind of silly, (reads like it was written by a teenager) the amount of clicking is ridiculous, there's no challenge to the game, there's even a hint button that will literally tell you exactly what to do to proceed. Honestly, this game is well suited for young teens and children more so than adults. However, there was just enough fun from all the clicking, crafting, and reading that I didn't mind finishing the game. Actually, I finished the game, realized I hadn't got all the achievements and played it all over again!\n\nBottom line: This game is not for adults, but it's fun enough to keep you playing till the end.

Unfortunately, the story is very short, and grinding around for stuff to do kinda gets repetitive, for that, you can progress through the game however you want. Hunt, gather, fish, and craft potions, trade them around, or sell them for money, complete small quest and you're done. It's true that it could have been more, it even looks like it could have been more. The map screen is large and it unlocks as you visit each area for the first time. However, I initially though it's going to be completely uncovered, but it's not. Still, if you're not using the helpful quick travel and instead try to backtrack area by area, you might get confused at first. The graphics are pretty, there is no animation, but it still looks great and nostalgic. The soundtrack is okay, I guess, although I wish it wasn't just that one song the entire time, accompanied by sounds of cows, goats, dogs, birds, bears, wolves, and other "ambients" over and over again. But you can turn the volume down whenever you wish, fortunately. If more than anything, this game made me nostalgic and opened an appetite for older RPGs.

Hero of the Kingdom has a very linear story; You play as the only child of a farmer who goes to town, leaving you to look after the farm. You go about performing various tasks and learning the basics of the game. There is no real challange to the game, you cannot die, but you require sleep in order to perform tasks, and some tasks are more tedious than others.\n\nAs you progress you'll discover skills, these skills allow you to find things that are scattered throughout each of the areas. Maxing the skills allows you to complete a moderate amount of the challanges presented and also allow you to complete the game quicker.\n\nThis is an easy 100%  achievment get. Though it is can take up a lot of time as some of the objects are cleverly hidden.\n\nAt the end of the day I would definitly recomend this game to those looking to take a break from the norm, particularly at a sale price.","November 28, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For anyone on the fence about it, just give the demo a try.\n\nMy only complaints were: 1. The handholding going on in the beginning and a lack of freedom that went with that. 2. Once you open things up it's hard to keep track of what all you're doing. There's no journal or anything like that. 3. The hint option is what is offered to make up for that. You're essentially offered a Cheat at Any Time button and it's the only way of reminding yourself, for instance, where to go on the map to find the one merchant you need for an objective\n\nIt's a simple game and lacks features found in bigger offerings, but that does not take away from it being good at what it does have.

It was extremely relaxing. This is one of those games where you can lay in bed and play with just the mouse. Sure it's a point and click story bookish game, but combined with the cute but immersive graphics, sound effects, music, and dialogue, it successfully pulls the player into its world. Sure the plot was quite predictable but it was quite satisfying as a result. The art was beautifully done, emulating more classical 8-16 bit graphics. I beat the game in two days, however on the second day I couldn't wait to finish school to rush home and continue the story, I just couldn't put this title down until it was finished. It also had quite a unique battle system, if you can call it that... For what this game is, 9/10 from me.\n\nCons:\n-No replay-ability.\n-The end game was a tiny bit monotonous but it's a small inconvenience.\n-Easter egg hunting tiny objects for side-quests is annoying.\n-Lots of back tracking... and memorization...","October 1, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a basic point and click RPG whereas you're a Farmer's son asked to look after the farm while he leaves to take care of business.  Of course tragedy occurs after a day, or so of your Father leaving the farm. You are forced to travel out into a strange and unfamiliar world with your simple farming equipment to help you along your way to Heroism.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is simply where to find what, or how to get what in the game and the balancing of money vs. resources. If you need a specific resource and don't have enough tools to farm it, you can buy it for a price naturally. *hint* the resources of this game is limited, so don't sell it all off if you don't need to. I've made a complete game walkthrough with 100% achievement, i'll post the link once I am finished rendering and uploading that series.\n\nMy two only complaints: Quest list & Vitality Restoration Process\nQuest list: There is none, you either have to remember what you have to do, or do one task at a time.\n\nVitality Restoration: Takes a long time with no way of skipping the, "scene," you'll hear me say skip to the next video with ~10minutes left because all I was doing was restoring my vitality.(no vit bar btw, so people can abuse that just fyi if a dev comes along and reads this)","July 21, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact it is extremely linear with very few options in terms of how you complete a quest only exacerbates matters. Either you harvest certain supplies you need, or outright buy them. I expect a certain simplicity with casual games like this, but this seemed to be a bit much in that regard. The story is very minimalistic with writing on par with a young children's story--just enough to make a point. It has very pleasing visuals and sound and the game length felt just about right from a completionist viewpoint.\n\nThat said, this is a game that would be delightful to play with children. The simple story, hidden-object elements, and resource management just feel like it targets more of a family video-game night and I am reminded of old adventure classics like Mixed Up Mother Goose I would play with my parents and friends when I was young.\n\nOther players looking for a light, relaxing gaming experience can just sit down and enjoy the story without any pressures or puzzling to do however, players wanting a game that provides a more thoughtful experience may end up disappointed.\n\n","February 27, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But at the mid-game, once you join the army, the game starts to get repetitive, consisting of nothing more than farming and exploiting existing chains, rather than actually discovering anything new. I'd have liked to see more side-missions, the ones that aren't always marked on the map and which require hidden-object skills, or to have had more complex trading objectives that required you to make better use of the map.

There is something very minimalist about the user interface and moving about the world that I quickly found rather appealing, though. The game is very well balanced in how you gain new skills, the things you can find, the quests you can solve, and though not strictly speaking linear, there is a rough order in which things need to be done.\n\nThere was something refreshing in how you move through the world not as a fully-fleshed 3D or even 2D character, but by clicking on the buildings, people and items you wish to interact with, clicking on direction arrows on the edges of an area to move instantly to the next one. For adventure games requiring a bit of walking back and forth, and strange as it was to start with, this makes it less boring as many other games as there is no transit time to speak of to get around.\n\nIt makes for a nice game in between other more time-consuming games. With a playthrough time of 3-4 hours if you wish to do everything you can, find all you can, craft all you can, hunt all you can - not strictly speaking necessary, but there is something satisfying about making as much money as possible too.\n\nThe story is fine, the hidden-object aspect of the game for finding treasure, mushrooms, eggs, etc is nicely done, and even the unconventional combat system, if you can call it that, where you gather the resources you need to win a given battle and return to the location of it with the weapons, manpower and potions needed to overcome the enemy is an interesting and refreshing twist on what you'd expect to see in a game like this.\n\nI think I bought this very cheaply in a bundle, but even at its regular price, I'd still feel I got a few hours of entertaining gameplay's worth for my money, and cheaper than spending a similar time in the cinema, which is how I often calculate entertainment value when it comes to computer games.","April 4, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And that's basically what you do: Gather resources. You go picking some mushrooms, hunting some animals, getting stuff for people, trading and so on. There's really not much you can do wrong so the gameplay is much about how to optimize your resources. Even combat is a question about having the right resources (e.g. 2 bowmen and 4 healing potions). So if you have the resources you can fight (and win) and if you haven't got the resources you can't attack until you've got them. It's pretty simple and that's actually some of the appeal of this game.\n\nI'm not a power player but I like to hunt for achievements.\nIt took me 3,5 hours to complete the game with all the achievements.

This is a very casual and relaxing game, albeit a repetitive one.  I got it for less than two dollars on sale, and to be honest, I wouldn't pay more than that.  There are a couple mechanics the game never properly explains to you, such as finding eggs, mushrooms, crates, and the like.  (You have to click on the tiny little pictures you see on the map; they don't have icons like almost everything else.)  On top of that, a game this simple could have benefited from a marginally more unique story.  I'm not saying you have to construct an epic tale, or anything, but man, you could have attempted SOME sort of a unique plot twist.  I mean, I guess there was one, kind of, but it was the sort of thing you've probably seen a million times before.\n\nOne of my biggest problems in this game was how hard it is to make money.  One of the hints I was given at some point consisted of doing tasks for people, which would have been all well and good, if it weren't for the fact that pretty much every single task required some sort of payment up front.  Occasionally, you'll get a somewhat sizable-seeming sum, but since everything is so expensive, it'll probably be gone very quickly.  Eventually, I ended up trying to gather and sell all the herbs and fish I could, but none of that stuff ever respawns, as it turns out; once you gather all the herbs and fish at all the fishing spots, it's gone forever.  So if you need that stuff later, as I did, you'll be buying them from the store.\n\nWhen I say I recommend this game, bear in mind that I only recommend it if you can get it for two bucks or less.  This is one of those "I have less than five bucks left in my Steam wallet, what do I do with it?" sort of game, not the kind of thing you should go out of your way to buy.","December 29, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a kind of puzzle/hidden object mix set out like an RPG.  You travel from area to area, accomplishing set objectives in order to progress through the story.  Often it's as simple as gather x number of this object, and then returning to the quest setter.  There is some grinding necessary but that's the case with many games.\n\nGetting all of the 38 achievements isn't too hard either.  However, this does require a real eagle eye for spotting the tiny objects on screen.  On my 1980 x 1080 setting monitor, I had to painstakingly search each map area carefully to find the objects, which can be tiny.\n\nOverall, not a bad game for the price.

You can then click on different map hotspots to exchange resources for other resources. This is sometimes puzzle-solving but much more often simply deciding which trade would be more valuable in the long run. I did say "map," and I meant it; you're looking at the Kingdom you are the Hero of from an altitude of a few hundred feet.\n\nThere's some combat, there are some choices of which path to pursue first, but overall the game is fairly linear and very simple. There's a kind of thin plot involving finding out what happened to your family, but it plays out very slowly. It feels like this was originally a mobile game, and seems especially suited to a touch screen ... though I wouldn't want to read this much text on a screen that size. (Also, there are irritating hidden objects, like mushrooms, scattered around, which are barely visible even on a full-size monitor.)\n\nAlthough it never actually happened to me, it certainly seems like it's possible to get stuck without the resources you need to continue and without any ability to accomplish anything. So there's an element of resource management. Otherwise, though, this is a decidedly mechanical point-and-click game, distinguished only by the UI's bird's-eye view.","May 5, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a loose story but finding new items to gather or fight keeps this game interesting to close to the end of the game. The fights are about finding items to beat them. The game mechanic is basicly clicking to gather things while removing hearts that you need to sleep to restore.  There is a point where money may seem like you need to grind to continue. I would advise looking at the guides for getting money faster as its not very fun to grind in. The rest of the game doesn't require much grinding but its sorta like a puzzle game to find missing items to continue.

I would characterize Hero of the Kingdom as a casual adventure game with some trading elements. There are no reflexes required, you simply need to click around the different maps to collect various items and turn them in to complete tasks. When you complete most tasks you beat the game. Overall you shouldn't expect to play this for more than a couple hours but it is a good use of time where you don't need to stress out. I found the story to be serviceable given the scale of the game.\n\nAll actions in the game are ultimately governed by its currency, which is gold. So if you want to do lots of things, such as stock up on supplies, get more hit points or hire more helpers, you need gold. This is where the trading part of the game comes in. There is only a finite number of resources you can gather before you run out, but you can manufacture more money by astutely trading the resources between various NPCs. I found this to be kind of interesting, but ultimately maybe not that constructive as the game actually gives you a good amount of money. I blame it on my RPG hoarding tendencies, but if you sell everything you gather (and you should! there are no missables!) you should only have to do a minimum of trade farming.\n\nLastly, many people play this game because it is easy to get 100% achievements. Not really my thing, but that could be a reason to play this game as well.","June 8, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't help you there)\n- Very pretty artwork and music.\n\nNegatives: - very short (only 4 hours long) and very simple, so the normal asking price is a bit steep for what you're getting.\n- Very detailed fine artwork on a very high resolution screen means a lot of very intense squinting at very small pictures.\n- Re-playability is minimal (the drop locations and quantities for the collectables vary from game to game, but that's it.

If you're looking for excitement or action, this is not the game for you. However, if you like casual point-and-click style games with a hidden object element and some minor resource management, this is a very satisfying little time waster. It's a bit akin to playing a facebook RPG except without having to wait for actions to refill.\n\nFor me, personally, I really enjoyed it. It satisfied my gamer OCD to see all the little actionable items slowly getting action'ed and fading from the screens, getting through the little checkpoints and "battles" without feeling rushed and thus being able to micromanage resources to their efficiency.\n\nConsidering this is considerably cheaper and lasted many times longer than, say, a comparable game from Big Fish, I highly recommend. Especially if you can pick it up on sale.\n\nAlso, about an hour of my total playtime was looking for the last f****** couple of mushrooms to get the related achievement.

I'm very eager to play the 2nd as I enjoyed this one very much and will be looking for future work from this developer.\n\nThis game does a good job of giving you instant gratification and making you want to play from start to finish in one go. It might take some a bit longer, especially if they're trying to go for all of the achievements or if they're trying to reveal the story to all of the side quests instead of just trying to complete the main story.

It's part point-and-click adventure, part interactive story (but effectively linear), part resource management, part "hidden items," part collection quest, _none_ of those genres i particularly care for. Nonetheless, i thoroughly enjoyed the casual, at-your-own-pace nature of this game, as well as the music, the interface (trivial to use), and theme. It's short - i played through it in a single sitting of (Steam says) just under 6  hours (didn't bother to go for 100% of achievements). Combat is unique in that in order to fight, you have to collect certain resources (one of which is fatigue (which is collected by resting)), at which point success is guaranteed. Will i play it again? i might. In terms of cost-per-hour it's already paid for itself, though, and there's nothing left to do in the game except go for the 100% achievements (but i'm not quite that OCD).

But that's true of Monkey Island and Minesweeper, and no one would call those clickers.\n\nNow that I've got that off of my chest, time for the real review. This game borrows heavily from 90's D&D-based CRPGs. It's got the same visual style, and the same sort of subquests, gathering, improving skills and back-and-forth.

Buy it on sale though as it won't take you very many hours to finish it and it's not very replayable.","January 31","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Surprisingly it was not the kind of game I expected but regardless turned out to be quite an enjoyable experience. The only sad part is that I didn't manage to get 100% of the 'collectables' in one playthrough so I have to play through it again to get it. That in itself is not so much a problem because it's still fun, but it doesn't offer any replay value in terms of experiencing a different adventure the 2nd time through.\n\nBasically, it's a point & click adventure in the literal sense that you will have to click.. a lot. The game is set up in a way that you could never fail it unless maybe you were deliberately trying to - and even then I question the possibility. For that matter it can be said that the game is somewhat of the easy nature. Really, the only real challenge in this game is getting 100% of the achievements / completion. The story is pretty straightforward and not really memorable but there are a lot of hidden 'secrets' and things to look out for which makes this a great game for those who are into exploration or putting their eyes and mind to the test.","January 30, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finish the last achievements, find some more mushrooms, sleep with meat a few more times, and trade until you have 5000 gold in total.\nBut, it's like finishing a pokemon game completely. Finding all the pokemon, and levelling them to the max. Restarting the game from scratch seems like a waste to the time it took, and the story/adventure won't change much.\n\nGraphic wise, it's quite good. Not too new of a graphics, but how all areas have small hidden things, like hidden pearls, and mushrooms in them (that you sometimes unlock by becoming a better herbalist) makes each area new, and abundant!\n\nThe story itself isn't too impressive. but it's fun, and not only can you quite often start doing side quests, and unlock special areas, you can also continue the story, and 2 screens further, another small bit of story is available, so almost all screens have a special story part. This means it's easily focussable on the next challenge, and you won't get lost in the quests and finding the solutions.\n\nGameplay: Gameplay in this game is what really drives the game itself forward. A lot of items that are clickable do not have an actually specific picture, like the trader, or a quest giver does. Sometimes, it's just a simple mushroom in the middle of a forest, that you can click. This means sometimes, boredly looking around actually rewards you. The actual movements aren't great, but it's kind of fun to see soldiers changing position, a few arrows all pointing towards a single enemy, and then moving on. Also, even though you're probably the same size as a normal npc in the game, the fact that you don't see yourself on screen kind of helps the immersion. YOU are the one that checks out the little clearing in the forest, to see if you can help save the lumberjack, and you are the one that decides to attack the boar. Strangely enough, if you would be a few pixels on the screen, you'd be too small to matter, but now, you really do.\n\nBasically, I recommend it. I think since it's not too high in replayability, it's probably better to wait for a sale, but there's no definitive need for it. It's just a fun little game, that you can enjoy, until you're completely done.","May 10","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Full price is not really a fair buy, as the game is really short (I got all the achievements) and has no replay value at all.\n\nIt is essentially a casual clicker game with some hidden object dimension in it (more below). You go on from map to map, gathering food, objects, speaking to uninteresting NPCs, and accomplishing some dull quests for them. Yet, the game is catchy, and you can finish it in a row as it keeps being entertaining. You cannot die nor make mistakes, it is pretty easy, but it's fun.\n\nTo make some more money (necessary for quests) you can grab some objects hidden on the maps, such as mushrooms, fishes, crevices, eggs, and you can hunt animals. Strangely enough, becoming the Hero of the Kingdom also means plundering it from all its natural resources. This hidden dimension is nice as the objects have not been put randomly: eggs can be found in the forest or on cliffs, mushrooms are found near the woods. Everything makes sense.\n\nThe story has no interest at all. They could hardly have done a less interesting one. Too bad as it would have make the game better.\n\nFinally, the late game is tedious. You have to fish everything and hunt every animals, so you need energy and you spend most of your time sleeping. Repetitive fights (where a fight means gathering enough potions trhgouh trade and then automatically resolve it for a guaranteed win) are just utterly boring. Without the pleasure of discovering new areas as all the bad guys are found in already visited places, it looses all interest.\n\n\nConclusion: A good game to buy on sale and spent a relaxing and entertaining yet too short time.","May 11","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't expect a challange, nor an unexpected plot. In fact the game is simple to play and the story the most classical ever... But, I don't know how, it turns out as an extremely enjoyable game.\nIt's relaxing and, more important, it gave you that fantasy feeling that you had as a child imagining adventures - before all the post-D&D fantasy garbage spiled the genre.","May 15","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thorigor/recommended/259550/","thorigor","Thor / Igor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thorigor/","199 products in account","Excellent little game! At first I was worried because of the way it took me by the hand during the first 5 minutes or so. But my worries dissipated after the game and quests opened up wide to allow some interesting decision-making. It was just the right level of challenge to complete all of the achievements. The story, although not very original or believable, is imersive and entertaining.\n\nI see people complaining about 2 things and I'd like to adress them.\n1 - "It's like a facebook game". People say that because of the energy system and kind of exploration + completing quests gameplay. Yes, the gameplay is really an interactive story with exploration, hidden objects, collection and trading, so be aware. On the other hand, it does not have those annoying time limits, inviting friends and premium currency. You don't even have to wait for your energy to be low to recharge it - there's no limit to how much energy you can carry so although it's not realistic, you can rest repeatedly and build up lots of energy to then do your actions. Also, this game has an END. It does not have seasonal events and added content. So I see a monstruous gap between this game and a facebook one, I love this game and hate the ones on facebook. Huge difference.\n\n2 - "The game is too short". For the people who say that, I recommend a youtube video called "in defense of short games", from the channel Extra Credits. They explain it a lot better than I could write here. But basically if people keep on judging games only by the lenght of the gameplay, we will get longer games that provides us a poorer experience. Everybody knows at least one TV series of movie franchise that got streched to the point it became so bad it was not worth watching. We need to end this way of thinking. The lenght was perfectly fine for me. I finished the game in 2 sittings of about 3 hous each, reading every dialogue line and getting all achievements before ending the game. Isn't that enough gameplay? There are too many other games out there I'd like to experience before getting stuck with a single game that provides "endless gameplay" or something.\n\nIf I had to complain about one thing in the game, would be the pace of the action resolution sequences. Everytime an item drops, I need to collect it before moving on. Everytime I choose to perform an action, I need to wait until it is done to do something else. I'd like to be able to do several actions at once, clicking the next one before the previous one is completed, then collect their rewards. Or at least click several actions and "queue" them. It would make the game more dynamic. Also, the nighttime sequence is too long for something that will be repeated several times during the game.\n\n9/10","May 15","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It\'s not Mass effect, it\'s not dragon age.  The video is pretty clear as to what it is.\n\nIt\'s a little tedious at points.  Money can be tricky and some of the clickables are hard to see.  There are some \'quality of life\' changes i\'d love to see (for example, a short cut to sell all of an item at once.  The ability to go \'oops, that\'s one item too many!\'... etc)\n\nbut generally?  This was a really fun little game to spend an evening with :)  Don\'t make any great expectations and you\'ll have a good time. :)\n\nI would also say that this game is kid friendly and might be a great game for your little ones.","June 1","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
