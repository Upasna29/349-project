The game's limited skillset has a couple of cooldowns and SP requirements. You are unable to obtain new skills, only upgrade the stats of your available skills.\n\nOther things to mention about the game:\n\nRepetitive gameplay: You will be fighting the same monsters, using the same actions with very little to no variety of gameplay.\n\nKeyboard controls: For those who are unable to use a controller, the default keyboard controls are pretty bad. The main problem being generic movement is mapped to arrow keys, and not WASD These controls can not be re-mapped. (Resolved as of 5/18/2016)\n\nNo quality options: The game will simply play in fullscreen, stretched to your monitor's resolution. No questions asked. (Resolved as of 5/18/2016)\n\nNot many options for alternate costumes: Only about 5 total for the main character, including the starting armor.\nThe game itself runs... pretty well for me. I haven't had any game crashes, noticed any strange bugs, and runs just fine at a locked 60fps.\n\nSo I'd say this game is pretty average at best. Average, but worth the $12 asking price ($10.19 for the first week sale).\n\nNow maybe they can use the money they made from selling this game to... buy a license to use Unity?","May 15","true","6.5"," 116 of 155 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","116","155","9","24"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivan_osorio/recommended/467930/","ivan_osorio","Ivan Osorio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ivan_osorio/","234 products in account","Hour 1: A few first impressions from ground zero:\nPretty great, actually. I was sort of expecting a button masher, but the combat mechanics are in fact well developed. You got your dodges, invincibility frames, special attacks and situational skills, different modes that increase your damage output for a decrease in defense. Good stuff here. The AI is a bit brain dead so far but it's not like I've played very far into it yet. The challenge modes seem pretty brutal though, and there are a lot of them, which I appreciate.\n\nAs a whole, Smashing The Battle reminds me a lot of Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae, a game which I really really like. And amongst many common traits, they also share the "virtue" of being well executed packages with fun gameplay.\n\nThe camera can be a bit wonky, it tends to end up turning bird-eye view, but it's easy to correct, even in the middle of battle. Nonetheless, it could definitely have used some better tracking. But as I understand it, this is supposed to be played in VR? I don't own or have any interest in one of those so I wouldn't be able to tell you how that works, but apparently it's there if that matters to you. It may either resolve or exacerbate the camera problems, I have no idea.\n\nI wanted to leave this here as a "congratulations" to the developer, the game plays and runs great. He is also pretty on point with support, so that's definitely a plus. But also, I wanted to leave a word on the gameplay, since I bet a lot of people are going to see breasts and either immediately buy it or immediately dismiss it, which sometimes works but would be a shame here. This game deserves an honest shot.\n\n\nHour 2: Some additional thoughts:\nA few mechanics are not as well explained as they should be. I have yet to figure out what is the purpose of "Scrap", even though I got a bunch of it. I don't get the "point" (gameplay wise) of saving people. They don't seem to give tremendous resources and their Keys could be spent unlocking stuff, at least in the early game, EDIT: Rescued workers have a really high chance of giving you another key when released. Always save them!\n\nThe rating system is a bit weird, and easily exploitable. Getting "Massive Kills" sometimes feels like it just fails, I have no idea what a "killstreak" is in the context of this game, but this is the only star that I always get, and the dodge counter, while cool, is not particularly well implemented. You can farm environmental hazards for those, or leave just a few enemies alive and farm them. So far, the numbers are always the same as well, and it feels like a missed opportunity. Have a stage where the requirement was to dodge a bunch of attacks would have been interesting, or clearing a stage without getting hit. Or under a time limit. The current system works fine enough as it is, but since the missions are already all pretty similar (as far as I can tell, which is not a lot) aside from the starting dialogue, not having more unique mission requirements feels odd. EDIT: There are different missions types. Most seem to be just arena type scenarios, you go in and get locked until everyone is dead, but some are waves, which I had already encountered but had forgot about, and I just stumbled upon a timed mission, which was nice. Even though the timer was actually really lenient I appreciate the change of pace. Good stuff.\n\nI'm looking forward to unlocking the other character as well as the ability to get extra costumes.\n\n\nHour 3: Other things I noticed after playing a bit more:\nVery nice difficulty curve. You start off with very easy and passive enemies but before long you are getting swarmed and fired upon from every possible direction. Situational awareness and good dodging become key, as well as efficient crowd control. Environmental hazards that are first introduced as simple obstacles along your path show up in later encounters and even boss battles, sometimes combined. Having to dodge spinning lightning rods, while the field is on fire, while a bunch of robots fire a ton of projectiles at me gave the game a very interesting vibe, almost bullet-hell -ish, but the punishment is never as severe. I have died when I got careless though, it certainly proved to not be the cakewalk that I thought it would be. Of course, you could always grind stages and upgrade the ♥♥♥♥ out of your everything. Personally, I feel I've struck a nice balance.\n\nI think I'll let this review be for a while and continue further into the game. I will probably update yet again once more stuff opens up and I have a better picture of the game as a whole. It's been very fun so far though. Definitely recommended.\n\n\nHour 9: Closing thoughts on the whole experience:\nSo... I've now cleared both campaigns, played for a while. It starts pretty easy and stupid, the difficulty ramps up quite nicely and the last stages had me locked in the zone of situational awareness that few games can pull off right. I was surprised and pleased that upwards until level 25 of the second campaign (which would make it level 55 in general) the game was still introducing new attack patterns or expanding on older ones. It was really refreshing and made the last stretch of the game feel very tense as the bullet count on screen rose considerably. I also came to really like the camera going bird's-eye view because that IS the best view to deal with multiples incoming shots from every possible direction. Since attacks are telegraphed mostly by patterns on the floor, having a top-down view can seriously save you. So, yes. Camera. Actually pretty great.\n\nThe characters do play differently and required, at least in my experience and playstyle, different approaches to gameplay. With Sarah, I would usually gather enemies around with the magnets and try to clear them with the Great Spanner, her special attack, while evading anything I can for an SP boost, but her standard combo attack is pretty fast so I wasn't shy about getting in the face of enemies. I also never ever used her bombs. Mary's game for me was much more reliant on "hit 1" of her combo attack. Get in, hit, run. It was mostly an attrition game. I rarely used her "remote bot" with intents of exploding it, but as a means to get the surreal amount of fire off my back for a second so I could regroup.\n\nAbout dodging: I really like how it works. Dodging consumes a bit of SP every time you use it. It's mostly negligible, but if you are low on SP and can't use your special attacks or Heal, dodging is probably what you want to do to get some SP back, since performing an Evade Bonus nets you 20 SP. The thing is that if you just mash the button, you are going to cannibalize your own earnings. I really like this system. It's not strict enough to be really punitive and screw you over, but it also hampers you back just enough that you will try to do it better until you can pull it off consistently.\n"Massive Kills" still baffle me. Is it a number of enemies thing? Is it a cumulative damage dealt over HP total of enemies thing? I have no idea. I THINK it's damage related but I have no idea on how it actually works. I've farmed a few stages and consistently killed some mobs the exact same way every time, and I got the massive kill bonus about 50% of those times. It's pretty weird.\n\nIn retrospect, I think the additional suits have always been available for purchase, that's what "scrap" is for, but I never noticed as I never "confirmed" on the character selection screen before getting Mary. They are recolors, sadly, but they do come with special abilities. Running faster, increase in attack or defense. Etc. The bonuses are not the same from character to character, which I appreciate.\n\n...I wish there was some sort of "point refund" system so I could try different builds or challenge runs.\n\n\nAll in all? Pretty good. Takes a while to warm up but it's worth it.","May 15","true","17.3"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","53","66","8","10"

What you see is what you get, nothing special, but at the same time, it has its charms. If you love what you see, get it, can't go wrong with this.\n\nThere is no skill trees, no different weapons, nor equipments drops. You smash through the stages, get coins (for upgrading your stats), and scraps (for buying 8 different skins/costumes). You also get keys for unlocking lores, and fanarts.\n\nYou get to play as 2 different characters. 1 is unlocked after finish the first one. Each has 110 stages to complete. (30 story / 80 challenge)\n\nEach character has 2 unique skills, and 3 basic skills. 1 move-set, 1 rolling attack. However, they are different in playstyles.\n\nYou can find several power-ups during stages from boxes or enemies.\n\nControls are responsive enough to keep you alive during the heavy fights, combat animations flow really well, although they lack some dynamics to keep the whole things fresh.\n\nGameplay gets repetitive quickly, but still a good fun to play.\n\nHere is something which might be useful for your playthrough.\n\n* The multiple attack bonus can be earned by any kills occurred at the same time. Sometimes, you don't need a skill to do it, but normal attack should do the trick.\n* The dodge roll in SMASHING THE BATTLE uses iFrame. However, Sarrah, and Mary's iFrame kick in, and end at the different dodge frames. So, your roll is not invincible.\n* Dodge roll is not always a must. At times, moving around is much safer. (may not seem this way in story mode, but challenge mode is)\n* Smashing attack (rolling attack) is strong.\n* If in-game hints mentioned that something is important, it is important.\n* The collisions can be weird at times. You can roll into the invisible wall sometimes, however, you can walk through that area normally, and start rolling again.\n* Achievements can be earned after you gets your reward in the missions menu (can be accessed from main menu), and leave the game. (they sync after quit)\n\nHere is some gameplay, much better than words.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685661284\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687175478","May 18","true","11.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","1"

They share the ability to repair and an ability that pulls enemies to a sort of magnatism bomb.\n\n-The game has 60 story missions and 80 challenge missions, each of which take a few minutes. Nothing very long, but the amount of content is decent.\n\n-Enemy variety is good. There's a pretty interesting array of enemies ranging from weak melee fodder, to suicide bots, to laser bots, to arc fire bots, to homing bomb firing bots, and more. They're pretty varied and do a good job to keep you alert.\n\n- A notable mechanic is that your SP regenrates pretty slowly, but you get +20 for dodging through attacks, so it encourages you to actually pay attention to the timing on your dodges so you can keep using special attacks (and repairs) for drawn-out encounters.\n\n\nAll of the above adds up to a genuinely fun game. That said, the place where the game falters is in boss design. Bosses are all just bigger versions of the normal enemies with a big radial AoE to keep you on your toes. They're not too hard to kill honestly, and they don't require you to change up your tactics much beyond watching out for the big purple circle AoE telegraph. The bosses are really pretty much as generic as the normal enemies, to the point that they're even reused (a lot). This means that between the mass of normal enemies and  lack of very interesting boss design, the game is pretty repetative.\n\nI mean, imagine taking your favorite beat-em-up and then remove all of the bosses from it and replace them with tankier/harder hitting versions of the normal enemies. It's probably still a decent amount of fun, but it's missing something. That's pretty much this game (for me so far). I do think this is the kind of thing that could be compensated for by wide player character variety (think Musou/Warriors style games), but this game doesn't have that either.\n\n\nAnyway, Smashing the Battle is worth a look, but it's not going to blow your mind.","May 19","true","6.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

While the controls and flow of combat are quite good the problem is you'll be stuck with same moves fighting in the same envoirment over and over. While new enemies are introduced at a decent pace and do offer a nice bit of variety it's sadly the only real variety the game has to offer and sadly no enemy is truly paradigm shifting.\n\nCombat boils down to mash attack and dodge out the way every once in a while. Also your abilties are mapped to other buttons. It works well and it can be exhilarating to pull off a long combos of magnet, mines and dogding, however the lack attack combos and only one attack button can quicly make you wish for a little bit more in the combat. The game does offer a change of pace by way of a second unlockable character but only after pretty much beating the game. It would be nice if the game had two from the beginning unlocking more as you went on or least new weapons that offered a new move set, that would clear up the monotony.\n\nTo adress the elepant in the room or perhaps better put the two heaving bosoms in the room, yes the game is male pandering fan service with it charcter desings. If your a fan of anime girls and or jiggle physics then you'll probably find some enjoyment in this game. It's honestly not as bad with it's pandering as other games, however thats not to says it's not pandering, I mean there's no real reason the game has to feature scantily clad women fighting robots but it does. It's pretty shameless about it too, so If you have a problem with kind of stuff really why are even bothering reading reveiws for the game. The tittle screen is the main character bouncing up and down jiggle physics and all. It is what it so lets move on from there.\n\nLastly the graphic and presentation are really quite nice, the game is colorful and flashy but would really benifit from some superfical changes in envoirment, I mean why not levels like a basement with pipes and steam or like a data center with blinky lights and what not something to make you feel like progress is being made. The music and sound are ok but it could really be improved. For instance some level complete fanfair would be nice or sounds the indicate things like ablities being ready or power up wearing off. It serviceable but bare minimum in my opinion.\n\nWith all that said the game is still good hack and slash fun with a nice futuristic anime fan service coat of paint. The gameruns and plays well and i've haven't run in to a single bug in full play through with main character. If the some gameplay footage of the game looks interesting to you may like it however don't expect something great because it not, it's decent and fun but if it goes without saying there are better games in the genre than smashing the battle. If you think you'll enjoy it however, you probally will.\n\n6.5/10 Fun while it last but won't last long.","May 22","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't find any other complaint about the game, besides price.\n\nedit: later impression:\n\nbeat the first of two story modes, started with the second of two characters\n\nmore of the same levels. Both characters have interesting abilities to try and make the most of, but the second character's moveset, if you can even call the amount of moves these characters can do a "set", is pretty uninspired.\n\nThese two have got less moves than a level 1 dynasty warriors character and never get more.\nGranted, a lot of the game is about running around the square battlefields and kiting the crowds and dodging death, so it isn't fair to judge on the same criteria, since in this game evasive roll is the most important move.\nThe boss fights get sort of like a danmaku - bombs get randomly tossed about, each showing a ring of what their explosion radius is going to be, and you have to dodge and weave between all the rings, running from the mob and trying to take a swing at the boss - using abilities like, drop a stationary magnet that pulls the mob toward it, at key times. As I noted before, this games controls are pretty smooth, refined feeling.\n\nSo I think there's about 6-10 enemy types, maybe 5-10 levels that get recycled out to I think 60, plus the challenge modes, so even more. There are two characters that I think have about 4 moves that are unique to them, and two abilities that are unique to them.\n\nUnlocks/character progress would take a long time to complete, and I can't ever see myself doing it, since that'd mean repeating several more times an already repetitive experience.\nAt 4 hours I can't be certain whether I'm done with this or not, "done for now", and like Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae, I'll come back to it every once in a while for its own unique thing.\n\nI do reccommend this, but MKH was about 1/10th the price and it was superior in many ways (other than oppai).","May 16","true","4.4"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","48","13","27","6","0"

The game is very repetive in every way possible but on the plus side that gives plenty of opportunity to refine the tactics for every different mob type combination. And the two different characters play quite differently which is a nice change of pace.\n\nCombat feels satisfying. It's not the best I have played, but atleast you can interrupt the combos to dodge roll.\n\nThe story and characters are surprisingly alright, which ain't saying much, but at the very least they aren't offensively stupid and cliche. Graphics are nice. Audio does the job.\n\nSome criticism and suggestions:\n\nMap design is unbelievably lazy: the maps consist of less than 10 different pieces that could easily be procedurally laid down to achieve endless number of varying (though still quite boring) maps, but instead same exact maps are repeated multiple times with identical item placement. Thank god atleast the mobs change from level to level which, to be honest, is much more important gameplay wise. Still, would have been nice to see atleast some variety in the level art. Maybe in a sequel?\n\nAll of the bosses are just regular mobs scaled up and with small tweaks. This, I think, is fine, but one of those tweaks is an electric attack that is way too random: some times it bounces away harmlessly, but too often it piles on you after you have taken a hit or done a dodge roll and hits you multiple times often killing you. It can be avoided by knowing not to dodge roll or avoiding taking damage when you think it's coming, but it feels cheap and random. I would like to see it changed so that you can only get hit once per attack and preferrably so that there must always be at least a chance to dodge it.\n\nThere are also numerous smaller enjoyment enhancing tweaks that could be implemented:\n1. Mercy frames: possibility dodge some small time _after_ getting hit to avoid damage (see Enter the Gungeon)\n2. Smaller hit boxes for characters or explosions, or larger warning rings for explosions, as now standing just out side of the danger zone markings isn't quite enough\n3. Danger zone markings always visible: now they sometimes blend into the chaos as enemies or red lighting can hide them.\n4. Better telegraphed attacks: in the midst of the chaos of combat the danger markers for especially lazers and the cutters are easy to miss, could the lazers have a "small lazer" that becomes visible before the attack starts dealing damage. I don't know how cutters could be better visualized, but now they often appear from out side of players field of vision making them very hard to dodge.","May 28","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game has nothing to offer, which perfectly expains why there's no coop in this game what so ever.\n\nTo be honest, i wanted to quit the game after seeing main menu - big brested woman (main protagonist) jumping in the background. I'm sorry but WHAT IS WRONG WITH CREATORS OF THIS GAME?! And by this i didnt mean like boobies are bad or sth, but how poor the game has to be to put boobs from the very begging of the game to not lose interest of player? Because to be fair, design of this game bought me, but what i saw after playing the game makes me never trust games from green light ever again.\n\nNext we have that awful story with just text, any voice actors, which for me is very unpleasant. And as I'm talking abouth the story let me tell you that they even put that less effor to it that in the first scene we're riding EMPTY ELEVATOR and we're checking on some things (which is spoken in the dialog) - I'm not the game designer but it really cost MINIMUM EFFOR to put some boxes aroud to make it look believable. Second later some dude shows up frome no where beeing chased by the robots and bla bla bla, it's pretty boring, but still like how he gets there? We were on our way down fast and we saw NO holes form levels that he can jump to as from.\n\nTalking about gameplay itself, I played like 2 stages and all I can say that i quit the game because it has just nothing to offer. Simply gameplay is not something bad but in game like this, when you are winning and it wasnt challenging or wasnt giving you that feeling that you achived something or just for damn reason your in to the story!

It's very basic, runs well, looks pretty good coming from Unity Engine. The story is forgettable and gameplay is a little stale, but it's not the worst Hack N Slash I've ever played.

I made a video out of it to see where it goes and from what I've seen, there's 30 story missions and 80 Challenge Maps. That's a lot of challenge maps!
