The story is quite interesting, although simple. The game is pretty confusing too. Lots of times it gives no clues as to what you have to do, and sometimes you have to do some pretty weird stuff, like hanging an amulet on a random statue, or pickpocketing a key without even being told you can pickpocket.  I am a huge fan of werewolf related stuff, which is why I bought this, but I was rather disappointed. Overall it isn´t terrible, but it feels a lot like a test or early access game, so with a few updates it could become pretty decent, since the main idea and settings are great.","January 24, 2014","false","6.1"," 2,260 of 2,374 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","260","2","0","42"

Unfortunately, I can not in good conscience recommend this game. First off, the map is horrible in the game. It doesn't tell you where you are, where you need to be, no hints, nothing. You stumble through the game with absolutely no direction or hints.\nI can overlook the horrible character models and cheesy dialogue, but the whole "Stuck wandering around in hopes that i'll stumble on the right thing" is a big turn off.\n\n*Edit* Sorry if my personal opinion of a game offended anyone. Although I shouldn't have to defend myself, I will. I'm not a "noob". I've been gaming since the original Mario Bros. and Zelda.\nGames usually tell you where you are on the map so that you have a general sense of your surroundings. No, I don't like things handed to me in a game, but some direction would be nice.\nI love trying new games and I love challenging games, however, this one just didn't do it for me. That is MY opinion which I am entitled to. If you don't like it, then skip over it and move the hell on with life. Don't bash someone just because they have a different opinion  (on a damn GAME I might add) than you.","January 26, 2014","false","1.1"," 1,134 of 1,179 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","134","1","0","8"

When a game implements a certain style and feel it should be done right and with lots of details. This game fails to achieve just that and fails to deliver. It just feels not done and rushed, and those things keep it from being an enjoyable game. A few examples:\n\nIt starts with the resolution itself, some weird low-res 1000 x 800, not widescreen but not 4:3 either. The graphics are cell-shaded but done very generic and it looks just bad. The effects for water, fire and particles are dx6 or something.\n\nThe sound is also not very good and sound rather cheap. The voices are rather cheesy and lipsinc is not in sync (understatement).  Music is ok but gets annoying quickly.\n\nWhen you move it feels like you are very small because you are a bit close to the ground. You interact with things when your dot changes to a hand. That's about it what you can do.\n\nThe story is a bit weird; you wake up outside a castle, run around a bit and faint again, wake up and look at a pre-2000 character model that asks you questions and it feels like they know a lot about you although they just found you outside the gate. Pretty weird.\n\nThe story path is very linear, just look up things and use then to pass a gate. That's about it. Plenty of better games around and I suggest  you stay away from this 'game'.","January 24, 2014","false","4.9"," 1,247 of 1,333 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","247","1","0","2"

I also when talking to characters in the game had their text floating outside of the text box with no alignment at all.  i played this for really 40 minutes trying to get immersed in the story and game but i lost it when i had no way to progress forward and no context as to where to go other than a kitchen to find a cauldron when all other doors are blocked or locked.  one last thing i tried to use a gamepad (xbox wired controller) and the controlls would work with the game pad only when the game wanted to work and i had to use both the gamepad and the keyboard to run and use items in my inventory.\nthis game has some good ideas but the lack of real development to bring this game to the standard of working fundamentals or what is expected for a game released in 2014 even 2009 needs to be done or to advertise this openly as an alpha if it is even that.  save yourself the head ache and 10 dollars and avoid.","January 26, 2014","false","1.6"," 447 of 460 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","447","460","0","1"

It's a hair pullingly frustrating game format that most people abandonned in the point and click days. In it's new release state, it also has a long list of bugs, some potentially game breaking, and is seriously lacking in in game options for the most basic things, like screen resolution.\n\nThe game looks and feels more like a high grade earning school project that demonstrates all the key priniciples in game design without actually embracing any of them and does not feel at all like a finished commercial product... Definitely the first candidate of the year for Worst Game of 2014, but it's not so bad that it will likely retain the title, as there will surely be worse games released by the end of the year.","January 27, 2014","false","3.0"," 248 of 252 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","248","252","0","0"

(except the music artists... they did good.)  In no way shape form or fashion at the final stages of development should you all have said, "Yeah, game looks good, ship it out."  Were you rushed?  Were you strapped financially?  Those questions are irrelevant.  After a project like this your company should just fold, hand in the towel, and send its employee's elsewhere to find better career opportunities.  This game is TERRIBLE.\n\nNow to the meat and potatoes, so we can figure out why its bad.  (I am not even going to give a warning for spoilers, because I think everyone who bought this should fight steam and have them refund their purchase.  Anyone who has not bought it.. DON'T!)\n\nI played this game for 2 hours and 54 minutes (approximately) that is from start to finish.  The opening of the game gives you no indicator that the story is even actually happening beyond the main character saying that he needs to go someplace and find someone.  It starts you off in a fashion that someone made a level in unreal tournement where you spawn in a location with no intro.  There should have at least been a cutscene introduction on par with the ending cutscene of the game. (don't get me started on the quality of the ending cutscene, but at least a cutscene to explain what is going on is nessesary!!!)\n\nWith no true direction (or clue) to where to find your current target objective (due to a lack in informative begining), you might decide to follow the blood trail to a horse.  Thats it for the clues beyond that. You are then greeted with the option to head for the gates, only to be told that you are missing something.  now with no sense of injury or purpose, you then are left to wander the cold wilderness in an attempt to find the corpse of a character that is literally meaningless to the plot due to no introduction or other such information.\n\nYou are then greeted with yet another way the game decides to illustrate story.  By walking up to the gate, it immediately warps you to a bed chamber and a talk to a literal stick of a human being.  The characters that ARE present in the game, are emotionless and look like they are incredibly dated (probably inspired by 2001 time period character models) HELL THATS BEING GENEROUS!\n\nRegardless, the options are bland, they don't have any apparant meaning for either selection of choice, and the voices seem remarkably quiet and uninspired.  And this is constant through the game, when you actually do get choices for dialogue.\n\nThe game play is dated, adventure games have come along way since this rustic example of old school room escape games.  (even in those games, the items you used to solve the puzzles disappeared out of your inventory.)  Instead, the items you collect kinda serve to guide you as a gauge for how much longer you have to suffer through the game.\n\nThe tutorial consists of a help file that opens from the options, or in the start of the game.  And even that tutorial does not actually explain some of the mechanics of the game (LIKE THE STEALING MECHANIC!)  Its ambiguous, and not intuitive.  There should have been a small, subtle example of each mechanic as the game introduces them to you, but it never does explain anything in the game.  It doesn't even have a story that really truely explains what exactly is going on.\n\nThe story is there, but its vague, and rarely seen.  The journal entry literally gives a hint as to your next direction, and that is your only motivation to do much of anything.  Its rediculous.\n\nThe stealth mechanics are terrible.  There are two spaces in the game where you are actually supposed to hide from the crappy looking werewolf.  TWO.  And one of the doesn't work.  Those two specific instances don't even really add to the tense atmosphere that was supposed to be there.  one of them was out right  broken, and I ended up solving the area, by grabbing the cog, and dying only to appear back at the ladder with the cog in my inventory.  The stealing in the game is effortless and in general unessesary outside of two times due to the lack of need for anymore than 200 gold pieces.  You only need to steal a minimum of 3 times.  And when you do need to steal, there is no indicator as to where and who you need to steal from.  Good luck guessing on a first playthrough.\n\nThere is no sneaking in the game.  There is no descernable combat in the game.  There are very small amounts of platforming, and the puzzles are actually few and far in between.  Its mostly collection oriented situations.  "Man I would like an apple." - go get apple- "Thanks, here is a key to the door to continue the game." - rinse and repeat.\n\nThe music, is good.  The music is actually well done, and probably the only thing worth-while in this game. After this dev team is disolved I hope that the music artist will get a job somewhere else.\n\nThe end cutscene in the game looks and runs like a damn story board.  The art is half ♥♥♥♥♥ because it looks genuinely un finished.  If you ever watch a story boarding session for disney or something, you will see how this cutscene runs.  Its insulting.\n\nI paraphrased alot of what the issues are with the game.  And if you realy want to see how bad it is, then check out my youtube channel for the whole playthrough of the game. In closing, the game is not worth a penny, its clearly an early alpha build at best.  I spent some of my time trying to figure out how to unlock myself from the terrain I clipped through, or figuring out how to get back into the level after moving through it.  Bad game is bad, and this one is just terrible.  Not worth the time, not worth the money, and a disappointing addition to the ever small selection of werewolf titles.\n\nDevs, you asked me to play the demo for you, and you got my hopes up, and you got me excited.  I jumped in to green light this game, I spoke highly of it for you people.  And then you do me this.  I am sorry for sounding brutal, but I am honest.  You mislead anyone that believes your description of the game.  Half of the description for the game in the steam advertisement section, is either pulling for strings in an effort to sell the game to folks, or outright lying.  This game is terrible, and I am not happy that I jumped and spent money on this title.  Anyone that bought it, needs to go and demand steam refund the purchase.\n\nIf you are one of the two people (at the time of this review) who gave this game a thumbs up (despite the 4/10 from one of you), you should come chat with me so I can show you some actual good games to play to put this game into some perspective.  That or I would be lead to believe that you were paid to give your shallow praises for the game.\n\nBad show devs... bad show.  I want my money back.  I would suggest you either take this game off the steam roster, or drop the price to free to play.  This is (at the time of this review) a 15 dollar purchase.  I expect much more from you guys if you are going to charge this much.","January 29, 2014","false","3.0"," 231 of 234 people (99%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","99","231","234","0","5"

After the initial... I hesitate to call it a quest because it wasn't, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the game was broken as the key to moving forward (I hesitate to call it a puzzle) relies on a mechanic that the game never really tells you exists. There aren't really any puzzles, certainly none that couldn't be solved by applying a solitary brain cell to them. The only challenging part to this game is finding all the things necessary to complete missions, and that's not a good kind of challenge. It's one that frustratingly made me stay up until four in the morning playing because I wanted to see if it redeemed itself in the end and I knew I wouldn't have the willpower to start it up again if I shut it off. The combat is wholly unnecessary, as you can quite blithely run straight past the guards who are too slow to swing to really do any damage to you and not only don't chase you, if you transform right in front of their bloody eyes and then leave the room and come back, they have apparently FORGOTTEN that the alchemist they're talking to just transformed into an unholy beast right in front of their eyes, making them utterly superfluous. Not helped is the fact that their dialogue (And pretty much everybody elses) is completely phoned in on the part of the voice actors. There are only four characters in this game, counting yourself, and two of them have a whopping THREE LINES, and yet we're supposed to care about them. Oh, and that monster they're always touting? Seen three times in the game. You see it, it chases you, you hide or cut off its path, and then it just gives up IMMEDIATELY.  I regret this purchase.

But the story really fell flat on it's face. There is no real substance or engagement in the very brief storytelling. After being given a screen telling you the controls; you're unceremoniously plopped in a field with no clear objective what to do. That theme continued throughout the game.\n\nFor being a puzzle based game; the puzzles themselves are easy and short. Having to navigate from objective to objective is numbly frustrating. I found myself consulting the community guides just to find out where to go next, as the game will not tell you. The game itself is very short, easily beaten in one sitting after you understand your objectives. The only real challenge, as I said, is figuring out where to go next on your own with no hints.\n\nThere are no game settings. You get one setting and that's it. My XBOX controller half worked in the beginning. But, glitch after glitch, I gave up and went back to the keyboard and mouse. And even that didn't fully work. I didn't experience any game-breaking bugs. But, the glitches and sub-par programming will annoy you.\n\nI would not recommend this game, regardless of the price.

What I mean by that is it's horrible, but it's still sickly funny in that "How could someone (FUN Creations) mess up that badly?".

Not Stephenie Meyer's shape-shifting pet poodles, or the wolf anthros that plaster Furaffinity, Tumblr and DeviantART; the horror werewolves that made the werewolf the legendary creature it is today. And I'm sure you are too! But I just can't help but feel that this is a cash-in on one of horror's most venerated creatures.\n\nWhen I first started Identity of the Canine, it was good enough for an indie game. The atmosphere of some serious faecal matter was about to happen was great and the controls were intuitive enough that I didn't need to reference the controls at all. Then it came to an abrupt halt when I was rudly told at the front gate that I had to look for some special item. Scrounging around the countryside (if it can be called that) of naked trees with a ridiculous cartoony outline for about 45 minutes, I finally found an axe in the least probable area one would expect to find it: Lodged on the opposite area of the map where the logging cabin was! Suffice it to say that it was one of the most jarring treasure-hunts for the most basic item that shattered the suspension of disbelief. But a voice in my head said, "Be nice. It is their first game. They at least took your advice to take out the irrelevant jump-scares."\n\nI was starting to wonder why I listened to that voice in the first place until I saw the highlight of the gaming year so far - a poorly voiced Russian princess (who oddly has a Spanish name and British-American accent) with a shocking taste in clothing and historical accuracy, and a comical outline that gave her the hint of a five o' clock shadow. After I finally stopped laughing if only to save my underpants, I began laughing at the dialogue structure. It's so clichèd with the genre and roles of the characters that I had to step out for five minutes to calm down. It's not totally asinine, though. There is a nichè choice structure that at least changed the next piece of dialogue, but for the sake of the chair and linen - I muted the sound. The magic-man behind bars was a similar story, though his voice acting was at least a cut above the rest. The Count wasn't much better than either, and his lines screamed of his role in the story. Probably the most organic lines came from the guard to the front door, and that was just plain flat. But I calmly reminded myself that Shape of the Lupine was still an indie game.\n\nI know I said the controls were tight and intuitive enough that I didn't need to look up the controls again, but the gameplay itself was like the graphics - patchy, glitchy and unforgiving at best, and nightmarish cluster-bomb on common sense's front doorstep at worst. Getting chased by the hairy attack dog was a nice shot of adrenaline through the game, but its appearances give you no option to escape or hide other than the linear chase prescribed by the developers. One chase even has you charging TOWARD the werewolf when there are no less than three good hiding spots to wait for the hulking mastiff to pass on. And no less than five times did I think, "Hang on. There are windows around with moonlight coming through, and I have an axe which smashes through baricades. Why can't I fight the poodle?" I discovered the answer after being savaged for the umpteenth time: because it's not using your brain. I know that the protagonist is a brainiac in his own little lunch-box, but we, the cruel angels of fate, are not. By this point, I was thoroughly outraged I spent $15 on a game worth about $7 for its cheap laughs and wacky graphics. But brace yourself for a shock, because there are some things that did go right. Just enough to bump its worth up to a possible $8.50.\n\nThe fact that you can turn into a werewolf, if only for two minutes and in set checkpoints of moonlight, is really what gives a credible note to the game. It was a nice little feature but it sucks in that the only combat takes place in wolf form. Even then, it's you - the unstoppable pet bulldog of The Hulk - against a scared guardsman just following orders. Horror games like Outlast and Amnesia have little, if any, combat, but it's done well! You can run, you can stun, you can hide, you can be savaged and wait for the beasties to pass on post-mortem - not follow blind instructions to the letter by running down a hall and pressing the "I Won the Race" button. Taking a chunk out of the guards was oddly satisfying in its own demented way, but I soon felt guilty after killing the most human and realistic characters in the game.\n\nI still think it was a damn shame that you couldn't take a chunk out of the characters that mattered to the wearily predictable plot. You have so many stereotypes packed into each character that you can judge their role just by looking at them - the cursed love interest (if you hadn't worked that out within the first ten minutes, you were probably too busy staring at her incredibly well-endowed bosum), the bad guy with a name, the deus ex chamberpot, the bored guard, the scared castle hand, the self-insert know-it-all-but-can't-remember-a-thing protagonist, the.... Oh wait, that's the list. They're so riddled with nits and bullet-holes that it's hard to sympathise with any of the characters. Hard at best and frustratingly difficult at worst, but it is possible. I did find myself at one point going, "Awww.... Poor Filch." Though it still doesn't excuse the fact that he only shows up once in a while to say a few lines, give you a book and reveal his backstory, only to leave you hanging for the puzzles. The princess is about as useless as you would expect as anything other than the protagonist's love-interest McGuffin, and the Count's plan was sure to backfire from stage one. I'm sure it sounded great to the drunk, semi-literate peasant farmer who the Count discussed the plans with, but he could have at least planned it with someone along the lines of Caesar or Alexander to get the kinks out\n\nFor those cheaky strumpets that skipped right to the bottom: A good game this is not. Good and Likeness of the Wild Tundra Dog just don't mix. Not bad for what it's worth, but just not good! By all means, get it in a sale or for the cheap laughs or if only for the fact it has werewolves in it, but not for something serious.","February 17, 2014","false","4.9"," 85 of 88 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","85","88","0","6"

The idea is not so bad, but the implementation is horrible.\n\nJust from the start of the game, you can see that the only options are music/sound and language select. No resolution, graphics, controls or anything. The game has many bugs and glitches, it crashes, and even has performance problems. It has lag spikes on my PC, where I usually run every game on max. The gameplay is really boring, there are a few ''puzzles'' which are almost the same, they are either too easy or make completely no sense. The NPCs do not even move or teleport, they just stay in one place and say 1-2 standard lines. Aslo, their talking animation made me laugh so hard. There are only four characters in this game, counting yourself. The game is pretty confusing too. Lots of times it gives no clues as to what you have to do, and sometimes you have to do some pretty weird stuff. The combat is horrible you can run from the guards as they are too slow and won't hit you, and after you get past them they will quickly forget about you and get back to the work of standing still. If you do choose to fight back and kill them, the game hardly seems to notice. If two guards are standing on either side of a door and you kill one, then transform back into a human, you can speak to the other guard as if nothing at all happened. The most common obstacle you’ll come across (besides locked doors) are locked chests. Each time you open one, you’ll play through the same minigame in which you have four buttons that rotate one or two of the four tumblers in the lock. As a one-time puzzle, this could have been mildly amusing. Instead it comes back over, and over, and over again, never getting any harder or less tedious. The game is also really short, you can finish it in 2 hours... if you can play this game for that long. The map system is horrible. not even a icon showing you exactly where you are all it does is highlight the area.\n\nThe graphics are horrible, it looks like it was made an decade ago, feels amateurish and unfinished in every aspect. Textures are lazy and all the same, it has no real enviorment effect, other than a crappy snow. The only good thing about this game is the soundtrack, it is pretty nice, however the voice acting is a joke. The cutscenes are not skippable, and it also has big loading times for a game like this.\n\nStay away for this game, don't play it even for free. 2/10. The developers should be ashamed, in my opinion this unfinished game was made to cash-grab from werewolves lovers.","September 9, 2014","false","1.3"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","36","40","0","0"

The twist becomes that you are stricken with lycanthropy and after dabbling in some potions, you unlock the ability to control yourself as a werewolf. Its a game that has charm enough to be playable despite being ripe with imperfections such as stiff animations, clipping through background objects, poor voice acting and seeing through the seems of objects just to name a few.\n\nThe bulk of the game, you're in a snowy castle that does a good job of detailing the look and making it convincing as a real place that someone could live in. There's a kitchen, a dungeon, a main hall, a courtyard and so on. The dungeon has bear traps set for the werewolf, so always look at the brown floor to see the rust colored traps. Stepping on one or any kind of death will restart you at the last frequent checkpoint.\n\nThere are a few characters to interact with. Some with instructions and other are there just to flesh out an area. They are voice acted and as wooden as the acting is, I'd rather hear it than read it. That's one of the game's issues, hearing the text. Even with the sound cranked up in the settings, the speech from person to person is inconsistent. Some are soft while others are clear.\n\nYou'll encounter the werewolf a few times where your only choice is to run. There are levers to pull that will spare your life when a gate comes crashing down to separate you. For a budget game, the werewolf's animation is serviceable, but its basic. Every animation is basic in the game, but at least the characters have moving mouths. Almost nothing else moves though. No one blinks, but they seem to breathe by slowly bobbing at the knees.\n\nWhen you become a werewolf, you have the ability to dash and destroy objects like twenty stone statues or barricades. You can even maul citizens to death. To transform at key moments, simply stand in the moonlight for long enough until your character drops to the ground and his arms get longer, grow claws and hair. Its a basic system that lets you get to the next area. Your time as a werewolf is limited, the moon on your screen will time how much time you have left. Its a good mechanic.\n\nThe game is linear, but you'll still have to search around a bit to discover things like ingredients for a potion or a lever to open a door. You can even see your current objective in the inventory, but its never that far away. Its good if you take a long hiatus from the game.\n\nThe controls feel like a lot of other games, mouse to look, keys or controller to move. You have buttons and keys to interact, run, a pathetic jump, map, inventory and cancel. Its a game that is self explanatory that keeps you on point and task. It quarantines you in an area until you figure out how to progress. If you try to proceed without doing what you need to, the game will prevent you from leaving.\n\nYou'll need to look in your inventory, select them and find something to use them with such as giving an apple to a prisoner that could kill for an apple rather than saying, "Could I bother you for some food? You see no one has fed me in quite a while, in fact you are the first person I've seen in maybe a day." You'll need an item that breaks down weak doors and drop ingredients in a cauldron to make a potion.\n\nThe puzzles are never anything that cryptic and solving one will lead you to the next area in fact the game will often tell you what needs to be done and you figure out how to do it. There are switch puzzles, places where you'll need to mix a potion using a list. Just follow the instructions. You can even pick the locks on a treasure chest by clicking four switches to make four tumblers shift into position. Its a fluff mini game, but its still engaging at the same time.\n\nAs simple as these tasks are, there is a moment early on in the game where you need to realize that you're supposed to pick pocket a guard for the key. This is so cryptic and soon into the game that it can turn people away from the game forever. A different guard comically tells you no one is allowed to pass, but he'll let you pass for two hundred gold. Now go loot the castle. What? That's like having a bank tell you, sorry you don't have enough for an account, but if you rob us, you'd have enough.\n\nI have to say the cell shading makes the game stand out in a good way. There are so many games without it, that just look awful. Its better to have something that looks unique and better than cheap. The torches and light affects do a lot to enhance the visuals as well, but upon closer inspection you can see faults with the art style. The black lines are drawn as objects rather than on the textures themselves. So if you put your nose up to something like a book or a bar, you can see black lines floating. One specific giant crack in the wall is just in front of the wall, so if you move, the crack will shift position on the wall. Its nothing game breaking, but its still noticeable.\n\nGuise of the Wolf has a lot of noticeable faults. Walking through bushes and chests. When you click on something in the menu or your inventory, you need to move your mouse cursor off it in order to click it a second time. The fireplaces look tiny compared to the beds. Rather than pushing a door, its the handle you need to interact with, even if there is no handle. The alter in the church is up to your chin, as are some of the tables. Some barrels you can only click on their lower half from far away and last, it just looks funny seeing your hand as a cursor on a character's body parts.\n\nIts two biggest sins are the cryptic pick pocket leads to frustration and its production values fall short. With better animation, the game would excel to its audience, but it still needs some hint that you can pick pocket. These are both things that could be fixed, along with the visual issues and the menu. There is a good game under all of this that people can still enjoy.\n\nWhile I like the game its tough to recommend with all the hate it gets. I can overlook its faults, because they're all visual and it still manages to interesting to me. The problem is that a few years after the game's release and these minor issues never went away.","October 10, 2015","false","2.7"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","28","32","2","1"

Even though I actually liked the idea of a werewolf game, you only meet it a few times (a number of three).\n\n+ The dialogues, the only thing the game still has its value. I mean, "Helps to have a map." is so hilarious it could be.\n+ I actually liked the achievements\n\n- Bugs everywhere\n- See the positive commentary above. The reason why it's hilarious, is that it's sad you can't see or do much in your implemented map. Even though you are in the Dungeon or just in the Count Hall, you can't see your position in the map where you are going or standing.\n- Voice actors in general\n- The graphics could've been better\n- No hints when and how pickpocketing the guards, bad tutorial at all\n- Sound bug when being the werewolf\n- The werewolf you encounter is really boring\n- Boring lockpick mechanism\n\nI'll give this game a 1/10. If you want a bad game, buy this. Otherwise, go and play real horror games where you could be frightened or just having a good time.","July 18, 2014","false","12.5"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

That is dedication to being terrible right there!  Finally, just because I am recommending you get this piece o' crap, please do not purchase it at the insane price they are asking.  I personally got it in a Groupees bundle and ended up paying 50 cents for it.  A penny more and I would have been ripped off.

Truly, this is a remarkable breakthrough in the gaming industry. The studio behind this masterpiece have made their entrance into the gaming world and it looks like they'll be sticking around. My sense of smell actually feels heightened and I can feel the tingling hairs on my nipples as they grow tenfold. Can you smell what the ROCK is cookin? I smell a sequel, do you? But I digress, reviewing time baby.\n\nThe game throws away unconventional and worthless things like clipping. You, the player of masterpieces, will have nearly infinite freedom. No longer will we be limited to roads and paths, this is the FUTURE. The first rock you encounter will have something special cookin' inside of it, so make sure you go in there and look! You won't want to leave-and can't!\n\nNext, we do away with voice acting. These NPC's do not know what acting is! They are alive! Each one of them feels like a dear friend and every person you encounter shares a special memory with you. When they are harmed you can truly feel their anguish and pain. Don't even get me started on the wolf. It's just like Jakob from Twilight. Hell, I even named him Jakob. He is unmatched in his CGI cutscenes, nearly ruining every other game character with the sheer awesomeness of an ability called existence. The dialogue is very open and you even have the option to say things in different orders. Sometimes, I forget it's a game and howl into the night. Say farewell to your life because this game truly absorbs you into its dark atmosphere. I won't spoil the plot. I can't even fully comprehend it. Its complexity cannot be adequately appreciated until I complete a novel version for all to read. I've already written 9,001 pages and I've barely touched 12% of the whole plot.\n\nYou see my friends, you MAKE the plot. The creators took a gamble and allowed YOU, the player of masterpieces, to create your own story. It leaves many plotholes on purpose for your imagination to fill in, making the replay value infinity.\n\nBeware, once you start this game you may contract a disease known as "Large Dong". I'll let the details be a surprise, but know that you won't want it to be cured. Keep napkins closeby as the female lead is a true Goddess. Her beautiful voice echoes forever in your mind and you'll spend the vast majority of the game not actually playing but searching for this divine Amazonian. She watches over the player giving advice and health/love potions from time to time. You'll fall in love with her soothing voice quickly, so be sure to listen to her.\n\nMake sure you check the map often. It really helps, the guards told me so and they've seen everything. Everything! Good luck sneaking by them. Additionally, they're incredibly handsome. If you find that your cannot contain your primitive lust I must warn you to be extremely careful when patting them down. The one named Jesom specifically likes his left ear stroked gently. Try it, you'll get a extra 15 gold.\n\nPlay on, friends. This game is the greatest buy of my life, and I bought twelve ladyboys for a night.\n\nAWRHOOOOOO!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWHROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!","December 25, 2014","true","46.6"," 78 of 151 people (52%) found this review helpful 165 people found this review funny","52","78","151","165","5"

Thus, the reason I got this.  The other reason I got it, was because I thought the artistic touch was well done.  The art is unique and thoroughly different.  Yes, poor dialogue and vagueness abound, but the art style just amazes me.  If you can look beyond the annoying items, and just explore the style, you might find yourself enjoying the environment more than the game itrself.\n\nI remember a time I paid $40 bucks for a game, that came with a free game.  Turns out the free game was the only thing I played...so for the $7 or so bucks, it doesn't pain me too much and I at least get to explore the world.\n\nI hope this company can make other games like this with better dialogue, map, and so forth.","April 9","true","1.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_eek_/recommended/259640/","_eek_","Eek!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_eek_/","659 products in account","This is the best game I have ever played.  This is the best game I will ever play.  People owe it to themselves to load up GotW, and I'm a little disappointed Steam/Valve haven't bought it on behalf of every single Steam user.  The game has amazing graphics, fluid animation, wonderful mechanics, the best sound effects money can buy (the 'walking on wood' sound was so good I felt I was walking on water) and an atmospheric, chilling soundtrack.\n\nI play this game every day.  Sometimes I pretend I'm actually the main character in person, skulking around the dark, moody castle (my bathroom), whilst other times I pretend to be Isabella and hide from everybody else, no matter how often they get upset and beg me to come out.\n\nHere's my take on the in-game characters:\n\nLaszlo's sadly dead from the start but that very discovery will make you tear up and suck you into the detailed plot.  Even dead characters here put other games' in the shade.\n\nFilch Hoodwink has the misfortune of looking like a creepy child molester and having a name that people often mistake for 'Filth', which doesn't help matters.  It's a shame, really, as all he wants to do is eat juicy, juicy apples.  I've never met anybody that immediately wants to hold a conversation about them, but this man is positively apple obsessed and brings the subject up several times in the game.  He loves seeds too and will hand them out to anybody and everybody at parties.\n\nIsabella, friendly soul, insists she'll be nearby and yet shows up a total of three times in the adventure (one of which involves being rescued at the end), for a combined screen time of probably a minute.  Curiously, despite the brief encounter(s) she seems to hint of a possible romance between the pair of you; Filch clearly doesn't do much for her and, frankly, who can blame her?\n\nArtemis was born with a permanent Roger Moore-esque raised eyebrow which, I'm sure, led to a great deal of ridicule as a child (but fruitful experiences when he was old enough to discover women).  He has the deepest, villianiest voice I've ever heard which must be annoying when attempting to hide villainy motives.  In any case, I hope his sore throat clears up soon; I recommend Wrigley's 'Lockets' which have a lovely, gooey, honey centre.\n\nThe guards are all very helpful and uniform (which guards should be!), greeting you cheerfully and pointing you towards your map.  If I found a real guard like this I would want to shake his hand quite firmly for a minimum of no less than five seconds, or until he asked me to stop.\n\nKitchen Wench™.  Unknown motive(s); one suspects cooking food.  Prone to panic.  Prone to face collapsing when killed to death.\n\nI refuse to comment on the wolf itself as overexposure will diminish its quite dramatic entrance.  All I can say is this: once you see it, you will never forget.  Isn't that what we all strive for in life?  I know I do.\n\nI'd like to address some laughable 'negative' points I've come across, both here on Steam and elsewhere:\n\nStealth.  The stealth system is actually nuanced and in-depth.  Each guard has their weapon on display at all times and an unsuccessful pat down of their bottoms will result in a major tongue-lashing.  I can't explain the sheer euphoria I felt when I managed to steal a key to a dungeon; something I can only claim to have done a handful of times before in real life.  The fact this genre-busting mechanic isn't documented anywhere within the game is entirely the point; you have to get into your character and into the mindset.  Don't be lazy; explore, probe, discover, learn.  Fondle.\n\nNow, I'm puzzled by the negativity in regards to the black outlines.  They are perfect.  They are us.  They accurately convey the darkness we all have in our souls which is, presumably, why Filch 'Filth' Hoodwink is completely encased in blackness at one point.  To remove these outlines is to remove a part of ourselves.  Even the scenery needs these lines; nature can be unforgiving and cruel.\n\nAnother gripe seems to be in regards to objects, and the fact many can be walked through.  All I can say is this: if you were trying to hide from a werewolf, I think you'd be thankful you could hide inside a large rock or tree!\n\nOverall, you must buy this game.  This is not a request and it makes me weep to know there are genuine, decent people out there deprived of this experience.","March 27, 2014","true","233.8"," 203 of 441 people (46%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","46","203","441","49","41"

The problem with games based so much on puzzles is occasionally you bump into a puzzle you can't solve and that brings your gameplay to a dead halt. I ran into that fairly early on, and if I hadn't found a walkthrough, I probably would have stopped playing. The solution to that particular puzzle wasn't ridiculous -- it made sense -- but I doubt I would have thought of it. And it was a lot of fun running around as a werewolf, smashing pylons... until I realized I'd missed one somewhere in that insanely complicated map. It took me two days to figure out which one I'd overlooked! But overall, if you don't mind the 1990s-style graphics, I recommend it.","July 17, 2015","true","4.8"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","6","21","2","0"

Your main goal is to cure yourself and stop the werewolf who gave you the bite in the first place. Along the way, you learn to control the transformation, to the point only direct moonlight can make you turn.\n\nI'll rate the game overall in 5 categories:\n\nReplayability: 4/10\nIf you want to get all of the achivements you need a minimum of 2 playthroughs to get all of them (because there's 2 endings).\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nStandard graphics, seems like a cartoon set in 2005, but it doesn't impede the experience.\n\nStory: 7/10\nAgain, if you're into midevil/alchemy, you'll find this interesting to say the least.\n\nVoice acting: 3/10\nIt helps to have a map.\n\nOverall experience: 6/10\nRead total below.\n\nOverall: 5/10\n\nIt's not at all a bad game, nearly all of the negative reviews were due to the fact it didn't release trading cards along with it's innitial release which is sad that's all people care about rather than enjoying the game. If you have a couple of hours to kill (if you don't follow a guide and just play the game normally) you'll find a good experience to say the least.","October 3, 2015","true","5.0"," 9 of 30 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","9","30","2","0"
