Since this game only has local (offline) leaderboards, there isn't much to propel you to get a braggable high score if you don't have friends around to play it. It isn't really Bizarre Creation's fault that there isn't steamworks integration here, since they are closed down, but that was probably the second most important feature beside the main game.\n\nThat being said, the core gameplay is exactly the same as the xbox 360 version and there is full controller support, which is nice.","February 8, 2014","false","0.8"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","30","43","0","2"

Despite being an older game, the graphics (although not HD) still hold up well & are styled to give the game its distinct feel. Geometric shapes with the saturated palette makes it easy to distinguish what is going on in the chaos of coloured pixel explosions!\n\nUsing the XBox 360 controller, I found the input to be responsive, giving you great control over your ship's movement & aiming. That being said, it still takes some time to become a master at Retro Evolved.\n\nSuper cheap title now offering great value, must have for any twin stick shooter fan & certainly also worthy of anyone's collection who likes a challenge. One of the real standouts in the genre. It is important to note that this entire game is also a dedicated game mode now available in Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions. This is still a most worthy pick-up but you may get better value in the long run out of the current release.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","August 27, 2012","true","5.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Retro's "asteroids" on steroids with a challenging and fun arcade gameplay! I originally discovered this game on the xbox 360 and was stoked to see it here on Steam. There's a mobile version for the nintendo DS which took the series on a totally different route with new gameplay mechanics and RPG elements (odd, huh?) if you own a DS I strongly suggest checking that out. I also strongly suggest checking Geometry Wars 2 as it adds a multitude of different game modes that are all very unique and challenging within the gameplay of Geometry Wars. 26th of November this year they're releasing Geometry Wars 3 -- which will be in 3d with rotating maps. I'm stoked! I'm going to be getting it on the Xbox One as I want to return to the original time of playing it on the console and personally I believe its easier to contorl with two joysticks rather than wasd and a mouse.

It's pretty beautiful to look at and it's fun to play.  I love the sound and music.\n\nIt's very arcade-y in nature, for sure.  Having said that, the gameplay is also predictable: although you'll get different types of waves, you get very similar ones at similar times.  It's balanced and eases you into gameplay, but the start is also fairly boring after you've played a few times.  Conversely, later in your run things will get ridiculously hectic.\n\nThis was the first game I had played where I had a lot of issues with my controller(s).  I've had similar issues elsewhere now, but Geometry wars (when I started it a few years ago) was only really programmed for the 360 controller.  Other controllers would sort of work, but the game didn't really understand the input so much (for example, the game couldn't detect "Up" on my ps2 controller).\n\nWhile this is one of my favorite chill out games, I'll probably only play it for about 15 minutes at a time and then not touch it for a few months.  It's great fun for sure, but it's also a very redundant game.\n\nIf you don't already have it, though, you absolutely need Geometry Wars in your library.","July 11, 2014","true","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Geometry Wars feels like an homage or love letter to classic games like Defender, Space Invaders, and Asteroid.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely fun and finds the right balance of casual gameplay and simultaneously being very challenging while even approaching unforgiving/punishing in how hard it can be.  It's hard to explain the experience of how playing this game can be relaxing and leasurely and, in the same session, become intense and anxiety-provoking, causing a release of adreniline in the player.  It's also difficult to explain how rewarding it is to feel yourself naturally responding to the challenges the game throws at you and finding yourself handling situations and reacting differently, getting through a point in the game that used to have you stuck.  The game itself is very well made and has a great feel to it, and the graphics are beautiful.\n\nMy only two minor quibbles with the Steam release are lack of an online Leaderboard (probably has something to do with Activision getting shutdown and that they just used Xbox Live's leaderboard functionality before) and that the Steam release doesn't have any of the unlockable achievements the Xbox 360 version had (how hard would it have been to include those?).\n\nI payed $1.99 for this on Steam and would have actually paid more.  Again, I can't recommend it enough for a modern take on classic Arcade gameplay.","June 28, 2014","true","23.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There are also no online leaderboards, which is a massive shame as well.

Geometry Wars starts off easy, but once you hit around 10000 points, it really starts picking up and getting harder. There are two weapon upgrades you get, that alternate every 10000 points. A rapid fire machine gun thing, and wide shot. You also have a bomb that can kill all enemies on the screen at once. Yes, you will need to use it. There are many varieties of enemies, from the type that simply float around, to big long snakes that you have to hit in the head to kill, to those green squares that continually try to ram you and are smart enough to dodge your fire. It is a beautiful game: all retro graphics, with very nice anti-aliasing and wonderful multi-color explosions. I strongly recommend purchasing this game if you love a fast paced arcade-style game, with wonderful visuals, and brilliant 'just one more try' game play.

If you look at it closely you’ll see that this game has styles that are pretty much identical to arcadia. The only difference is that Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved put a lot more effort in to prettiness and particle effects. The enemy type also varies a lot more than Arcadia. While the overall production value is better than the graphically inferior Arcadia, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved is missing everything else that made Arcadia worth playing. The lack of multiplayer options, online leaderboards, and any sense or progression makes this game virtually pointless to play after a few run through. As a result the current asking price of 3.99 is outrageously outlandish, better wait till this game is like a 1-2 dollars.

Very much a throwback to the visual design of Tempest and the gameplay of Robotron 2084.  It's hard to play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time because of the repetitive nature, but that also makes it the perfect game to pick up and mess with when you're waiting around for other things.\n\nThere's a sequel out for the Xbox360 arcade which I dearly hope to see on Steam someday along with a pseudo-sequel called Geometry Wars Galaxies for the Nintendo DS and Wii.  The DS game is AWESOME and totally worth playing if you can get it.\n\nOne thing to remember, -this game can be played with a mouse and keyboard, but you WILL WANT a dual-stick gamepad to enjoy it properly.","December 9, 2010","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not even kidding. Who knows how long I played part 2 either.. Part 2 is shinny and had more modes to play BUT this is the best version. Period. Geometry Wars 1 is the only game I ever knew that would case me to shake from exctment when passing a high score. When I first started playing it my hands would lock up painfully (think they called it claw hand or crab hand lol) but once it passed I was right back at it.\n\nI've uploaded a video on youtube of me getting all 12 achievments (xbox version) in one run WITHOUT using bombs. Basically that means scoring 1 million points without dieing and not fireing a shot for the first 60 seconds.. Needless to say its a fun game.  I am BroodingTom from xbox live and I'm ranked #1 in king mode in GW2 for 2 years now and held 1st in Evolved for about a year too but lost that rank cause I quite playing.\n\nI recommend this game to ANYONE! It takes a while to seperate the 2 sticks (gamepad) and learn the enemy behaviors. But  the feeling of mastering a game is like none other game I have ever played! NOTE; scoring anything over 10 million in this game is just a act of endurance really.\n\nI so wish I could play GW Galixies using my xbox gamepad =/   THIS GAME IS SO UNDERRATED!!!! Bizzare Creations was STUPID for naming it after Math...? I mean seriously?  This game is the best shooter ever made. Split seconds can mean death. And it can take 6 months to a year to master. (depends on the player)\n\nAlso, the true game dosn't begin untill 3-4 million points.\n\n~Tom","December 18, 2013","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've given it a few hours to see if it's any good, and I can't really say that it has held my attention for all that long.  Having played Waves, I'd rather play that (if it didn't crash all the time!).    The music here is limited, the gameplay is very short.\n\nMy main issue with this game is that the difficulty seems to go up and up and up, without every giving you a respite.  There comes a point where the entire screen is just WHITE with explosions and bullets.  You quite literally CAN'T SEE what you're playing.. at which point you just shoot and move while you wait for the glow effect to fade...\n\nThe graphics, however, are moderately good, and the controls are responsive.

That is really all the game has to offer. I am not kidding. And the shooting controls are BAD. Your cursor is hidden, so you can't control the, let's say, "bullets" as well. This problem could've, and still can, be fixed. Just make a patch. This game could've also benefited from a campaign, along with some achivements, along with a multiplayer arena death match mode, sort of thing.\n\nOverall, this game isn't that good. It may be a bit addicting, but I wouldn't waste money on this game. Just because it sounds cool doen't mean it is. I do not recommend this game.

No regrets at all. The game is basically asteroids on crack. The visuals are trippy and at times beautiful and the gameplay is arcadey and challenging. The real joy comes from challenging your own high score, which can be very addicting if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nI will say though that this game is best played with a dual joystick controller. The PC controlls are acceptable, but it's definitely designed around control sticks.","October 6, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an exciting shooter, but the graphics, sound and music are a bit too flashy (literally) to me.\n\nA mildly recommended rating, great as a casual time-killer.

And for only a few dollars, you too can have the pleasure of destroying flying shapes while avoiding seizures in your own living room. Because the real star of this game is not the tight controls, or the perfect soundtrack, or how addicting this game can get; nope, the real star of this game is the insane visual effects that grabbed everyone's attention when this game was originally released on XBLA almost a decade ago. Sure the servers are no longer up and running, so high scores no longer matter, but that doesn't change the fact that ‘Geometry Wars’ is insanely cheap and will undoubtedly offer it’s value in about an hour of gameplay.","March 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It only has one mode and lacks online leaderboards as well as multiplayer, but I actually prefer this version because of its simplicity and lack of geoms (items enemies drop that you need to collect for multipliers in other versions).

Twin-stick, frantic, progressive, high-score-chasing shooters are remarkably addictive to me.  I have 100's of hours logged between console versions of Geometry Wars, the pc clone Grid Wars 2, and the "Pew Pew" games for iOS/Android, and while I'm far from a high score chart topper, I feel I have enough time in them to offer an opinion.\n\nI was THRILLED to see this come across on Steam, as Steam has become my gaming "platform" of choice in recent times...but sorely disappointed, once I logged into the game.  Yes, the core game is here.  Yes, it's amazingly fun and addictive and has that undeniable, "Just one more game" syndrome to it.  Yes, it's visually stunning and crazy hectic and a great showcase for wow-ing your friends as you dodge things they can't even see and somehow come out the other side still shooting.  Yes.  All of that.\n\nBUT.  This game was a rush-job port for an easy cash in.  For starters, there aren't any achievements in the game, at all.  None.  Furthermore, yes, there's a leaderboard....but it's LOCAL ONLY.  This completely eliminates all of the high score chasing mania that made the originals so incredibly long-lived.  And, on top of all of this, not a single glimmer of any of the extended game modes is anywhere to be found.\n\nSo, yes, I'll still turn to this game in those moments where I want to kill time without thinking about it, or worrying about save points...and I'll still recommend it to anyone who does have it...but the sad truth here is that this could have been much, much better.","December 30, 2013","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was kind of dissapointed to find out after buying the game that it doesnt have NEARLY as many games modes as the two ipad games PEWPEW and PEWPEW2 (which are based of this game). In fact, it's only one mode compared to Campain Mode and multiple variants per game. But still, it's a very enjoyable and fun game to play when you have nothing to do ;)","May 17, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And for only a few dollars, you too can have the pleasure of destroying flying shapes while avoiding seizures in your own living room. Because the real star of this game is not the tight controls, or the perfect soundtrack, or how addicting this game can get; nope, the real star of this game is the insane visual effects that grabbed everyone's attention when this game was originally released on XBLA almost a decade ago. Sure the servers are no longer up and running, so high scores no longer matter, but that doesn't change the fact that ‘Geometry Wars’ is insanely cheap and will undoubtedly offer it’s value in about an hour of gameplay.","March 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s a good game, but the newer Geometry Wars 3 has all the features of this game as bonus content.\nLength: 1+ hour\nGenre: Arcade, Twin Stick Shooter\nScore: 6.5/10\nNote: As I mentioned in the Quick Breakdown section, if you purchase  Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved, it includes a classic mode which is the same content of this game. So even though I’m giving this game a positive review, I recommend against buying it, and instead purchasing Geometry Wars 3, which is well worth buying for its own game as well.\n\nFull Review: Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved is a pretty simple, but addicting game. You play as a small ship on a flat board that must fend of waves of different geometric enemies. There are about half a dozen or so different shapes, and each shape behaves in a different manner. Some enemies will sit in place on the map, others move about aimlessly, and some chase after you.\n\nBefore I talk about the gameplay, I just want to note that this game is nigh unplayable without a controller. When I refer to the controls in this review, it will be in reference to when using an actual controller.\n\nThat said, the controls are very simple as well. You use one joystick to move about the map, and the other to shoot in any direction, hence why it’s a twin stick shooter. You can also use one of the shoulder buttons to activate a bomb, which will wipe out all enemies on the map. You begin the game with 3 bombs and 3 lives, though you can acquire more by scoring points, which is done simply by killing enemies.\n\nThe aim of the game is simply to rack up as high of a score as you can before you bite the dust for the final time. A game won’t last very long, only a few minutes, but you’ll get enough reply out of it to get at least an hour’s worth of gameplay out of it.\n\nIt’s a fun game, but you’re better off just buying Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved, since it includes the content of this game a lot more. Still, it’s only a few bucks if you’re like me and insist on getting it anyway.","November 15, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
