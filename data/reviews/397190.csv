It features campaigns  from the Warring States period of Japan to the Imjin War (when the Japanese invaded Korea and battled the Joseon and Ming Dynasty).\nOriginal First Impressions:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU_p6QUQJRs\nCombat is, of course, the main focus of the game. Turn-based combat where the player must flank, disrupt and destroy enemy formations in order to gain victory. There are various troops from swordsmen, archers, spearmen, cavalry, cannons and all manner of units that have differing qualities and morale. For example, Yari Samurai will perform better than Yari Ashigaru and because Samurai are more elite warriors than Ashigaru will hold the line whereas Ashigaru may falter against larger foes. Firearms are a new technology which have ludicrously powerful volleys when fired at point blank range yet suffer from Line of Sight and range issues whereas a bow can fire overtop units at longer ranges. Cannons are also powerful tools you can use, yet they are far more of a morale breaker than a damaging unit. Some units even come with a cannon attachment, making them more powerful frontline units. New additions to this version from Pike & Shot also includes new general units which provide morale bonuses and can be killed in battle affecting morale of their associated side.\n\nWhile I could talk in depth about the mechanics of the game, I think it's more important to explain whether it's good or not. Simply put, it is. If you were a fan of Pike & Shot: Campaigns and you're interested in an Eastern setting with brand new maps, units and tactics then this is the game for you. As a huge fan of Pike & Shot: Campaigns, I was more than happy to step back into the world of Pike & Shot plus I can't help but feel that many major Asian conflicts have been left out of our modern Western gamespace so it was a no brainer to tackle conflicts like the Imjin war or various Japanese campaigns. Also, that music is freaking great. Seriously, it's probably my favorite part... just wish there was more of it. Definitely recommended.","May 19","true","6.7"," 50 of 67 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","50","67","7","0"

I've put more hours into Battle Academy than any other game I own, so every time I see a new game using the BA engine, I usually take the bait.\n\nI wanted to love Sengoku Jidai. Just like Pike & Shot, the game is aesthetically beautiful. The period artwork is gorgeous, and along with the great music, really provides an immersive experience.\n\nWhat killed both games for me was the pursuit mechanic. I look at turn based wargames like games of chess. I want to plan my strategy, and develop it by thinking several turns ahead. What I don't like is having control of the game ripped away from me by the game mechanics, and not the cunning tactics of the enemy. It's simply impossible to implement an overall strategy when every time a unit breaks, the victorious unit automatically chases it. You end up with units vanished off the map, with no idea when or if they'll return. Other units have rallied at random points outside of command range, and even getting them back into action is going to be a tedious chore. The only actual chance you get at strategy is in your initial deployment, because once your units make contact, you essentially lose control of them. They are locked in melee combat for multiple turns until one breaks, then the victor compulsively chases the loser around the map. I've literally spent four turns or more without issuing a single order. Once all the automation is finished, the battle has devolved into a scattered mess, and any sense strategy is lost.\n\nUntil the pursuit mechanic can be toggled off in the settings menu, I'll have to look elsewhere. I'm bummed about this.\n","May 22","false","6.1"," 45 of 64 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","45","64","7","16"

The new graphic style and UI is not very clear to read though and detracts from the gameplay.\nAll in all reccomended as an enjoyable tactical battle game.\n\n\nIN DEPTH EXPLANATION BELOW:\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n1. The good old Field of Glory:Renaissance system - if you like it, play the game.\n\n2. So far imho good and realistic combat results (I never played the asian armies in tabletop, so this is new for me mind you)\n\n3. Enjoyable tactical battles, just as with the previous game in this series.\n\n4. Varied armylist. NO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THE DLC TO PLAY A BATTLE AS THE MONGOLS OR JURCHEN! These are vailable freely in skirmish mode. The dlc is just for the campaigns.\n\n5. The AI is decent.\n\nTHE BAD (mostly grpahics and UI):\n\n1. The UI/graphics - it looks cool on first glance, but its much less user-friendly than the one in "Pike&Shot". Its harder to see unit facing and the "engaged in combat" markers are hard to see, especially in forests. After a few battles it became easier, but the UI is still more fuzzy than in the pervious game in teh series (Pike&Shot).\n\n2. While the graphics don't have to be relaly pretty to me in a strategy games, I do want to say that my eyes felt tired after some 2 hours of gameplay. This is usually a bad sign in a strategy game. I wear glasses with anti-reflective coating and play in a well-lit room, and yet my eyes felt tired. This did not happen with Pike&Shot or with other games based on this engine.\nGuess someone will probably come up with a "P&S" style terrain and UI modpack soon.\n\n3. No multi-sided campaign, in each campaign you can choose one of 2 sides only. Come on this is Sengoku-Jidai the era of shifting alliances and numerous warring factions.\nI know this game engine was deisgned for 2 sides, but I think in this particular game the devs could have done more given the era flavor.\n\n4. No full-Japan campaign map, you are limited to central Japan only.\n\n5. No southeast asian armylists, nor the possibility to use European armies from P&S. Its a minor point all things considered as this is a standalone game after all. I'd be willing to buy a southeast asian DLC if the price was reasonable though.\n\n6. Was especting some more specifgic asian terrain. Instead rice paddies are just "rough" terrain etc. Feels more generic than it should.","May 19","true","14.6"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

And for turn-based  battles it is precisely what one would hope for.\n\nThe battle mechanics are fluid, make sense in a simple to learn and well explained manner, and is possibly the best turn-based system I've yet played in how it removes absolute control of units once battle is joined. You will curse your cavalry as it pursues enemies off the battlefield and then cheer on your samurai as they smash through the enemy front line and roll it up. The timer ticks down during the battle, nightfall being salvation or a missed opportunity. The music and the styling of the maps really fits the theme. The AI is useful whilst remaining an AI. This game will likely shine even more against a human opponent.\n\nThe campaign mode is clearly not the focus here, and to me that's a shame. I can appreciate the design philosophy whilst wishing there were more to it. Whilst it ties together battles and their consequences, there is a sense of it being there solely to tie those battles together. Perhaps one day more could be done here. As a criticism of this game it's a very mild one because it's just wishing it were more.\n\nWould recommend this game. There's a lot of play time here even for solo players and a nice entry point into turn based strategy games (average army size has been around 10k to 15k for me - 20 or 30 units) while retaining sufficiently nuanced detail to please older grognards.","May 21","true","11.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/170269/recommended/397190/","170269","MajorReisman17","http://steamcommunity.com/id/170269/","224 products in account","OK first I would like to state that I did pay full price for the game plus all the DLC except for the e-manuals. I have never purchased or played Pike and Shot.  Now that is out the way onto the game.\nThis game is so far very enjoyable. I really like the art style and I also really enjoying playing the skirmish mode (I am still learning the ropes). I also especially like the addition of generals although sometimes loosing a general feels a little weak in my opinion (e.g. not a great effect if he gets killed).\nSometimes you think your plan is working finally just to get a boat load of bad results (and bad decisions sometimes - we are all human after all :-)) and suddenly you find yourself in a mess and having to come up with a new plan (which this is very rewarding to play). I know some people compare this to Total War series and even though I have played most of the series (last one funny enough was Shogun Total War 2 with all the DLC packs). I personally have always struggled with playing these and the campaign map side of things are somehwat complicated and takes alot of time to perform turns. On the other hand this game has simplier campaigns (which to me are much easier to play).\nThe battles really have a wargaming feel to them (congrats on getting this right - I started out wargaming / playing board games approx 25 years ago).\nI think the biggest difference however between Total War and this game are the turn based battles. Total War series have very nice looking battles however its all realtime so if you have a large army it can be hard keeping track of everything going on (which is somewhat realisitc) and makes performing specific tactics hard. On the other hand this game really is very tactially challanging gameplay and has a good mixture of stratagy and tactics (and a little lady luck) in order to win the day.\nIt is much easier to perform flanking manoevers and perform some very unique tactics. In Total War series it more about the two sides just running into one another and fighting it out (hoping you purchased and positioned the right troops).\nI really like having to use what little brain I have left to plan and implement the best possible tactics including trying to get the upper hand on the oppenent by using tactics like ambushes, flanking and charging into the rear of troops (which is devasting by the way). Your troops also have a chance of pursing which could cause you to loose your troops (sometimes only temporary) if you are too close the the map edge so you have been warned. I am looking forward to playing a lot more of this game in the weeks and months to come and look forward to future plans that this company has.\nHighly recommend purchasing this if you are into wargames and enjoy lots of stratagy/tactics options with a simplier campiagn. Great job developers.","May 25","true","9.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I've also played around 10 hours in offline mode so the steam play time is not accurate.\n\nSengoku Jidai is set in the time of the Japan civil war and allows you to take part in a good number of historical battles. I found this part to be the most interesting. It's a great way to learn Japanese history if you're a fan of that, it allows you to play as one of the most known generals of the era.\n\nHistorical battles are not the only playable mode but are certainly the most interesting one. I found the campaign to be lackluster and very barebone, it works simmiliar to the first Shogun and Medieval: Total War - you capture provinces and recruit and command armies under your banner. Unfortunately that is everything there is to it. There are no buildings to build or technologies to research and the UI in the global map is certainly not the best there is. It does inovate a bit in multiple ways but I still find it very underwhelming.\n\nFortunately, all of that can be forgotten because of the brilliant battle system. Sengoku Jidai has some of the most interesting and in-depth combat ever seen in a strategy game. It's turn based, but there are more than two turns. There is a turn for you to make your moves and a turn for your opponent to make his moves. After every turn there are also aditional two turns where combat is resolved and archers make their moves.\n\nCombat can be very slow at times. You need tactics to succeed as flanking and different types of advantages (morale, presence of generals, height advantage, morale states and more) play a huge role. Two evenly matched troops will fight almost indefinately and will but slowly chip at each other. You also can't pull back a unit after it engages in combat untill one of the perticipants is defeated or falls back. After that, the winning troop will charge after it and will be much easier to be flanked if you aren't paying attention. That makes formations very important because you can't have holes that your opponent can take advantage off. Turning also takes up action points so you have to take that into consideration as well.\n\nAnother great thing I've discovered is that while the graphics are not that great, the game runs great even on integrated graphic cards (tested on intel hd 4000, 60FPS in 1920x1080). That makes it a great choise even if you don't have the up to date hardware, as you will almost certainly be able to run it.\n\nFinal Rating: 7.5/10","May 27","true","7.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The ukiyo-e style is well embedded in the game. I could see the talent of these game designers. The game mechanism is also well-designed to try their best to show what the 16th century oriental war would be like.  Some of the reviewers may not like the mechanism of pursuing and think it is out of control.  However, from the game perspective, I like it since it could prolonged the manoeuvre distance. From the historical perspective, if someone studied battle of Kawanakajima, you could see wrongly pursuing could cause confusion. So using charge carefully and wisely is quite vital.","May 27","true","126.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I found it easy learn, my first campaign I played as Imagawa clan my main opponent was Akai clan, first battle was chosen by Akai clan, lucky for me was with nice big hill so guarded my hill and pulled off victory, my kill ratio to deaths was 2 to 1 so need learn more. Second battle I went straight for with half my army, Akai agreed open battle this one I choose river position to defend, this with fact I already smashed troops before gave me an advantage, I won battle and Akai clan sued for peace.\n\nLots to learn and lots of enjoyment, there large range of content so will take while to master.

There randomness to life things just happen, good general should be able counter any problems.\n\nI would recommend it highly, if your looking for total war not going find it, this is more about battles then building things.
