Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock (M:DtD) is your dream come true. Not only does it have some nice small puzzles, but it also offers the player an entertaining experience.\n\nHe who learns but does not think, is lost! He who thinks but does not learn is in great danger.\n\nConfucius\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock.\n\nGameplayM:DtD is a story driven point&click game, starting from the moment the ship crash lands, and it's up to the player to fix it and get the hell out of that evil ridden planet.\nThe story is interesting, and the environment around the whole scenario is somewhat creepy, especially taking into consideration all the dead bodies. Fear not, it's possible to escape! From fixing hull breaches, to visiting places to find pieces, the player will soon discover there's more to the planet than expected.\nEvery step taken towards the end ends up being a new step on the creepiness scale, which goes well with the shadowy sci-fi setting. Just take a look at the screenshots available on the store page, and you'll instantly understand.\nThere's an incredible feeling of accomplishment when completing the game. I only wish the game was longer!\n\nPros Neat graphics;\nInteresting story with some alluring puzzles;\nSome enjoyable cutscenes;\nThe riddles are pretty straightforward, and the clues are a nice guide, too;\nThere's a walkthrough available if you ever get stuck;\nWell designed environment;\nEngaging piece assembly system.\nCons The main character's voice acting is terrible, except during cutscenes;\nNot much replay value, as it's a pretty straightforward story;\nI'd cut down the price a tiny bit.\nVerdictI'd give it a 7/10, considering it gives the player a nice overall experience, with a nice story and a creepy environment. I'd certainly consider a higher score if the main character's voice acting wasn't as bad.","May 28, 2015","true","3.7"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

Really big game for the time and fabulous graphics with actually interesting cinematics.\n\nIf you try and find it online today, it's sad that the voice work has been removed. When I saw it on here, I kinda rejoiced. It's not terribly long, or complicated, but somehow everything just fits right. It's a nice, honest, and surprisingly solid little adventure game. Thankfully, the game's been remastered a bit. The graphics aren't much better, but they are slightly improved. Some new voice work. It's about as quality as its previous iteration but I actually like it a lot. It somehow strikes me as fitting in spite of it being rather deadpan. I miss the character portraits though.\n\nAnyhoo, the game doesn;t have too much additional content compared to its free counterpart, so it's up to you whether you want this experience, or the slightly less in-depth one. The differences aren't worth the price tag, but if you've got the cash, I'd recommend the buy. The game's solid and I'd love to see the developers get some support and make a new game. They definitely got some talent for it.\n\nAll in all, I'm quite happy with my purchase and would suggest it, though for obvious reasons it's not for everbody.","February 19, 2015","true","2.4"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","1"

He heads to the cockpit to find the Captain of the ship impaled through the stomach by a random piece of debris. He takes a seat and reins in the damaged vehicle as it cascades to the planet below. Powell must now explore the planet and find a way to repair his broken ship.\n\nHigh Points\n\nEngineering puzzles – The puzzles are sound from an engineering perspective. You’ll find materials and parts to fix broken equipment and structures around the planet. Powell and the Captain will give us hints on how to use the parts, and from those hints we will craft makeshift sensors and explosives.\n\nCreepy Atmosphere – Descent to Deadrock has a truly creepy feel to it. Stone statues of unknown origin watch over a sandy wasteland. Wrecked ships and dead bodies are strewn about the desolate planet leaving only the mystery of how they died. It creates a tense sensation while you search for a means to escape.\n\nAverage Points\n\nDem Graphics – The visuals are very 1998, and that would be acceptable if not for the stillness of the game play. It reminds me of older games like Shadowgate or Déjà Vu. You are mostly watching a still image that only reacts when you interact with a puzzle piece. I wouldn't say it’s bad, but it could use a touch of life to the environments. Wind blowing the sand, the Captain struggling to breathe in his suit, anything that makes the world feel alive.\n\nLow Points\n\nVoice Acting – The voice acting for the main character isn't awful, but it’s not very effectual or interesting. It’s clear that this person is just reading his lines off a sheet of paper, and not trying to inject emotion to the situation at hand. The Captain of the ship provides hints and information and he’s actually worse than the main character. I found it difficult to care about the situation when the characters themselves don’t seem to give a damn.\n\nClickity Click – Morningstar is an adventure game that’s a bit too far in the past. You will swirl around the cursor on the screen looking for places to interact with. The game gives you some reasonable tells to solve most puzzles and even a nice hint system. However, there are still places where you’ll have to just randomly click on items to solve a puzzle.\n\nShort game – You can beat this game in 3 to 4 hours even after all the random clicking. You can just plow right on through to the ending sequence without much of a problem. The ending is anti-climactic as well, and it never really solves a few of the mysteries on the planet.\n\nConclusion\n\nMorningstar: Descent to Deadrock hearkens back to the olden days of adventure gaming. It is light on animation and the voice acting is only tolerable. I recommend that only fans of the adventure genre invest in the short but eventful game play. If you’re not a fan of the adventure genre it isn't going to convince you to join the genre, and the bad voice work and older design might just scare you off.","February 18, 2015","true","3.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

There are no frustrating pixel hunts to stress you out.\n\nThis simplistic approach is  quite refreshing and  allows you to focus on the titles main selling point, the story.\n\n\nA Tale With Impact\n\nDescent to Deadrock tells a compelling and mysterious tale.\n\nThe game opens with your ship crashing onto a seemingly barren desert planet. There are only two survivors, the ships captain  "Novak" and You!\nNovak, like the ship itself, is in a bad  way following the crash, so it's  going to be down to you to find the items you'll need to try and repair the ship and hopefully escape the planet.\n\nAlong the way you'll scratch the surface of some of the mysteries Deadrock keeps.\nDon't expect full disclosure though, Deadrock holds its secrets tightly and your main goal here is to escape the planet, there will be unanswered questions after you complete this game.\n\n\nFinish Him\n\nAnd complete it you will...\nIt's the strong intriguing story that'll keep  you playing though the couple of hours required to complete Morning Star.\nYou'll probably finish it in one sitting, which isn't necessarily a  bad thing.\nThere's a lot to be said for a bite sized, focused tale that completes its story arc in two hours.\nA movie gives us a couple of hours entertainment and that is exactly what you'll get here, two hours of sci-fi mystery interspersed with some exploration and problem solving.\n\n\nStatic Atmosphere\n\nBased on an old flash game, this outing of Morningstar presents itself mostly as static screens where you'll be searching for and using items to either fix machinery or get past obstacles.\nThese static visuals are nothing if not atmospheric, the stillness in each location creates a sense of tension and isolation as you explore your crashed ship and later the surrounding area of Deadrock.\nDue to all this stillness, when animation is used, it has a much greater impact than you'd imagine.\n\nThere are also some cut scenes, not many, but they are very effective in pulling you into the moment, I just wish there were more of them.\n\n\nDid you hear that...\n\nThe game is fully voiced, and whilst the voice acting isn't going to win any awards, it is competent enough to keep the story moving forward without breaking the immersion.\n\n\nGoing Down?\n\nShould you get Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock?\n\nThat depends on what you're looking for in a point and click adventure game.\n\nIf you're looking for an epic, sweeping tale to lose yourself in for weeks, challenging puzzles and state of the art cut scenes, then no, Morningstar isn't that game.\n\nHowever, if you're looking to invest a couple of hours in an enigmatic sci-fi setting, enjoy some thoughtful but not too challenging puzzles and be entertained in an encapsulated narrative experience, then you could do a lot worse than spend an evening with Morningstar.\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","March 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

While there is no time limit to the game, the atmosphere conveys a need to progress through in order to escape as soon as possible.  The voice acting is pretty bad, making it hard to push through, but as you play through the game, there is less dialogue making it easier to stomach the farther you get in the game.\n\nThe story is decent, and does a good job of connecting you to the character that you pay as, but it is the gameplay that makes this game worth playing. You need to find items as you progress through the world and combine these items in different ways in order to progress forward. It doesn't feel like a scavenger hunt, as so many adventure games do.  The game didn't hold my hand as I went through, but it did use  puzzles and items in such a way that I had to use my brain, and work to solve the problems (even through the hint system is tied well into the story and doesn't make you feel like a cheater). This made me feel more like the character that was portrayed rather than some 3rd party player, thus why it may of added to the difficulty at times, but this also help set a stronger atmosphere.\n\nThe game was solid and sensible, and I enjoyed playing this game despite its few flaws.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\n\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","March 17, 2015","true","3.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

Funny thing is that perhaps that's not completely true, but you are going to have to find your way through this point click adventure to find out what this planet has to hide, and are you going to be able to get off this planet in one piece.\n\nMorningstar: Descent to Deadrock is by Red Herring Labs and will take you on an hour and a half ride where you will get to explore this "Dead Rock" and try to find anything and everything you need to potentially get off of the planet. You will have to combine items, find items, and fix issues in order to advance the game.\n\nThe one thing that I can honestly say that ended up bugging me about the game was the EXTREMELY deadpan voice of the lead actor in the game. He definitely had the almost monotone approach of not getting a damn about anything as well as never being shocked or excited about anything. That's not to say that the other voice actor was that much better, but at least they gave a little bit of feeling to the game.\n\nI liked the look of the game, and it was pretty straightforward in how you navigated around. You are going to see almost always 1 single view of a room or an area, there might be deeper parts of the area/room that you can explore and get a new vantage point on, but this is definitely not a game where you are going to have to search every nook and cranny to find what you are looking for.\n\nOnce again, perhaps its my time away from point and clicks until recently, but there is a hint system in place, and it was good to see that it was actually useful with out making me feel dumb. There were a couple of times where I struggled to find out what to do next, but thanks to the hint system I was able to easily get back on track.\n\nI can honestly say the further I got into the game, the more I actually got into the game. What I mean to say is that it took me a little bit of time to find the pace, but when I finally found the pace of the game I was ready to move. It was unfortunate that once I got up to speed I found the end of the game, but hey it says something that I had no issue of playing the game straight through.\n\nSo I guess the question now is should you get this game... Well I think if you are looking for something light, has a futuristic space theme, is a point click adventure built around survival, you are going to enjoy this game. As I mentioned before the only big issue I had with it was the voice acting of the main character, and before anyone asks, there are really only 2 voice actors, so that sort of didn't do it for me, but then again it wasn't like he talked the entire time.

It was entertaining enough to play for the time it lasted, but it's short (about two hours), the voice acting is abysmal, and the story is not particularly gripping or compelling. The great mysteries of the planet never really get plumbed, many of the puzzles have solutions that strain plausibility, there's an awful lot of pixel hunting (the only part I finally looked up in a walkthrough turned out to hinge just on me having not seen a hot spot on the screen -- once I was alerted to that, it was fine), and not LOTS of try-this-with-that, but not none either. All of these design issues will be familiar to, and probably reasonably okay with the seasoned fan as mentioned above, but likely frustrating to anyone who isn't used to dealing with such things regularly.

Although you run across dead crew here and there, the game wasn't too gory and annoying, except maybe the captain's initial condition.\n\nThe voice work ranges from very good to quite poor, usually it's quite good but it boggles me when a voice actor doesn't know which word receives emphasis in a phrase... I can only imagine it's a general lack of reading proclivity. It happens in many games with voiceovers and this one more than usual. Still, most of the time it's fine.\n\nThe puzzles are generally easy but fairly satisfying. It's mostly linear but you do get to roam a few locations sometimes to look around and try things.\n\nThe rapport between the captain and protag is mostly good but a little cheesy at times. And a bit of animation on the captain woul have helped, it felt like you were talking to a painting at times.\n\nAnyway I enjoyed it and finished it in 2 sittings. There was only one poor puzzle part I got stuck on, the ventilator near the generator.\nBut I can recommend this as a nice, short point & clicker.","August 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So this review is a bit more a compare between old and new.\n\nFirst what you get in both:\n\nThe game has a nice story and a great atmosphere with good voice-acting. It´s a point-click game with a nice intro. If you played the old one and know the solution, you will do this here in an hour or two, without maybe 3-4, more would be annoying, because there are not so many things to do or many places.\nWhats different:\n\nThe story is a bit extended, but it´s just some kind of more task to do to the end. It´s a bit odd and I expected more. Also there are one or two more puzzles within the game....compared to the original flash game not that much more content.\n\nThe voice-over has better quality, but was also ok in the flash-game.\n\nThe Videos/Animations and Graphics are far better and of course deserve the flag "HD", but the flash version felt in some cases better....especially dark areas...the slight "fear"-factor is in the flash-version better, the graphics in the new version are often to clean. i liked drawing style more than those  a bit dull renderings.\n\nIn the flash version you scroll by moving the cursor to the screen edge. Those pictures have a perspective/are curved and that gave you a bit 3d-illusion . In the new version you have just fixed pictures, nothing to discover by scrolling.\nand...now?\nIt´s ok...but not worth 10 Euros...yes the old version has less resolution, but it "felt" better while playing.\n\nWhat I would recommend\nif you played the flashgame and enoyed it, you can grab this game on a sale...but more for your collection.\n\nIf you don´t know the flashgame, you may get this one here on sale or of course, still the flashgame for free.","June 10, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you've played a few games in the genre, you know what to expect; you'll wander around, collect some items, try to combine them in logical ways, and when that doesn't work, try to combine them with anything interactable.  You might encounter some logical leaps, or other mini-puzzles along the way.  If that's not for you, stay away from this title.\n\nThere's lots of this type of game available on Steam, though, so how does this one in particular stack up?\n\nIn my opinion?  Very well!\n\nFirst, the atmosphere is spot on.  A sand-covered world filled with scraps of twisted metal, weird alien structures, and the corpses of the unfortunate, Deadrock gives just the right amount of sci-fi macabre I'd expect from the title.  Add in a handful of really great-looking cinematics, and you've got yourself a nice little experience.\n\nAnother major plus is the banter between your hero, and Novak, an injured smart-alec captain who serves as your point-of-contact during your exploration.  Major props to his voice actor, who got a lot more chuckles out of me than I'd expect from a game like this.\n\nThe adventure is a short one, and falls a bit on the easy side.  However, one of the reasons the game feels easy is because all of the puzzles feel like they make perfect sense, which is SO refreshing.\n\nThere's no BS acheivement hunting in this game; what you see is what you get, and completing the title will earn you 100%.  And that 100% will be all the sweeter because the ending of this game is without a doubt extremely satisfying.  This is definitely worth a playthrough.","December 23, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/339130/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1846 products in account","Originally posted at http://www.apochs.net/2/\n\nMorningStar: Descent to Deadrock is one of the latest point-and-click adventures to hit the PC/Steam marketplace. However, this independent title is one that may very well sneak under many a fan of the genre's radar. It was developed by the relatively new studio Red Herring Labs (Nocran Space), which was then picked up for distribution through Phoenix Online Studios. The game itself is touted as being in the category of "Atmospheric First Person", placing you in a nightmarish struggle to escape an alien planet in one piece. It also happens to be a remastered version of the older PC title MorningStar. But does this updated entry stand as a good modern take on the style, or is it nothing more than recycled cliche's that are far from enjoyable?\n\nThis story follows one of the ship's crew mates named Powell. He and the captain are the only survivors of a simple mission, having crashed on the alien planet referred to as Deadrock. You are tasked to not only help your superior officer, but also repair the engines in order to escape. Of course, you don't have everything you need on board, and soon you are forced to explore the planet, as well as the remains of another downed ship and deceased crew. However, the more you explore, the more the mysterious stone heads scattered about become an ominous sign that you are not alone.\n\nThe game mechanics are just about as traditional as the story itself. Other than fantastically developed and rendered cut scenes for the opening and closing, much of visuals are images that only move when you interact in a way that would affect them, such as removing or opening a door, causing a device to explode, or simply picking an item up to keep in your inventory. The puzzles require you to find the right item, often in order for you to progress like going outside or to replace necessary fluids to help you survive the long trip back home, as well as require a number of things you will need to put together in order to solve said puzzle or create some crude replacement part when necesary. Sometimes these combinations are a bit cryptic, but you can always call your injured higher up on the radio and get a hint as to what to do next.\n\nOn top of that, it's nearly impossible to miss investigating every little object you can interact with. Much like calling for assistance, this does detract from some of the difficulty in the game, which only comes in one mode: Casual. But, by the time you finish, you'll realize this wasn't meant to be that perplexing. There are some times, however, when you can overlook things like codes or patterns later on thanks to clues that don't really point you in the right direction. This is a major issue later on (one that made me spend an hour running between three different rooms cursing up a storm as to why the planetary sequences wouldn't do anything to the main device in the ship), though it has been kind of fixed thanks to updates that hit around the time of launch. These improvements mostly factor into the keyboard you enter the sequences in, making it a little easier to do so, as well as removing the coding on the left side of the screen during the aforementioned cinematics (something that appeared in the game prior to release).\n\nAnd then there's the voice acting, which is as standard as everything else in this game. The cast literally sounds like they are just reading off cue cards, rarely adding an emotion outside of sarcasm, especially when insulting one another in a manner that seems only jovial due to the dire circumstances at hand. Powell will narrate basically every move you make, so the hum drum approach does grow tiring after a while, especially when you end up a bit stumped as to what to to do next. This is, sadly, the only real punishment for abusing the easy item system. You can try combining items or placing them anywhere at any time, as long as you're willing to hear the same bland dialogue over and over if it doesn't work. Other than that, there seems to be no major repercussions that I have experienced.\n\nBut, what it all comes down is if the game itself is fun, and, yes, it is. A lot of the charm from the original is still captured here, even with the new shine the modern darker visuals bring to the table. MorningStar: Descent to Deadrock doesn't set out to be anything but an enjoyable, casual point-and-click Adventure game that you don't need to put a lot of effort into, or worry about forgetting something important other than certain sequences later on. The only major gripe is that the mystery of those stone heads aren't really explored outside of logs you discover. A few more cinematic scenes also would have been nice to have, though their absence doesn't really impact the title negatively. But, everything functions just as it should, and there's just enough going on to keep the player engaged for the roughly two hours that this little quest ends up being. MorningStar: Descent to Deadrock won't really appeal to the seasoned veterans of the style looking for a more serious experience like the Tex Murphy games or The Dig, but this simpler and refined offering is a great way for nowcomers to the style to get their feet wet before moving on to some of the more challenging titles out there. Regardless of your experience level, this is a game worth checking out, though you might want to wait until it goes on sale given the length.\n\nScore: 6/10","February 21, 2015","true","3.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I purchased this in the hopes of finding a spacey adventure game with an intense atmosphere like that of The Dig (both involve mostly solitary exploration of strange, desolate alien environments), but was left distinctly underwhelmed by the game in general. It's diverting enough, with enough mileage to absorb somewhat for a few hours, but the plot and characters are basic and lacklustre. There's also no real climax/resolution to the game - while there's a confrontation, it's expected and occurs as a cut scene that is over quite quickly, so there's no real sense of being in real danger at any point or discovery of anything really shocking. The voice acting is rather poor, with some lines read as though the actor doesn't fully understand their context.\n\nOn the plus side, the environments are nice to look at (although largely static - the only other character in the game doesn't move) and the puzzles are generally logical and don't require very large leaps of logic, although they're not particularly sophisticated or imaginative, either.\n\nOverall, an easygoing, but ultimately forgettable, few hours.","March 8","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The setting is developed just enough to keep you going, but no questions are answered.\n\nApparently, there is a free Flash version of the game present on sites like Kongregate and Newgrounds, so you can try it there first. 9 Euros/Dollars for this might be a bit overpriced.

Think Myst but with simpler puzzles and lots of combining inventory items. Most of the time the puzzles take the right amount of thought to sort out, though it took me forever to figure one out. Another pre-supposed that you had an idea what went in to gunpowder, which I luckily did. There isn't really a way to fail or die though, so trial and error is safe and will get you through the game. Sometimes his hints seem to be so general as to not help you at all, however.\n\nStory\nThe story is written well enough to hold my interest for the 1.7 hours it took to beat, but the voice acting is somewhat amateurish. The main character is fine, but the only other voiced character, Novak, has an accent that swings from Swedish to Russian to Spanish, which can be irritating.\n\nOverall\nThis is an ejoyable game with good story and somewhat dated graphics.\n\nIf you're looking to buy it I'd wait for a sale; $10 seems a little steep for 1.7 hours of gameplay that you most likely won't repeat. I even got all the acheivements on the first playthrough. Maybe look for it to show up in a bundle, too.

You can get a few hours out of this game, and none of it is particularly difficult. Showing a lot of love from the old-school point-and-click days, all of the backgrounds appear to be hand-painted, which only adds charm as far as I'm concerned. The inventory system is easy to use and you'll need to drag some items onto another item to create a new item. Not all of these combinations are obvious, so you might end up trying a few things; but none of it leads to frustration.\n\nThe story itself isn't bad, but it feels like a lot of disjointed ideas that are thrown together. For example, one area shows an alien that's been stabbed to death in a hidden room and supposedly the body is still warm, meaning that it's a very recent murder. Nothing of this situation is ever resolved. The alien is never identified, the murderer is never revealed, the reason for the murder is never established, and there is nothing to link it with the rest of the story anyway. So, why bother introducing them in the first place? Also, human technology just so happens to be compatible with alien technology. That's quite a coincidence.\n\nWhat made this game difficult to get through was the voice acting. Oh, dear God! It's by no means the worst I've ever heard, but that's not saying much. It's bad! "Reading lines while utterly bored" might be more appropriate.\n\nStill, the artwork, the semblance of a story, and the throwback to the days of classic point-and-click gaming made this worth playing. You might want to turn the speech off, though.","November 27, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
