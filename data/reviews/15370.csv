This series spans back to my early childhood.    The Heroes game I played the most  was WOG, a custom expansion for HoM&M3.  I loved this series and logged countless hours into these games.  They are indepth yet easy to pick up, hard most of the time unless you are a seasond vet.\n\nBuild up your town.  Recruit Troops (this version allows upto 7th level units). Upgrade your buildings to get bounses, like resorces, spells, or your creature dwelling. In HoMM5 you can select from 2 differant upgrades for each creature type.  You have a army that is lead by your hero(s).  On the map you will be just one person, but if you attack a creature stack or another player the map closes in and you switch to battle.  This is simalar to RPGs where u wander around a map and you trigger combat then cut screen, there is your party ready to kick some butt.\n\nThis game allows may differant types of combonations with town faction/hero selection/creature types/pre-gen maps/campain.\n\nNew Features include the single player campain where you play as the orcs, and i think the 'caravans' are new to this expainsion.  Caravans can be selected where you hire creatures and there u selecet where you want your guys from and the caravans will farry you troops from creature dwellings or even other towns.\n\nI must also point out this game does have some flaws.  First I mention the AI, to be honest the AI in heroes games has never been the best and this game is no exception. Many people claim that the normal setting is "Comp doesn't even try" (Yes they will even not capture resorce nodes, and be crippled by larger maps).  Also people claim the hard setting is "Comp Cheats way to much". Don't be upset, they are fan made mods that tweeks the AI so its more cunning and less cheating.  The random map generator built into the game is poor compaired to previous games.  Lack of teams is the biggest issuse, for multi player games.  If your playing single player the random map gen is fine. NOTE: the time for the computer to move on random maps seems to take extreamly long time even with a 'newer' computer.  YET AGAIN, fans of the Heroes games shine through as I have found 2 other random map gens, I've only used one and it worked great, but the comp lag remaind.\n\nThe best things I like about this game, caravans (YAY), the gfx (not the best but better then earlyer Heroes), the camera controals(feels natural, smooth when combined with arrow keys), balance (like most heroes games there is no horrid balance issuses), and the community (you will have to resort to the web for forums,)\n\nHeroes games have a place in my heart and this one is no exception.\n\n9/10","June 25, 2015","true","218.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","1"

The story is a continuation of the first one's (which was very good)  and the mechanics that run the game are well made. You can even play the game online either against other players or coop with your friends. It also has a built in mode online called Duel mode where you and your opponent each get a premade fully developed army and fight to the death with them. It is very quick and alot of fun to play as each of the heros are well balanced and have there own quirks in this mode. If you feel ambitious you can even make your own armies for duel mode and even custom campaigns and maps with the map editor. It is a very fun title and has given me hours of enjoyment.

Some challenged nodes like "+1 luck to all owner's heroes" or an architect's hut that gives some discount on buildings in owner's towns or allows to build twice per day would be nice. Alas\n- Overabundance of creature abililies makes combat very varied, but you'll have no idea what many of those abilities actually do even when you use them, because their effects are not stated anywhere in the game. There is a fan-made manual for that though.\n- AI is not very I\n- Random map generator is still quite glitchy\n\nP.S.

Some of the major additions is the two types of each tier of soldiers that you can recruit, and of course adding an additional faction, the Orcs, while not losing many of the great features in Heroes V that were lost in the Hammers of Fate Expansion.

The only game before it (for me) was HOMM 3, And no, not the peice of s**t HD remake, but the original, CD PORT.\n\nHOMM on its own was a really shallow lot of cool but also very bland gameplay, enjoyable but not mindblowing amazement, however, this expansion to the HOMM 5 library makes every nerve in my body tingle. Not only do we have stronghold which is now probably the most amazing race to play, but overall,  has a fun mechanic which rewards you for being aggressive as all hell.\n\nIn short, it's a must buy for anyone who has any patience and love strategic games, I believe anyone can get into this game in particular. HOMM 3 can't do that to people, that takes nerves and a lot of spare time. Crack this one open when you are bored, you learn the mechanics in literal seconds, and you're good to go.\n\nGR8 game m8 8/10","October 4, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is worth buying!!\n\nOnly downside is it graphic is a bit old... but gameplay is awesome!!","May 27","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
