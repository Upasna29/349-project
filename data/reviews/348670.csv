This game has max 6 people online for a half hour, then goes dead on the north american server. People can build walls around your bed to trap you in if you die and it's seems to be geared towards this. I played not killing anyone and kept 100% karma most times that makes you a saint and immune to other players trying to kill you, so they will just run you over with the jeeps even in the safe zones and that kills you- defeats the whole purpose of being a saint.  I will change my review if the developer decideds to do something about these issues. I think the lack of content and these issues are the reason why only a hand full of people play this game.","March 17","false","78.5"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","27","37","2","5"

Reviews that have 16 minutes in game are not worth the bytes they are wasting on Valve databases.\n\nCurrently the game is a bit empty but it can be expected (from time to time you will see other people and talk to them).\nIf bugs exist then they are really really not game changers (mostly just animals running away into the sea).\nThere is a lot to do and a lot to explore. Those that played the game for 16 minutes and tell you it is boring and there is nothing to do except chop trees, I chopped trees in the tutorial and maybe 2-3 trees ever since and I am still selling wood to the NPC. I have 18 hours on record and have only visited like 4 different cities, like 3 other places with crates and a bandit base, out of about 12 cities and bases or so.\nThe game is fun and pretty much one of the better early access games I bought.\nAnother thing I must add, the dev is really nice and takes into consideration all suggestions brought to him.\n______\n\n11/11/15 update:\n\nSo lately the game is far less empty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/348670/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nImmune is a very early access survival game. There's you, there's zombies, there's friendly and unfriendly NPCs and, sometimes, there's other players. I say sometimes because the game is still very new and very raw and thus there's not a lot of people on, or stuff to keep people hooked.\n\nThe game itself has a simple premise so far: you're trying to survive post zombie apocalypse. You look around for food and resources, you kill/escape zombies, you hopefully team up with people to survive. There's a few things you can craft, you can plant a couple things, you can go through boxes and stuff, and you can punch trees (and other stuff) for resources.\nThere's not much of a story, not that I've seen yet anyway, but it's a nice game so far. Simple, obviously has a long way to go still, but promising all the same. It was a bit hard for me at first to get on my feet, but once I got a friend to play with it was a lot easier and faster to get resources and share them.\n\nThe game played well in my computer, which I deem a toaster.\n\nOf course, because it's early access, there's not much content yet, things still need modifying, and what you see now might not be what you get in the long run.\n\nDownsides:\n- Not a lot of variety on stuff (only a few types of food, only a few types of stuff to craft, amount of items needed to craft stuff seems a bit odd at times)\n- Cars super hard to handle with the drifting\n- Servers can get a bit kick happy sometimes, also they are new so they're mostly empty (which can be both good and bad)\n- Seems a bit difficult to hunt stuff when you're soloing (zombies are too strong for someone with just a stick, evil npcs kill you asap too)\n- Characters lack variety (no choosing gender, they all look the same, but at least they're cute)\n- You can not move stuff once you place them down, some stuff have very short durability (like crops, walls)\n\nThese are all stuff that could be easily fixed (and probably will be, or will at least change) as the game progresses, though, so I wouldn't just discard the game for it.\n\nUpsides:\n- Cuteish graphics\n- Actually nice to co-op with friends\n- You can use the cars found around!\n- You can loot your own backpack if you get back to where you died (thus recovering your stuff) :)\n- You can make current buildings into your own safehouse\n- The developer replies quickly to issues, and he's very nice and friendly\n\n\nImmune still needs a lot of work, but for early access it's not a bad game (I mean, responsive developer and mostly functional game. I've seen worse in early access!).\n\nI still don't know that it'd be worth full price in its current state, but this could become quite a fun little-big survival game!","March 25, 2015","true","7.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","2"

The developer is very approachable and appears to enjoy hearing community feedback. He is also very transparent about the development as he posted his trello page (linked below) so that any and all can see the progress and where things stand.\n\nhttps://trello.com/b/CRV1xeII/immune-survival-online-game\n\n\nRegarding death in Immune.\nIf you are not one who likes to lose progression or items this game could induce rage. When you die you do lose rank (experience) and can de-rank. Also if your backpack is full up to 4 items will be lost. I did not ask but assume it is because the 4 slots of equipped items auto move into the backpack space so 4 items don't have a place to drop into.\n\n\nIf you are reading this review wondering about how much content is here I will give fair warning that a little more than half the map is currently blocked with an under construction blockade. (screenshot below). That said, the developer's intentions are to add/fill the existing space before opening up even more space with little content.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/348670/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nI will start by saying Immune is an early Access game, so take that into consideration when reading my review.\n\nImmune identifies itself as a Massively Multiplayer Survival game. The game has been released almost two months at the time of writing, and when I booted it up, I found I was the only person online. Like all the other survival games out there today, you are thrown into the game to literally just survive, there are no missions, quests or tasks to complete, it‚Äôs just an open sandbox, you create your own story/challenges.\n\nImmune is one of the first games of this genre that I have played, and I have to give them credit, their tutorial is actually quite good, it's very basic, but it does well in explaining the key mechanics such as chopping down trees and making simple items such as camp fires. Sadly though, the tutorial is probably the only small gleaming positive coming out of Immune at the moment. Once you finish the tutorial, you are thrown onto an island, with no sort of guidance as to what to do, you are just out to fend for yourself. I wandered around for a while and found absolutely nothing to do. Nothing at all. Okay I chopped a few trees down, then what? Build a fire. Ok....in order to build anything remotely interesting you need to chop trees down constantly for half an hour...\n\nThe graphics are poor compared to other games of this type, it can be played at higher resolutions, but really, there is no point, it still looks the same in lower resolutions. There is no music, the sound effects are also none existent also, at one point I had to tab out of game because I thought I was muted, nope, just no sound.\n\nThe controls are also horrible too, space bar is your attack button? To me that just shouts out as an issue. I mean, it would be a little redeemable if they incorporated mouse controls, I mean we are playing on PC right? All of the controls just feel wrong sadly. Don't even get me started on attempting to drive the one truck I managed to bump into, the control on this thing was terrible, and the physics...well, there are none, I was driving, then suddenly I started sliding, it was just awful. I finally quitted the game when I was driving, hoping to be able to get through what looked like a small pool of water, only for my car to explode on impact of even touching the water slightly.\n\nThe idea behind a MMO Survival Game is really good, the likes of Rust have done really well out of it, but right now Immune is in no state to be played, and especially for the price of ¬£12,99. Maybe wait a couple of months while this is still being worked on and maybe some more content and fixes will be in place.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

But i have yet to do that.\nI would like to custome my guy like change is facial expressions like maybe mad eyes or beard or something. But there is no custome mode in this game. No pants to change . The feet you take 100 steps your shoes break. I dislike that. But other than that the armor and guns they all lose 1% each time they are hit or used. Unlike other game you do not have a few round to shoot per 1%, thats the only 1 shot you get.\nUsing the shovel, It can be tricky and its something i had to figure out on my own. So for those who do not know how to use it, ask around or come find me on North America and ill help you out.\nSometimes you cannot get out cars when servers are laging or need to be reset, that could be due to the early access part im not sure.\n\nBut those are all small things, there is a'lot to do on this game its better to invite friends to play with you. If you buy the game get the 4 pack and invite your friends take over an area and lets play. I welcome everyone to North America we need more players on that server. One small tip if you are reading and unsure on if you should buy this game or not. Do not expect this game to be #1 game you play. If you do you will get bored and give up. This is a game i love to play but its easy for me to stop playing because its so basic on what to do. There is not any other games that have my interest right now and im tired of playing my old games. So with that said, if you buying this game, i promise you will enjoy it everyday when you are bored, or if you need a break from your main game you play. But this is a game you want to buy and its worth more than the price they are asking. Its a good buy and a good deal thumbs up to the makers :)\n","February 1","true","150.7"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

Sooo slow, sooo clunky.  Movement is frustrating.  Combat is frustrating. Interacting with anything is frustrating.  Using the inventory is frustrating.

I liked the crafting, scavenging, collaborative play you can have as you and friends search the landscape for food and supplies. It definitely felt good getting enough crafting material to build my first weapon and some armor. Plus not sure I have played any other game where i had to chase down a chicken so i could harvest the meat and the feeling of victory of killing it.\n\nOn the bad side this game does have some quirks to it. Granted it is still early access so problems are going to arise and be present that will hopefully be fixed. between enemies not dropping loot sometimes, to killing a guy who is shooting a gun at you, but getting nothing. Makes me feel a break in the survive mentality. If i kill someone who is using a gun that gun should be on them or at least ammo.\n\nCrafting is another aspect i am looking forward to seeing what is coming. There are a number of good items you can make, but when you hit the highest level as of now, it kind of makes you wonder if carrying all your crafting supplies is needed once you make the items that can help you.\n\nOverall Immune is fun and has a lot of potential. I am definitely looking forward to the updates coming and see where the game goes from here. I have a more in depth review linked here. http://www.omnicomic.com/2015/05/review-immune.html if you want to see more of my thoughts on the game.","May 20, 2015","true","4.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Despite being, when it comes down to it, a pretty gritty survival game where players are put up against both zombies and human foes in a fight to the death, the art style of the game is gentle and inviting. It‚Äôs a bit of an odd pairing, and in some regards it brought my thoughts back to games like Minecraft, where that same contrast of ‚ÄúOH ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• IM GONNA DIE!‚Äù and ‚Äúooh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs soothing‚Äù pervades the entire experience. Thankfully, to the developer‚Äôs credit, Immune is more than just a pretty face, and the game is honestly an enjoyable gem that does a great job of pulling away from the hordes (see what I did there?) of other survival games and providing an experience that is, above all else, fun.\n\nFor my full review, check out the article over here: http://shoddypixels.com/indie-focus-immune/","April 13, 2015","true","4.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

For those who've played their share of crafting games (like me), they're going feel right at home with this one.\n\nFor an early access game, you get a lot to do in this open world - driving cars, fighting zombies, raiding other players and taking over stuff all over the map! So there's plenty to do.\n\nMy only gripe would be that there aren't as many players on the maps as you'd think there'd be for a Multiplayer game like this. So some areas feel a little bare (albeit with the keeping of the game's 'feel')\n\nDon't see this being a problem in the long run though, since almost anyone - with pretty much any rig - can pick up the game and jump in!\n\nCan't wait to see what's to come :).","May 24, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Was this to be yet another bare bones, early access survival game destined to end up unplayed with the others? Then some real players showed up in a jeep, handed me some supplies, and away we went to loot and murder NPCs for their stuff. The community is tiny but awesome, helpful, and fun to play with. The developer is also a super nice guy that obviously loves what he's making here. After feeling screwed over by Reign of Kings and other cynical, survivor based games, I'm happy to play this little diamond in the rough with loads of potential. The art style is great, and the top-down feel evokes Zombies Ate My Neighbors and other games from my childhood. The price may be a little high, but I'm confident you won't care once you start to play with others. There are certainly some bugs and kinks to work out (driving is hillariously bad but fun), but the game remains stable.

I love survival apocalypse games! It tends to get a little boring after a while but none the less worth my 1$. I have been playing for around 8 hours and have some of the best items! There is usually a couple people online at all times. Sometimes there is around 10 people on one server which is awesome! You can raid and fight them or you can help them get good and fight along side them!

Immune is an amazing game and even with the lack of players. There is not much in the game yet but that's why it's early access. The Dev is open for ideas so just say things you would like in the game! The game runs very smooth most people wil get a solid 60 FPS during your play time.

In recent years, a lot of out of games in the genre of survival, and most of them are of the same type. But not in the case of "vidiludi games and entertainment"! These guys decided to add a little MMORPG genre, and turned not quite bad - given early access to the game.\n\n. Now, you will still earn your reputation, affecting relations with the NPC. Improve your rank \ level to open new recipes for crafting - filling experience by killing zombies or performing tasks. Many quests are regenerated randomly to help you quickly catch up on the top!\n\n. Attack the combat bases with zombies, these creatures are not just running around and bite stupid, even you can get in your head turn with the machine ... And the most interesting, not only from the player, and from the zombies and special negative NPC.\n\n. Unite with friends and conquer the servers! Build a base, grab things and ammunition, fend off other players in the preservation of its treasures ... The game is fun and very positive! And do not forget that the game is still in development, and be in the early access!\n\n--- In the end I recommend everyone to try this fun game and give 7 out of 10 drunken zombarey.

Immune does nothing to be better or different from any of them, and in some cases, does things worse.\n\nI played 9 minutes... sadly, that was all i needed to request a refund...\n\nThe camera angle and zoom level are terrible.  The art style is pretty decent though.  The minute you get into the turtorial, you realize there is nothing new here... start off wih a few wood things to craft, then wouldnt you know it, a few stone things.  I didnt bother to look at the next page of crafting, but id bet my life that there was a door or wall made out of metal.  Its just another survival game...\n\nAlso, its an MMO survival game, but very few players on.\n\nI dont reccomend it, but for 4.99, if you wanna do the same thing you do in every other survival game, go ahead grab it.  You can probably craft for a few hours and find it decent enough.","September 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/348670/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroduction\nWhat would you do in a post apocalyptic setting? Be a lone hero, form a group to survive with or maybe hide and wait for the sweet release of death? Immune is here to help answer that question for you. With little more than the shirt on your back, you will be thrust into life or death situations along with other players trying to survive.\n\nStory\nThere isn‚Äôt much of a story to speak of in Immune. You spawn as a generic character and after a few hints on newbie island you‚Äôre left to fend for yourself in a barren wasteland. All player generated characters look the same, no option to customize or change the gender, and there are no backstories at all. "I don‚Äôt even know where in the world I am nor what happened." The non-playable characters also offer no help as all they do is offer to sell you  things, give missions or try to kill you.\n\nGameplay\nNot having a story isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. This game is an open world multiplayer game so  the game is what you make of it. If you can find people to play with, you can build up forts and take down tougher enemies. If you can‚Äôt find anyone to play with you‚Äôll be wandering around aimlessly, freezing and starving to death. Then, once you die, you‚Äôll lose any items you had on you and wonder why you even bothered. The controls aren't very responsive and you move very slowly, there is also a lot of empty space so expect to be slowly walking through nothingness a lot. Unless you find the car...which might crash because it‚Äôs hard to maneuver.\n\nI didn‚Äôt get a chance to build anything, I had trouble finding material and even more trouble staying alive. I started the game with a stick that made a good weapon but lost it upon my first death, I couldn‚Äôt kill animals food because they moved faster than I did and all I had then was my fist. I finally found a new weapon but was then quickly killed by a nearby monster before I could even get the weapon into my inventory. I‚Äôm personally not the biggest fan of open world games but the amount of frustration involved with Immune plus the lack of other players really made it a chore to play.\n\nGraphics/Audio\nDespite any issues with the actual game I might have, I can admit it looks pretty good. You play from a top down perspective and you wonder through the 3D rendered world that has day and night lighting. The screen also changes by adding different tints if you‚Äôre hungry or hurt, adding to the urgency of the situation. There just isn‚Äôt much to see in the game, however; there are a few safe areas and a few action areas and then empty brown space with maybe a tree or animal if you‚Äôre lucky. The game so far has no music, just sound effects but some spooky atmospheric tunes would certainly help players become more immersed.\n\nPros\n+ The game is very cheap. You can buy the four pack for only $2.99 and drag your friends into the game.\n+ Multiplayer so you can play with others even if none of your friends are around.\n+ You can build structures in the game. Create your own fort and hide from enemies and other players.\n+ Or you can just attack other players and see who lives the longest in the game.\n+ Graphics aren‚Äôt bad and I like the day and night change.\n+ It has trading cards.\n\nCons\n- Unless you do buy the four pack you might not find anyone to play with, the servers are either barely populated or dead depending on which region you choose and the time of day.\n- Hats are the only way to make your character look different from other characters and they cost money.\n- Too much empty space with nothing to do or see and very little to explore.\n- Depends too much on multiplayer, very little reason to play alone.\n- Too easy to die and you lose everything unless you managed to squirrel it away.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis game is only in the Early Access phase so I do hope that the finished product will offer more to do and perhaps be more forgiving to players. A nice finished product will hopefully bring more people to the servers and unlock the true potential of this title. In its current state, however, I cannot recommend Immune unless you grab the four pack and try to make a go at it with friends.\n\nRating: 4.5/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.","February 25","false","5.4"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"
