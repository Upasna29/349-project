And you can mute it too! 7/10\nPlayability: Works fine with pad as well as keyboard, no gfx lags no sound lags, all good. Even when screen is full of chicken n eggs. 10/10\nGood pricing (4€) 12/10\n\nOverall 9/10\n.5 point deduction for me now having the strange urge to buy chicken wings...\n","March 6","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
