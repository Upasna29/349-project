Constantly and almost immediately respawning, it's clear the developers had little imagination as to where the game would go and instead made one intensely hard level that with enough practise you could likely complete in around 30 minutes.

I am happy to say those issues have been resolved and you can now play Dark Void Zero after inputting your serial. Still sucks we have to deal with third party DRM but its better than no game at all! Simply put Dark Void Zero is leaps and bounds better than the original game on which it is based. This is a super retro style game wherein it definitely feels and plays like a classic 8 bit NES game of yesteryear. You can jump and shoot and with the use of your trusty jetpack, fly and hover. Its a challenging and fun game with a decent (if not silly) story. If you like retro style games but they never quite feel retro enough...this game is for you!\n\nPS: Disregard my playtime. I played this game to near completion on my 3DS and just wanted to try it out on the big screen with surround sound and it plays exactly the same!

The reason being, this game handles as if it was designed in the early days of platforming, when game creators hadn't quite gotten the hang of how things should handle.\n\nThe movement of your character isn't abysmal, but using the jetpack is far from the joy it is in the previous (or...  later?) Dark Void game.  You can hold the jump button down to rocket, which is OK for going up, but the delay makes coming down tricky to control, or you double tap, which is probably the preferred method but has some weird quirks, like a slight bob that makes aiming while hovering trickier than it should be.  The controls overall feel oddly unresponsive. This combines with moving, which re-adjusts your aim, making you have to do a lot of fiddly jiggering to really point the way you want.  All the while, getting blasted by aliens.  This could have been fine if it were a dual stick shooter instead, but the way it is makes dodging and firing a real chore if you want to be safe.\n\nAnd you do want to be safe.  Because if you take a lot of damage, you WILL have a "low health" alert.  That goes on and on.  And is annoying.  This just adds to the likelyhood that this game really was created in the 80s.\n\nThe entire first level consists of collect keycard, open next door, collect another keycard, which is OK, but again, makes it feel dated.  I got to the first boss, and promptly lost all my lives.  And yes, since this is claiming to be an arcade game, having lives makes sense, but it feels just like worthless punishment here.\n\nFor a bonus, while it's not the WORST music, it sounds like Mega Man cast-offs to me, uninspiring stuff that didn't make the cut for their better tracks.\n\nI guess for me, they either really found this game and decided to do absolutely no modernization, or they concocted a story meant to play on nostalgia and went out of their way to make it play poorly.  I really hope it's the first, which is forgivable.  The thing about nostalgia is that, people would have had to play the game before now to have nostalgia for it.  Either way, poor mechanics without the memories to back them up are a disappointment, and make this game overall not worth it to me.","November 28, 2013","false","0.7"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","2"

The Nes era has come and gone so what exactly is the point of designing such a game in the modern era? Sure leader-board and achievements is all fine and dandy, but what about the gameplay and longevity? There is no randomization in the game, spawn points are the exact same in every playthrough, level and monster creativity isn’t really anything to write home about, and the game is insanely short at only 2-3 hours. The only reason to play this beyond the first playthrough is to score higher and get achievements.

It lasted for the moment when I tried to find it on some NES related websites and found nothing. What does that mean? Dark Void Zero have an amazing atmosphere and while playing, it really feels like old game. It bring so many good memories, when platformer games were simply and fun. It's not a long game, have only 3 levels and 3 boss fights, and if you are not begginer when it comes to this genre, you can complete this game in 1 hour. Is it hard? At first, on hard difficult level, but once you learn how to deal with enemies and boss, it will be piece of cake. I guess that's most fun thing in such a games. I can recommend this game to every platformer games fan, it's a great game.\n\nABOUT SecuROM DRM - not only the activation limit was raised up to 20 times, but you can also revoke activation limit in this game, check the guide in community hub. Still, it sucks that game which already have a DRM (Steam) are using another one, just to make lifes of us, gamers, harder.","September 28, 2014","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you crouch you will always shoot down, even though i have yet to encounter a floor that you can shoot through, and the jet pack wavering makes it hard to not fumble into obstacles. That harm you. And enemies can shoot through. That you can't. Also It has the arcade format of three lives then done, but unlike most of the games that are like it, you have no continue option.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Magil/recommended/45730/","Magil","Magil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Magil/","435 products in account","It's not a good game, nor a bad game. Supposedly a tribute to NES titles, but aside from odd choise of graphic filter and the soundtrack that screams "I wanna be Mega Man 2  to associate myself somehow with a popular and successful game", it really nails the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aspect of shovelware cash ins of yore. Which is weird, because *almost* everything that Capcom did during the NES era was gold.\n\nThe game has very stiff controls. You cannot aim effectively while moving, and taking aim directly upwards frequently has you aiming diagonally first, then firing one shot, then aiming upwards. Granted, you can aim directly upwards if you let go of your D-Pada and then press Up. But it's a hassle when you're already used to a fluid quarter circle motion that doesn't hinder you in other games.\n\nThe screenshots suggest that any given level is divided into several screens (with their respective transition), when in fact the entire level is displayed upon entering it. Conceptually, it doesn't sound bad. But having the camera follow your character at all times without staying fixed means being unable to see what is directly below you. since the camera is fixed at an angle where your character is always in the lower half of the screen instead of dead center. Good luck being able to see what is directly below you whenever you collect a weapon, as the developers decided it was a good idea to display a huge text message everytime you did, obscuring everything beneath your character's feet.\n\nIt's not THAT bad, though. Once you adjust to the bad controls (and even more awkward flying/hovering mechanics), it becomes a modest challenge. But the game is both too short (being only 3 levels long, with the same boss with minor upgrades being recycled), as it is too repetitive (every level consists of having you fetch keycards that open other parts of the level, which have more keycards that open more sections, until you run out of keycards and then you're made to walk half-way across the map to fight a boss).\n\nFortunately, the key activation issue that plagues the majority of the current reviews seems to have been resolved. However, further research indicates that you're ony allowed to install this game up to 20 times before you lose your license to the game, after which you permanently lose the right to play the game. There is a workaround available on one of the Community guides, but I thought it would be nice to mention it now so you keep this in mind.\n\nI would only recommend getting this game if it's 90% off, and you're terribly bored. It's really not worth your money or time otherwise.","October 19, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have any interest in this game, and if you own any Nintendo handheld from the DSi onward, buy that version instead. I haven't played the DSiware version, mind you, but from videos of gameplay I figured the PC version would be somehow better in it least resolution, but a better look at the graphics here only serve to the games' detriment; the native resolution on the DS makes it look as if it were a unique step beyond 8-bit, the 2 options (windowed and fullscreen)  on PC make it look like poor mockery of a NES game. One problem I have which I presume is present in both versions is that the sound design (other than the music) is inconsistent with the "retro" theme, with some sounds being appropriate and some just being poorly masked modern sound effects, which is jarring when noticed. I had to drag the windowed screen to a much smaller size to make the graphics decent looking, and also put the sound effects down to minimum and the music 3 notches above it - there was some definite oversight with whoever made the default options so bad. If you've made the same mistake of already buying this version of the game, this is at least the most optimal way to play it.\n\nNow, my biggest gripe with this port is the blatant removal of an integral feature: the map. The DSiware version gives it to you on the bigger top screen the entire time, like the DS Castlevania games. Here, Mr. Tesla is constantly referring to having updated your map, and THERE IS NO MAP. There isn't even a button to bring it up. You could argue that the map is unnecessary given how simple the map is, and maybe this is a direct throwback to Metroid I & II, but again, it is CONSTANTLY referred to in game, and those are the only games in the series that are too obtuse to play now without the use of a guide. I could have overlooked it here if they only removed that from the dialogue. That Capcom hasn't is obscenely lazy, and as a result, there is no justification for having released this game in the state it is in.\n\nI had no issues with the CD-Key, but it was still an unnecessary and inconvenient step in the process further defining this version as the inferior port.\n\nEdit: Nevermind, the M key brings up the map, which is explained nowhere and I had to find out online! Still can't recommend this version.","March 16","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
