Definitely worth the $5, but it falls short of something like Super Meat Boy.","April 10","true","0.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Overall, I enjoyed it, but I think it falls just a few notches short of what it's trying to be. It feels like it's trying to be a casual platformer while at the same time using hardcore mechanics, which is an awkward combination IMO.\n\nThe difficulty ramps up very fast, which isn't a bad thing on its own. I enjoy a good challenge. However, combined with VERY quick movement speeds and zero margin for error in most situations, it quickly became frustrating. Casual players will probably not stick with this one very long.\n\nGraphically, the game is elegant. It has some neat lighting effects I haven't seen in many 2D games. I turned off the blur effects (there was too much blur), and it bugged me that there was no anti-aliasing on the player character. You play as a slimy jelly creature, but the jagged pixel edges are very apparent as the character jiggles and morphs.\n\nA few tweaks to the mechanics and gameplay could turn this game from an alright platformer into an excellent one.

The controlls are tight now and the chalenges are exactly as they should be, chalenging :) Lots of great ideas have been put into the game. If these things intrest you im sure you will enjoy it! Also the developer have adressed all bugs and major issues that were in early release with the first update and im sure will be happy to fix any others that are found. The developer is very understanding honest and open minded and wants to make the community happy.","April 10","true","1.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","6"
