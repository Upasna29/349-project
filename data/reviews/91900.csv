So, complains about the "unrealistic physics" are just stupidity. It's like complaining that Mario Kart is not realistic!\n2nd, the game is too short. Now, it is true that there are too few tracks and too few cars, but the game actually runs very well with no bugs at all and it is actually fun for some fast destruction racing with friends.\nAnd 3rd, the graphics are not top quality. But in my opinion, they are good enough. (Actually, I just can't understand why people give so much importance to graphics on games. Fabulous graphics may impress you at first, but after some minutes you get used to it and your entertainment will actually rely much more on other aspects, not on the graphics, unless it's so bad that it hampers gameplay, which is rare and definitely not the case here)\nThough there are better titles out there, it's 44 metascore is simply absurd. This is not the first time I see a totally misleading metascore. I can't trust it anymore after this one.","November 25, 2013","true","2.3"," 153 of 177 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","153","177","0","5"

The goal here is to get the most kills while on a closed circuit track rather than winning a race. A simple make it to the finish line would be too easy. Since you want the most kills, if you're in first place you had best slow down and let the others catch up to you so you can wreck them. However, then you risk them overtaking you and the person in front always has the advantage when only one weapon is designed for a forward attack.\n\nEach of the game's twelve vehicles has their own set of three weapons. The front attack is usually something that shoots forward, the side attack sprays out mines of some sort and the back attack drops something. These weapons all do something slightly different. The childhood dreams school bus has a cow catcher that will throw a vehicle, the alchemist RV has an ooze gun. The logger has side saw blades, while another vehicle has mines that will throw you into reverse. The side and back attacks are temporary and disappear after a moment. When you use them a rear view camera appears so you can see if anyone hits them for your own fiendish glee. When you kill someone a notice pops up on the screen.\n\nYou can have all three of your weapons ready by driving through colored barrels. Blue is the side weapon, yellow is the front, red is the rear. Black barrels give you a random charge. Having three weapons at once makes you dangerous. In fact everyone here is dangerous. You need to watch your opponents for a red, blue or yellow glow on on each respective area. Well if there's a glow on their front you'll never see it coming. There is full camera control, but the problem is you need to rotate the camera to face behind you rather than a quick look behind you. Another shame is no indicator to warn you that someone is on your six.\n\nTo get into the lead position you have a nitro boost and a lot of it. If you run out, you can find more in green barrels, but otherwise it refills after a brief moment. This boost is more than a slow thrust, so there's no logic to using it. When you get a small amount of it, use it.\n\nYour vehicle has health, so getting hit with a falling log or running over ice spikes still gives you a chance of surviving. If you die, wreck or even respawn, you lose all of your charged weapons and keep what's left of your used nitro. So Post Apocalyptic Mayhem has good strategy rather than quick and crazy car combat.\n\nThe courses are designed to make use of this combat with several sections that break up a map into narrow stalls, larger areas and bottlenecks. Kills are almost guaranteed without quick thinking to play defensive and let others through a narrow corridor or nitro ahead and leave barrels or fire for the others to run through. There are several different paths with each track so you always have a chance of finding a safe path to get ahead.\n\nThere's an arcade mode that lets you play one track at a time, but I much prefer the apocalyptic challenge which has you playing all eight tracks back to back with a score after each one and a final score at the conclusion. This mode makes it feel like a deeper game even if its limited. The game does offer multiplayer online with ranked matches, but four years after a budget title's release means the game is inevitably dead for multiplayer. I would have enjoyed it, because medium felt easy and the hard difficulty while it was still fun, it was difficult to exceed second to last place.\n\nThe vehicles all have character and there's a wide variety each with their own stats for acceleration handling and mayhem.  You have nine unlocked from the start and can select between a pair of dune buggies, a little car with a unicorn head that has a giant twisting drill, another small nuclear themed car and a few others. You'll need to purchase DLC with the ice cream truck, 1950s squad car and classic tow truck. On sale, I'd go for it. I'd advise against smaller vehicles, because a smaller body size means its tougher to hit the barrels to get weapon charges.\n\nIf you think there's a balance to smaller vehicles having less body to hit with weapons, you'd be wrong, because the weapons really scatter out making them tough to avoid without stopping. The mines themselves are tiny and blinking, so they're tough to even see.\n\nThe game plays like a lot of other racers with a chase cam and I feel like the game was really designed with a 360 controller in mind. Everything is color coated to the controller, even the barrels. Its true arcade style racing with throttle controls of forward and reverse. There is a hard brake, even if I never had to brake. Slowing down to let opponents catch up just meant I had to let off the forward.\n\nNow that I've discussed the good, let's turn to the bad. The weight of each vehicle is so light it felt like driving a balloon with tires. Its difficult to stay grounded even in a logging rig, a school bus or an RV. There are a lot of jumps and ramps, but I'm talking about in general you can be driving on the walls. Coming down from a high jump can bounce you back up. Its ridiculous and it took me thirty minutes before I stopped laughing at the game and had some fun with it. You can also boost through the air, because your boost is a rocket rather than strict nitrous.\n\nAs for the graphics and art direction, it just looks faded and worn. I feel like I could enjoy the game more if the colors were bolder and it was more than a dusty covered look to them. I would say a dusty brown, but one of the eight courses feels little more than a happy winter wonderland of a previous course where rather than having brown sand blowing in the breeze its a snow dusting.\n\nAnother interesting thing is how much the demo or trailer plays in game if you wait too long in the menu. I enjoy when games have demos or trailers and it seems to be what's missing from games now, but it plays a little too often.\n\nThere's a lot working against the game despite all its positives. Its still far from a good game, but it was entertaining once I stopped laughing at it and found the strategy involved. In a sequel I would love more levels, more modes and a different, more vibrant art direction. I think a lot of people will hate it for how simplistic the weapons are with side, front and back coupled with the fact each vehicle's weapons are different and there are better vehicles.\n\nIf you find it on sale, take a risk.","September 22, 2015","true","2.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is a racing game, except honestly the racing doesn't matter. What really counts is the level of destruction you cause on the other drivers while racing.\n\nThe game comes with a variety of cars (ranging from an ice cream truck, police car, and more cynically, a mobile meth lab) that all play differently.  Each car gets three weapons, which are activated by finding colored barrels.\n\nGameplay is pretty straightforward.  Literally.  You just drive down the track, collect weapons, and make it hell for the other drivers.  If you can wreck another car, you get a point.\n\nMy big complaint about this is the DLC pack.  The additional vehicles are included in the game already as opponents, the DLC simply unlocks them as playable.  It is not particularly expensive, but it strikes me as somehow a part of the full game is removed and hidden behind a paywall.","December 3, 2014","true","12.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I am completely in awe of this game and I am so addicted to it. I love how the races always seem different even though I may use the same car with their own unique weapons. Every race is so unpredictable and you never know what's going to happen. This is a good distraction game for me and it makes me feel incredibly happy playing it. I can kill my opponents without the risk of getting arrested! Lol. Great music tracks to each race in the apocalyptic challenge mode as well as various cars with extremely powerful weapons. Some cars are better than others but I like to play with them all to make it even and challenge myself even more. You can play on easy which is not as easy as you would imagine but a good place to start if you are playing it for the first time. I like playing on hard. I love the challenges of the hard mode. What can I say. Good graphics, music, gameplay and interest. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in buying it. If you like fun and a challenge or 2, then this game is for you. You need to be on the ball and kill your opponents in order to get the most kills if that's what you like. There is no escape! I would say that it's sometimes difficult to play in multiplayer if you can't get any players to join but it's a good excuse to get your friends to buy it too!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/recommended/91900/","maghook","Maghook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/","1308 products in account","Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is a fun, arcade-type racing game where the goal is to destroy as many opponents as possible with a variety of weapon pick-ups. There are no laps and your position in the race does not matter, there is only a countdown timer that signifies the end of the match. Unfortunately, that simple description is where the fun ends.\n\nThe game is broken. Some vehicles are obviously better than the others and the ones that are lacking in certain areas are not awarded any compensation in the remaining aspects as you would come to expect. A vehicle that is extremely slow generally does not gain a weapon that can be used over distance, rather requiring you to home in on your enemy before launching an assault from the front, side, or rear. Vehicles faster than you can manage to "hoard" all of the pick-ups, leaving you with the frustrating realisation that you are crippled and unequal.\n\nFast vehicles have the advantage, even if they have horrible steering. Certain faster vehicles in particular have weapons that create an area-of-effect that can wipe out every opponent in a single attack. Unless you like the challenge it is simply unwise to select a vehicle that is slow and cumbersome.\n\nIn my short experience I've come to understand that the online matchmaking system and netcode is completely broken. There is no way to cancel a connecting session, you are simply forced to sit and stare at what might be a match being made or what might turn out to be a failed connection. Once you've successfully joined a game you might find yourself stuck in starting position, like stone, as you watch other opponents speed off only to look to the side and see another half-dozen opponents frozen in the same position as you. There is nothing you can do, the only course of action here is to force-close the game by using the task manager or through Alt+F4.\n\nI've also now discovered that if you check someone's "gamercard" while you're waiting for the match to start you will not be able to close the Steam overlay as it will continue opening the person's Steam profile over and over again. The only way to successfully stop this is to wait for the match to begin and close the overlay or simply force the game to close through the task manager, as the overlay prevents Alt+F4 from working most of the time. This is a massive oversight on behalf of the developer and who knows if bugs such as these will ever be fixed.","February 13, 2014","false","9.4"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","27","45","0","0"

The reason for this seems simply to be because the developers disassociated themselves from the Meridian 4 group for a period of time. Even during the absence of this game on the store page, the PAM community was still playing it, with their friends quite frequently.\n\nYou will also notice that this game has what seems quite an absurd meta critic review score 44/100 when you compare it to the large amount of positive reviews from the gamers themselves. One of the biggest complaints to the game is that it has relatively few levels 7 all up and a handful of cars 12 only which some are quite decent.\n\nThe game is best described as a Mad Max version of Mario Kart. The objective is to not only be the fastest around the track, but also the one who has the most kills. Hence it is possible to win the game even coming in third place or something as long as those in first and second place do not have more kills than you.\n\nTo help you get the kills each car is fitted with a wide arrange of novelty weapons which only activate by running over the corresponding colored barrels on the race track. Each car has a weapon that shoots from the side of the car, shoots behind the car and shoots in front of the car, there is also a turbo boost you can pick up. Each directional weapon is color coded to a corresponding barrel color. While this may sound complicated you will pick up the idea within the first lap.\n\nThe cars handle really well and the map courses are quite eye pleasing and somewhat versatile when it comes to terrain. When the game suggests mayhem it aint kidding. On the harder difficulties you will spend most of your time bouncing around the screen by all the explosions thanks to your enemies. The game caters single player, multiplayer and campaign.\n\nIt must also be noted that there is a large amount of achievements that are dedicated to the multiplayer aspects of this game, the frustrating thing is that there are few that play the multiplayer online, unless they are playing with friends. So if your an achievement hunter you may wish to seriously think about buying the multiple pack of this game so that you can play it with your friends. This game is definitely fun and really quite decent, having said that I would still recommend that you wait for it to go on a sale.\n\nSince the game was developed back in 2011, hopefully steel mokeys will one day stop scrathing and sniffing their behinds and give us more levels and dlc to please the players. There is serious potential here, but alas still only peanuts of material given.","September 16, 2015","true","9.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

It's succinct and straight to the point. Everything fits and makes sense and the controls serve it well. This is a problem as well as a benefit because it may lead to boredom from lack of variety for some, but the fact that the developers have a complete package with few flaws and tight gameplay holds value.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nThe most severe problems with PAM are the same universal problems that the vast majority of multiplayer racing games suffer from: the lack of persistent mutliplayer. After a certain amount of time all multiplayer games will suffer from this, and that's just part of the scene, but for a game who's best enjoyment comes from the multiplayer combat and blasting and racing with and against your friends, it's sad that it's pretty much dead just a few years after release and the absence of local mutliplay is definitely a black mark.\n\nSteam groups like PAM Multi may help to alleviate this and find people to play with, and the single player is still strong enough alone to have plenty of fun, but it's a big loss and may be a deal breaker for you, especially when compared against newer releases with similar mechanics and more players. If you have friends with the title or you're happy to blast around racing against the AI in single player then this probably isn't an issue for you.\n\nLack of content, specifically tracks and game modes is also an issue. With just an arcade racing mode, a slightly extended Challenge mode and only 7 tracks you can expect to explore all this game has to offer in a couple of hours. Yes, the game is simple chaotic fun, and the limited variety of vehicles and power-ups mean that every play will be slightly different, but it's still very much a one trick pony. The question is whether that pony is fun enough for you to ride on long enough to justify the price.\n\nRecommendations\nOn Steam at $9.99/£6.99/9,99€, Post Apocalyptic Mayhem is good value for money for a game you're likely to come back to time and time again. There's also a 3-Pack option on Steam, which offers a negligible discount, and two Next Dimension packs which offer their other less positively reviewed game I, Gladiator which should probably be avoided. There's also the Chaos Pack DLC which offers 3 additional vehicles. This isn't much, but the price is so low that it's a fair buy for those who have played through the game and still enjoy it enough to pick up some extra vehicles.\n\n* There's a well put together PDF Manual with some information on the vehicles, controls and more available here[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com].","March 30","true","2.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There's really no incentive for actually trying to race. The winner is determined solely by # of kills. At this point, why not just have a big arena? Make it a car combat game like the Twisted Metal series. Actually that wouldn't work because most of the weapons are designed for a racing game. It's a head-scratcher of the a design-decision, since it applies to the entirety of the single-player. There is a multiplayer mode for racing, but everyone is going to destroy each other anyway(or at least they would if anyone played this game online).\n\nAll that said, it isn't really a big deal. I'm just annoyed as hell because while playing the game I got hit with a nasty bug. At one point the game gets stuck on a loading screen. It stinks but it happens. I bring up the task manager, but the game pops right back up with its infinite loading. I try to bring up task manager again, and the loading screen comes right back. This freakin' game was trying to hold my computer hostage! I had to restart the PC just to get out of that mess. That little experience soured me on the entire game. As soon as everything was back to normal, I uninstalled this piece of crap with the quickness. I'm not saying it could happen to you, but what if it did? What...if...it...did?\n\nI wasn't feelin' it anyway. The game isn't even compelling enough to grind out a few achievements for. The loading-screen bug was the 2x4 that broke the camel's back.","October 2, 2014","false","1.2"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","0"

In fact you will not win if you keep trying to speed away from the others.

This game is not about racing. It's about war!\n\nThis one was once a small little gem, that was sadly overlooked and suffered from race quitters in it's multiplayer times. The game looks nice with a cool aesthetic and a good driving feeling. On release there were only three maps available which were fun to play. Thank to the devs a free DLC was released adding new content like two new maps and three new cars. The cars are well balanced starting from small fast ones to big slower ones. All cars have a front, side and a back attack. Every car has its unique crazy weapons which are activated by collecting power-up barrels on the race track. All weapons are fun and you should definitely try out all the cars with their weapons to better choose what car is best for you.\nIf this game is on a sale grab it! You won't regret it.

Everything in this game is very unique and stands out from other racing games; from the vehicles to the tracks, and of course the weapons. It is so much fun. This is by no means a realistic racing game and the laws of phyisics are thrown out the window, so if that's what you are looking for, look elsewhere. What this game is is a ton of fun. It's probably my favorite arcade style racing game I've played. All the tracks are unique, (from a Christmas themed track, to a cold war beach and an airplane graveyard) and the vehicals are just fantastic and all handle differently. My personal favorite is "Kitty With Claws." It may not be the fastest or the biggest, but I think it stears the best.\n\nYou have three different weapons at your disposal to create chaos on the track and take out other vehicals. Each weapon is replenished by picking up power ups laying on the track in the form of different color barrels. Each vehicle has their own brand of weapons and are very satisfying to use when executed correctly. The only problem is that there is hardly anyone playing online anymore. But I have had a fantastic time against the AI in all the tracks. Since I have always been terrible at racing games, (realistic or arcade style) I find playing on easy mode gives me a good enough challenge and still maintains its fun factor.

I can give you the nutshell:\n\nThe Ugly:\nINVISIBLE WALLS. And if they aren't invisible, the existing walls sure as heck have longer edges than what appears.\n\nTRAMPOLINE physics. No such thing? Might as well be. You launch yourself in the air with seemlessly "almost" zero gravity that you will more than likely fall of the track, lose all your pickups (which are not random and almost useless sometimes) OR bounce off the invisible walls, only to be facing the reverse direction which takes longer to spin yourself around and continue forward than it does to just push the "reset" button to have the game reset your position on the track (which is hella far away).\n\nPOOR CONTROLS\nI'd rather play outside in the snow naked right now. Sure it sounds fun in theory, but then come inside the house after all itchy and frostibitten. Then try pooping with a chapped butt. P.s. it seemed like every time i landed from "air time" that the car would immediately turn a hard left or hard right upon landing. So don't take large jumps, there's no reward for it other than the feeling of flight (but it's a racing game).\n\nThe Sadness:\nI was a fan of Re-volt, Toy Commander, Mario Karts (most of them), Rock n Roll racing, Death Race, Road Kill Rally (you bet!), Micro Machines racing (amazing!) and EVEN the long forgotten 360 game that was made by SEGA "Full Auto" (which failed to present a sequel on the 360 but continued on PS3).\n\nThis game would have been way better off choosing to either have a balanced mechanic for fighting WHILE racing OR just a Twisted Metal/Interstate clone. There is no point to the racing. It had potential at some point. I feel like the developers gave up or something. Maybe one of them quit? It happens. People are scumbags in the coding world (they all have egos).\n\nThe Good:\nBeing that this game was free, I still don't care for it. I just got it for the steam cards (sorry devs, but it's true). I just... I don't know. The menu looked okay, but WHY IN GOD'S NAME DID IT START ME IN THE LOWEST RESOLUTION POSSIBLE (240p)?\nWhat else... I don't know. The sound was used from stock sounds and borrowed from other games.

I got PAM for free as a limited-time promo from Green Man Gaming & noticed it had a low metascore which made me almost not get it, but reading some of the reviews changed my mind about this game! It's  unique because of the method of shooting - you have a frontal, side, and rear attack indicated by color (yellow = front, blue = side, red = back, & green = boost)\n\nThe only 2 problems I've had with this game are that the in-game Steam user interface (Shift + Tab) is laggy for some reason & sometimes while playing mulitplayer, you can't move at the beginning of the race (this only happened to me twice in my hour of gameplay) but to fix it, simply press escape and resume. Other than these 2 flaws, the gameplay is amazing! :D\n\nI rate this game 7/10 - you can drive a unicorn car named Kitty With Claws!","February 12, 2014","true","1.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Post Apocalyptic Mayhem has been collecting dust for quite a while and it looked (from the screenshots) that it would fit the bill perfectly.\n\nI really adore the over-the-top and entirely impractical vehicles of destruction; my personal favorite was immediately the school bus. I jumped immediately into the first course and, within 30 seconds, was really disappointed. The game performs lovely, and visually it may not be able to compete with the likes of Mad Max but it’s nothing to complain about. Had this been any other genre, I would say the handling was abysmal; however, the floaty and silly vehicle physics fit right in with the style. Here’s the problem: it is SO SLOW. And I don’t mean that driving a 4 ton school bus outfitted with steel plate armor was a bit sluggish. On the contrary, I flew past everyone else on the track with very little effort. The problem is that there is literally no sense of speed. If I had to guess the approximate top speed I reached, I would say roughly 50-60 MPH with the rocket boost held down. There was zero thrill to navigating the course. What disheartens me more is that the problem couldn’t be solved with a simple edit of the vehicle data files because the levels are clearly not designed for any faster speed.\n\nI loved the weapons and the vehicular combat. When I slowed down enough to engage the other drivers I had a blast flipping them over my head and peppering them with napalm cluster mines, but everything was just so slow and unenthusiastic. The excitement of any exchange of blows was immediately sapped away by the dull driving experience. I do not believe PAM is a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s not a game I would suggest a friend to pick up. I would be really excited to see a more aggressive and faster sequel because I think they have a decent foundation to work with here.","September 28, 2015","false","3.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Each "race" lasts three minutes, no more, no less. You score so many more points for kills than you do for completing laps that there's literally no point in trying to race, and it just feels dumb as hell deliberately going slow in a "racing" game just so enemies can catch up so you can maybe kill them. If this game was arena-based, it'd probably own a bit, or if it was like Daytona or something where you get additional time for kills and laps, that'd also be cool. But instead it's not that cool, and in fact almost kinda sucks.","December 24, 2011","false","1.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

In fact, I quite like this game.\n\nLet's start with what I like:\n\nThere's a nod-off to Breaking Bad (You get to use the RV as a driving option, and it kicks ♥♥♥)\nThere's a nice variety of cars, with an equally nice variety of weapons, and feelings to them.\nThe music is damned good.\nThe tracks aren't extremely linear, and there's a good amount of shortcuts, and alternate routes. There are a few re-skins, but they're winter themed, so it's not exactly a money-grubbing ripoff.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\nHandbrake = Car flip button. No powersliding here, cheif.\nLack of modes. This got me the most, I kinda wanted something like a demolition derby bowl race. There's only two modes. Play through all the maps until you fail mode, and single race mode.\n\nI guess some kind of progression, and upgrades system would also be nice, but I'm not too fussed. Overall, though, this game is well worth the money.","August 26, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like it as its actually playable without being over the top like many other racers. We want to go around corners at high speed on turbo and go flying though the air without skidding off into some over graphicfied building. Some say the graphics look cartoonish, they are far from poor and a lot of detail and design has gone into the cars and levels. I actually prefer "game looking" graphics more than "real world" type graphics. I drive miles each week on the M1 personally, why the heck would I want to come home and look at more of the same ?  I wan't to get away from the "real world" and enjoy playing game which look like game, not like the past 2 hours of stuff I have been looking at.\n\nThe AI drivers could be a little better, but they can more than give you a good race. Play with friends no problem!  Blow them up with rockets or donuts or whatever you want, which gives the game a little bit more fun than just going around a fancy looking racetrack all day thinking "wow the graphics are so cool" which isn't playing a game IMHO. The graphics are good in PAM even considering its a old game now.\n\nWe have tried other racing games and really do not get on with them at all. So if your alike and want something easy and fun to play then give PAM a try! Its next to nothing in price.  My only bad thoughts are the are not many tracks, I think 7 after the bonus pack. They are big tracks and even after playing for several hours we can still manage to get lost in them. I really wish they made more tracks or a editor for PAM, possibly more cars too. Though we will be playing it for the foreseeable future for sure! Well worth a couple of quid!\n","June 9, 2014","true","90.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much from it, but playing the game was a real fun!\n\nGraphics are really nice, and it runs very smooth on my PC, unlike lots of similar games that clog the CPU. Music in the game fits it well, and doesn't get tiresome after a while of playing. The physics are of course really arcade-ish, but driving is fun! And so is killing things - especially since you have a bunch of different cars to choose, that actually doesn't make you feel you're using the same car with different skin. The game is well-polished, that's a plus too. The menus are nice, there's no (many :D) bugs in it, achievements fun to earn.\n\nOne "drawback" of the game, is that's in fact a casual game. It's not challenging, there's not much to do, so I'd say it's a casual game. The other minus is that pretty much noone plays multiplayer, so you're bound to play with your friends or single player.\n\nAnyway, I totally recomment the game, especially at it's low price!","May 19, 2012","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much from it, but playing the game was a real fun!\n\nGraphics are really nice, and it runs very smooth on my PC, unlike lots of similar games that clog the CPU. Music in the game fits it well, and doesn't get tiresome after a while of playing. The physics are of course really arcade-ish, but driving is fun! And so is killing things - especially since you have a bunch of different cars to choose, that actually doesn't make you feel you're using the same car with different skin. The game is well-polished, that's a plus too. The menus are nice, there's no (many :D) bugs in it, achievements fun to earn.\n\nOne "drawback" of the game, is that's in fact a casual game. It's not challenging, there's not much to do, so I'd say it's a casual game. The other minus is that pretty much noone plays multiplayer, so you're bound to play with your friends or single player.\n\nAnyway, I totally recomment the game, especially at it's low price!","May 19, 2012","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shredsterseven/recommended/91900/","shredsterseven","Shredster VII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shredsterseven/","414 products in account","In short: Post Apocalyptic Mayhem (PAM) is a combat racing game where the players race ad-hoc battle machines through various sandblasted locales, with the ultimate goal being to rack up as many kills as possible within five minutes.\n\nSince this is a driving game, lets talk about the vehicles first. Generally speaking, the smaller the vehicle, the more "zippy" and easier-to-control it feels. Larger vehicles trade in control for weapon power and the ability to take a beating. Not exactly the most original concept, but it's reliable and makes perfect sense within the apocalyptic setting.\n\nThe driving mechanics themselves do not do a good job of conveying a sense of speed. Even when using Nitrous, you're never going to feel like you're breaching 50 MPH - as a result, when you manage to catch some big air in a race, it's going to feel like your vehicle has very "floaty" physics. As a veteran player of Dethkarz, Re-Volt, Trackmania and Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed, this strongly irritates me.\n\nOn the plus side, there is very little overlap between each vehicle's unique weapons. There are four types of weapon pickups you can collect, each color reponding to either extra fuel for your boost meter, or front-facing, side-facing, and rear-facing weapons. Though most side-weapons tend to be "a bunch of miniature bombs", the front and rear weapons are almost always totally unique for each vehicle. As a result of each vehicle requiring a different playstyle, there is actually a huge amount of strategy in picking which vehicle you'll use during a race. I've become rather fond of the Nucloid vehicle myself.\n\nThe overall level design is very, very good. There are six unique tracks, and a seventh Christmas-themed reskin of the first track.  Each level contains wide-open spaces, chokepoints, and multiple routes. Very rarely will there be a part of the track where you can't come up with a plan on-the-fly.\n\nMy one complaint track-wise is that three of the game's tracks - Wasteland, Cold War Beach, and Airplane Cemetary - all have very bland aesthetics. The latter two have some interesting architecture, but Winter Wasteland is about ten times more interesting than regular Wasteland despite being little more than a reskin. The other tracks - Urban Jungle, Death Area 8, Abandoned Sawmill, and (again) Winter Wasteland have far more interesting aesthetics and are generally more fun to race on as a result.\n\nThe soundtrack is... generic. Though the genre of each background song varies, they really don't add anything to the overall feel of the game. Once again, the exception being Winter Wasteland's background music, which is actually pretty damn epic for a Carol of the Bells remix.\n\nThe A.I. in this game can actually be surprisingly skilled, though there is just a touch of rubberbanding involved in their programming. Playing on hard difficulty can result in most players earning an average score of around eight kills (which is a hell of a lot). Though you'll find virtually no online games being hosted, going a few rounds with friends is when this game shines at it's brightest.\n\nIf this game happens to go on sale for a decent price, I urge you to give it a shot. It's not Twisted Metal, but it is a fun romp nonetheless. 7.0 \ 10","June 26, 2014","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Your primary goal is to destroy your opponents by means of weapons installed on your post-apocalyptic car. I shall underline it again, because it's not immediately clear from media files and game description: this is NOT a race. It does not matter if you come first or last: the winner is the player who killed more enemies (and got more points, consequently).\n\nAll cars and weapons are available from the very beginning, there's no profile development and no campaign mode. Some of the most dangerous cars are locked, though; you will need to buy the DLC to open access to them. You will be able to make an informed decision, because the AI always has access to all cars - there'll be the chance for you to fight against DLC cars, watch their weapons in action, and decide whether you need them or not.\n\nAny car has three weapons: front, side, and rear. They are more or less balanced, but different: each one is useful in its own certain situation, so there's no universal solution fitting for any track. When you start the fight, you don't have any weapon available; you need to activate them by picking barrels distributed throughout the track, and after you have used a certain weapon once, it is deactivated again, until the next barrel. Tracks are very peculiar, both in terms of scenery and of layout. A bit of physics is included, but it's not very realistic (so far as it's an arcade).\n\nDon't expect too much of a game where ice cream refrigerators kill others by giant ice cream balls falling from their rear door, and small pink cars with ponies on their hood flood the road with dozens of teddy bears filled with explosives. Just have fun and enjoy the mayhem and chaos you wreak along with other horrible, rusty, freaky cars that had somehow survived the unknown apocalypse.","November 28, 2013","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That was my first impression when I first started playing this game.  For a brand new game, with decent graphics, nothing high end, why use this much bloom ? Anyway, it's a bit like Wipeout, or Carmageddon without the pedestrian killing. You race around and try to kill each other. There are power-ups to be collected and they're specific to the car you're driving. So one car drops mines, the other shoots chemicals for example. Using the same power-up. It's pretty fun.

There is no single player, just racing bots in arcade mode and time attack on the 7 tracks. There is no progression. Driving mechanics are good, although you flip a little too much, and it would have been nicer to have a button to look behind instead of relying on the joystick, as its cumbersome. Also if you get stuck behind something its hard to turn around or back up. There are many different vehicles and each has 3 attacks, but unfortunately they are mostly reskins of the same ability. The behind one you basically always drop a bunch of bombs, same as the side one, it is just a different looking bomb/explosive item. The front one you usually shoot an explosive or stick a sharp object out in front of you. Because there aren't a variety of effects from the abilities, like slowing down, or doing other things, it makes the different in vehicles less substantial. May be fun with friends but not worth getting now. 4.5/10.","March 21, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And by really great I mean someone took FlatOut, smeared lip vaseline all over it and then sprayed twenty boxes of neon graffity on the mess. It is almost painful to look. It doesn't help that the main menu looks like something you would get from a happy meal.\nThe music is... Well... Give me a second... Erm... Is there any music in this game anyway? Sorry, I won't bother turning it on for the sake of writing a recommendation, but if there IS any music, it is bland, uninspiring and almost annoying - the type of "music" you would make by mashing two metal dumpster lids together while shouting: "Old MacDonald had a farm" out of rythm. The fake sound of engine on full throttle doesn't help that much either - it sounds twice worse than a four year old immitating a F-1 engine sound - and six times as annoying.\nThe gameplay is so much FUN! Well, it WOULD be, if you wouldn't get bored after three minutes. There are like 8 or something cars, with 4 more if you are willing to shell out cash. (Please don't. Please. Give the DLC money to charity or something, just don't buy the DLC). The cars differ visually, sure, but SLIGHTLY by stats, and really little by abilities - instead of yellow waste, you shoot green booze, omigosh. Although the idea of anything-goes wipeout racing is really great, this game manages to eff it up anyway. There are 4 powerups in the game - your front attack, your back attack, your side attack and nitro. You get those in kind of a Mario Kart principle. And that's it. There is literally 0 depth here. Like, if you look at the game's storepage for four and a half seconds, you MASTERED IT! Congratulations. There won't be any cake. You might think that the if you manage to cross the finish line first, you win. But no. You need to get the most KILLS! Sure. Next time in the Olympics, we will cheer for the sprinter who stabbed the most athletes in the neck. Basically, it all comes down to stupid, no strategy involved carnage. And not the good type of carnage, where you kick a table into a window and break the window, the table AND a poor passerby in slow-motion. This is the type of carnage where you and seven other freaks on a 7 year steroid-only diet have a race to punch a brick wall and the first who breaks his arm completely wins. A free trip to a hospital.\n\nPlease, don't even consider this game. It's painful to play (figuratively), it's painful to write about (literally, my arm has been cut and every single word I write is out of the sheer willpower that this game must not reach the hands of fellow citi-gaaaaaaaaaaaah. Sorry. I'm bleeding. I should stop now). The idea was good, but it's burried somewhere in between the lipstick-smeared graphics, ear-bleeding noise, fatally boring gameplay and all the blood that's coming out of my arm.","November 11, 2013","false","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Handling of the vehicles is a bit wonky, and physics in general are strange in a fun way. The game is an unashamed console port, with the instructions screen still referencing an Xbox controller and the power-ups doing the same. However, it's rather satisfying to unleash the variety of weapons on other players, and it's a game that values both racing laps and getting kills, as both count towards the final score.","November 7, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Probably, bots were too slow to compete player in racing. So developers made that you don't need to race. In game where maps are racing circuits. Yet bots do race. Scoring are based on number of kills, and technically on number of laps completed, but latter has almost no impact on score. To win you just get away a bit, collect weapons and spam rear attack. Or don't try hard and just have a fun.\nAnd multiplayer is even worse. Most of weapons are made so you use while racing. But because there's no point in it, they can be simply avoided by slowing down.\nI don't say adding a real race mode would make this game better. As I said, player who got away at start will spam rear attacks and he will be unbeatable.\nAnd I didn’t even mention graphics or awful handling (most first person shooters have better car physics).\nThere is much better combat racing games on Steam.

It'll never be the best game in the world, and it isn't trying to be. It isn't even trying to be some ultra-deep indie title. It's a fun little racing game where you blow crap up. The number of tracks is VERY limited, so be prepared for that. There's really only one game mode, so be prepared for that. The driving isn't "Realistic", the cars handle more like Mario Karts than they do cars, be prepared for that. The graphics and sound aren't top notch, so be prepared for that.\n\nSo why do I still recommend it? It's a fun game. It doesn't try too hard. The graphics and sound are cartoony and get the job done. It has a sense of humor. The controsl and gameplay is very tight and fluid.\n\nSo if you're looking for a fun time that you can keep coming back to when bored, check it out. If you're looking for a game you can sink hours and hours in a row into, this probably isn't it. Go into it not expecting too much and you might be pleasantly suprised.","February 27, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/germia/recommended/91900/","germia","germia * Intel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/germia/","242 products in account","PAM is a funny racing destruction gamePAM is a surprisingly great and funny game built on a principle of Destruction Derbys. That means your goal is to race and destroy as many vehicles as you can. You have a lot of ways how to do it - you can use your driving skills (for example push the opponent from track or into other vehicle), front weapon you load when you collect a yellow barrel, side weapon loaded with blue barrel and rear weapon loaded with red barrel. So we all get what´s this game about, so I´ll write what I like and what I dislike about it so far:\nAdvantages\n+ Lots fo vehicles you can choose from. They differ not only in the boring statistics like speed, acceleration and other, but they are really funny and they all have custom weapon animations. For example little pink car, that has an unicorn horn as its front weapon or other car is thwrowing nuclear waste as ammo.\n+ The maps and tracks are well built. There are numerous ways where you can go, you can jump, trick or lay traps.\n+ It´s a real fun to play\n+ I haven´t played the multiplayer, but I think things could go really crazy when you play it together with your friends. I wish my friends have this game too!\n+ You could get it really cheap, there are lot of sales and you can buy a 3-pack for your friends too. This game could be often found in random steam keys too.\nDisadvantages\n- The game does not offer a lot of hours of playtime. The game goal does not change and in spite of the fact, that there are a lot of vehicles and tracks, there is no advancement as in other games. You can play all the cars from the beginning, you can ride all the maps. Everything is open. You don´t see any point of playing it sometimes (except it´s fun). So it´s great fun to play as a pause-filler but not as an full-time game.\n- The physics of the game are sometimes unrealistic. There is a bus and a little something, that looks like VW Beetle and the tiny Beetle could push the bus easy from the cliff. It seems like all the vehicles have the same power, the same weight in collisions. But when it comes to speed, handling, acceleration and breaking, everything seems to be ok and appropriate.","September 2, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finding matches online can be a problem as there aren't really enough players at this time, best bet is to join a couple of P.A.M. groups & organise a game through them.","June 22, 2011","true","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish I had someone to get drunk and play head to head, but as it stands... this is basically if Twisted Metal was a racing game that also included kill totals towards your score and rank.  I kind of wish it just had a big level to play some car combat without racing and a few bosses, but thats my Twisted Metal nastalgia eating at me.

The combat while racing can be quite hilarious with friends, as well as competitive. The flaw in this game however, is the scoring system, in which you receive points based on laps and kills. Because of this, it is pointless to do more than a certain amount of laps on maps where you know you won't be able to do another one before time runs out. So, you are forced to sandbag for the rest of the time and stack up some kills.","December 6, 2013","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lot of mayhem in the game.  As you race, you get pickups which give you different weapons, either dropping from the back, the sides, or straight in front of your vehicle.  With a good deal of vehicles and 3 different weapons each, it makes for a great racing game.  Pretty well designed controls for the joystick, but my right hand is aching from holding down R2 as the gas.

Why didn't I think of this before?!"\n\nWell, after having aquired this one once more as the full version this time around, I can still safely say that the game still holds up rather well. The graphics look very nice, the controls are rather simple, the music sets the tone of what it is that you're going again and everything in between just works. Despite there are some times where it can get a little frustrating and trust me, there will be times when you will encounter quite a lot of them, if you LET them, of course.\n\nThe game doesn't really have a story mode per se, but it makes up for it with a little campaign mode that runs about an hour or so, pitting you against five other racers that are all out for each other's blood, where the only way to win is if you've completed more laps than they did and got more kills then they do, instead of traditional racers where only first, second or third gets you the win. The weapon systems for each individual vehicle is tied to specific buttons, where you have a front, side and rear weapon. Each has their own characteristic, their own style and has their own method of doling out punishment. You can only use these once before you have to grab a color coded barrel that ties to the weapon in particular. Red ones for the rear, blue for the side and yellow for the front. Green ones are for your speed boost, which comes in handy when you're trying to catch up with pack, but over time, you come to figure out that there's really no need for it, unless if it's a long run. There's also black barrels, which gives you something at random. It's more or less a crapshoot, but it comes through in the clinch.\n\nThere's really not much I can say about the cars, since they're pretty much exactly what you would expect.\n\nBut of course, I will have to agree with some detractors that the game doesn't offer much in terms of vareity and that it wears out its welcome fairly quickly. Multiplayer does in fact have a limited shelf life and this is something I can agree with, but even then, whether you're playing with random people, with friends or even by yourself, you'll still have a great time,\n\nOverall, this game gets a positive recommendation from me.","December 25, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kind of a clever idea--the three-directional weapons just wouldn't work if the pack wasn't all headed in the same direction. But at the same time... it's more demolition-focused than race-focused, so rather than blazing down the track and leaving everybody behind... it's actually a better idea to slow down and keep them in weapons range.

THEN-, you would uh, probably get the already existing game Jak X... ...\n\nBUT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PS2 AT THE MOMENT, YOU WOULD GET THE POST APOCALYPTIC MAYHEM!!\n\nAhem, PAM is an intense racing warfare game where you do not compete for the first place. You compete for the most kills through an arsenal of wacky weapons, all depending on your chosen vehicle (who all have some kind of inspiration or theme).\n\n\n+ The selection of vehicles and their weapons who each demands specific tactics and strategies where not one is like another.\n\n+ I highly recommend playing PAM with a controller, when all your attacks are based on the 360 Controller's right buttonpad (Y,B,A,X) with A as your nitro, B, as your rear weapon, X as your sideweapons and Y for frontal mowing. So natural!\n\n+ The immersive tracks and stages is very fluid and are quick to learn the ups and downs in. One of them is just a lying eight, how rad is that?!\n\n\n- Sometime when you hit a obstacle or get thrown in high speed, your car turns into a helium filled balloon and flies all over the place which VERY QUICKLY can get on your nerves. The game prays that you get over it and keeps playing though.\n\n- Griefers could hide out at choke points just to have unsuspecting racers drive right into his just placed minefield or something like that. FRUSTRATION INDUCED.\n\n\nPAM has its rad parts and its bad parts but overall, I'm having a fun time with this controlled demolishion racer.

The physics is horrible, cars handle unpredictably and hitting any minor bump or rock on the road can make your car spin weirdly in the air for no apparent reason.\n\nThere is only one pointless game mode - no story, no progression, no goals or unlocks - just pick one of the tiny selection of tracks and play a pointless "race" where being in the lead makes no difference, since all matches last for a fixed 5-minute timer.\n\nIt's a shame, this game shows a lot of promise, but as it is I couldn't consider it more than a barely playable prototype.","February 14, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would say it's a mix of Twisted Metal and Flatout. Or well. Tries to.\n\nEach vehicle can have 3 attacks and boost. One frontal attack (mostly useless) a side attack (often just backwards) and a backwards attack (usually most powerful).\n\nIt's a racing game, but the race itself doesn't matter one bit, it's all about staying in the front, awaiting the enemies (yes, even on hard and no, I don't have it in me to go online in this game...)\n\nControls aren't bad, unless you're at a low speed, in the air (oh god the ♥♥♥♥ing airtime...) and reversing. Turning is easier at higher speeds, which is weird. Low speed, crap turning. High speed, amazing turning. So boost at low speeds.\n\nOverall it's a game that has a good idea but the overall experience is bad and gets very boring after a run through each level.\n\nWhat I've done in the game:\n- Played through the Apocalypse run (all levels back to back) on medium, not losing a single race, nor challenged at any point.\n- Played a few Arcade races on hard to see if I would get challenged. A few pesky red attacks, but overall winner each time.\n- Tried a race on easy. Well... I don't even know why. But I got 30-something kills. In one race. They just kept lining up behind me and I kept on giving them what the wanted.\n\nIf I would rate this game I'd give it a 2/10. It's just... Bad overall and even with the sale going on at the moment (75%) I wouldn't pick it up unless you're really bored and need a quick fix for 20 minutes.

This racer isn’t for everyone but it is a solid, budget-priced racing game that is a blast to play with a group of friends. The best way to describe it is Mario Kart meets Vigilante 8. There are 6 different rides, each with their own set of abilities and stats. As you race, colored barrels are placed throughout the map and when picked up, they charge the corresponding abilities. The main mode’s objective is to kill the most opponents as well as try to finish in first place. Currently there are only 3 maps with 4 different game modes, as well as a bot control single player. With free dlc on the way (2 new vehicles and 1 track) 9.99 isn’t much to ask for the amount of chaos and cheap tricks that ensue. Just don’t go into the game expecting a deep racing experience, you do get what you pay for.","April 6, 2011","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kind of a clever idea--the three-directional weapons just wouldn't work if the pack wasn't all headed in the same direction. But at the same time... it's more demolition-focused than race-focused, so rather than blazing down the track and leaving everybody behind... it's actually a better idea to slow down and keep them in weapons range.

THEN-, you would uh, probably get the already existing game Jak X... ...\n\nBUT IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PS2 AT THE MOMENT, YOU WOULD GET THE POST APOCALYPTIC MAYHEM!!\n\nAhem, PAM is an intense racing warfare game where you do not compete for the first place. You compete for the most kills through an arsenal of wacky weapons, all depending on your chosen vehicle (who all have some kind of inspiration or theme).\n\n\n+ The selection of vehicles and their weapons who each demands specific tactics and strategies where not one is like another.\n\n+ I highly recommend playing PAM with a controller, when all your attacks are based on the 360 Controller's right buttonpad (Y,B,A,X) with A as your nitro, B, as your rear weapon, X as your sideweapons and Y for frontal mowing. So natural!\n\n+ The immersive tracks and stages is very fluid and are quick to learn the ups and downs in. One of them is just a lying eight, how rad is that?!\n\n\n- Sometime when you hit a obstacle or get thrown in high speed, your car turns into a helium filled balloon and flies all over the place which VERY QUICKLY can get on your nerves. The game prays that you get over it and keeps playing though.\n\n- Griefers could hide out at choke points just to have unsuspecting racers drive right into his just placed minefield or something like that. FRUSTRATION INDUCED.\n\n\nPAM has its rad parts and its bad parts but overall, I'm having a fun time with this controlled demolishion racer.

But I feel like it can be a great game with a few updates. When I'm driving through the courses, my vehicle gets snagged a lot on the scenery: a pole here, a rock I thought I could jump, a piece of the tunnel that was juuuust enough to my side that it stops my car. The game needs to be more forgiving here, since the scenery makes the difference between 1st and last place. Another thing that I feel should be fixed is the sensitivity. Now I don't know if it's just my computer having this problem, but a little tap to the left in my vehicle  goes a long way. Too long. My vehicle can get kind of unpredictable at times. However I can deal with this sort of by being careful.\n\nNow, the things I liked. I really dig the diesel-punk vibe I'm getting from this game. The menu is just a blast and the music fits. The courses look pretty cool and fits the whole apocalypse theme. Another aspect is the gameplay: points are won by completing laps and killing the most people. This two pronged point system gives playing the game a kind of edge that I like. The vehicle selection is pretty cool too. We got a policecar, a unicorn with a B.A. drill horn in the front, and a logging truck that spills logs onto the track. It's pretty cool.\n\nOne thing that I might suggest as new material is to let the player demolish the course as they drive. Like if I ram into the train hanger in the Wastelands, I'd go through it and come out the other side. And what if one gets points by doing that? Like if you take down a section of freeway you'd get a lot of points compared to taking out a shipping container. And then you'd be thinking of three ways to get points in the game, making it more of a challenge.\n\nTo sum up, the game needs improvements but there are many parts of it I enjoyed. 6/10","February 18, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would say it's a mix of Twisted Metal and Flatout. Or well. Tries to.\n\nEach vehicle can have 3 attacks and boost. One frontal attack (mostly useless) a side attack (often just backwards) and a backwards attack (usually most powerful).\n\nIt's a racing game, but the race itself doesn't matter one bit, it's all about staying in the front, awaiting the enemies (yes, even on hard and no, I don't have it in me to go online in this game...)\n\nControls aren't bad, unless you're at a low speed, in the air (oh god the ♥♥♥♥ing airtime...) and reversing. Turning is easier at higher speeds, which is weird. Low speed, crap turning. High speed, amazing turning. So boost at low speeds.\n\nOverall it's a game that has a good idea but the overall experience is bad and gets very boring after a run through each level.\n\nWhat I've done in the game:\n- Played through the Apocalypse run (all levels back to back) on medium, not losing a single race, nor challenged at any point.\n- Played a few Arcade races on hard to see if I would get challenged. A few pesky red attacks, but overall winner each time.\n- Tried a race on easy. Well... I don't even know why. But I got 30-something kills. In one race. They just kept lining up behind me and I kept on giving them what the wanted.\n\nIf I would rate this game I'd give it a 2/10. It's just... Bad overall and even with the sale going on at the moment (75%) I wouldn't pick it up unless you're really bored and need a quick fix for 20 minutes.

The game follows the classic race and kill formula and it is as boring as it comes, the only (theoretically) interesting thing was the post-apocalyptic setting but there's no story whatsoever, nor any interation with it, it only means the environment looks bland and/or desertic. Steer clear from this game, it's not even worth it in a bundle (where I actually got it), buying it at full price is basically lighting a cigarette with 10$.\n\n+ On par and fluid graphic\n- 100% Not Fun Guaranteed\n- Uninspired & Boring\n\n2/10","September 16, 2014","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would say it's a mix of Twisted Metal and Flatout. Or well. Tries to.\n\nEach vehicle can have 3 attacks and boost. One frontal attack (mostly useless) a side attack (often just backwards) and a backwards attack (usually most powerful).\n\nIt's a racing game, but the race itself doesn't matter one bit, it's all about staying in the front, awaiting the enemies (yes, even on hard and no, I don't have it in me to go online in this game...)\n\nControls aren't bad, unless you're at a low speed, in the air (oh god the ♥♥♥♥ing airtime...) and reversing. Turning is easier at higher speeds, which is weird. Low speed, crap turning. High speed, amazing turning. So boost at low speeds.\n\nOverall it's a game that has a good idea but the overall experience is bad and gets very boring after a run through each level.\n\nWhat I've done in the game:\n- Played through the Apocalypse run (all levels back to back) on medium, not losing a single race, nor challenged at any point.\n- Played a few Arcade races on hard to see if I would get challenged. A few pesky red attacks, but overall winner each time.\n- Tried a race on easy. Well... I don't even know why. But I got 30-something kills. In one race. They just kept lining up behind me and I kept on giving them what the wanted.\n\nIf I would rate this game I'd give it a 2/10. It's just... Bad overall and even with the sale going on at the moment (75%) I wouldn't pick it up unless you're really bored and need a quick fix for 20 minutes.

There is something missing in this game. Graphics are ok, but the gameplay is just not satisfying. Front attack, side attack, rear attack... grab the barrels to get ammo. Repeat until you get bored and don't go too fast or you will be ahead by miles and won't score any points (you will lose). Physics are bad, driving is boring and destructing other cars is meaningless and repetitive. Being killed is not even frustrating because it's so common and without consequence. Once I got the hang of this game, it was over. That's it? Yep, nothing else to see, I tried all cars, all tracks, and multiplayer is dead.\n\nI uninstalled as soon as I got the last Steam card and can't see how I would have interested to ever reinstall this game.

Drive slow and try to turn around. D@mn, this car can't turn for sh¡t! Fine, I'll hit reset, but no wait, BLAM! IN YOUR FACE, you just got killed by someone else. Now you have to watch your car blow up before it will reset. Ok, now it's reset and its blinking (your invincible) and your accelerating, now you can get that next barrel in front of you. Yeah! Nailed it, head on... wait... what? I didn't get the power up? Because I was still invincible I can't pick it up?!\n\nKitty wins: 18 kills, everyone else, 5 to 8, you... 3 kills.\n\n*R4GE F*CK!NG QUiT*\n\nOh, hey, I got a trading card :)\n\n\n\nI only recommend this because, yes, it's fun. But it has some serious problems with balancing and overall game mechanics/rules. (So only get this on a huge discount)\n\nYou drive around, you pick up colored barrels to give you weapons (blue (X)=side weapon, yellow (Y)=front weapon, red (B)=back weapon, green (A)=nitrous). You fire the weapons at the opponents and get kills. Basically, most kills wins. And thats how it's fun: it's a 'racing' game where you attack the other racers (like all the other ones out there, only not as well put together).\n\nGraphics, music, sfx, original weapon designs for the different vehicles are all good. A decent number of tracks, though some are similar in appearance (wasteland, airplane graveyard, cold war beach). And the tracks are fairly open, with wide/multiple lanes/paths (which is necessary or it would litterally be a cluster*#*ck).\n\nOk, but here are the problems:\n\nYou can only hold one of each type of weapon (so you can't stock up) and your attacks only last for so long (even if you're laying mines or ice crystals or what have you,) they'll eventually just disappear, so it does no good to be in first place if you're too far ahead of all the other racers.\n\nPhysics are WAAAYYY too arcady. The cars weigh anywhere between a balloon and a foam football (with wings). You hit a slope/ditch in the track and you're up in the air for over second, and probably tipped to the side, too. Which means when you finally come down, you'll have to wait for your car to slowly roll onto its wheels. And if you hit a bump just right and launch yourself almost vertical, then you'll be stuck spinning/floating in the air for several seconds while all the other racers pass you by. I also managed to hit an oil slick while I was flying over it. It spun my car out and I had to wait 5 seconds for my car to absorb enough damage to die, then watch it blow up, then wait for a respawn. It's that Mario Kart agony of getting hit with a shell on the last half of the last lap, only it happens in this game over, and over, and OVER! But that's ok because laps don't matter.\n\nThis brings me to one of the biggest problems: It's not actually a racing game! In fact if you're first, you'll more than likely loose (because you didn't get enough kills). As far as I can tell, Kills and laps are both worth the about the same. (I think damage you deal counts for some of your points, too.) So this game went from racing game to just driving in a circle shooting at the other racers. The circuits are so long, if you're actually racing, you can probably manage finishing 2 to 3 laps in the time limit. But then you'll miss out on getting around 5 kills a lap, so you loose! This ought to be changed if it's going to be a racing game. They should to switch it to checkpoints and give you points based on your position in the race when crossing that checkpoint. And maybe award you all weapons if you're first across, 2 weapons if 2nd, 1 weapon if 3rd across. Just my thoughts...\n\n\nIf you like a game that has you playing with ping pong balls physically, has a LOT of ups and downs, a game where coming first is bad, then buy this and go play with kitty.\n(caution: she has actually has a drill in the front...)","June 10, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat, which is what I was craving, grew tiresome quickly as well.  Basically find a power up, line up a car to the front, side or rear depending on which you have and kill the opponent fairly easily.  Not a whole lot of strategy and each car plays almost the same.  The tracks are all independent and the only point is to get the most points you can.  There is no choosing weapons, no campaign mode, nothing to keep me coming back.

Gameplay wise, P.A.M. is enjoyable, playing almost like a motorstorm game but with similar weapons and weapon systems to an older twisted metal game. The nine cars (Three in DLC) that the game has are all rather unique and pretty well balanced, and at least one makes homage to, again, Twisted metal by having a weaponized ice cream truck. But then again, you can also play as a school bus with a plow or, better yet, a nuclear-powered smart car. Each one of them has three different weapons, one for the front, one for the back, and one for the sides. They're all absurd and many of them are variants of tossing mines on the field, but they do it in differing way, to the credit of the designers.\nWhen you're actually in a race, it's certainly different than most other racing games. Laps don't matter too much in the grand scheme of things, nor is your placement in the actually racing around. The tracks are so damn big that you usually only get one lap anyhow. But what matters most is your kills. Even if you're in last palce when the timer runs out, but you have the most kills, you win the race. This means you can be a cheeky sonuva♥♥♥♥♥, grab a side weapon, and then slow down and time out the weapon to catch the majority of the opposing racers. Works well, try it.\n\nBut my main complaint about this game is content. The cars are decent, sure. The price of the dlc isn't bad either; $2 for three cars. But you only have six tracks and a remodeled version of the first one made for christmas. (Yes, really.) The tracks, though, are amazing- Plenty of alternate routes, tons of insane terrain, and plenty of pillars to run your ♥♥♥ into when boosting at full speed. All are enjoyable and very long except for one of them, from what I remember. But that's all this game has. Nine cars, six tracks... and that's it. The only two gameplay modes are arcade and "Apocalyptic Challenge", and all the latter is is just playing all six tracks in a row for a total, final score. It can certainly get boring quick, but it's enjoyable while it lasts.\n\nOh yes, the achievments in this game or stupidly easy to get at times. I got one for switching off the in-game music... -_-\n\nTo put it simple terms:\n\nPros:\nExcellent vehicles with a good variety\nGameplay is enjoyable and works well\nTracks are really well designed\nHard mode is actually hard (Weird, right?)\nBreaks the normal racing mold and changes it a bit, certainly for the better.\n\nCons:\nToo damn short. Just not enough replay or simply play value at all. Good for a fun few hours, but that's it.\nLack of game modes.\n\nIn the end, this gets a 7.5/10.  Worth getting if on sale.","December 30, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why didn't I think of this before?!"\n\nWell, after having aquired this one once more as the full version this time around, I can still safely say that the game still holds up rather well. The graphics look very nice, the controls are rather simple, the music sets the tone of what it is that you're going again and everything in between just works. Despite there are some times where it can get a little frustrating and trust me, there will be times when you will encounter quite a lot of them, if you LET them, of course.\n\nThe game doesn't really have a story mode per se, but it makes up for it with a little campaign mode that runs about an hour or so, pitting you against five other racers that are all out for each other's blood, where the only way to win is if you've completed more laps than they did and got more kills then they do, instead of traditional racers where only first, second or third gets you the win. The weapon systems for each individual vehicle is tied to specific buttons, where you have a front, side and rear weapon. Each has their own characteristic, their own style and has their own method of doling out punishment. You can only use these once before you have to grab a color coded barrel that ties to the weapon in particular. Red ones for the rear, blue for the side and yellow for the front. Green ones are for your speed boost, which comes in handy when you're trying to catch up with pack, but over time, you come to figure out that there's really no need for it, unless if it's a long run. There's also black barrels, which gives you something at random. It's more or less a crapshoot, but it comes through in the clinch.\n\nThere's really not much I can say about the cars, since they're pretty much exactly what you would expect.\n\nBut of course, I will have to agree with some detractors that the game doesn't offer much in terms of vareity and that it wears out its welcome fairly quickly. Multiplayer does in fact have a limited shelf life and this is something I can agree with, but even then, whether you're playing with random people, with friends or even by yourself, you'll still have a great time,\n\nOverall, this game gets a positive recommendation from me.","December 25, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not sure why they even bother to have a position ranking since coming first or last doesnt effect anything all you need is this most kills, this game should be played in an arena not a circle, and why is there no health pickups? Seems silly since you can damage yourself with your own powers. Game has no storyline, the multiplayer is completely dead which sucks since 50% of achievements require you to play ranked multiplayer and the match making requires another person to go into your lobby and ready up before a match can even begin. The lack of vehicles with unique powers makes this game repetitive and boring. The cars dont even move that fast so it feels slow.
