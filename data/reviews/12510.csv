"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/12510/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3932 products in account","This game is terrible.\n\nFor starters, there is no tutorial. The game thrusts you right in with the options of Mens Prison, Womens Prison or Military Prison. It does not explain what the differences are between them (if there are any at all) or what each prison will actually involve, you're just expected to guess.\nI went with the first option. Mens Prison.\nOnce in the game there is no guide on what to do, no objectives, nothing helpful at all. It doesn't even clearly show you which plot of land you should be building on which is annoying as first impressions.\nOnce you start to figure things out on your own, such as how the menus work, what you should be building and such, you expect the game to get better but it doesn't.\nIt's drab attempts at being a 'prison tycoon' just makes you frustrated and bored. The learning curve is huge and i'm sure there's many things i'm missing because the game just doesn't explain to you what to do or how to do it (apart from the 'manual' which i've given a read and it isn't very helpful).\n\nThe graphics are average for the release date but when the gameplay is boring the drab graphics don't do anything to help ignite your enthusiasm and the same goes with the menus and other interface options. They are downright ugly, and 90% of the times the options are not labelled and do not explain to you what they do, there is just a random picture which you yourself must decipher.\n\nI'm sure if I put another 10 hours into the game I may learn how to play it fully, but I doubt that even if I did learn the more complicated parts of it I would still not find the game enjoyable.\nThere are many better tycoon games out there for your money, I just can't recommend this at all.","February 2, 2014","false","0.6"," 99 of 116 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","99","116","2","6"

Putting a guard in a tower is pointless because they get confused and walk forever and stand by while inmates sprint by them and hop the fence. The AI for the inmates is also terrible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sucratzz/recommended/12510/","sucratzz","Matt Bailey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sucratzz/","128 products in account","First off, this is a pretty old game. It was released in 2007, so don't expect 2014 graphics. You start with an area of land and an amount of cash to start your prison. You first need to put some fencing up, plop a place for the inmates to sleep and a security building. From there you just continue to expand until all available buildings have been placed and you have your prison. It took me a few prisons to get the hang of what you need to do so inmates aren't constatntly jumping the fence and making a runner for it. On my fourth or fifth prison I finally got the hang of security and that was when I was able to excell to Max Security.\n\nGiven how old this game is, I'm surprised I didn't have to use compatibility mode. If you have some problems with starting the game try using xp sp2 compatibility mode. It has a fair few bugs that can be worked around, fencing is easy to make a mess of which leads to crashes etc. Guard patrols for the most part work fine, but can crash if you try to issue too many commands to the same guard too quickly. In essence, if you can master the guards and security you can get some pretty pumping prisons going.\n\nThe game has a long learning curve, even with the manual having a bit of detail in it. It wasn't until close to 7 hours of gameplay that I had that "ahhh, so that's what you have to do" moment, and I've played a lot of tycoon/simulation games before.\n\nNot too bad of a game, but once you figure it out, there's not a lot of depth left.\n\nI was lucky enough to grab this for $2.49 on the steam sale and if you can get it for that price I would say it's money well spent if you like tycoon games.","December 28, 2013","true","26.0"," 19 of 43 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","19","43","0","3"

When the game starts you have not one not two but yes three types of prison's you can run as none other then the warden yourself with your high preformance stick and small flag mouse on the screen. I know what your thinking how can only one man run a whole prison by himself? But with Prison Tycoon 3 its possible. If you have all the time in the world to just ♥♥♥♥ around with this game that will get you no ware in a hurry by all means this is for you! Like I said you can pick three types of prison's you can run men's, women's, or military. Trust me you want to run the military prison its so cool! Tanks in the back ground whats not to like! You start with $10000.00 so the sky is the limit!. The music top notch in my book. Nothing beats the sound of the old west like your a true outlaw the whole time you play! And it gets better! By the time you have build the whole fence around your prison you don't have a damn dime left to your name! Now how do you make money well here's the BEST part of the WHOLE game YOU CANT MAKE MONEY!!! Yes people you can not make one cent in Prison Tycoon 3. You can even save your game so you can come back to that boring ♥♥♥♥ing game that you left one year ago just to find that you still don't have any money and you have to destroy building and fences to pay your guards.

What's the purpose of having guards if prisoners can just run past them?\n\nThe only thing I like about this game is that I got it for free.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, this game is still horrible regardless of price.

When I purchased this game, it was from pure nostalgia. I remembered when I would play this game for hours on end, and I recalled how much enjoyment I got from it...\n\n...After I bought this game, I remembered that the only reason I played this game was because the choices at my grandmothers place was 1) play this game 2) go to Church or 3) watch re-runs of the Andy Griffith show, and there is only so much of Deputy Don i can take before I\'m willing to do almost anything...and I\'m not a Christian, so I chose Prison Tycoon.\n\nDon\'t waste your money. The only reason this game should be bought is as a prank gift to a good buddy when you have a few extra bucks to spend.\n\nThe graphics are sub-par (even when it was first released), UI is almost worthless, no tutorial (let me say that im not a huge advocate for tutorials...i don\'t usually need EVERY small detail explaned over the course of a half hour. But this game REALLY needs it), and worse of all...your prisioners WILL escape. Put up a tall af fence with rolls of barb-wire? They climb over it like a jungle gym. Got 100+ guards on duty & 20 Guard Towers to help catch them? Still climb fence, and still escape. Nothing you do will prevent this, and no matter what they WILL get away.\n\nNot to mention the economy. Seems simple...build a factory or two, fill it with shops, assign prisoners to work schedules, and make money...right? WRONG! Why? Because even though you have the proper facilities and mechanisms in place to get them to work...they just dont feel like working. So, you will go broke pretty quick as you watch your lazy idiot guards pimp walk around while your prisoners are running off into the sunset.\n\nTL;DR - Game sucks. Move along.","June 1","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
