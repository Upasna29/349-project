I can't recommend it in its current state. The game is dazzling to look at, and the sound design is nothing short of incredible with my Soundblaster Z sound card. The feel of the tracks are authentic, making it as if I'm really there. However, the game has a fatal flaw, which results in frustration and ultimate dissatisfaction. The penalty system in the game is simply too stringent. Codemasters said the issue was fixed in F1 2013, but it makes me wonder why they don't patch/fix the issue in this game.\n\nThere is nothing more frustrating to be trapped in a group of cars bunched in a corner, and getting a drive through penalty for "illegal blocking." Or a car driven by the AI bumping up against you, and acquiring another drive through penalty for unsportsmanlike behavior. I just spent an hour and a half in a race with 28 laps to go, and accrued two such flags in one lap. That pretty much guaranteed a last place finish. This needs to be fixed.","January 12, 2014","false","73.1"," 31 of 50 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","31","50","0","0"

Its extremely challengeing, and very rewarding. The longer you play the better you will understand the physics of your car. Then when you change it, it starts all over again :)\n\nThis is the cheap way of getting to know a lot about F1 in general, before every race in real life I spin 20ish laps on the track to be sure to remember every corner, watching the real race after that is much much better and more understandable.\n\nThe only con I see is trouble with online multiplayer, it does not work for me.

It gives penaltys to the player for minor incidents and other cars are forgiven for bumping you hard. And the pit exit of some tracks is bugged because the game gives a penalty for crossing the pit-lane line, when the car is still controlled by the AI. I have to save rewinds for that moment for not, my race is going down hard.

And this is coming from someone who isn't a die-hard fan of F1. It appeals to the casual gamer as well. It's not arcady, but still thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nPros:Great graphics\nAwesome sound\nVery good ambience feel\nAddictive gameplay\nVariety of challenges in case you want a break from the Career mode\nCons:Could do with a lesser percentage of Race Length option - Currently, the minimum is 25% which takes around 25-30 mins for a single race to complete in Career mode. Having a 15% option wouldn't be a such a bad idea.\nManual pit lane handling - AI taking control as soon as you enter the pits can be avoided as well. Perhaps having an option to turn that off/on would be great\nPerhaps needs a bit more commentary during a race\n\nI had to really think hard for the above three points (none of them gamebreaking) which to me is an indication of how much I love playing this game.

The only downside to this game is the sensitivity in the steering. PLayng this game on a keyboard can be a challange at times because you have to judge perfectly the point where the apex of the corner and the time to steer into that apex; if you are too soon, you will understeer, and if you are too late, you will oversteer the corner. This sensitivity makes streemlining difficult too, because its really hard to maintain the colinear motion behind the car in front. This sensitivity does however make the game a lot more chalanging, and makes the F1 car feel nimble and makes chicanes a lot of fun.","May 9, 2014","true","8.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

My first impression on this game was like many who look at racing titles with a unenthused "Meh". However, after devoting time to it, you'll easily see how great this title is. Whether you're using a controller or you're a hardcore sim racer using a steering wheel, you're find many hours of enjoyment in this.\n\nFirst and foremost, the graphics are stellar. If you have a machine which can handle the graphics, crank it up. You'll be blown away by the level of detail. Next for me is obviously the gameplay. You genuinely get the "race car driver" feeling as you race in search of that extra .1 second you know that you can take off of your qualifying time. You race to get your team on top, your name on top and to come out on top. You also feel like you're part of a team as your crew chief/engineer gives you track data as it pertains to you. If you've never played a racing title before, you may find the learning curve of the racing terminology to be pretty steep. You'll have to learn about KERS, DRS, prime tires, optimal tires, intermediate tires, wet tires, when to use them and also about fuel mixes which can help you save fuel by using less of it (at the cost of speed) or use more fuel which makes you go faster. All of which play into your general lap time and track position.\n\nOne of the best things I love about this game is the AI. They're smart. They don't try to run you off the road but they're aggressive just like F1 drivers are. If you leave a gap on your inside before a turn, they'll slide in and take it. However, when you're coming up on lap traffic, they'll slow down and pull to the other side of the track to let you pass. You can really get into some close racing action on here. The one and only downside I can see is the difficulty level. It's hard to find a middle ground sometimes as you can find yourself running away from the field or find the field running away from you. The gap between Intermediate and Professional is quite large. In Intermediate you may qualify 1-2 seconds faster than the next car whereas in Professional you may find yourself 2-4 seconds off the pace. But, there's a lot of ways to get faster and they all involve playing the game and simply getting better at it!\n\nAll in all, this a great game which I would recommend to anyone looking to have some close racing action.\n\nEasily an A+ in my books!","January 6, 2014","true","39.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreampime/recommended/208500/","dreampime","CoolBreeZe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreampime/","74 products in account","I mainly raced against friends (and AI), and did a few season challenges (among which 1 in co-op). Most were 25% races; I only did a 100% race once. I'm no Formula 1 aficionados, but I immediately liked F1-2012. Challenging but yet simple, enjoyable from your couch with a controller, I liked the balanced mix between arcade and simulation. Fuel and tires management is not much but it adds a little strategy aspect, affecting pit stop in a fun and sometimes decisive way. I progressively removed the driving assists, and I had tons of fun improving my lap times. Winning then gives you great sense of accomplishment, like "Look 'ma, no hands". On the down-side, AI difficulty isn’t very progressive, amateur or intermediate are too easy for me, but pro is just out of my league. And the penalty system is another thing that may be improved. Anyhow, I still like to race a couple of tracks now and then. And win, of course.","November 27, 2013","true","146.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

However, the career mode is a ton of fun. I love setting up my car for each track, and I like the dynamic weather system they have in place. The game is a fun and rewarding experience. The only real issue I take with it, is that it is very easy to get penalties. Also, the handling isn't quite up to snuff when compared to true racing sims like Assetto Corsa and iRacing.

When it runs into you you will be punished (throttle limit for x amount of secs) despite having done nothing wrong and it continues as if nothing happened.\nAlso I find that the rules are not applied correctly at all times, sometimes you will get no penalty for being in the grass with all fours, at other times you will get one (again limiter on throttle) while you are 100% sure that you had still one tire on the tarmac. I play in cockpit mode so I had a clear view on the front of my car at all times and I could repeat it while testing.\n\n\nTBH,\nI enjoyed '97 (PSX), '98 (PSX), 2001 (PC), 2006(PSII), and all other versions I have ever played much much more. If I had to choose between this version and 2006 on my PSII I would go for the latter (heck even 2001) any day of the week despite the graphics being dated a bit.\n\nI could suggest you try for yourself and make up your own mind and refund if needed but the game requires you to do all the tests before you get to drive races in career mode.\nNot sure if you will manage to get there within the two hour period as playtime included time to download and steam adds an hour (for some bizzare reason) when you go the the support section.\n\nArcade mode is available from the start but is not representative of the 'real' game.\n\n\n\nSee comments for more details about why it was not running for me at some point. ;)","September 22, 2015","false","129.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","15"

Not to mention that rule system of the game: the developers just missed the point. The game will punish immediately by time punishment or invalid lap once you leave track, even if noone is around. If an NPC contacts you the player gets punished not the NPC. The team dispatcher does not tell if any rain is coming though it lets you change your tires to dry when the rain is already falling. Fun fact: I got punished because I left the track...TO THE PIT!!! :@\n\nTo summarize my opinion the developers should pay me for paying this piece of sh*t. F1 deserves a better game that means fun and entertainment not infinite raging after I got punished repeatedly.","March 1, 2015","false","38.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I'm a casual racer. My favorite racing games are the Grand Turismo games on the Playstation consoles. I have the wheel that was designed for the 5th one on PS3. That game is awesome because I can just play it. But THIS GAME? No. Not so much. Maybe I'm just a novice, but I just can't even get past the first track on career mode. I use my wheel with this game and the cars are VERY twitchy. I've sat and tweeked the heck out of the wheel. I've gone to various forums looking for advice others have given on the best settings and tried those. And just when I thought I had the track down no less, which takes a lot of patience and time I might add, the AI just destroyed me; leaving myself wondering, "How in the heck can I drive this much better with this game?!" Oh and its not like I have it on Hard or anything. It's on the default AI setting. What was really sad to me was I did not notice a difference in how the cars handled when I pulled out my Xbox 360 controller to play this game. Dare I say it might make driving the cars a little easier? I don't know, but I know as much as I try to really like this game I just can't. I had more fun playing the Formula 1 games released on the first playstation. I had more fun playing the old Sierra NASCAR games on PC back in the day. You know why? It was because the controlls for the cars were easy to learn, and easy to use! The cars WEREN'T TWITCHY! Whenever I would break and then veer into a turn, I DIDN'T SPIN OUT like I do at least a few times per race in this game! This game is NOT FUN. It feels like work every time I play it. When I play a racing game, I expect to be able to just load, play, and be competitive. Not spend days and days trying to master a track only to finish in the bottom half of the pack. Screw that.

The career mode is extremely compelling - you want to improve in order to finish that place higher, to get onto the podium and to get the better contract for next year.\n\nThe weather and track effects are very good. The handling of the car feels completely different on the dry, damp and wet track, and it takes practise to master them all (especially the wet!). The physics of the car feel satisfying, with the modifications you make to the tuning having a real difference that you can immediately feel\n\nSadly the penalty system is borked, which can be annoying. It's very frustrating when the game wrongly gives you a drive through penalty, ruining an otherwise perfect race and dropping you back down the field. Apart from this gripe, it's a game I would thoroughly recommend picking up, especially if you have an interest in F1","July 13, 2013","true","65.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The career mode is extremely compelling - you want to improve in order to finish that place higher, to get onto the podium and to get the better contract for next year.\n\nThe weather and track effects are very good. The handling of the car feels completely different on the dry, damp and wet track, and it takes practise to master them all (especially the wet!). The physics of the car feel satisfying, with the modifications you make to the tuning having a real difference that you can immediately feel\n\nSadly the penalty system is borked, which can be annoying. It's very frustrating when the game wrongly gives you a drive through penalty, ruining an otherwise perfect race and dropping you back down the field. Apart from this gripe, it's a game I would thoroughly recommend picking up, especially if you have an interest in F1","July 13, 2013","true","65.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You do need to learn and understand the different tracks. There are still a few minor bugs which can occasionally cause you to throw a race (Abu Dhabi seems to be the standout for me) but otherwise pretty flawless. Avoiding penalties in the first lap can be hard and for the beginner intensely frustrating but with practise you can eventually avoid them. The only bugbear I have which stops me giving it a ten is the one aspect of the penalty system which penalises you if you have a collision but if some clown AI driver knocks you out they seem to get away scot free which hardly seems fair. The only way to avoid this is be really careful in the turns and stay as far away as you can from the other drivers. But apart from that it`s just a blast especially in career mode which really makes you feel a sense of achievement when you do well in a race or even better get offered a contract with a big team.

Pro is for the AI, not as brutal as they are on Legendary, but given I have no rewinds it seems like the right level of challenge.\n\nEach race i need to manage my fuel, tyres and race strategy and am currently running 9th on the Drivers Championship.\n\nFor the Arcade fans, Season Challenge is a quick 9 or so race season that you can run on Easy difficulty and still get immersed in the sensation of racing these groundbound rocket-ships.\n\nGet it, thank me later.","October 9, 2012","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is marvelous, and I'm not really bothered it's not a full simulator; it has a good natural feel to it. The assists mean you can enjoy it regardless of skill level.

Or pay 20 bucks if you really want it; at least it's not $60. Fun and has a great Easy setting if you're not a hard core driving gamer (medium and hard settings as well, and plenty of driving assists you can turn off, so it's highly tuneable).
