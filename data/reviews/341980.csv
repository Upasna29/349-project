The game looks great! The sea monster creature looked scary the first couple times, but then like the game it grew old. At first it took me awhile to learn the controls and mechanics of the game. With the detailed character creator I had a nagging suspicion that I was missing something. Somehow I wasn't playing my engineer right. Quickly I learned that was not the case.\n\nThe game past it's character creator is entirely simple and poorly balanced. The fact I went engineer meant absolutely nothing to the game. You gain no special abilities, no access to tools others would be without, no entry into areas that a scientist or pilot would be denied.  It's just stats, and so you'd better make sure you make great choices because you'll never be able to level up in the game.\n\nThe game relies not on experience but a currency you pick up throughout the maps. No problem there except you must survive in order to carry over the money you've found to be able to level your character up. That runs into a major issue since survival is almost impossible once the monster sees you and it will see you.\n\nOnce spotted you must run, but there is no means of escape, no means to halt the creatures progress or to slow it down. It can follow you into duct and once it has you confirmed it will not let go. There is no way to lure the creature elsewhere when you enter its patrol area. Essentially the game is a chase simulator with no mechanics other than running.\n\nAs I said I tried to get into the game, but with no means of progression, the monster stale, the game gets incredibly boring. Perhaps it would be fun online, but no one plays the multiplayer. Although the multiplayer is a good way to give yourself multiple lives.\n\nIn the end the game could have improved itself in a number of ways. It could have included NPCs that the game seems more than capable of rendering in funny hunt, but are entirely missing in single player. Even as cannon fodder they'd provide a great distraction.  There are no abilities, the monster isn't hampered by in world hazards nor are you capable of exploiting them to your advantage. That's the theme with this game it feels as if there are all these features that can be added, that are meant to be there, but just aren't.\n\nNot Recommended\n","December 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 80 of 92 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","80","92","0","0"

WILL UPDATE WHEN I CAN!\n\nDispatcherDeveloper: CivilSavages\nPublisher: CivilSavages\n\nNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an unbiased informative review. No other compensation was given.\n\nNote: My play time is not accurate, as I played several hours in Offline Mode.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nThe horror genre is super saturated right now, with only a small handful of titles standing head and shoulders above the other. Every now and then there comes a new horror title that really shakes things up and sets a new standard for the genre. Dispatcher......is not one of those titles. HOWEVER, that's not to say it's a bad game. It does a lot of things right, but there are also a lot of things that need a heap of improvement. I was really torn on whether to give this game a thumbs up or down...however I have ultimately decided to give it a thumbs up due to how well it accomplishes the good things, and for the potential it shows.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nDispatcher is set in the near future on a spaceship called...."Dispatcher". Odd name, but the crew ran into an accident and now alien creatures are roaming the ship along with some sort of infection. In typical horror game style, it's your mission to find out what happened as well as escape the ship with your life. Let's go over some of the finer points.\n\nFirst up is character creation. You have a small array of choices with which to customize your character. First, you choose a profession...this can be a pilot, an engineer, or a scientist. Each profession gives you certain stats, which as far as I can see do not affect gameplay in a major way yet. If they did, I did not notice much of a difference. I could be wrong. Next you choose a hobby, which can be things like a bully, gamer, farmer, or alcoholic. Each of these has a small effect on your character as well, such as how fast they gain experience, or how silent they can be while moving. Next, you choose whether you are male or female, your voice, and a name. This must be done in the Database section of the main menu before you can start a game, by the way.\n\nOnce you hop into a game, you are presented with a few more options to customize the game. These include whether or not you have infinite battery charge in your flashlight, how many monsters appear (or none at all), or how much the infection spreads. Once you get this sorted out the way you like it, you are dropped into the game into a small room of the ship. A short prompt on screen introduces you to the story, which after this point is told entirely via Notes you find laying around the ship.  Speaking of these Notes, Dispatcher was developed by a Russian devteam, and as such Russian is the game's main language. Even your character voices are in Russian. There is an English option (does not apply to voices), but when used the entire game looks like the original Russian script was just ran through Google Translate. As a result, things might not make a whole lot of sense as there are a LOT of errors.\n\nOnce you get past that, you actually have a genuinely terrifying game. What Dispatcher does best is the immersion. You can hear your own footsteps, the monsters prowling about, and sometimes your own breathing. Every so often you will hear one of the monsters growl, making it sound like it's very close by, even if they are not. This keeps you on edge the entire game, so that when you do finally see one of the monsters, it's a terrifying experience and you will literally freak out. You have to keep your cool and find a way to shake it off your tail, whether it be staying in the darkness (TURN OFF YOUR FLASHLIGHT!), keeping very quiet, or hiding inside a ventilation shaft. Due to this terror I recommend the game be played in short bursts, unless you are a glutton for punishment. I do not recommend using headphones or playing in total darkness!\n\nThere are a small number of items you can find and use throughout the game. Batteries are useful if you chose to leave Infinite Battery unchecked, as you will need them to continue to use your flashlight. Pills are basically your way of healing yourself, should you be able to escape a monstrous encounter. Laying around literally everywhere you will find small amounts of what I call credits, which you can spend on upgrades or to unlock new professions/hobbies.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nDeveloped in the Unreal 4 Engine, the game looks stunning. However everything appeared a bit glossy...at least to me. This made distant objects look rather bland, but up-close everything was amazing. Set inside a spaceship, you will definitely see the setting upon every corner you turn. Vents, lights, doors, some windows, even a few living quarters are all accounted for here, and detailed out the wazoo. It almost reminds me of Alien: Isolation. Perhaps that was one source of inspiration?\n\nThe in-game models looks nice, as well as your character portrait in the character creator. One of the loading screens features a very striking resemblance to the YouTuber known as PewDiePie...perhaps the devs are fans? The "hot chicks" they advertise on the store page...? Create a female character, hop in-game, and look straight down. That's it.\n\nMy only complaint is how generic, weak, and underdeveloped the monsters look. One is literally a humanoid with what looks like pus-filled bubbles all over its body, while another looks like a running shark (this one will chase you into vents!!!). I am inclined to believe that the monsters will see some improvements in the future as Early Access runs it's course.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe music, while simple, is only used in the menus so far. The main menu screen's theme gives you a dreadful chill as  you prepare to dive into the game. The best part of the game is the sound direction. As mentioned before, you will hear the monsters wandering the ship, and occassionally growling to let you know that they are coming for you! Again, I do not recommend playing this game with headphones, as this only serves to help the terror settle into you deeper! While that is the point of the game, it can be a bit overwhelming to people who are not used to the horror genre.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nMy only complaint is that when you first boot up a game, it may take a few minutes to load. After that everything loads a lot faster. So far, I have seen 60 FPS consistently, with no crashing, glitches, framerate drops, or lag. I honestly forgot to see if the game had controller support, as for this type of game I usually default to mouse and keyboard.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nDIspatcher does not have a lot going for it right now, but it has a ton of potential. Once it's finally finished and released from Early Access, I can see it being one helluva horror title with great immersion. It's definitely worth a look for diehard horror fans, but not so much for everyone else. Thankfully it has a somewhat small pricetag, so even those who aren't horror fans aren't burned too badly should they find themselves disappointed or too scared to continue playing.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/On9fLhpnObA\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\n\nIf you liked this review or found it helpful, please consider rating it up. Feel free to rate it down if you did not find if helpful, and please leave a comment letting me know what you didn't like so that I can improve my reviews in the future!\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","September 7, 2015","true","5.2"," 174 of 231 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","174","231","6","5"

I was only able to get the game working by streaming it from another computer, then changing the default resolution settings, and THEN launching it on my computer again.

Sadly there has been no one in my experience to play the multiplayer with as it seems to be dead.\n\nThe lack of content is also something to look at, there are not enough customization options for your characters, as well as they are gender locked, making it feel more limited. you are playing within once map, where you can spawn into three seperate areas (Block A - C), once you've explored everywhere and managed to escape, you've seen most of the game.\n\nThere are also problems in ther game where I was not able to pick up items, save up on the currency to buy the last two locked characters due to it deleting itself. after a session, my footsteps and monster's steps sounding exactly the same when it shouldn't as I'm not a heavy beast stomping the ground.\n\nOverall, Dispatcher is a demo disguised as a "full" game with the lack of content, poor presentation, and lack of any story to engage the player to be interested.\n\n3/10","January 8","false","2.2"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","47","57","2","0"

The movement feels EXTREMELY clunky and slow, level design is just horrible, mostly straight corridors with little options to actually hide from the monsters. Oh and most of the time you only know there's a monster around when you run right into one. Yes, they do make some noise, but most of the time it's still impossible to tell where a monster might be (unlike in Alien, where you can use the motion sensor to get an idea of where the Xeno is sneaking around and can then try to avoid it). Combined with the level design this makes the game feel extremely unfair and more annoying than scary.\n\nOh yeah and the graphics.. I don't know why other reviewers keep praising them as one of the good things about this game. They are mediocre at best and get completely ruined by a lot of ugly post-processing effects that make it look just bad.\n\nSo if you think about buying this game, just don't. I bought it for 2,50€ in a sale and still feel ripped off.\nThe only good thing about this game are the pilot's boobs.

To make it worse, not only have the few survivors been affected, but Aliens seem to have found a way onto the vessel. Armed with a flashlight, you have to try to survive as long as you can in this atmospheric horror game!\n\nFirst you have to create a crew member (your character). You will have several classes to choose from: pilot, signalman, engineer, scientist, and two others who you can unlock (which I haven’t yet). Then you have to choose your biography (I like this, it’s fun) everything from a farmer, fanatic, idiot or alcoholic to an actor who likes to play movies in his/her birthday suit (absolutely mind blowing). Each biography has its own attribute… cough…cough!\n\nYou will be able to play 2 modes in single player - Survival or Funny Hunt. In the survival mode, you will have to survive as long as you can and escape the vessel. In the funny hunt, you will play the monster and hunt survivors (the A.I is not that great in this mode). A multiplayer mode is also available.\n\nWhen you setup a survival game, you can choose the level of difficulty, from No Monsters to Hard. I suggest trying the first couple of games on the easy difficulty as you do not have any tutorials on this game. You can also choose if you have an unlimited number of batteries for your flashlight and you can elect to have infection or not.\n\nDuring the gameplay, you can pick up items: batteries for your flashlight, pills to regenerate your health, money, red and blue keys to open doors (that need one of these colour keys to open), notes and fuses. Be careful what you step onto, as there are a number of dangers: Explosive mines… (well, you know what will happen if you step on one of those). Electric mines (will not kill you but if you being chased by a monster, you will be in a bit of a strife): Green slime (this is radioactive and you will lose a fair bit of your health).\n\nFour enemies to be worried about include a glowing red orb - one touch and its game over!\n\nThe graphics are good and I really like the horror ambiance in this game.\n\nThere are a couple of issues. The resolution can’t go higher than 1920 X 1080 or the screen will be cut. There are some items that can’t be pick up. For me the most annoying thing is the sensitivity on the mouse wheel button (please change this, make it part of the setup). However, the developers seems to be on the ball and are trying to resolve issues rapidly.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics\n-	Great ambiance – Horror theme\n-	Good character customization with humour\n-	Challenging\n-	Trading cards & achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	A bit buggy\n-	Mouse sensitivity – please remove it from the mouse wheel button\n\nDespite a need for some improvements, I am enjoying this game and I am very happy to recommend it!\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

So, so much work. This barely feels like an alpha build at the minute. Once you're dropped into the map, you can either step out of your room and immediately get your head ripped off by monsters you can't fight or stay put and stare at your own boobs.\nHaving said that, I'm still recommending this for the simple reason that it has more potential than any Early Access title I've seen in a long time. Character creation is excellent but needs proper implementation. The monsters are brutally unsettling, especially the shark-mouthed abortion that charges after you into vents. I'm excited to see what the multiplayer throws up too.\nIt isn't just tweaks at this point; major gameplay changes need to be considered. The cat and mouse element between your player and the monsters should be massively emphasised; maybe they can't be killed but they should at least be stunnable or able to hide from or distract. Your first port of call there is the mines. If you've got the skill to hop one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in full sprint, you should be rewarded with the satisfying sound of it detonating up the business end of whatever's chasing you.\nI believe in this game.

A game also have a multiplayer. In funny hunt mode you are a monster and your goal is to kill all survivors. In a survival mode you are a survivor, your goal is to escape from station. You can set up difficulty level, for example you can play without monsters or you can turn on infinity battery life. First you should create a character. At the start you can choose from 4 classes: pilot, signalman, engineer, scientist (also you have two character that can you unlock later) then you have to choose from a 12 different biography (all classes and biography add to your character different stats and perks). Also I should mention, some biography be funny for example alcoholic or idiot. After that you choose you face, voice and name. In a game you are found some collectables: batteries for your flashlight, pills for healthy yourself, money for upgrade your character, notes with story and fuses/ key cards to open doors. Also in your way you found some traps or toxic what you should avoid. Also in game you can found four different enemies. In a game a sound is very good, it's good point, because for a horror games this one is very important. Graphic is very good and this is not wonder because game use Unreal 4 Engine.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+good graphic (Unreal 4 Engine)\n+good sounds\n+good character customization\n+good difficulty customization\n+multiplayer\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-a bit slow loading\n\nWell this game you found good graphic and good sounds, the last one is very important for horror games. You can create your own character and develop it, its bring a bit RPG felling to game, also you can easily set a difficulty, it can be very useful for players who don’t very similar with horror games.

Opening doors and looting the room for survival gear while watching your back for unkillable enemies is fun but when the whole game is based around it, it gets pretty boring fairly quickly.\n\nA coupIe things I dislike about the game. First is that crouching is faster than walking, I played the first hour of the game in crouch as it was alot faster to get around.\n\nSecond is that the enemies are unkillable, you don't have a weapon to kill them with and can not find weapons. You play the game with a flashlight running around the ship looking for key cards to open the next door and batteries which power your flashlight. When your flashlisht runs out it is certain death within a minute.\n\nCan't recommend buying this game but if you get it in a bundle give it a go.","January 26","false","2.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

To start off, I have only played this game with a friend, so I am not sure how this game is to play solo. The first time I played, I found some batteries and then went adventuring down a hallway with my friend. Less than 30 seconds later we hear a loud screaming sound and then he hid in a toilet and I died. Basically, this game catches you off guard VERY easily and it is really terrifying when that happens. I think I've only ran into the monster once where I wasn't caught off guard, and it still scared the crap out of me because he was right around the corner.\n\nPros:\n-A ton of fun to play with friends\n-Pretty terrifying (a lot scarier than me and my friend expected)\n-3 decently sizes maps to play on (all on the same ship, just different areas)\n-FANTASTIC atmosphere (sound and graphical design)\n-Beautiful graphics, on par with alien isolation and soma\n-Bonus mode where you and your friends compete to see how many humans you can "infect"(kill). I am sort of indifferent about this mode, at least for now, as there aren't any options. If you could choose how long the game would last for, and you could customize how many humans there were, it would make it a lot better.\n\nCons:\n-There are some cheap ways to die; i.e. mines on the ground, the green radiation that can infect and kill you(although this can be remedied by taking pills).\n-Not really that much of a variation between all 3 maps (which can be a good thing, because it's all supposed to be on one ship anyways. It's also very easy to get lost, which in a horror game, depending on who you are, is a good/bad thing.)\n-Once you get through all 3 maps, there's not much left you can do. (Then again, I have been playing for almost 2 hours and only beat one of the maps.)\n\n\nOverall, this game has great potential, and for what it is right now, it's very good. My only hope is that the developer adds more options, and adds more maps/areas to explore, and maybe even new monsters.","December 3, 2015","true","7.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

After playing it and dying over and over again or getting stuck in various objects and collision I was super close to giving up on it forever. I jumped directly into MP as well with a friend we were both lost. I took a break came back after 30 minutes and started up single player thinking maybe I just need to explore more and sure enough there was an option to play it with no hostiles and just explore. I familiarized myself with the game mechanics and how it plays. Tried MP again and had a blast game was a lot more fun when knowing what the point of it all was and how it plays.\n\nGameplay: 6 *Very buggy, hard to get into at first\nGraphics: 8 *Not bad at all\nPhysics: 8 *Boobs are good everything else like carrying objects is annoying\nSP Fun Factor: 7 *Kind of boring solo, Alien Isolation did it better\nMP Fun Factor: 9 *Loads of fun with friends\nReplay Value: 7 *This is really up to the player / players to keep it going\n\nShort Guide on how to play the game.\n(Default difficulty option I don’t know how much harder or if they have new monster on the harder difficulty levels)\n\nSurvival : You must survive you take damage over time due to the elements; you can find pills to heal you and batteries for your flashlight. Escape by getting into an escape pod, only one person can escape in MP.\n\nRed Orbs: These NPC’s are red orb like beings that follow you around if they spot you but are slow moving and easy to dodge. They are one hit kills if they touch you.\n\nAlien: This guy will follow you forever learn the layout of the map and remember safe zone locations otherwise you will die, try to stay as quiet as possible it seems to be attracted by sound and light. You will know it’s coming by its loud footsteps and you will know it sees you when the music changes and it roars.  This guy can kill you in one or two hits. For some reason I have survived by flipping him off “RMB”.\n\n(If in MP and people use up all their lives they will turn into zombies that can attack the player)\n\nTraps:\nExplosive Mines:  1 hit kill they are red but can be moved around or jumped over a pinging noise will occur when you are getting close to one.\n\nElectric Mines: Will stun you for a length of time they are blue in color.\n\nGreen Dust: Green dust or radiation areas will cause massive life damage over time so get out of these areas fast.\n\nHanging Alien Vine: This is some sort of 1 hit kill plant just walk around it as it hangs from the ceiling.\n\nItems:\n\nCredits – Blue / sliver shaped Currency survive and escape with these to level up your character from the crew menu.\n\nPills – Look like your average pill box / bottles these will add to your radiation / life bar.\n\nRed Card – Used to open red doors around the map\n\nBlue Card – Used too open blue doors around the map\n\nBlue Cube – Press E to pick up / is used on the cube pressure plate (which looks a lot like the cube) on levels to open the door and escape with the escape pod. (I have made it through some levels without using this item so It might not be always necessary, I also made it through a level without using any keycards……could just been a bug but whatever)\n\n\nRemeber to level up your character upon having credits when you escape the ship, you can do this from the same menu you created your character.\n\n","November 17, 2015","true","2.7"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","2"

Well, because it's the plot of 'Alien' and the recent title 'Alien Isolation'. Not that this is a bad thing, the idea of creating suspense with a secluded area and a few enemies creates magnificent tension. Which is done extremely well here.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/arqgFNgrfRo?t=24m43s\n\nUsing the Unreal 4 Engine, Civil Savages creates a very immersive and beautiful looking game. The mechanics are fairly typical of this genre. First person control, pills to heal, batteries for your flashlight, and interactable objects. However, you don't come to a first person horror game for deep crazy mechanics. You come for the exploration, the jump scares, and the challenge of getting out alive. One thing that stands out as different for the gameplay is the rpg mechanics. Which are implemented in an almost roguelike way.\n\nThe first thing you do before playing is create a character and choose between 7 (5 available at start, one unlockable) careers. It's basically who are you on this ship. So you can be a scientist, signalman, engineer, etc. Each class has their own starting stats (Energy, Reaction, Stamina, Immunity, Quiet) that affect your character. After choosing your career, you then must choose from  12 different biographies. These are what you were before you were assigned to the ship. Each of these give you character a little flavor, but also change stats and add static effects in some cases. As you go through each playthrough you will earn money which can then be spent to increase each of the individual stats. Making the game have that roguelike feel.\n\nBeing in early access there are some bugs I ran into, like falling through the world in the practice area. So be prepared for optimization coming down the pipeline from Civil Savages. They are also planning to add a co-op mode to the game at some point this summer which I find to be an exciting take on the first person horror genre.\n\nOverall, Dispatcher is on it's way to being a strong competitor in the horror market, with great graphics, atmosphere, and character, you'll be sure to have your share of scares.\n\nFor more Indie Movie, Music, and Game reviews - EarlyAccessMedia.com","July 9, 2015","true","1.1"," 31 of 56 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","31","56","0","0"

I love the art design of the creatures that you encounter but the main issue I have with the game is that some of the props and the sounds just have the "PLACEHOLDER" feeling to them. The art design for the station's hallways seem viable and okay enough but I cannot help but feel that the stacks of papers, cardboard boxes and other misc items from what look like the 1970's do not really fit in this game and feel like they were a last minute decision to add "filler" to the game itself.  Again I know that this is early access and there will be more updates to follow.\n\nAlso, I just feel that there is no real objective at this point in the game's development nor is there a strong sence of direction. What I mean by that is the story and overall what the hell is going on, you just spawn in a room and the game goes, "HERE YOU ARE SPACE MAN!"\n\nFinally the U.I. is kinda ♥♥♥♥...","July 17, 2015","true","0.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET!\n\nThe only real horror here is that this game level of not being finished. It looks great, the monsters, alright. But good luck trying to figure out what everything does or what to do. It NEVER tells you. You have to figure out that a glowing slot is where a fuse goes and where to find it. And thats just the first part.\nThis game has SOOO much potential, but its nowhere near done. The maps are small and constrained, monsters will chase you mercilessly so hope you have enough map to run away and lose sight of them AND that you dont trip any of the traps that dont work on them. Honestly if luring them to a trap was part of the game that would be something but it doesnt kill them and you have NO way of fighting back, distracting them or even dodging them.","January 4","false","0.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

Your 'moral' attack, which is flicking the monsters or your friends off, uses up your BATTERY. Your battery in itself last maybe 2 minutes, at MAX.

Now all this is just from the START. You'll die more times than the drill will fail you in Payday 2. There is no source telling you what you have to do, where to do, or what the hell is going on. You wake up in an abandoned spaceship. The reviews for this game are misleading, do not listen to what peopel say on here. Look up good honest reviews on youtube or something, becausee this game is not the hype that these people are saying it to be. The only thing i see this game being, is a cash a grab, make the game look good, have people write some reviews for it, make it sound positive, and let the money flow while under the assumption that its 'early access'. Now, for something nice about it. It has a great idea to it, and the situation could of been fun. If the freaking mines and traps worked for monsters just as well as humans. Mines do not work on monsters just to let you guys know. ONLY HUMANS.\n\nTL:DR\n\nDo not buy this game until you see what its like AFTER its released.

As if a unbalanced monster wasnt enough we got lots of explosive death traps, toxic waste, vines and other one hit kill devices randomly lying around. This might sound like ♥♥♥♥♥ing, but all that combined makes it near impossible for human players to win even one round.\nAlso the options are really spartanic. There is no fine tuning of gamma settings, mouse sensitifity and the music cant be turned off without turning off all sounds. The whole station is extremly dark and small (makes running away even more annoying). Character creation is a waste of time because it doesnt change anything in the game because the only things you will do is finding key cards and some points.\nI really think this wannabe Alien Isolation is an insulte to the gamers and I cant believe that I spend money on this waste of time.","January 2","false","1.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

But something has gone wrong, and a sinister extra-terrestrial being is now on the hunt for every human aboard, including you. It is your goal to evacuate yourself off of the Dispatcher and escape the horrors of space and its predator.\n\nThat’s the basic gist of the game. You’ll be collecting pill bottles to restore health, batteries to keep your flashlight alive, notes, key cards, power fuses and so on; all the while being hunted by the monsters.\n\nBut here’s the thing… this game is cheap as all hell. I can’t tell you how many times an alien spotted me from who-knows where, only to chase me down and kill me before I could even flinch. Their ability to spot and chase the player is stupidly quick, and you won’t have a chance to react before getting eaten alive. Hiding in vents, behind objects or any sort of barrier is a total waste of time. The only way to properly evade your pursuer is to lock yourself inside a storage closet or bathroom, and if you aren’t situated directly next to one of these rooms… well, you’re dead. There’s even an enemy who looks like a floating red orb, and the very second it touches you, its game over. Its things like these that make the game less horrifying and more irritating. And don’t get me started on the plethora of traps scattered across the Dispatcher. Mines, radioactive sludge, even electrified explosives. When the player is running from the monster, he/she won’t be looking down at the floor to avoid hazards. It’s just another cheap mechanic to get you killed.\n\nAs mentioned before, the player’s only objective is to find keycards and fuses to open specific doors, but the ship’s layout is so basic and similar that it’ll take you ten minutes before realizing you’ve been walking in a circle.\n\nBut thankfully, there are some pros to this game. Sound design is top notch, there is a unique and fun character creation mechanic that RPG fans will feel right at home with, there’s multiplayer, and the Unreal engine looks better than ever.\n\nBut with all this game’s short comings, I just don’t see the worth in Dispatcher. The entirety of its content can be played in one of Alien: Isolation’s DLC survival missions, and it’s far more frustrating than it is scary.\n\nTo sum it up, Dispatcher still feels like it’s in early access, and what it sets out to achieve has already been done by better horror games.","November 23, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/341980/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1465 products in account","IntroductionDispatcher is a sci-fi horror game that has you roaming around in the dark searching for notes and to find a way out of the 'Dispatcher' while being chased by monsters.\n\nGameplayFor a game like Dispatcher, you would expect it to be a typical run away from monsters in a linear type of way, whereby you are running to where the game wants you to go. The first thing that I didn't really expect from a game like this is a custom character that you can create from the start of the game. There is a nice variation of what characters you can be, this also with some cool traits that your character can have, and even some different voice options. Although this isn't really needed in a horror game, it's still a nice feature to have on a specific type of genre that doesn't normally have character customization. The traits that you can pick will increase or decrease your overall score of these: Energy, Speed, Stamina, Immunity and Quiet. Although it seems like some of these attridbutes don't really change the gameplay all that much. I have tested the game and have changed the amount of Stamina, speed ect I have but didn't really see much difference in the game itself. Upon playing the game for the first time you will start off with a few options in the game to either make the game harder or easier depending on how you like to play your games. The level design for Dispatcher is well thought out, although may be on the linear side of things the game itself is very good and the level design seems to be well thought out. Although there isn't much orginiality to the game, it's still fairly nice to play. The atmosphere is well presented, along with some nice sound effects along with it.\n\nThe graphics of this game are rather impressive, the lighting of this game is very good. It's just light enough to keep the game interesting, especially when you hear a unexpected monster creeps up on you. The graphics of the game in general are very suiting for the type of sci-fi genre that the game is going for. With the nice lights that are on some blocks and the that the walls look fit the genre of the game very well, giving it that futuristic feel to the game. Although the graphics are fairly nice, the one thing that I noticed was there was no option to change motion blur on or off for the game. This may annoy users who don't like the use of motion blur and therefor are forced to play with it on.\n\nPros+ Atmosphere is great\n+ Lighting of the game is well done\n+ Level design is well thought out\n+ Trading Cards & Achievements\n\nCons- No option to change motion blur\n- No controller support\n\nResult / Final thoughtsDispatcher is a fairly decent horror game. It has great graphics and lighting that are really done well throughout the game. The graphics, along with the well thought out level deisgn and monsters really make this game good. Although the game seems to be better suited with full controller support, it is still a great game and well worth the price.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here.","March 27","true","3.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I'd be despairing if the developers thought this was anything even vaguely resembling a "finished" product.  And while I appreciate it's just Early Access, a few more clues as to WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING would be appreciated.  Even if said hints were just on the Store page, and not even in the game itself (though that'd be nice, too).  Here's an example, in any case, of what IS on the Store page:  "Chicks in skinny clothes, blood, screams and other possibility."  So yeah, okay, I'm a bit of a ♥♥♥♥wit if I thought this game was going to be eloquent in its instructions, but a bit of brief scene-setting and/or a tutorial wouldn't go astray.  Now there IS an option to try something called a "Practice" mode, but unfortunately that gives us NO more of an idea as to what's going on than the "Start" game does.  Considering how much influence the devs seem to have taken from both Monstrum and Alien: Isolation, here's hoping that between now and the "official" release they study those games a little closer to learn how to better clue the player in on what to do.  Monstrum, for example, only gives you the bare minimum you need to know, but it's still WAY MORE than we're gettin' here.  Which is regrettable because...\n\nTHIS GAME SHOWS MASSIVE POTENTIAL.  I say that a lot, especially about Early Access games, but rarely do I mean it as much as I mean it here.  The graphics are fantastic, the atmosphere is great, the sound is spooky, and the monsters are sufficiently gnarly.  Its "heart" is TOTALLY in the right spot.  But its "head" still needs a great deal of work!  My few attempts at play thus far have consisted of:  "Oh, here I am in a room.  I can pick up a few things - don't know what they do yet - but I can pick them up.  One way out of the room, I'll go that way I guess (though I'm not yet sure why...maybe I just feel like a quiet stroll).  Roam some more corridors.  Take a bit of radiation damage.  Work out that that's what the pills are for.  'Cause let's face it, they couldn't possibly be to counter any damage caused by the monsters, who within mere minutes seem to track me down and corner me at the end of a corridor and kill me more-or-less instantly.  GAME OVER."  Either this, or I step into some electricity...which zaps me for many seconds and maybe attracts monsters, but doesn't do any damage in and of itself...or failing all of that, I might step into some Alien-esque green gunk dripping from the ceiling and accumulating on the floor, which gets my foot stuck and promptly leads to me being killed by something unseen before my game unceremoniously crashes.\n\nLet's see, what else?  Well, unlike the games I mentioned earlier- and Outlast, to name at least one other - you don't seem to be able to hide in lockers or under beds; indeed, I always seem to end up in situations where I'm not sure where to hide at all.  And considering that I don't even know WHY I'm walking around in corridors teeming with monstrous beasties in the first place, I can only conclude that my character has watched all their space-friends die horrible deaths, and is thusly resigned to SUICIDE.  I also don't know, for the life of me, how you actually "outrun" monsters, as they're always two steps behind and, like I say, you can't seem to properly "hide" anywhere even if you DID manage to outrun them for all of three seconds.  I'll also be dang-♥♥♥♥ed if I know what all the stats are for when you "create" a "character".  Though there is one small bonus for all the lonely male gamers out there:  If you play a female character, you can look down in first-person and see your own BOOBIES.  I guess that's what the devs meant by the sentence I quoted from the Store page up above.  After all, if you're gonna run around a spaceship with no purpose in mind other than to git yo'self kilt, you might as well do it with half yo' boobies hangin' outta yo' jumpsuit.  I know that's what I'D do, if was a sexy, big-boobied chick stuck on a spacecraft with rampaging aliens.  One, two, three, sing along wit' me:  "My milkshake brings all the monsters to tha yard..."\n\nLook, with a bit of work - okay, a LOT of work - this game could end up being EASILY worth the ten dollar asking price.  But right now, unless you're like me and you just like wasting your money so that you can write reviews in which you whine about unfinished games with the words "Early Access" in the title, you may want to be SMART and wait to see if they actually knock this into some sort of shape.  All we have here, right now, is a quick run-around inside the corridors of a spooky spaceship before you get space-smushed.  If they manage to add a PLOT to all of this, well, we may just have a winner on our hands...\n\nVerdict (for now):  6/10.\n\n(UPDATE - as of 14th November, 2015:\n\nOkay, so apparently the game is now officially FINISHED...and, I'm sad to report, things haven't improved much!  In fact, I'm tempted to say they've gotten worse...\n\nFirst of all, there's been no discernible "story" added.  No set-up, no explanation for anything...you just appear in a room and don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing there, EXACTLY as you did in the Early Access version.  And things only get more frustrating the second you step out of said room...\n\nI just tried replaying this, twice.  First time, I wandered around a bit, picked up a few random objects, heard a monster before I even saw it...and DIED.  Second playthrough, walked out of the room I spawned in...IMMEDIATELY DIED, from stepping in some electrified puddle or something.  So the devs of this game still have absolutely no interest in building any suspense, developing any kind of scenario, tutoring the player in any kind of gameplay mechanics...it's just walk outside and, well, ♥♥♥♥ happens.  And boo-sucks to you if you don't already know what to do.\n\nLet me know when the NEXT "official" version goes up, and I'll maybe...just MAYBE...have the patience to try it again.)","July 10, 2015","true","1.4"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","12","27","2","2"

But it's not that fun either. As of now the game has no real story and  no real direct objective. There's a practice mode and Single Player mode but I'm not quite sure the difference between the two. There's also a multiplayer mode but it's currently blocked out. So basically you start the game, look for clues as to where to go and avoid the monsters. Dispatcher borrows heavily from games like Alien: Isolation and Outlast, but it's graphics are top notice due to use of the Unreal 4 engine, when you can see them of course. As of now there's no gamma bar or brightness bar, So unless you want to turn brightness up on your monitor prepare to bump into a lot of walls. Unless you're into Early Access games I'd recommend waiting on this one for a least a few months.

Monsters will send you to your room to was your butt and put on new underwear. But, it is still currently early access. Its short. Very short. And there are bugs still that are annoying. Additionally, there are no instructions on what is happening, or what is going on at all. Finally, everything is in Russian! But, this was pretty good for early on. Should be enjoyable for those of us that keep spare underwear just for that purpose. Enjoy! And if you would leave a comment or something on the youtube that would be appreciated.

With puzzles to do as well! Basically, it's Amensia with a dash of Fallout in space. If you like being scared while trying to figure out puzzles, this is the game for you.\n\nWithout a doubt, Dispatcher is scary. Given its a horror game, that's a good start, but that's the thing done best so far about Dispatcher. It combines jump scares, with the shuffling sounds of the infected crew member to keep you on edge. You can't fight back, and all you can do is hope it never finds you.\n\nBeyond the scare factor, Dispatcher is also part a puzzle game and part an RPG. You get to choose a class for your character, and then traits for it, which helps define your skills (and more importantly, how quiet you are!). The puzzle part comes in with the level design- you need to finish the level and escape, while avoiding the infected crew member/alien (not really sure what it is at this stage). So to do so, you've got to open locked doors, find key cards, etc.\n\nConsidering how early the game is right now, this game is looking pretty amazing. It looks brilliant, and the lack of lighting really creates that atmosphere needed for a decent scary game. When you combine the scare factor with the puzzle nature, and the RPG element, you've got the potential for a great game here.\n\nThe only issues you'll find with the game so far are the translations, which are mostly in Russian still, or in badly done English (you can still make out what they mean however, so its not an impediment), and the lack of a tutorial or help system (they offer a practice mode ingame, but it's another puzzle section that is more guided, without actually using any words. You've really got no idea what you're doing first up, so it'll take a few attempts to get going. It's an easy game to pick up though, so you'll be fine.\n\nRight now, it's extremely early access. You'll get some fun out of the game right now, but not an infinite amount, so purchasing it now is more to support the developers so they can finish this game.","August 17, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

On anything other than hard mode, the game is a pretty, but shallow entry into the survival horror genre, as one might expect with this being an early release. However, when you switch to hard mode, that's where things get really interesting. I play lots of horror games and the hard mode experience in this game is something you should experience if you love having your video games scare you, because I assure you, this one will.\n\nI am looking forward to see how this game progresses as it approaches a final release.

Amateur.\n\nThis game was also a lesson in Steam refunds, as I learned that since I purchased the game along with several others during the Autumn Sale, the only way to refund this game is to refund my entire order with four other games, removing all of them from my library.
