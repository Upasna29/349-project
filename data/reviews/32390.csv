As a kid who loved Star Wars and loved Doom, when this thing came out it was so hot. I only had the demo back then (which featured level 1) but I played that badboy about 200 times. I knew every secret and tactic there was for that level.\n\nFuelled entirely by nostalgia, over 15 years later, I saw this for sale for 89c and pounced on it. I fired her up... It appeared stuck in windowed mode and I started to panic. When the opening cutscene finished, it went into fullscreen. Relief washed over me in an awesome wave.\n\nSuddenly, it all came rushing back to me. My hands guided me and I started moving like I knew exactly what to do... Then I realised the mouse aim was inverted and all the control bindings were odd. I fixed that up and then I was back on my feet. Even without the conscious appreciation of what I was doing, my hands and subconscious knew what to do:\n\nThere is an enemy around that corner. A secret weapon can be found down there. Look up and slash that vent with your lightsaber.\n\nI was on fire. I finished the level on hard with 100% completion and no retries. Now I was in new territory. Despite the 8yo me playing level one ad nauseum, the demo had not allowed me to progress further....\n\nHelp guys. I'm stuck on level 2 now and it's hard.","May 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 169 of 181 people (93%) found this review helpful 210 people found this review funny","93","169","181","210","7"

(Played between 2013 and Early 2014) I may have not played this game during its release but even playing it recently I had respected the old visuals, in order to enjoy the fun experiences of each level. The levels in this game are very diverse, you never spend two missions in the same location with the same playstyle. This game was also unique the the franchise other than Jedi Knight: Academy in the fact you don't play as Kyle Katarn the whole time. Switching between characters was a nice and I really enjoyed the different gameplay from each character. Mara Jade's missions gave something new to the series, as you play in very different settings against foes who normally only appear for a short time in the other games. This game is rather short, being only 14 levels but with each of these levels not playing like the next. I would definitely recommend this game if you have played the other Jedi Knight's and enjoyed them, and don't mind playing with an older generation's graphics. A few closing statements are beware the cutscenes are only in one resolution, while the rest of the game can handle any resolution. Also you must be open to a more challenging game where fighting may be less advanced in terms of keys, but is way harder then the newer games. (Played on Jedi Master)\n\nIf anyone has any other questions or concerns don't hesistate to add me i'll be happy to answer them!","February 22, 2014","true","15.6"," 65 of 80 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","65","80","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/recommended/32390/","thecolorurple","TheColorUrple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/","511 products in account","+Excellent level design\n+Lengthy for an expansion pack\n\n-Compatibility issues\n-Storyline and voice acting\n\nStarting out Mysteries of the Sith, I really wasn't sure I was going to finish it. I had completed Jedi Knight back in its day, and decided it would be fun to revisit the gameplay via this expansion pack. (On a personal note, I feel it's deeply frustrating to play through a 1998 expansion pack with the length of the average full-priced game of today, since nowadays the best we can hope for is a 3-hour story DLC for $15. Oh how the times change.)\n\nThe game's age was the first thing I noticed - blocky, pixelated character models and textures, complete lack of AI, the strange inability to change the inverted mouse look - and it's admittedly offputting. Spending hours configuring the game to be playable on my system didn't help either (see the Notes below).\n\nDespite all of this, Sith is a deeply engaging experience. This is based on a few key factors.\n\nOne is its level design, which not only holds up well despite its age, but is actually smarter and far more interesting than the majority of shooters released today. For one thing, the levels are enormous. Sith is the antithesis of the corridor shooter that was so popular back in the 90's. Every level has you exploring what feels like a real place – a Hutt palace, a mining facility, a spaceport – whatever the case may be, the level design feels congruent throughout, like a fully realized location instead of a series of shooting galleries. It is a linear game, true, but the way forward often loops back on itself and isn't always apparent, even very frequently hidden, requiring the use of a HUD map to find it. In fact, since I'm used to never having any problems figuring out where to go in a linear shooter, I forgot about the map feature and got stuck a few times – this is the effect of being spoon fed by modern gaming design. Since you play as a Jedi with the ability to use the Force to jump very high and very fast, there is also a truly remarkable verticality to the maps, requiring the player to look carefully up and down for the next area, using a combination of Force powers to access it. By today's standards, I often found myself thinking I had found a secret, when in fact I had just found the correct way to advance. I actually missed most of the actual secrets in the game, which is a testament to its brilliance in design.\n\nAnother very important positive for Sith is its combat. While I initially thought the first level a bit bland, I was suddenly low on health, trying to scrape by each conflict with lots of quicksaving. Soon after, I found myself facing a giant rotating fan I had to pass through in order to proceed, and since the player has to take damage to get through, I was forced to backtrack to find a health pack. This was the first in a series of lessons that taught me that careless combat, even on the normal difficulty, gets quickly punished. This is still an FPS of the run-and-gun variety, similar to Quake II, but a player still needs to be careful when moving through - ambushes abound, and especially considering the verticality of the maps, you'll have dudes shooting missles into your face from out of sight high above. The AI isn't too sharp, but the enemies are quick, very aggressive, and all deal high damage, which means you can lose half or more of your health within seconds if one of them gets the jump on you. Frequent quicksaving alleviates some of the difficulty, though the curve isn't balanced – the second level in particular is by far the hardest in at least the first two-thirds of the game (not only in combat, but also navigation and puzzle solving), while the last few levels see another spike in toughness. Still, that's the 90's for you.\n\nOther aspects of the game are less successful – the lightsaber is next to useless for blocking shots, which is disappointing, but does force you to play the game like a shooter instead of just standing there deflecting blaster bolts like the sequel allowed you to do. The force powers are underpowered, clumsy to use, and not really necessary, save for the jump. The storyline feels less epic than the other games in the series, and as a whole, falls pretty flat. The voice acting is weak and the cutscenes are rendered in game, and are clearly not the focus of the developer's time, inserted minimally to advance the plot and the player to the next (awesome) location.\n\nI reviewed Mysteries of the Sith since it's the one I played recently, but honestly, the things I have said could almost certainly be applied word-for-word to Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, and thus I would still recommend both today. I am not particularly a fan of 90's shooters, but this is a game that really did get it right.\n\nAnyone born after 1995 will still probably think it's a piece of crap though.\n\n\n7/10\n\n\nCompatibility issues:\n\nThis is not a Windows 7 or 8-friendly game. The .exe should be run in Compatibility mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3 to even get it to start. Running it through Steam's Play button for whatever reason puts the entire game in a windowed mode, but clicking the .exe file itself to start gets rid of the problem. 3D acceleration to make the game look and run smoothly can only be used by downloading a .dll file available online (check the Steam forums for its location), but even then, this is only apparently fully compatible with Windows 7. Windows 8 users such as myself do not get the luxury of having a HUD when using 3D acceleration, and selecting force powers also makes the screen go black and thus the game unplayable. So the only option available for Windows 8 is disabling hardware acceleration as well as the Backbuffer in System Memory – this latter option improves frame rate for a short time until it crashes the game. In any case on any system, higher resolutions will immediately crash the game. I had to run at 1024x768 in software rendering mode to get 25-30fps, while remaining clear enough that distant objects don't overpixelate. It's not ideal, but I found it very playable and still a good amount of fun. At any rate, whatever your setup may be, this game's graphics will not impress you, so who cares.","January 19, 2014","true","16.0"," 48 of 56 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","48","56","0","1"

Mysteries of the Sith is park of the Dark Forces series, which usually starred Kyle Katarn but in this you play as Mara Jade later on which is a nice change.\n\nOne of the main reasons I enjoy this a bit more than the previous standalone Kyle Katarn installments is because it feels different, not a copy paste entry. Mara is on a mission to find Kyle and it seems that he has fallen to a less than light path. The latter levels add an eerie element, as you traverse through Sith laced catacombs, which is a welcome change and it's always intresting when the lore of the Sith is included in a game. I've not personally played a game that's really focused on that and gave off a slightly spooky feeling, since the first time you land on Korriban in the amazing Knights of the Old Republic I.\n\nThe weapon roster is fun, Mara's Jedi powers are enjoyable to play and we see parts of the SW universe not seen before.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/32390/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","Mysteries of the Sith is an expansion pack to the second entry in the Dark Forces Saga, Jedi Knight. In some ways it improves upon its predecessor, and in some ways its a few steps back.\n\nThe game gives you a good, if false, first impression in the opening level. While Kyle Katarn is training his new apprentice (smuggler-turned-Jedi and future wife of Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade), the Republic base they're at is attacked by the Imperial Remnant, using space stations disguised as asteroids to ambush their enemy. You spend this section playing as Kyle, and its a breath of fresh air from Dark Forces II with a sprawling, semilinear level and two or three new varieties of Stormtrooper to fight.\n\nHowever, this level was either designed to catch your attention so you'd be strung along with the rest of the game, or was indicative of the original vision that ultimately didn't pan out, as once you move on from the Republic base things quickly deteriorate into largely linear run-and-guns punctuated with both the unintuitively specific progression of Jedi Knight and at times the baffling moon logic of the original Dark Forces. The impressive scope of Jedi Knight is also lost, leaning more towards the relatively cramped and linear confines of the later Jedi Outcast. One notable exception to this is the final level in the Sith Catacombs, which involve a series of puzzles spread along the perimeter of a massive central chamber that gives your efforts a sense of continuity and scope.\n\nFinally, the story is the absolute thinnest of the series, which given the flat characters and often thin establishment of Jedi Knight, says a lot. While I never was at a loss as to what I was doing at any given location and why, there is no overarching story to the game whatsover. After the initial attack by the Imperial Remnant, Kyle leaves Mara Jade behind to look into an unrelated matter, and the Imperials never come up again, apart from a minor occupying force on a later planet that never factors into the plot at all other than as someone else to shoot. Mara is left to run errands for the Republic in the meantime, first by gaining the assistance of a crimelord for supplies, then by guarding and then recovering a Jedi Holocron when it inevitably gets stolen by pirates. Absolutely none of these things relate in any way to each other or the final act, other than Mara's hand in all of them.\n\nMara Jade is a more interesting person than pre-Jedi Outcast Kyle Katarn (being little more than a gun-for-hire in Dark Forces and a bland grizzled action hero in Jedi Knight), but she is without question the most horrible person I've ever played in a Star Wars game who wasn't a Dark Sider trying to make their puppy-kicking quota. When sent to negotiate with the crimelord I mentioned earlier, the doorman speaks highly of her former smuggling career but says his boss is uninterested in seeing her due to distrust of the straight-laced Jedi she seems to have become. Her response? Kick down the back door, murder about 80% of the crimelord's employees, and then force him into negotiations at gunpoint. He relents in return for a favor, but the fact that we're supposed to be rooting for Mara here kind of disturbs me.\n\nOnce that's dealt with (an affair that mostly involves a chase through a city, being captured, killing a rancor, and then fighting your way out of your target's base), the crimelord agrees to a business relationship with the Republic, but not before Mara Jade decides to blackmail him one more time, just for kicks. This plotline never comes up again, as we next see Mara overseeing the transport of a Jedi Holocron, when her ship is attacked by pirates and she's forced to smuggle herself onto their ship, fight her way through their docking facility, then to the base of the collector it's been sold to in order to retrieve it. This plotline has nothing to do with anything else either.\n\nFinally, Mara decides to go looking for Kyle as she hasn't heard from him since he took off on his private investigation. At this point the game largely plummets into Xen Syndrome, as you wander through a swamp with nonsensical puzzles (you can't pass unless you use Force Persuasion on the statue? What?), overpowered enemies that will kill you in two hits (and in the case of the trash-squid things, can't be killed at all for some reason despite Kyle gunning down a dozen or so of them in Dark Forces), and the complete inability to use any weapon except your lightsaber for the rest of the game. Oh, and there's Sith Zombies for some reason, because I guess that's a thing now.\n\nIt turns out that the strong Dark Side aura of the ruins on this planet sent Kyle, who has been established as a borderline-neutral individual throughout the games, off the deep end into crazy Sith hermit. Exactly what happened to twist him that way is probably a more interesting story than the actual game, where after a few ignored attempts to get you to either ♥♥♥♥ off or join him, he decides to finally try and kill you dead, at which point your only option is to turn off your lightsaber to convince him that he's not far gone enough to start offing his friends. At which point you leave, the credits roll, and two massive plot points that occured between this and Jedi Outcast (Kyle switching from a yellow to a blue lightsaber and eventually giving up his Force powers) are left entirely unadressed.\n\nIn summation, this game is roughly on par with Jedi Knight in quality, with every improvement balanced by a downgrade.  And much like Jedi Knight, I ultimately can't recommend the experience. Basically nothing happens over the course of these two games couldn't be guessed at based on offhand comments in Jedi Outcast, and quite a few things that ARE mentioned in Jedi Outcast are never actually addressed in these games. Not needed for the story, and the gameplay isn't up to snuff with Dark Forces or Jedi Outcast, so just play those and skip these lesser installments.","February 22, 2015","false","14.4"," 62 of 98 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","62","98","8","6"

I've never played the first Jedi Knight (though now I want to) but this is simply a steal for $3. Dated graphics aside, this game is one of the best single-player experiences I've had in a while. The level design is excellent: the levels are large, and secret areas reward you for exploring around (though you'll probably find some of them by accident anyways); and the levels are also challenging and sometimes require you to think outside the box. There's only one particular boss that I think is overly difficult (you'll know when you get there), but besides that I think this game is well designed. And it oftentimes does a good job of creating some awesome atmosphere, along with allowing you to explore some nice views--even in the dated graphics, I still enjoyed perching high up and looking at a cool view.\nOVERALL: somewhere around 8.5/10\nNOTE: I suggest "Enabling 3D Acceleration" in the display settings. Also match the resolution to your resolution. For me, that made the graphics optimal and worked perfectly great. Also definitely go to the control or gameplay (can't remember which) settings and make sure that the Y axis is NOT inverted.","July 6, 2015","true","31.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","15","17","6","0"

Additionally, cut-scenes are rendered in-engine and draw attention to how out-dated the graphics are.\n\nPROS\nHas interesting gameplay elements and story progression points which pay homage to Return of the Jedi,\nMore great gameplay identical to the main title,\nA meaty single player experience which lasts as long as the main title,\nNew enemies, some of which are truly superb (cough...RANCOR...cough),\nNew weapons,\nNew Force powers,\nCONS\nPoorly executed cut-scenes make it hard to become engaged in the story,\nThe level design is not as aesthetically pleasing as the main title,\nThere aren't as many encounters with Imperials as I would have preffered,\nSteam overlay didn't work,\nIssues with resolution and full-screen settings are still present in the expansion (as they were in the main title - see my Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II review for more details) and the game can be unstable at times,\n\nCONCLUSIONS...\nThe same great single player experience is still there with additional characters, weapons and Force powers, however, this expansion didn't feel as polished as the main title, with somewhat uninspired level aesthetics and poorly executed cut-scenes.\n\nWith that being said, if you enjoyed Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, you shouldn't miss this expansion...and what a sizeable expansion it is - the single player experience included is just as long as the main title! Beware of difficulties getting this running at 1080p however (more so than the main title), and at times it can be a little unstable.\n\n\n_______________________\nRANKING DESCRIPTIONS\n\nScore        Description                1        This pile of c%$p made me want to take a break from gaming!                2        Avoid this title like a fat man on a diet avoids cake.                3        Why did they even bother? Oh wait...they didn't, so niether should you.                4        I wouldn't play this unless I was really, really desperate, or the biggest fan alive.                5        While there are some interesting aspects of this title, there are just too many faults to recommend it to anyone.                6        An "average" title which has some redeeming qualities, however, be warned that it also has its fair share of flaws...                7        A good game and it probably shouldn't be missed by fans of the series or genre, but be warned there are better games out there which are more deserving of your time and money.                8        An excellent title which shouldn't be missed if you can help it. I found it hard to put this game down, and I hope you do too.                9        A master piece! As close to perfect as any title can get.

Cool level designs that encourage exploration, good weapons, fun story, etc. If you've played any of the other Jedi Knight games you know what you're getting into. From what I've seen this definitely the weakest link in the Jedi Knight series but not by much.\n\nThis particular release, however, I can not recommend.\nTo be honest the release is trash. Music is missing, thing won't even run properly or at all without having to find a bunch of fixes. Literally asks for a CD if you don't have a CD drive so you'll at least need a virtual drive. The epitome of lazyness. I've heard people defend it because it's "old", but if it's old, the proper thing to do is not re-release it at all or provide fixes (which obviously exist if you search the forums here) to make it playable on modern hardware that purchasers are going to play on. In short, that fine print in the system requirements is there for a reason and you would do wise to take it seriously.\n\nIf you're willing to jump through hoops in order to play this game, get it, but get it on sale.

Wait, what??? XD\n\nFive Years have passed after Kyle defeated Jerec and his Six Disciples and now He's training a new Apprentice, Mara Jade, in a New Republic outpost. Imperial Forces will attack the place and Kyle will save the situation on his own. Later he will entrust the Republic assignments to Mara, while he will leave to investigate an abandoned Sith Temple.\nIn this Stand-Alone expansion You will control Kyle first during the Imperial assault, then You will Switch to Mara Jade. And this was a great surprise as Mara Jade is a very known and important character (the Future Wife of Luke Skywalker in what now is no more canonical expanded universe... Thank you Disney...).\nIf you already know Dark Forces II there's not much to say as it presents the same gameplay and issues. You can control a Jedi Knight with Force powers... Actually two of them. Anyways, The engine is the same, so the same bad-aged look made of low polygons characters and low textures maps, animations are the same coarse movements as seen in the previous game and the force powers control system is the same. Unfortunately there are no cinematics with real actors so everything is made with a pre-rendered version of the game engine. Unfortunately they've changed Kyle's voice as well. Anyways the most important aspect of this game are its maps. they're 14 against the 21 maps in Dark Forces II, but they're bigger, longer, more complicated with more puzzles, some of them very lethal, and a very difficult maze-like pattern, so it's quite easy to get lost without finding a way out, especially in the latest maps. And this is the aspect that makes this chapter quite frustrating, not to mention the puzzles with non-linear solutions (just like the final fight as well). Even though the story is quite important it's a bit superficial and a bit predictable, but still I consider this chapter important for the consequences in the saga.\nObviusly the original amazing soundtrack from John Williams will still accompany our adventures. Unfortunately, as in Dark Forces II, they're no longer dynamic tracks as in Dark Forces and the music doesn't loop immediately so there wil be moments of silence which kind of ruin the atmosphere.\nSince this chapter uses the same engine as in Dark Forces II you might run into the same issues, considering the age and the very low compatibility. Luckily the solutions are almost the same as in DFII, and you can find anything from the Steam Discussion Forum.\n\n+++PROs+++ JEDI! We get to move and control not just a Jedi, but two of them with a lightsaber and force powers... And one of them is Mara Jade!\nSOUNDTRACK. Of course there's always the amazing music from the Original Star Wars soundtrack.---CONs--- SOUNDTRACK. ...But unlike its predecessor and successor it isn't a dynamic soundtrack that alternates calm tracks in exploring situations and more active music during fights. Besides the music won't loop immediately leaving moments of silence.\nSTORY. Even though this chapter holds an important passage it's a bit predictable, and despite the title it doesn't explain much.\nLOW-COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. This game is very old and of course issues and glitch were expected. My first attempt resulted in a black screen ingame with all sounds and events running, or completely inverted/pixel-blasted textures. Luckily, after GTA IV I've gained enough patience to read deeply the Steam Community to find different solutions and patches, and I've made it work eventually... Too bad that seems like the GOG release is already patched and fully working... -.-\nLEVELS STRUCTURE. This Expansion is way more tough than the predecessor, it's easy to get lost, some puzzles are quite difficult to solve and the latest maps are really REALLY tough. It requires very good observation and attention to details.","May 27","true","6.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RubberDicky/recommended/32390/","RubberDicky","Rubber Ducky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RubberDicky/","624 products in account","I played these games heavily as a child and have fond memories of many of the events of JK and the Mysteries of the Sith. Upon revisting JK, I was filled with joy to find that it hadn't aged quite as poorly as I'd expected. The run and gun mechanics still work, the levels are well-designed and expansive, and even the puzzles can at least be reasoned out. I feel the bland story and characters are buoyed by the fun, campy FMV cutscenes, giving the game a B-movie feel. The lightsaber battles are a little janky and un-fun at this point, but few games are perfect.\n\nIn playing Mysteries of the Sith, I found all of the levels I rememberly fondly; however, the feeling with this expansion is completely different. Practically everything in this game feels an order of magnitude more frustrating. The story falls flat, meandering around a bunch of unrelated events until it fizzles out at the end. The characters are worse, Mara being painted as reckless, illogical, and sometimes downright distasteful. Kyle, for whatever your opinion of him was before this game, was at worst a bland, uninspired character. Suddenly, this game turns him into a paper-thin, boring villain for no reason other than need of a climax.\n\nThe puzzles have suddenly become several times more obtuse. If you thought Dark Forces was hard to figure out, buckle up. The level design feels like an afterthought. These feel like throw-away levels from JK, possibly explaining why the story feels like an afterthought. The worst part of their design is the constant hiding of the way forward behind grating in the dark corner of a hallway halfway to a dead end. All of this is pretty bad, but the last two levels take the cake. The game spends thirteen levels with scarcely a single use for the lightsaber other than a glorified wire cutter before immediately removing use of all weapons other than it. Two needlessly long levels filled with non-stop ambushes by enemies that can kill you in two hits on easy? Surely, this was top-shelf game design in its day. I merely squeaked through these levels by slowly spamming saber-throw for a lack of a better way to defeat most of the cheaper enemies.\n\nI can understand that JK hasn't aged greatly, and my nostalgia for it certainly elevates my opinion of it. However, it stands as a solid, if forgettable, FPS game set in the Star Wars universe. Mysteries of the Sith is more akin to a steaming mess that reeks of horrific, likely rushed design choices resulting from a desire to cash in on the success of JK.\n","January 12","false","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quake 1 engine cutscenes are ugly).

Mysteries is not for everyone. It's unforgiving like Dark Forces 2 but there's a strange difficulty spike in Mission 12, 13, and 14 where you are forced to use only your lightsabre and your firearms mysteriously missfire. It basically turns into the grandfather of Bloodbourn and Dark Souls. The enemies, depending on the type, can kill you in either 1 or 2 hits and since they all use melee attacks, they bypass the energy shield.\nSabre Throw and Destruction force powers help but unfortuanetly I DID NOT GET THEM! So yeah. You're going to die A LOT.\n\nThat bit of whining aside the levels are great in terms of design and the secret areas are mostly pretty damn well hidden. Some of the progression rooms are well hidden as well. They story however isn't something to hang in the Christmas tree unfortuanetly. It's odd and messy I feel and there's not real overarching story that I could dicern.\nEnemy variation is nice and challenging to engage. Force powers are fun to use, especially Force Persuation which makes you invisible. It does not work on the final 3 levels though.\n\nLastly I have to talk about the version: I have had difficulties running the Steam version of Mysteries of the Sith with several crash issues related to saving and sometimes loading the game. The game saves, buuut it'll crash right afterwards unless you use quick save. And loading to many times crash the game as well.\nThere is hope however. Over at GoG com they have a working version with which I have only experienced one crash.\n\nOh, and there's a default mouse setting which inverts the mouse Y axis so moving the mouse forward looks down and moving it backward looks up. Why? I have no idea but you can change it in the Setup, Controls, Mouse, Mouse Y Axis and then uncheck the Reverse Direction box.\n\nAll in all I recommend it for the puzzle challenges, combat play, thought not the lightsabre. It kind of sucks, and the level design.","March 6","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is all over the place and the levels don't feel as memorable or well designed. The cutscenes are in engine and are pretty rough compared to Jedi Knights FMVs.  The game basically devolves into taking the main character from the first game, pretty much invalidating his character arch and making him evil for no real reason except to have an antagonist. That really left a sour taste in my mouth. I really disliked that the last 3 levels take away your weapons so you HAVE to use your lightsaber, and then throw an onslaught of difficult enemies at you that can kill you with 1-2 hits. I didn't want Jedi Knight to end, but this I couldn't wait for it to be over. Also, you will have to spend a good bit of time finding and installing patches to make this game run.","December 17, 2015","false","12.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

It's map design, story progression and combat variety are all absolutely horrible when held up the other games in the series. The last 2 maps of the game in particular will forever hold a place in history as some of the most tedious ever made for an FPS. Adding in the fact that the great live action cutscenes that defined the rest of the series have been cut, and Kyle Katarn has had a change in voice actors and there simply isn't much left to enjoy.\n\nThis is the only game in the series that's truly worth missing.

As a shooter it's tolerable, but once you switch to lightsaber combat it becomes terrible. The lightsaber mechanics are clunky and nothing like the fun combat from Jedi Outcast or Academy. Even worse, using the lightsaber becomes mandatory in later levels, where enemies that can kill you with one or two hits are thrown at you, making the game incredibly frustrating. I would recommend simply skipping this one (Dark Forces II isn't that great either) and playing Jedi Outcast instead.","December 25, 2015","false","14.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/contaan/recommended/32390/","contaan","Booty Bamboozler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/contaan/","93 products in account","An expansion to Star Wars Dark Forces 2 Jedi Knight, this time, we follow Mara Jade, another Force “User” who has a two way learning relationship with Kyle Katarn. While you will be demolishing the poor cronies of the Empire with Kyle for the first two missions, you will be getting to know Mara for the remainder of the story. The live action cutscenes are no more however, (which I must say is a HUGE disappointment) and are replaced with in-game cutscenes which in my opinion are a step down in quality. There are some graphical improvements to the game as once again, you are led across the galaxy to new set locations, new enemies and people to meet and new weapons and force powers. Priced less than $2 during the sales (Pro Tip: Look for coins in the couch or change in soda dispensers), you can not go wrong in finding out the conclusion to the Dark Forces series. This is not the end for Kyle Katarn, the Chuck Norris of the Star Wars universe however…\n\n\n*The game requires DosBox however, with the Steam download, everything will be set up for you to enjoy as soon as the game is downloaded.\n\nStory/Characters:\nMara Jade, a mercenary who works for Talon Karrde (In this game, works with Kyle and the New Republic) is the main character. There are many different locations you will be going to, many of which is in the Expanded Universe books and such. Also, many of the cutscenes or scenarios in the game harkens back to the Original Series (think Dagobah) which was a nice touch in my opinion. The last several missions are one of the spookiest and well, excellently crafted atmospherically set pieces I feel in the whole series.\n\nGameplay:\nMostly the same from my previous Dark Forces 2 review as this is an expansion for said game. There are not as many mini bosses in this one, and in my experience, the difficulty really ramps up exponentially at the end which gave me several frustrated moments because of the lightsaber still being random and inelegant (Obi-Wan you lied to me!) but still, solid stuff.\n\nGraphics:\nOnce again, same sentiments from my Dark Forces 2 review. The 3D technology is still not “there” yet but you get the gist of what you’re whacking away at with your lightsaber.\n\nSound/Music:\nSound and music is still excellent. The voice acting in the cutscenes was a bit more on the “meh” side but that did not impact the overall game too much for me.\n\nControls:\nThe game allows you to use a joystick or the standard keyboard and mouse. You may also customize hotkeys from everything from moving to weapons to force powers.\n\nReplay value:\nLittle to none as there is no Light or Dark Side paths you may take.\n\nOnline:\nThis expansion adds new maps and play modes but I feel you’ll be up a crap creek without a paddle (Note: That is not good) if you want to play.\n\n---\n\n***If there are any mistakes to the facts pertaining to the game, please let me know. Also, if you have further questions not covered by the review, or if something were unclear, I will try to clarify as best as possible.

As well as some fine examples of the elegance found in the simple lines and textures of…  Okay I can’t keep that up anymore.\n\nWith Mysteries of the Sith being an expansion to Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, the first thing to do is go and read my review of Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II.  Go ahead, I’ll wait.  Done?  Good, now I only have to mention the changes, and how they effect the base score.\n\nThe couple of things that are changed, or I guess added is a more accurate term, are colored lighting and the AI.  The lighting I noticed right off, and it does make the game look nicer.  Some things just looked better lit, and there were less moments where I felt like it was too dark.\n\nThe AI took me a while to pick up on, but if you do the right things, and by that I mean if you play it a certain way, you’ll catch the changes.  And they are for the better.  They make the enemies and friendly NPC’s seem smarter.\n\nHowever, the ball was dropped, picked up, and dropped again with the level design.  And I know this is something that I always go after in these old games.  But all to often there is little to no thought put into the levels, outside the starting idea of ‘This would be cool’.\n\nI’m seriously getting tired of massive chasms all over the place in these games.  I know there is a rule somewhere that states every Star Wars location must have at least two massive chasms.  Planets, asteroids  ships.  It doesn’t matter where you are, there is a giant hole you can fall into!\n\nSomething I don’t think I mentioned in my Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II review was the map.  Both of these games have one of the greatest maps I have seen in gaming.  It’s very low-key, overlaying on the HUD as simple geometric green lines indicating where walls are.  It automatically expands as you seen new terrain.  You can also open up a more detailed(but still just green lines) three dimensional version in the games menu.  However I felt this one was to awkward to control and move around.\n\nI often found myself playing with the map up, because as with last time, the level design mixed with the low end textures make to some paths to be nearly hidden from some angles.  But I already mentioned how they failed with the level design.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, Mysteries of the Sith is a decent game.  Play it if you are playing the entire series.  Play it if you really liked Jedi Knight: Dark Forces.  Play it if you are tied to your computer chair and the only way of escape is to play it.  But if you never play it, you’ll be okay.","May 16, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The vast array of usable force powers is nothing to ignore and while the graphics aren'y impressive by today's standards, they were great then. Gameplay is fantastic, while consistently challenging. The game was really a strong foundation for the Force Unleashed type games we see today. This game was a definite notch above Dark Forces, which was also an excellent game, and considered by many as one of the great star wars classics (along with the TIE fighter series of course!) I highly recommend this game, if only because the gameplay is fun. Oh and the quicksave function- this game was the first game  ever played that had quicksave and it is amazing. Just remember not to overwrite in a place where you could potentially be stuck. I have lost hours of gameplay that way..... ~Dave","February 9, 2013","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As well as some fine examples of the elegance found in the simple lines and textures of…  Okay I can’t keep that up anymore.\n\nWith Mysteries of the Sith being an expansion to Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, the first thing to do is go and read my review of Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II.  Go ahead, I’ll wait.  Done?  Good, now I only have to mention the changes, and how they effect the base score.\n\nThe couple of things that are changed, or I guess added is a more accurate term, are colored lighting and the AI.  The lighting I noticed right off, and it does make the game look nicer.  Some things just looked better lit, and there were less moments where I felt like it was too dark.\n\nThe AI took me a while to pick up on, but if you do the right things, and by that I mean if you play it a certain way, you’ll catch the changes.  And they are for the better.  They make the enemies and friendly NPC’s seem smarter.\n\nHowever, the ball was dropped, picked up, and dropped again with the level design.  And I know this is something that I always go after in these old games.  But all to often there is little to no thought put into the levels, outside the starting idea of ‘This would be cool’.\n\nI’m seriously getting tired of massive chasms all over the place in these games.  I know there is a rule somewhere that states every Star Wars location must have at least two massive chasms.  Planets, asteroids  ships.  It doesn’t matter where you are, there is a giant hole you can fall into!\n\nSomething I don’t think I mentioned in my Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II review was the map.  Both of these games have one of the greatest maps I have seen in gaming.  It’s very low-key, overlaying on the HUD as simple geometric green lines indicating where walls are.  It automatically expands as you seen new terrain.  You can also open up a more detailed(but still just green lines) three dimensional version in the games menu.  However I felt this one was to awkward to control and move around.\n\nI often found myself playing with the map up, because as with last time, the level design mixed with the low end textures make to some paths to be nearly hidden from some angles.  But I already mentioned how they failed with the level design.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, Mysteries of the Sith is a decent game.  Play it if you are playing the entire series.  Play it if you really liked Jedi Knight: Dark Forces.  Play it if you are tied to your computer chair and the only way of escape is to play it.  But if you never play it, you’ll be okay.","May 16, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoyed Jedi Knight, and are still craving more after playing both runthroughs, give this a shot.

But this incarnation of Jedi Knight has so far caused me great headaches with the game not working, either by "insert disc 1/2", the general compatibility issues of older games, or just not starting at all, no error codes or anything. Once you get the game started it seems simple enough, however there is a bug in mine, and many others' versions of this game where the save system crashes the game, which is disappointing. From what I have been bothered to stomach of the game so far the plot seems typical of a Jedi Knight game so in that I am happy. It would be more playable if there was a better method of playing the game on a system from 7 onward.

This add on really is an improvement regarding gameplay. For example the AI is much better. Disarm an enemy with force pull, and they will run straight at you, to punch you in the face. Also, the fact the lightsaber and force powers are immediately at your disposal makes it more fun.\nThe story is not that great, and there are no FMV sequences anymore. the scenes between missions don't look that good anymore, but it won't spoil the fun.\n\nRegarding this steam version, it will not work without some troubleshooting first. Look in the steam support forum for this game to get it working properly.\n\nIn short, I would give the game a "yes" vote, but the steam version is definitely a "no" vote.

A few additional weapons and secondary fire abilities seem cool, but many go unused. New force powers now have more applications but are still clumsy to use. There are more enemy types but still very little variety. The story seems interesting, especially early on, but the conclusion is unfulfilling...apparently the mysteries of the sith are meant to stay a mystery. Overall I'd say the level design and pace was good but at a few points throughout the game I found myself snagged for a few minutes wondering where to go next.
