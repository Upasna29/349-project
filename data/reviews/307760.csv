You'll manage your zoo, making animal pens, placing food and beverage stands, along with researching new animals and researching other things like their welfare, mating and rehabilitation. The game has an easy and quick tutorial all within the game along with challenges that will give you things to do in order to drive the game forward. You won't have control over things like ticket prices, food prices or anything like that. Your goal is just to keep adding to the zoo. The menus are very easy to use and the game's controls are almost exclusively mouse driven.\n\nThis is an easy game, its grid based in an isometric fashion. You can't rotate your perspective. You'll select to build a type of fence, click and drag a square pen to put the animals in. Then you'll buy plants, place water pools and food before you add the animals.\n\nTo unlock animals, you need to build a region research center (there are a few regions), and research the animal. After a specific amount of time on a progress bar, they unlock. Then you have the option to keep researching the specific species welfare, breeding and rehabilitation. Each takes time and each can be done three times per species. The breeding means they'll breed faster when in perfect conditions. Animals will have a progress bar. The rehabilitate lets you send them back into the wild. I don't really see a purpose for it. The welfare means the animal will get sick less and wow do these animals get sick. The game has a ticker at the bottom that feeds you all activity in the park, who has a baby, what you just bought, and when an animal gets sick. It then tells you to keep your habitat clean. Even if the habitat has the perfect amount of foliage, water, is 100% clean and your animals are well fed, they still get sick. Then you need to click on the animal and click on the cure icon. Poof they're cured for a price. The whole research center system feels hollow since you don't have to have a path attached or even staff it, but you don't have to staff any buildings.\n\nYou have zoo keepers that will feed animals and clean pens. The amount of zoo keepers is capped by how many employee buildings you have built. When you click on an empty space in an animal pen, you can assign what percentage the food levels need to fall before they feed your animals and the same for cleaning the pens. Personally, I keep my levels high to prevent animal illness. The animals being rehabilitated need their own personal zoo keeper. There are only keepers and not vets, gardeners, and janitors. Gardeners would have been nice, since the plants in your game die after 20 or so days, forcing you to remove the dead plant, then add a new one to replace it. That just seems like an extra step, an extra chore in the game. That's not the only chore, your animals will age and die quite rapidly, forcing you to replace them. You can see an animal go from a newborn to an animal that dies of old age in the span of two weeks.\n\nThe game consists of days, there's a start of the day before the gate opens, then the actual time when the zoo is opened and an after hours period. While this is an interesting twist to things, nothing really happens when your zoo is closed. It is more of a prep time to add things and assign a marketing campaign, which is sadly a daily task you need to click open the advertising section and select the campaign. It should just be set without forcing you to do it every day and if you forget to do it, that's just lost income for your zoo.\n\nI say income, well the game's currency is 'popularity points' and not cash or money. You accumulate popularity points each day, but you won't actually get them to spend until the day ends. I guess that it makes sense, no one would have money until the registers are cleaned out. That causes a problem that you can run out of funds quickly and your animals will starve all day when there's no money to buy their food. That won't kill them, but that will make them sick eventually. If enough animals die, that's a game over. There are four difficulties, but it was very difficult to fail on normal difficulty (there is an easy difficulty).\n\nNot only do the animals have needs, but the people do too. For food, drink and toilet. So you need to place all of those things. Not just that, but they want to see beautiful decorations. You'll need to buy them and tactically place them. Each decoration has a radius and a beauty percentage. Exhibits will also need walkways around them, so they can be better seen. It adds some strategy to the game, but there's no sort of bonus for having all African animals in a section of the zoo instead of African in one pen, American in another and Asian right next to it. At the end of each day, you'll get a recap of what's needed, whether its more food or more decorations. You'll also see a summary of your animal health and their needs.\n\nThere is only one zoo. There are no scenarios to play, no different zoos. Just an empty plot of land that you start with and quickly build your own zoo. You can easily expand your sanctuary, just by buying more land. Its as easy as that.\n\nThe controls feel very click heavy. There are no hot keys, not even a menu, you'll need to push a menu button to get it. At least the menus get broken up into regions that act like filters. You'll click animal, African animal, then click the animal. You won't scroll up or down like normal games, you'll need to click a 'next' sort of button. To pan the screen, you'll need to right click and drag the screen. Its not awful, but it does make the game feel awkward, like a mobile game.\n\nWhat I really enjoy about the game is its challenges and rewards. Not only is there a list of ongoing challenges that will unlock things or give you random animals or a random baby, but there are day long challenges. These day long challenges amount to, we have an animal for you and if you want the animal, you need to get your zoo ready by doing 4 things, preparing for the animal, building the pen, putting out food, adding plants and so on. If you complete the goal, you get the animal and that animal species becomes unlocked without being researched. This is a nice touch that gives a free play sort of game a goal to achieve.  That's the problem without scenarios. There's no end game. You'll just keep going. That might be awesome to some, but I really get bored of looking at my one zoo for 5+ hours with nothing changing.\n\nIn all, it just feels like a really dull game. Being broke for an entire day and waiting to get a heap of a money at the end of the day didn't help. The ticker at the bottom is a big help to let you know what's going on. There are super easy menus and easy to set up a functioning zoo in no time, but there are elements that feel like chores. Replacing animals, clicking to cure animals, removing and replacing trees. Small zoos are fine, but large zoos, it becomes an issue.","October 25, 2014","false","6.7"," 89 of 114 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","89","114","2","0"

Instead of money, you earn popularity points to spend on upgrading the park. All of the animals besides the beginning one must be earned through research.  Barebones, it is a zoo park--no multiple scenarios and limited amount of challenges to achieve.\n\nIf you are looking for wonderful graphics, look else where. But it does have its own bit of charm, if you ignore the slightly annoying two-thirds angle. It feels more like it was designed to be a mobile game that was changed half-way through the production process.\n\nThe big problems I have with it is my animals get sick soo easily, even if their habitats are clean. And the breeding program is annoying at best, with the first animals you buy will most likely never actually have any children before they become too old to do so.\n\nIt has enough interest to keep me going for awhile, creating multiple parks. And for its price, it works. However, it wouldn't have been worth it if it was more expensive.","June 14, 2014","true","3.2"," 58 of 75 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","58","75","0","0"

Textures mesh well, there's no texture lines or breaks anywhere that I have noticed. When you click on an animal they have their own drawing/painting of the animal which I thought was a really cool addition and little detail they added to the game.\n-Animation: Very simple animations, the keepers clean up animal poop, refill food. People just walk around the park. Animals swim in water and eat. Over all simple but not terrible. There have been no glitches I have ran into.\n\n*Sound: 8/10\nThe day background sound is nice and simple. When you place a building there's a small sound, for example, when you place a gift shop there's a child laughing etc. When you click on an animal it makes the noise the animal would make. They're simple little sounds but don't get annoying so that's always a plus. I hate playing games that have a constant annoying animation sound so I was happy this game didn't. Side note, there's different background music for night time and it's really creepy especially when you place a gift shop at night and hear children laughing from the animation sound D:!\n\n*Hours to complete: 10/10\nYou can play this game infinitely which is a bonus because that means you're getting more play time for your money. I only included this section because it's in all my other reviews so, why not.\n\n*Story Line: 9/10\nYou build your own zoo while using conservation methods along with rehabilitation methods to ensure the success of your zoo.\n\n*Gameplay: 7/10\nThe game play is simple, there's a short tutorial in the very beginning every time you create a new park. This is helpful if you don't play the game for a while then decide to come back; which is what I do to a lot of games so that was a bonus to me. It's really repetition just with different animals. You research an animal, build a fence to house your animal, set up the exhibit by adding food, plants or water. You research healthcare for the animal, rehabilitation and breeding for the species. These are kind of like upgrades to make the processes go faster. You add food vendors, gift shops, water, etc for your customers to the zoo. You expand your zoo walls to add more exhibits, then the process starts all over again. It's fun but I think you might get bored after playing this game for three hours straight tbh.\n\n*Price: 9/10\nAs of right now, 9/26/2015, the price is $4.99\nThe price is decent for this game. If you can grab it on sale you'll be happy.\n\n*Overall:\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes:\n-Simulation games\n-Build your own games\n-Casual/slower paced games\n-Animals\n\n**Side note: There is a better game if you wanted to check it out called Zoo Tycoon. Only problem is it isn't available on steam (yet?). It's a little more pricey but a lot more fun.\n***Side note #2: Zoo Tycoon did not influence any of my opinions of the game. All of my reviews are as the game stands here and now without any relation to any similar or better games.","September 26, 2015","true","2.6"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","25","30","5","0"

I used to play Zoo Tycoon a lot when I was little, this game has a feel very reminiscent to that game. Though the graphics are better than the original Zoo Tycoon game, it does have less animals to choose from. I wish there were more challenges, but the ones you have can be pretty challenging. I do love the selection of animals that are available, and the fact that the animals make real accurate sounds when you click on them. I also love the realistic artwork of the animals on their status pages and that there is a different picture for Male, Female, and baby animals of each species. I appreciate the ability to fast forward time in the game. I also appreciate that it is very easy to navigate and learn the mechanics of the game, and it is a very easy game to just play for a few minutes here or there. I wish there were a bit more variation in the decorations/features included in the game, but I do enjoy what there is already available. The game is very relaxing and stress relieving to play, and the music is cheerful and appropriate for the game. Overall, this game is well worth trying out, especially if you are a fan of casual sim games and animals.","December 16, 2014","true","11.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetruelu/recommended/307760/","thetruelu","WoraciousVatermelon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetruelu/","259 products in account","Zoo Park is a great simple minded, simply presented zoo management "simulator". Although it might not be as inclusive as Zoo Tycoon or Wildlife Park, it's down to earth and easy to use controls and ideas are so easily and readily grasped no matter your age. Sure it might not be an actual simulator, but I have found myself losing track of time when playing. Gameplay wise, it is very much similar to any other zoo simulator: start with nothing but money (or points in this case) and build your way up. There is no rating system or critics critiquing your zoo, but there are challenges to be done. This game is more of an arcade style of simulator. Focusing on fast point and click fun rather than the slow climb to prestige that is only achieved through thorough understanding of the game. You start with a couple animals and you must research others to unlock them for placement in your own zoo (referred to as a sanctuary in-game). Although not really "realistic", I have found myself always wanting to research one more animal and place him in the zoo before saving and quiting. Taking care of your animals is also quite simple. You can open up the animals menu and see the space, food, water, vegetation, and fence requirements of the animal. Simple satisfy all the needs to have the "perfect" habitat and your animals will start breeding. You can also research other things besides animal usage, such as research to lessen the amount of time your animal gets sick or quicken the breeding time. As for the visitors of the zoo, they also need several things satisfied to ensure you get the most points per day (12 hours of in-game time, using the fast forward option, it would probably be around 5-10 minutes of real time). They are how well they can see the animals, how many they see, attractions/features, drinks, food, and gifts. There aren't many concessions types so you end up with a zoo littered with the same hamburger or hotdog stands which is boring, but hopefully there will be updates with more.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the game. The pricing for me is probably a little over (maybe worth $10 max), so if you are on the fence, buy this on a discount like I did (only $3!). However, if you like the simplistic idea and just enjoy animals, zoo sims. and playing a casual, relaxing game, I would say this game does a pretty good job of satisfying some of those simplistic urges. Notice how I used simple/simplistic so many times. If you want a hardcore, ultra zoo simulator GOTY deluxe edition 2020, this is NOT for you.","August 11, 2014","true","3.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

This game is more an animal sancturay game than a zoo game. This means that you have to work harder to get to a good point in the game. not all the animals are available from the start, many you have to research. if you want to breed them faster, you have to research that, along with improved health, and if you wish to rehabilitate animals, and release them to the wild, you can again do this faster via research.\n\nThere are not as many animal as in zoo tycoon, but there are still enough to keep you happy, and your sanctuary full. The exhibits you make for the animals are simpler than in zoo tycoon, which may make this game more youngster friendly, in that you simply choose the habitiat, how big you want the exhibit, and then place some trees, all of which are listed under the same habitats as the animals they are designed for. for example, if you want a lion, place an african exhibit, the some african trees. job done!  you can also place pools of water and rocks for animals which require them.\n\nIt is much easier on this game to earn 'money' to buy new items, or spend on new animals or research, again making it a bit more friendly for younger players.\n\nthere are some cons, in that alot of the animals do not live long enough to breed unless you have fully researched their faster breeding to 3 stars, so when they die you will have to pay out to replace them, but with the ease of money making in this game its not a huge problem.\n\nAt the price its currently at, £4, i would highly recommend this game, its a fun, animal themed passtime, that is well worth the money!\n\nI hope i have conviced at least one person to try this game, overlooking all the 'this is not zoo tycoon' reviews.","November 25, 2015","true","10.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Build many attractive features such as; statues of the many habitats that your visitors may encounter; stores for your visitors to spend their money on and much, much more!\n\nMake your animals feel at home and give them their dreams.

A little bit more dumbed down, however; it has a simple charm. So far I'm only dissapointed by the customization. The options for customizing your zoo are limited (beyond simple diversity of creatures). I liked the aspect of zoo tycoon where you could make whole water gardens and really get creative. This game doesn't allow enough features (so far) for that to be a thing.\nStill, it's entertaining, and if you liked the origional zoo tycoon the controls will be quite similar. It would be very nice for children, provided they're at least at reading age.\nI'd wait for it to go on sale before buying.","August 1, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I am an avid Zoo Tycoon fan, having wasted days of my life playing it. I only payed 69p for Zoo Park after finding it on sale on another website- I feel I have wasted 69p and I don't know how people who paid £6.99 for it will feel! I've played it for 30 minutes and I am already bored. I will be deleting it from my desktop and will never play it again. It's boring, very limited in the design aspect, graphics aren't great, it's really difficult and awkward to navigate- I just don't like it at all. Would not recommend to Zoo Tycoon fans, would however recommend to young children as the game feels more aimed towards them.","April 26, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Has a huge amount of research stuff, doing the animals and "upgrading" the animals is pretty satisfying. I like the fact that although the amount of areas isn't super huge, what you think may be short work is soon realized to take a very long time (gamewise) to unlock everything, lending to some very long term work. It may be a tad more simplistic than some bigger animal or zoo simulators, but I think that works out well, as this one can be a lot more casual while still leaving you "lots of work" to look foward to = a pretty good amount of playtime. Some might would call it boring but as a sim-game player I think it fits in nicely on the scale. Highly reccomend this one for casual but long term play. Since it can be ran in windowed mode, it can run while you do other things without TOO much worry about everything dying or going belly up. It's a well nice little game and doesn't deserve the mixed rating IMO.","February 7","true","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Needs more attractions and decorations and also more animals. The space in which you can build your zoo is amazing but the lack of animals, items etc almost make it pointless. I really enjoyed playing it and would love for it to have been more interactive. I don't know whether it was just me but my animals were getting sick alot and the cages and as the food and the cleanliness of the cages were depleting it seemed the workers were not doing anything (yes i set the stats up to about 90% for both and had more than enough workers). So all in all a great little game that passes the time :)","March 6, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whole game is about building Zoo. Graphic isn't very well, but it isn't awful, That's not graphic what is important in that type of Games, it's gameplay.\nGameplay is good, we have to build some kind of fence and buy animals. Every animal requires some kind of fence. To buy animal you have to research it first, it's a long process, so that's why in game is option "Fast Rewind" (This is good, but also bad). You can research animals in research buildings, there are few buildings and each one of them is responsible for animals from different country (Africa, Asia etc.) You have also feed animals and keep their "home" clean, otherwise they start being sick, and your responsibility is to cure them which costs, if u not, it's game over.\nYou have to care about entertainment, that's why u need to build cafe or souvenirs shop.\n\nUps:\n- animals\n- researching\n- need to care about animals\n- some kinds of economy\n- rewards\n\nDowns:\n- In fast rewind, game is lagging\n- This guy who tells you what u doing wrong is annoying, and he shows up so many times u even don't have chance to repair it\n- popularity points (which u must collect manualy)\n- If u turn off advice or mission guidelines, it's hard or sometimes u CAN'T turn it on again.\n- ESC doesn't work for menu, u must click "ZOO" in game bar, which is annoying, but u can survive this.","November 19, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has begun glitching really badly and crashes frequently. I'm not sure if this is due to the size of my zoo (some of the enclosures allow space for 5 or more large animals) or if my save file somehow got corrupted. I'm a bit disappointed since my goal was to have a totally complete zoo. We'll see if approaching the game a little differently next time will help avoid this issue.\n\nEither way, its a very fun, but imperfect, game. I don't regret the purchase, but if you're not ok with paying for a game that is likely to become pretty darn glitchy/ almost unplayable I'd pass on this one.","May 21","false","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
