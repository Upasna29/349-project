"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/recommended/218820/","arbco","Alien Rope Burn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbco/","761 products in account","Let's start with the good stuff: Paul Robertson's sprite design is excellent. Much like Scott Pilgrim on the consoles, the character design is pretty sharp, and this is clearly a game he can cut loose on more that he did on Pilgrim. Of course, this also means his creative boxes of body horror and gore get checked more sharply, too.\n\nThe main issue is that this is marketed as a Metal Slug-style game, but has none of the speed or energy. Rather than rewarding a run 'n gun style, you often cautiously stop to take down tiresome enemies with shields (their strength is in trying to bore you to death) and their ilk. It honestly reminds me more of the slow pace of early Mega Man games, only without the rad boss fights. The large, sprawling stages force you to grind through tons of enemies, and you better enjoy it, because you're going to be forced to visit each stage over and over and over.\n\nCrafting makes upgrading slow and unsatisfying. Though the gun design system is attractive and interesting at first, it's easy to maximize DPS in most situations with a high-damage, small clip revolver in my experience. Most other upgrade systems are perfunctory, but rely on tiresome grinding to get the correct ingredients.\n\nBoss fights are wearisome due to their implementation, similar to that of console hit Monster Hunter, where you have a limited window of time to defeat a boss, and then for some reason it runs away to another part of the stage, forcing you to grind over to its new location, or tiresomely set up in a new location to just wait for it to reemerge. Add in the fact that the bosses are clearly designed for multiplayer, so a single player has to take longer to beat them... and the stage overall has a time limit, so it's possible to fail the stage if your luck in locating the boss is bad.\n\nIt ultimately combines the worst of the old (enemies spawning just off screen, long enemy patterns where you can't hurt foes) and new (repetitive fetch missions through the same area, tiresome crafting and collecting). That isn't to say it doesn't have some old-school charm to it, but you have to be willing to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze to get that little spurt of nostalgia you wanted from this game in the first place.","November 3, 2014","false","12.8"," 215 of 263 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","215","263","0","5"

The sprite based graphics are very easy on the eye and the animations look right.\n\nGameplay wise it may look like metal slug but it reminds me more of the slow and precise nature of the old mega man games. You can’t take a lot of damage so its all about positioning yourself to easily take out enemies.  The locomotion of your character depends on the weight of your equipment, particularly your gun.\n\nThe weapon system works like this, when you kill enemies they drop items, you use these items to craft gun parts and assemble these into guns. If you assemble enough parts with the same stats you can use special ammo, like shots that bounces all over the place or homing missiles. All parts fit together, i.e. you can combine a shotgun stock with a sniper receiver. Now all guns you build are not guaranteed to work well, most probably won’t, but finding one that does is very rewarding and easily my favorite part of the game.\n\nThe level design is in general pretty decent. You progress in the game by doing missions, but  a lot of missions use the same map. This would not be a problem since there are several kinds of missions and those on the same map are generally different, but crafting gun parts require farming. This can make the repeating levels quite tedious.\n(mitigate; proficiency: medicine, slot 1: hoarder, slot 2: lucky penny )\n\nThe bosses in the game inhabit specific places on the map and maps generally have multiple of those. Once you find a boss the mechanics of the boss battle itself is quite good. Easily the worst design decision in the entire game is that unless you are really fast some bosses disappear mid boss battle and appear at some other spot. If you are to slow finding this spot they might teleport again just as you get there. This can lead to some frustration.\n(mitigate; slot 1:computer, consumable: shock bombs)\n\nThe question is whether or not to recommend this game depends on if you like mega man style platforming, farming for materials, experimenting with crafting and can work around a few annoying design decisions. If unsure wait for a sale.\n","April 21, 2015","true","49.8"," 92 of 108 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","92","108","2","1"

That's my like dream game! How could you go wrong? Well, upon playing the first few missions, I realized it was *nothing* like Metal Slug. Unlike actual run n gun games, where combat is hectic and explosive, enemies are strategically placed and tend to be bullet sponges. Even the boss battles manage to be boring. This, in combination with the sluggish character movement, makes the game-play very slow paced at times.\n\nBut hey, "two dimensional Monster Hunter with guns" ain't that bad of a description, so does that aspect of the game redeem it? No. The main problem of the game is that you can only use one gun for the entire mission. This little factor completely changes my opinion of the game; missions can take from ten to thirty minutes to be completed, maps are repeated constantly with different objectives, and enemies are predictable in style. I wouldn't mind these faults, but with only one gun, your customization and freedom can never be unleashed to use different play styles for each long section and thus it gets boring very quickly. You can equip different kind of grenades and melee weapons, but they are far from sustainable to make a difference.\n\nIt's such a shame, because the game has got a lot going for it. The art style is beautiful, and the smooth animations and characterization add a charm to the game. The music is also very well made, although voice acting is cringeworthy. The crafting system is incredible, in every mission you can pick up materials such as iron or animal skins which can be used to craft weapon upgrades and items, and the gun customization is a great concept that allows you to use revolvers which fire grenades and other ridiculous variables, but it's overall executed poorly since only one damn gun can be used at a time. The main saving grace is the local co-op multiplayer, which is much more fun than playing it alone, but even that can get boring at times.\n\nOverall, it's a very pretty game, and can be a worth a try, but overall I can't recommend it. It's such a damn shame, because it has so much going for it, and one of the few indie games I bought at full price (£9) because of its concept, but once you get over the pretty icing, there's not much left of the cake.","December 24, 2014","false","5.4"," 153 of 211 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","153","211","5","2"

It's a 2D platformer in a run-n-gun style which I tend to love.  Here's where the problems come in:  You do missions most of which are fetch-quest style but locating who you're supposed to find or the items you need is completely ambiguous task and the map isn't much help.  Also there's time pressure and enemies that are purpose-built to slow your progress (like the guys with the shields).  Other than that, why is there a reload mechanic in this game?  Gears of War has it because it's a cover-based TPS where you have down-time while in cover and it fits the game style there.  Lastly, why can I not shoot diagonally?  There are plenty of instances where enemies are placed on diagonals and are attacking me but I can't fire back.\n\nWhat I expected out of the game was something more fast-paced like Contra/Metal Slug style game.  If you want it to be more  "adventure" oriented the time-limit is a big roadblock to fun exploration... the game would also need to be less repetitive enemy/level variety as well then.  Like I said, I really want to like this game so I hope you can take this review to heart and do your best to bring out the fun in the game before it's too late.","January 5, 2014","false","5.4"," 484 of 741 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","484","741","0","21"

It's certainly worth about ten dollars for the first 10ish hours of play, but gets way too samey after that.  The developers gave it artificial length by making you play the same map over and over and over and over again, but this mission you kill a real easy boss, the next mission you collect materials, the next mission you kill all of a certain type of mob, etc.\n\nThat having been said, the visuals are on-point, the controls feel like an awesomely perfect old school platformer/shooter, and music, while as limited as the map selection, is real good, the characters are cute and funny, and the gun-play is a blast (pun intended).  The crafting got boring fast, though ... I play games like this so blow peoples heads off, not to stand in front of my gun closet choosing which parts to put together for 12 minutes before each mission.\n\nSteam is going to ask me, "Do you recommend this game?" and only give me a Yes or No.\nYes, with an "if"\nNo, with a "but"\nI'll click no for now, just because I feel it's a bit too expensive for the content.","November 3, 2014","false","10.7"," 96 of 133 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","96","133","0","0"

It has a very metal slug esque feel in terms of both graphics and gunplay. It does have a very weird control system which takes some getting used to and I would reccomend a controler until they fix the keyboard layout or at least support a mouse.  This game takes the metal slug formula of platforming, crazy bosses and twitchy gunplay and adds customizing guns, collecting items, and quests (which are either fetch quests or go here- kill this quests) to the mix.\n\nWhile I would normally reccomend buying this game on sale, there are two reasons I will instead reccomend full price:\n1) They consistantly add more content as time goes on. This of course lends itself to waitin until the game is actually complete before purchasing but\n2) Being a kickstarter, these guys are a small indie (indy? ) studio and as such would benifit more directly for a full price purchase as a larger portion of the sale would actually go to those who directly made the game\n\nVERDICT: BUY IT IF YOU LIKE RPG IN YOUR METAL SLUG.

I'm a fan of Paul Robertson, action rpgs, and weapon customization.\n\nBut the game makes it so hard.  The very core design of the missions is just dull.  Over and over you are given a timer to search a giant maze like map for a randomly placed item or enemy.  Because the maps are large, even if you luck out by heading in the right direction it's still going to take you 5 minutes. If you get unlucky it'll take 15 minutes easily, and if you run out of time or die you have to start over.  It's like they greatly overestimated how much people enjoyed this, because constant navigation is built into things that don't make sense at all.  You spend 10 minutes searching the random boss spawn points to find which one is active, only for the boss to move to another part of the map mid way through the fight.  Now you spend another 2-5 minutes finding the new location, rinse and repeat, and hope you don't run out of time. The game actually expects you to wander through each map a hundred times at 10-20 minutes apiece.\n\nThe weapons you construct have no creativity to them and are just not fun to use.  Sure they are creative art-wise, where you can create a toilet gun, but the moment you try to create a shotgun with more than 2 ammo the game cripples the damage so much as to make it useless.  The real potentials for creativity (piercing shotgun?) are completely unavailable, because you are forced to create a 100% sniper rifle to select piercing ammo.  So you are stuck with a few preset weapon paths, creating incrementally damage increasing versions of the same weapon.  The balance of it works against the mission design, because when you are searching aimlessly through a map of endlessly spawning enemies, making it take 3 seconds to dispatch each enemy (from either low damage ouputs or excessive reload times), it just makes the thing a chore.\n\nIt's highly unlikely that this will be patched either, the devs seem hung up on this idea of a grinding time sink somehow being fun, as similar things were in scott pilgrim too.","May 28, 2014","false","8.6"," 105 of 154 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","105","154","0","4"

If you bought it thinking something like that, you might have a bad time with this game. But hey, at least you get to write a whiny review like everyone and their mother.\n\nSo if you think about buying this to get a quick action fix like aforementioned games, look elsewhere. " So Crawley you rapscallion of a squid, what kind of game is this?" I hear you ask. Well, it pretty much is Monster Hunter with Megamanesque mechanics.\nIt's rather slow paced compared to Metalslug or Contra and features a whole lot of gun and blade customization. You want your combat knife to look like a pizza cutter ? Done. You want a Revolver with a shotgun Barrel and an SMG Stock firing Acid Bullets? This game got you covered. You get annoyed quickly by playing mission-based on only a handful of maps? Well..\n\nThe thing is this: Like in Monster Hunter, you choose a mission and get dropped into one of only few maps, gunning down enemies and collecting different materials to upgrade or modify your Guns, Blades or  Body Armor. Yes there are not that many maps and yes, you have to grind for material. So if this easily irritates you, this might not be a game for you. However, I actually quite enjoyed my first few hours and because of this loot drops from enemies you make at least some progress, even if you fail a mission. Why? Because you get to keep everything you collected.\n\nIn addition to that, there is a little reload minigame, where you want to hit the sweet spot on a reload bar. Contrary to what some reviews imply, the gun does reload nonetheless, if you do not.  If you actually hit the sweet spot, you get a damage bonus for a percentage of your clip, indicated by glowing bullets.\n\nSo after talking about gameplay a bit: The music and artwork is superb. I instantly fell in love with it the first time I saw it, and after playing a while back then I was really disappointed, because I expected this game to be yet another Metal Slug inspired game.\n\nAnd I am pretty glad it is not, because I like this way better.\n\nTL;DR: No this is not Metal Slug. Its Mega Monster Hunter Man. It's obtainable via the Humble  Bundle for one Dollar right now. If you don't mind some grinding  or like either Monster Hunter or Megaman, it is definitely worth it.\n","July 22, 2015","true","19.6"," 78 of 111 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","78","111","5","1"

The idea to put in a reload system was dumb but they way they did it (a time sensitive system) was actually kind of cool. Though it getting annoying fast.

Every mission I attempt feels tedious, slow, and boring, aided mostly by the fact that most every mission is some sort of completely unguided fetch-quest through samey looking environments that are an absolute pain to navigate through.\n\nIf the level design weren't enough to dissuade me from continuing, the limited ammuntion and active reload system makes the gunplay feel especially tedious, and just doesn't work well with the Megaman-style shooting/platforming, especially when the use of cover isn't as much of an option as in Gears of War, the game this particular mechanic came from. I can't count the number of deaths I've encountered after missing my target, only to be shot down during the short idle period in which I wait for the active reload to finish (assuming I successfully reload at all).\n\nThe inventory/item system was another annoyance for me; switching between items feels clunky and slow in situations where speed is needed, and always feels like more of a hassle than is worth.\n\nAs far as the crafting system goes, I honestly can't stand playing the game long enough to gather the items necessary to really try it out, so I don't have much to say regarding that. Perhaps after upgrading my weapons properly, the enemies will feel far less bullet-spongey, and I'll spend much less time standing in one place, jumping, and shooting in mid-air while I wait for an enemy to finally die (supposedly of boredom).\n\nI'm sorry, I want nothing more than to love this game, but this it's an absolute mess. Including modern game mechanics in an old-school platformer/run and gun sounds good on paper, but does little other than clutter the overall design and slow down gameplay. Perhaps if the level/mission design was a little less annoying, it might work.\n\nTo take this game from its current state to something I would enjoy would require gutting the vast majority of the superfluous features, completely overhauling the level design, and possibly even overhauling the crafting system, assuming it is as much of a mess as the rest of the game.\n\nI don't really have any faith in the final product, and I kind of wish I had never spent the money.","February 18, 2014","false","2.3"," 163 of 258 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","163","258","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SillyGate/recommended/218820/","SillyGate","Silver Hemswood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SillyGate/","196 products in account","The team behind Mercenary Kings are sat in that awkward in-between of not having a cult following from simply existing for a long period of time, like Final Fantasy, and not having the excuse of having never developed a game previously. As such, they're neither excused by rabid fanboys nor by simple naivety. In layman's terms; when they dun goof, no one's in their corner.\n\nFor example, it's over a year old (two years if you count Early Access) and it's only just been fixed so that it doesn't crash when you talk to an NPC and try online multiplayer. It's a pretty big deal when such a massive component is unavailable.\n\nThere are typos and syntax errors abound in the game text, something that should've been easy enough to fix in their numerous patches on PC. I do have to give kudos to Tribute's response to the concerns of the completionist demographic; when a kickstart-exclusive achievement made 100%ing the game impossible, they introduced a secondary method of acquiring it. That's gravy in my books.\n\nThe controls feel a bit like a student's final practical. Need to duck? Nope, there's an item by your feet, you're taking that bullet to the face as the collecting animation immobilises you. Nope, there's a ladder a pixel to your right, you're climbing down now. Need to climb down that ladder? Nope, someone put C4 at the top and your backpack is full! You aren't getting down that ladder until someone picks it up or you make room to pick it up yourself.\n\nFurthermore, the game seems to favour the commitment route for control schemes. When you jump, there's very little you can do to influence the path you'll take once you've left the ground. If you're unfortunate enough to try your knife in a pinch, you'll get locked in an uninterruptible cycle if you press it more than once. You'll need to allow plenty of time for the animation lock to finish if you want to so much as turn your character.\n\nThe graphics are the same as you find in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Same people, y'see. The style's consistent and the animations are gorgeous, but it becomes clear that some of the spritework was drawn before they finalised the character designs. For example, Lawless' hat bears the wrong logo in her comm. portrait, and Ryack's expression is far too serious for his actual disposition.\n\nI cannot fault the music. It takes a lot of cues from the Sonic games on the Sega Mega Drive (Sonic 2, Sonic Spinball). Gives me dem nostalgia feels. One of the bosses even takes a pointer or two from the first Sonic game.\n\nThe Steel Soldier, Titan Trooper and their recolours have an annoying habit of not telegraphing where they're jumping, and since you sometimes need to immediately dodge to avoid collision damage, it's a 50/50 chance of rolling in the right direction.\n\nOh, and all bosses and enemies deal way more damage via contact than by their lasers, rockets, bullets and missiles. It's pretty much Hug The Wall: The Game for boss encounters, and Flee In Terror: The Horror Flick should you come into contact with the wildlife. Because you can be killed by rabbits. Guess you're allergic?\n\nBosses randomly teleport to other areas of the map for no reason other than to arbitrarily extend gameplay. If it was purely to pressure the player into rushing the fight before he flees, there wouldn't be a time limit on every mission and its grandma.\n\nThere are a handful of large maps that get repeatedly used. The enemy placements are (mostly) the exact same between missions. A room or two will open up sometimes, but in the end, you'll have quickly grown tired of the same recycled layouts and textures before you've even beaten the game.\n\nIn later missions, some of the poorer design decisions become evident. For example, you'll leave a room and see a manhack to your upper-right. It's a perfect 45 degree angle. It'll automatically start descending diagonally towards you. If you jump to shoot it, it'll either be too close and hit you horizontally, stunning you for a second or two, or it'll be too high and it'll start moving horizontally early in response-- their AI is programmed so that they rarely become completely level with your gun if given the time and space.\n\nYour movement and jump speeds are decided by how encumbered you are; your gun, your knife, your consumables, things like that (your gun weight is negated if you holster it). It's a really neat idea when it's used exclusively for hiding secrets, but it's not. You have to leap defenselessly if you're too heavy, and the game has a nasty habit of placing enemies in the way of the finish line, and usually there's a threat for not finishing the "jumping puzzle" all in one go. Sometimes you have to do the entire thing again, sometimes it's a pit of spikes you can't get out of easily and will likely die from. The feature's great on paper but difficult to account for in all of their level designs, something evidently too difficult for Tribute.\n\nDesign-wise, you can't shoot diagonally for two reasons; 1, you'd have to be incredibly precise with your joystick movements (you're not playing this with a keyboard and enjoying it, trust me) so as not to wander and fall. And 2, because each gun sprite would need a second diagonal variation. Remember, Tribute had a limited budget-- something I suspect shows in how some arts assets weren't updated for the final release.\n\nGun customisation goes something like this in later levels: You built a sweet new gun! Does it have armour-piercing? No? Scrap it and take armour piercing so that you don't have to bounce around like a coked-up kangaroo. No, you don't have multiple gun slots while you're out on the field, so unless you have someone to play with, you're not diversifying your calibrations AND beating the missions in any reasonable time.\n\nI'll tell you something though-- crafting is so extensive and addictive, enough to make the constant grinding for materials almost worth it.\n\nI'd say Mercenary Kings has the making of a fairly memorable game, but it needs severe overhauls to give it the edge it needs. Maybe a bigger budget to allow for experimentation? Maybe a sequel...?","May 25, 2015","false","31.9"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","44","60","0","3"

This may sound like a very odd combination and the reviews are quite ambivalent about the qualities of the game but especially in co-op this game is a blast.\n\nThe story itself can be told quite fast: The bad guys called „CLAW“ (they have the brilliant slogan „CLAW is law“) kidnapped a famoust scientist and conducted some evil experiments on a solitary island. To end this madness the military sends a super special unit – the KINGS. No, the story won’t win a creativity award, but it’s solid and full of humor. The crazy characters are quite likeable and several conversations are actually interesting and bring in some plot twists. But you can be honest: You won’t play this game for the story…\n\n…you want these guns. And the knifes. And the ammo. All the good stuff. The gameplay can be compared mostly to a mixture of 'Mega Man‘ (jumping and shooting) and 'Monster Hunter‘ (crafting and grinding): First you have your own hub where you are able to buy items, upgrade your equipment and accept the missions. These jobs bring you into larger areas where you have to fullfill goals e.g. killing or capturing a boss, gathering materials or resucing some hostages. So you start running and jumping through the levels, avoiding obstacles on your way (like e.g. lava, needles and other evil stuff). Meanwhile you're shooting at everything that walks in front of your weapon while looking for hidden items and loot.\n\nThe level design is well done, the different areas and layouts allow for some nice exploration and the amount of traps and enemy types really brings some nice variety to the quite repetetive goals. Of course: at the end of several mission there's a boss waiting for you and these buddies provide some nice challenging moments. Most of the time simple button mashing ends in an early death and you really have to understand the patterns and to find a good strategy. Though when you’re finally able to defeat that annoying difficult boss (I look at you 'Metal Woof'!) and he drops the material you were looking for – that’s some pretty great feeling.\n\nTalking about materials: On your journey you’ll stumble across many different ingedrients and materials that can be used to craft individual gun parts, knifes and bionic mods. The amount of different parts is tremendous and they can be combined to fit your playstyle, whether you’re the tanky dude with the shotgun or the spray’n run submachine-type. Crafting new guns, mixing the parts and farming for materials is the core element of the game – and it’s very entertaining.\n\nIn terms of the visuals and the sounds I have to admit that the design and the style is gorgeous (I’m a huge fan of well done pixel-graphics). The environment and the characters are detailled, the animations are perfectly fluid and the overall picture is simply great. And in addition there is an amazing soundtrack, that features some really catchy tracks.\n\nI could go on talking about even more positive points, like the splitscreen multiplayer, the co-op mode or the omnipresent humor. But the negative points of the game can’t be hidden this way: the amount of different areas is very limited (there are over 100 missions but just like 8 different areas, so you will re-visit some rooms and places quite a lot) and after a short amount of time the missions can get quite repetitive (there are only like six different goals). Moreoever some time limits in the missions seem to be set totally random, sometimes you finish with half an hour left and sometimes with barely 3 seconds. That’s also due to the fact that some bosses 'escape‘ randomly after a short fight and then you have to search them again (probably not the brigthest gaming mechanic). Besides your characters appearance lacks some good customization aspects, aside from 12 different color schemes (approximately 75% of them look awful…) for the two characters there’s nothing more. Some unlockable characters (e.g. the 3 other members of the KINGS) and areas after finishing the main game would have been a huge plus.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nYes, the reviews and opinions for the game have been quite ambivalent. I think the problem is that many bakers and players expected a ‚pimped up‘-version of 'Metal Slug‘ with all its core points and elements. And with these expectations the game may disappoint easily. I bought it in hope to get a mixture of 'Mega Man‘ and 'Monster Hunter‘ – and I’ve never regret buying it because the game entertained me instantly.\n\nAll in all I guess the game would be a solid 7 out of 10 (or maybe a 6 if you dislike good old Mega or grinding) due to all the negative points (that are clearly there), but… I love the game. Sure I would have loved to enjoy even more areas and to customize my character to look different than my partners, but hey... -  I had a machine gun that fired some caustic missiles, which bounced of walls, splitted in little pellets and exploded on impact. That was one hell of a weapon. And I’ll never forget my shark-shaped-knife that shocked enemies on contact.\n\nThese two things alone have to improve the score by at least two points. Because of… reasons! And explosions. And think of the knifes! And the dogs in mecha-dog-suits. Yeah, never forget mecha suit Doge – ‚Metal Woof‘ ready for action!","September 4, 2015","true","49.0"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","38","50","5","2"

There are boss fights in the game, but after awhile they will give up and leave, which equals a failed mission. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. You are already being timed on the stage, you have to find the boss, get fenced in and figure out the pattern, and they can ragequit.

Admittedly, the maps could use a little bit more variety. That's somewhat remedied by way most missions are structured. Each unique map is inherently large so each mission will cover only certain portions of the map (with the rest of it being totally optional).\n\nThe game also makes you consider resource management. While you don't need to do every single mission to 'beat' the game, you do however need to plan which resources to bring and decide when to best use them. For example, infiltration or capture missions will require you to make the best use of your C4 charges and shock bombs. Wasting one or more of each item can usually lead to failing the mission. This becomes even more important when speed runs come into play.\n\nAnother selling point of the game is the massive amount of gun parts and gun combinations available to you through progression. It opens up a lot of possibilities and it's amusing to see different combinations suggested on various videos and forum posts.\n\nWith all these things going for it, Mercenary Kings is not perfect. I'd reckon that the average Metal Slug player will be able to finish majority of the game without even fully scratching the surface as far as crafting goes. I feel that there's a lot of room for improvement when it comes to content. Personally, I feel that the game was too short seeing as I reached the final level long before I even got to halfway on all the crafting achievements.\n\nMy suggestion? Steam Workshop integration. This is another one of those games that will benefit a lot from workshop integration to add newly designed maps. BattleBlock Theater serves as a great example by giving the players access to the various blocks that make up the levels. A move like this will go a long way especially to reduce the boredom from having finished the game and moving onto crafting everything else.\n\nMy initial impression of this game would be at around 9/10. It was definitely fun but it needs something to fill the gap at the end of the game. For now I'd rate this game as a 7/10 since it is severely in need of user-generated content. Nevertheless, it's still an absolutely fun co-op experience. I do recommend getting the 4-pack.","August 15, 2014","true","68.7"," 61 of 96 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","61","96","0","2"

It's really not, though. It's more like Monster Hunter, where you gather materials and embark on quests with specific goals, as opposed to running through stage after stage and then beating the end boss. Mercenary Kings just happens to use 2D gunning/platforming instead of 3D action for its main gameplay mechanic.\n\nThe problem with its emulation of Monster Hunter is that it took the worst parts and made it the bulk of the game. Too many of the quests are boring "Kill 20 small minions, find 10 stupid items, reach this destination." It's repetitive and not interesting.\n\nEven worse, Mercenary King's early boss fights are boring. They all follow the formula of duck, fire, roll under, repeat. There are 3 or 4 palette swaps per boss, who all receive the exact same new move. Why they chose to create 3 subspecies who all act identically is beyond me.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get to the good stuff.\n\nThe late game bosses become much more interesting and varied. If more of the game were like this, I would give it a glowing review.\n\nThe gun design mechanic is good and forces the player to make meaningful choices and decide between tradeoffs.\n\nPlaying with friends is quite enjoyable.\n\nIn summary, I recommend the game, but if any of the above sounds unpalatable to you, then definitely skip it.","August 18, 2015","true","64.9"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","2"

If you want Metal Slug, go play Metal Slug.\n\nMercenary Kings is a 2D action-platformer with a variety of missions to undertake with generally non-linear level design. Yes, many of the missions share the same maps which I admit is a bit of a bummer, they could use some more variety since there is typically only 2-3 different maps per rank. Still, they're large and fun to explore and, with different types of missions including extermination (kill x amount of y), neutralize (kill boss), gathering (fetch items) and rescue (self-explanitory), among others, the different tasks do mix it up enough to keep it from getting completely stale.\n\nWhat? Grinding? Yeah, there's grinding. You will need to grind materals to upgrade your gun's parts and upgrade your melee weapons. You will end up repeating missions over and over for mats. However, after the first run or two on a mission, you'll memorize the pattern of where everything is, making it much easier and faster to complete, so it's not as bad as it may sound.\n\nThe tunes are good, visuals are splended and charming, humor is amusing, characters are likable and the story works well for what it is.\n\nControls are responsive and both my old PS3 controller and my Logitech F310 work perfectly...do NOT attempt to play this with your keyboard or you're gonna have a bad time. I cannot stress that enough, do not use the keyboard, use a controller. Game client is stable; constant 60 FPS and no crashes to note.\n\nThe gun upgrade/mod system is fun and quirky, but could've been more refined and balanced, as the biggest changes to note are appearences, semi-auto/auto, clip size and reload time. While in theory this sounds nice since it boils down to preferences, many combanations lack fire-power so if you want major damage, you're limited to a few choice combanations. Considering this was one of the big selling points/features, it feels like it was unfinished and rushed.\n\nI wish I could comment on the 4 player co-op, but I've never had an opportunity to try it.\n\nMercenary Kings isn't a game you can pick up and finish in an afternoon, it requires patience, time and investment.

HOWEVER, forget any skillfull evasion then, because in close quarters you will get hit no matter what.

Secondly is the gameplay: its very satisfying and deliberate the controlls feel tight and the guns feel meaty with good sound effects and enemy death animation.\n\nThere is quite a lot of content however you do spend your time redoing things quite a lot in a sort of monster hunter fashion where you go to the same levels over and over to get materials however instead of just killing a boss there are different objectives for different missions like destroy something with explosives or save some hostages things like that. As for the bosses themselves they are pretty good they have attack patterns which can be quite difficult to master fighting against making them satisfying however unfortunately there isnt that many bosses in the game so you will find yourself fighting the same ones or varients on the same ones over and over.\n\nThis is a really solid game and can keep you going for a while if you enjoy it I spent a lot of time collecting different gun parts and trying different combinations however i eventually got bored of repeating the same areas over and over and moved on to other games.

That's not to say I don't enjoy the other games I play and adore, but this just tickles a fancy like none other. The rewards offered through progression, the challenges when the enemies ramp up, or when a new boss is introduced - they make playing endlessly entertaining. Now, much of the criticism the receives is due to a popular idea that the game is similar to Metal Slug. I've personally never played it, shame on me and such, but if you're looking for that experience, then you ought to play Metal Slug. This isn't like another game I've played, while it shares elements with many, it's an entity of its own.

The art and music is beautiful, and  the mechanics that they draw from Borderlands, Monster Hunter, and Metal Slug are very cool in concept. But, therein lies the problem. There is tons of character and tons of concepts, and they just don't really gel together in a satisfying way. The beautiful art is done injustice by how stiff the animations are, and by how creepingly slow variations in environments and enemies are introduced. While the music is good, the sound effects are flat, and don't provide any real sense of punch to the action. The guns are incredibly flaccid and static, feeling more like gussied-up number hoses than firearms. Customizing the guns doesn't really feel meaningful or fun. As in Borderlands, all the variety in the world ends up just being wallpaper for a different set of slightly different numbers. This is compounded by the fact that new weapons cannot even be found in the wild, reducing the excitement of their procurement a great deal. Action is plodding with neither the fast pace of Metal Gear nor the precision of Mega Man, but a muddy, fuzzy middle-ground that isn't satisfying.

If there is a fault to be had with MK is that it may be too ambitious.\n\nNaturally, the first thing you notice about MK is the look of it, and anyone worth their government-provided meat-substitute recognizes the style as, as I said before, Metal Slug (in terms of tone and atmosphere) and Scott Pilgrim (in terms of art style and visual humor). For many, this acts as a barrier to keep them from wanting to try the game and instead ridicule it for being "too much like a Metal Slug rip off!" when in fact that couldn't be further from the truth, but more on that later. The art style is incredibly charming and fun, despite taking place on a militarized island populated with murderous COBRA rejects. Sadly, and this is where part of the over ambition comes into play, the environments repeat themselves a lot, a whole lot. This is not so much a fault of the level designs, but more due to the fact that you will play different (i.e. different objectives every now and then) missions in the same level over and over until you manage to advance in rank. If the level art was a tad more detailed and beautiful this would be forgivable but after so many hours it gets bland.\n\nSound is nothing really to complain about or praise, but it gets the job done. Simple, appropriate, though like the art it can get repetitive as you listen to the same level music over and over and over again.\n\nNaturally the most important bit of information you want to know is "how does it play?" While some screenshots and/or videos may have led you to believe it plays like Metal Slug, it really doesn't all that much. MS had you going through a linear, left-to-right, level with occasional height changes. MK's maps are far more complex, the map probably even confusing some at first with the interwoven connecting paths, and should be looked at more like a Castlevania map - large and sprawling, with hidden alcoves, optional boss rooms, etc. You'll be jumping around a lot, ascending to reach a goal or carefully descending to avoid hazards. I would say it feels a lot like Spelunky in its controls, but how easily you move is dependant on what you have equipped.\n\nThe real meat and potatoes of this game are the guns. You collect materials from fallen enemies and found crates and use these resources, and money garned from completing missions, to craft components for your gun. Here is where the game really shines, as it doesn't restrict which part can go with what component, and if you want to try and make a terribad gun, you're just as able to as you are to make an amazing gun. The elements of any gun really work toward tailoring to your preferred method of runnin' and gunnin'. You could take a huge gun with tons of stopping power and a low clip, or you can take a smaller, faster gun so you can dodge enemy attacks more easily. Elemental upgrades for bullets allow you to gain an advantage or disadvantage against a given enemy, and many parts take advantage of the art style by looking silly, fun, or just plain ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.\n\nReally, it's the gun crafting and shooting that keep this game from feeling too tedious (at first). However, as time drags on, you find yourself grinding levels for materials and money, fighting the same boss over and over, collecting X of that and Y of this, killing some of these and more of those. Honestly, if your main gripe with MMOs are the fetch/mob kill quests, this game may not be for you.\n\nThe co-operative play really helps keep this game feeling fun, as your friends can split up and explore are area to finish the mission faster or you can operate as a time with one being the fast shooter for smaller enemies and attracting the attention of big ones while the other player with the bigger, slower, guns take the kill shot. If you have some friends who are interested in this game and you think they would enjoy the experience with you, this is not a bad grab.\n\nThere are other crafting elements in this game, allowing you to customize your tent interior, or create body mods to gain a variety of pros and cons (like increased drop rate, faster speed, etc.), and meals before a mission to give you a nice HP stat boost.\n\nOverall, this game is fun, make no mistake, but it feels tired at about 50% (it's a very long game, surprisingly), and that's why its ambition is its downfall. The creators tried to do too much and ended up spreading their efforts too thin, giving us plenty of features but no major depth to any of them (gun crafting excluded). Had they taken some more development time to craft some more levels, think up better mission objectives, or polish up the scenery it would have been a perfect game.\n\nStill, I can still recommend it to anyone who enjoys action/platformers with a Metal Slug/Metroidvania/Spelunky/Scott Pilgrim heritage, though maybe wait for it to go on sale for around $10, at most.","April 5, 2014","true","31.6"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","3"

Crafting your first machine gun after being stuck with the sub-par starter gun is hugely satisfying, as is completing a mission with all bonus objectives and enough resources gathered to buy several upgrades.\n\nThat said the gameplay turns out to be rather poor. On a regular basis players need to avoid enemy projectiles while firing at airborne enemies homing in on them and platforming, all at the same time. Sadly, the game lacks the silky smooth controls required to make this fun and instead just ends up being frustrating.\nThe actual gameplay takes the form of missions, each one with their own objective. Between them players can visit their homebase for upgrades and supplies. There are two major problems with this. First: missions take place in large locations which get recycled again, and again, and again. Secondly: no information is provided as to where in the freely traversable levels the current objective is located. As a result players are forced to scour the same places over and over again, often with endlessly looping background music, too. Combined with limited time for each mission things can become rather frustrating fast.\n\nOther annoyances:\nThe camera is not overly intelligent.\nExponential grinding for better gear.\nJumping has a noticeable delay to it.\nJumping down larger heights leads to the character freezing for a moment upon landing.\nSome enemies can fire diagonally, which players flatout can't.\nEnemies may respawn the moment their spawn location is off screen.\nHealth items are few and far in between, making the gameplay rather unforgiving.\nHealth can be regenerated at field hospital, which act as save points. The health regen is slow enough to not be noticeable. The game doesn't bother mentioning that this health regen exists.\nIt's impossible to jump while crouching, making destructable platforms the player has to fire at while standing on them and exercise in patients.\nDefault grunt enemies on platforms above the players may randomly decide to drop down, giving no chance to walk away or kill them.\nThe first boss decided to leave once he was on low health. He came back eventually but not soon enough for there to be time to finish him off, leading to a failed mission.

It's kind of bland but it can be skipped without an issue (just keep pressing "next" everytime the dialog windows show up after some key missions).\n\nThe negative:\n-Gathering materials is a chore. Even upgrading your armor requires grinding (example: one armor requires 2 of a material that's only dropped by one boss; to make matters worse, it's not a guaranteed drop)\n-There are a lot of missions but they are really repetitive.\n-Maps are quite big, which could be a good thing but you must check the map constantly to see if you are going to the right direction. Some missions actually don't tell you were the objectives are but luckily those are quite few.\n-Crafting is kind of confusing but the worse thing is being constantly constrained by having to find materials.\n-The food that can give you a boost on health (+ other temporary stats) must be grinded in the "hunting grounds" were you basically kill -mostly- harmless animals that provide no challenge. The whole thing looks like an unfinished featured that ended up being rushed.\n-"Profencies" that you can get by crafting lots of stuff seem kind of nice but they are not worth the trouble of finding all the materials.\n-The special "mods" that you can equip to your character are mostly kind of useless (although the one that assures that every enemy drops a material on death is extremely necessary to be able to craft weapons)\n-Enemies have "strenghts" and "weaknesses" that you can learn about by talking to a guy in your camp and changing your bullets for each mission is so boring that you'll probably use the one with the higher attack number and disregard everything else.\n-Weapons have a lot of different stats but they really don't change the playstyle.\n-You can craft a lot of decorative stuff that serve no purpose except tempt you into wasting your materials. In my opinion it would have been better to see the base change as you completed missions.\n\nConclusion:\nI can see a lot of potential in this game but it's full of really strange decisions that seem to be aimed at increasing the playtime of the game (but that's not the same as a game having a great replay-value).\nin my opinion the game would have been a lot better without crafting and actually focusing in making combat and missions more varied.","August 19, 2015","false","21.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","12","16","3","0"

Also, enemies respawn on the maps, so you can't even slowly/strategically work your way through difficult areas.  The "customization" isn't very exciting, and parts are tedious to collect in this game, not too mention, the weapons you finally do put together aren't even fun to use.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/218820/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Every time I see Mercenary Kings brought up online, people get warned away from it for various reasons. Despite that, I'm here to say that it's gone down as one of my favorite games. Seriously, it's one of those where I'll play it for 2-3 hours and then have to force myself to play something else because I want to keep doing missions. It might not be for everyone, but let me share the good parts with all of you for a change.\n\nSo if you've somehow glossed over this one, Mercenary Kings is a side-scrolling shooter in the vein of Metal Slug. Unlike Metal Slug, however, you have a persistent character that you upgrade with new guns and mods and stuff over the course of a hundred or so missions. And those missions take place in huge, wide-open levels with lots of paths and secrets to find. Missions range from beating bosses to saving hostages to recovering intel to gathering materials. Materials are very important, of course, because they let you build new guns and mods and stuff.\n\nSee, there's something like 300 guns in the game, and you build each one piece by piece, using money from missions and materials from exploring and shooting dudes to unlock components. Those pieces can be mixed and matched to create monstrosities like a 32-round caustic shotgun. It's kinda like Borderlands if you could custom-build each gun. You can also build mods for yourself that give you major advantages, like speed boosts and regenerating health, or guaranteeing material drops and finding more money. There's also melee weapon crafting, cooking, and decorating your tent!\n\nThere's also a surprising amount of goofy-♥♥♥ story, too. About half the missions are bookended with short character scenes like this that move the plot along. You have to rescue people to expand your camp, and once in awhile something will happen to them, like I had to go save my gunsmith at the start of the rank 4 missions. The design for the characters is by the same guy who did the Scott Pilgrim beat-em-up that sadly never made it to PC, and everything is beautifully animated.\n\nWhen the subject comes up, I've seen three big complaints about the game. The first is the bosses, and they're definitely one of the weak points. You have to actually find them in the level (unless you use the mod that shows their location on the map), usually in one of four locations, and they move around. Worse than that, they can run away while you're fighting them, meaning you have to follow them, though they're marked on your map after you find them once. They're not like Metal Slug bosses, either... they tend to be invincible until they reveal their weak point, so you have to learn their attacks and patterns. Once you do, though, they're not that hard. Capture missions ♥♥♥♥ing suck, though... you have to weaken the boss to a certain point and then hit them with a special grenade you can only carry like two of. I won't fault anyone who got stuck on a Capture mission and quit because of it.\n\nThe second complaint is that you have to grind for materials, and I really don't get that one at all. The first few mods that open up let you control material drops; one guarantees a drop from every enemy but lowers the chance of getting rarer ones, and another makes rare drops more likely but reduces the cash you get from missions. There are no real rare drops, either. Each enemy has up to three items they drop, but they tend to be spread around so that almost every material is a common drop from something. The only hard to get ones are boss drops, but you can find those hidden on most levels in secret rooms, and they're always in the same boxes so you can get as many as you want during missions there.\n\nThe last is that it's repetitive, and really that's going to be entirely up to the player. There are ten ranks of missions, with 10-12 missions per rank. Missions tend to take place on the same 2-4 maps per rank, so if you get tired of doing different things on the same levels, then yes, it's going to be repetitive. After almost 30 hours I haven't really tired of any of the missions and still go back and replay old ones to get extra materials and try to beat the par times. It's not perfect, but I got absolutely addicted to it and I didn't even play it co-op. Honestly, it's not a Metroidvania game but it's scratching the same itch for me that the old GBA Castlevania games did. If you like item hunting and gear customization in your platform games, I think it's a blast.","September 20, 2015","true","28.2"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The graphics and the gameplay strongly resemble those of the Metal Slug series. There’s the side-scrolling and 2D platforming that old school gamers have appreciated.\n\nThe plot of Mercenary Kings is about a mercenary who is part of a resistance group that is doing battle with a villainous organization known as The Claw. The narrative quickly becomes irrelevant as you start off in camp and learn to customize your mercenary character. There is no voice acting, so you have to read the dialog text to understand what is really going on. The lack of relevance the narrative has does not bring the game down since gameplay tries to be the strength of the game.\nUpon playing this game I first realized how awkward the keyboard controls are. There is no mouse to be used in the game, but the keyboard makes the gameplay feel like a drag. I firmly believe that fans of the Metal Slug series would be best advised to use a controller or gamepad to have any fun with this game. Another aspect of the gameplay that feels like a drag is the repetitive nature of the battles with The Claw. You have a limited number of lives and after each death you will have to face the same enemies and this feels quite tedious. Using keyboard controls is difficult when trying to press buttons to shoot, jump, and roll.\n\nThe graphics are pixelated, but that’s not too bad for a game that’s trying to be an old school, 2D side scroller. If the game had more variety in its levels, the replay value would be exponentially higher. I really wanted to like Mercenary Kings because of its concept of being of resistance fighter battling an organization of villains and the various characters to choose from and customize. Weapons can also be customized so that your mercenary can leave camp for battle with better gear.  I can only recommend this game to those with a game controller or gamepad and do not care much about the quality of the narrative. If you’re a gamer who is accustomed to using the keyboard/mouse combination, I would not recommend Mercenary Kings unless you are willing to commit yourself to playing with a game controller or gamepad.  I give this game a score of 6/10.","June 14, 2015","false","4.3"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","2"

However since then I have gotten to the later stages and now I see this game is everything I used to hate about old school games. In the later levels the Devs decided to make it more challenging by adding jump mazes that require a high end controller to do. If you are trying with a cheap controller or a Keyboard.. good luck...  And the time limits imposed on those missions make it so you are trying to rush though which of course increases the chance you will fail due to missing a jump.  And mix that all with the fact that there is usually more then one way to go on the map to your objective however some ways are blocked by doors that require C4 and since you can only carry 1 C4 that means if you choose a direction incorrectly once then the short time expires and you lose because of that.\nits really to bad. The game is a ton of fun all the way up to captain with a few annoyances here and there and then you just hit this wall of missions that suck all the fun from the game and induce extreme frustration.","May 7, 2015","false","22.7"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","20","36","0","0"

It feels like it lacks flair or intensity. Coming back to something like Metal Slug, the action feels very kinetic and constant.

But this genious game offers so much more with crafting, rank system, upgrades, multiplayer, mission types and even with enemy types.\n\nWhen i first started playing, i fully expected to just run through a one direction level blasting everything without much thought, but it suprised me.\nFirstly, each level can be "explored".  You can go up, down, left, right.. there is a full map to traverse!\nEach enemy has vantages that can make you think as you approach it. It's not all mindless blasting ( well you can try, but you get beat up a fair bit ). Then there is the bosses. They each are challenging and have unique weaknesses.\n\nPro's:\nWonderful arcade style graphics.\nMany hours of playtime.\nGreat fun with a few friends on online multiplayer!\nChallenges around every corner with enemy types, bosses, objectives, items and gear setups.\nMany missions and a few different mission types to keep things interesting. I Personally Love this.\nEach "mission" has side objectives and even secret objectives. Keeps things more interesting while giving you a chance to earn some extra dosh. So it's not always a single minded objective.. you have the choice to take things further.\nCrafting! Craft you own weapons, be it automatic, semi auto, bladed, single blast, double barreled.. so many possabilities! You can even install bullet types for different effects. I Had some fun mixing weapon parts.\nUpgrades! Upgrade your armor, install skills & effects and some camp vanity. Just to make things more interesting.\nA Large map on each mission to explore. "where am i suppose to go? Oh hello... there is a map! D:  "\nJust addictive!\nCon's:\nInitial keyboard setup can be frustuating initially. ( Though remapping or plugging in a controller makes it excellent ).\nSome missions that fully require certain items to complete it can become depleted thus making the mission void.\nThere is no option to "cancel mission" or "return to camp". So you are forced to exit to the game menu to cancel a mission mid-mission.\nLives are shared in multiplayer. So if you have a reckless friend who plays like a lemming, you will see the lives dwindle thus Failing the mission once depleted.\nQuite a few skills (mods) seem to have some negative effects that overwhelm the positive.\n\nI Would recommend this game 110%. I Would even encourage multiple purchases so you can share the fun with friends!!\n\n"Now waiting for Mercenary kings 2"","August 6, 2015","true","24.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

I think the most common description of this game would be something along the lines of Metal Slug x Borderlands. Where the gameplay is obviously like Metal Slug but the be all end all is to upgrade your weapons, armor and mods through pickups. I think at most that's where this game kinda diverts from the two games mentioned and probably falls closer to the gathering games found in MInecraft or Terraria. There is no leveling method from what I've seen and the only way to increase your health and weaponry is by increasing your money by doing missions and picking up material drops found during those missions. At first, the game may seem difficult like most shooters will but once you get a decent upgrade going the game will start feeling like classic shooters from days past. I think what sold me on this game was when I was rolling with another player online (4 player co-op) and she was carrying around the spread gun.

The evil organization CLAW makes me think of a James Bond villain's gang. This makes the setup quite enjoyable.\n\nI recommend this game and my number of play hours is testimony. Being a 2D pixel art game it ran great on my old laptop and this has been the game I played in transportation for quite a while.\nHowever, I believe this game also has a few annoying aspects that could be a deal breaker to some people. Il try to summarize it all in a list of pros and cons.\n\nThe Pros :Crazy amount of gun parts to craft. Lots of ingredients to loot.\nNice "Megaman meets Rambo" platformer gameplay.\nLevels are very big and quite complex. The map is mandatory to not get lost!\nThere are several "missions" for each map. You get to explore each throughly as the objectives are in different locations for each mission.\nMissions have appropriately varied objectives (collect ingredients, kill a boss, save hostages...). There are many of those missions, making the game quite long.\nIt will take you dozens of hours to craft the rarest parts, get the achievements, and unlock all the rewards.\nThe Cons :\nThere is a very annoying mechanic with the bosses : they can flee. Sometimes they flee to another arena at the other side of the map, and you don't have time to get there before they flee and change location again.\nThere are several missions for each map. Despite different spawns, goals, and how huge the maps actually are, it can be repetitive to see the same level 5 times in a short time span.\nThere may be many "missions", but aren't that many maps/levels in the game. The mission objectives don't modify the maps much either.\nTo farm some ingredients, you'll have to play the same mission many times. This makes the issue above even worse.\nWeapon parts are all a fragment of a "complete gun". These "complete guns" are all very powerful (at the point in the game when you can get the ingredients to craft their parts). This actually discourages you to experiment with gun building, since those "default guns" are very good.\nOverall, I recommend playing this game in smaller sessions, so that the repetitive aspect doesn't feel as bad, allowing you to enjoy the actual qualities of the game. Getting better at killing those bosses before they flee is also a great way to make this game less frustrating.","October 6, 2015","true","60.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Mercenary Kings came dangerously close to being great but stumbled near the finish line and crashed hard. Maybe it's me. I'm going to recommend, because it's not a bad game in any way and it features a pretty cool concept. Ultimately it's fun and i've been playing it longer than i initially thought i would. And i still want more. If you're into pixel art, retro styled action platformers, this is a very solid, if very uninspired game.\n\nMercenary Kings has some good ingridients, but doesn't seem to click too well. It takes some pretty bland cliches of 80/90 over the top cartoons, villains and macho bs heroes but doesn't use them to create anything compelling. It rehashes cliches for the sake of rehashing cliches which is a shame because the game has some pretty good elements.\n\nOrdinarily, i'd expect a game to come up with a cool concept then ruin it by being lazily half-arsed or rushed, but Mercenary Kings actually has good art and sound. I can't blame the developers for lacking effort because it's certainly there. The characters are drawn and animated with style and their dialogue fits the brash and cliched design. But they're unlikable and almost ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I don't expect great depth but they're very "cookie cutter" and not very memorable, although i must begrudgingly admit the idiots kinda grew on me after a while. Animation and dialogues are well done, no complaints there. Maybe there's one too many generic clones of the generic villian soldier but that may well be intentional and it fits the theme.\n\nThe controls seemed pretty weird to me, but they can be remapped. A simple run 'n gun platformer shouldn't be confusing, but it took me a while to come up with a control scheme that i felt comfortable with. Which is the same one i got used to in Risk of Rain btw. The controls are responsive and other than there being too many of them, there's really nothing wrong so maybe just attribute my control discomforts to the fact the game just refuses to "click" for me.\n\nLevel design is, as has been noted in other reviews, very repetitive but once again, Mercenary Kings has many ingridients of a good game and while you're still interested in the RPG-like aspects of gameplay, or looking to concoct even weirder combinations of weapon parts to smash enemies with, you'll be able to forgive the repetitivnes. It may even help a little because the game is pretty difficult at frist, unless you're really good at action platformers.\n\nSpeaking of RPG elements, there's leveling up, acquiring extra skills and abilities, collecting resources to craft both usefull and useless upgrades but i was kinda uninterested in them at first. Maybe they were not presented the way i'd like or i was whiny and temperamental or whatever but it felt like a bunch of possibilities were dumped on me all at once, and then i was told to grind away and eventually unlock the stuff. Grind is a bit unkind because gameplay is pretty fun and the concept of mixing platforming, combat, RPG progression and crafting is promising. But then again repetitive levels do make it feel like a grind, so and the promise kinda falls flat. As with characters, i never felt any connection to any upgrade or whatever. It very much felt like i was doing whatever to kill whatever, in order to rescue whatever so i can whatever whatever...\n\nOptions are pretty sparse. There's volume controls, control remapping, windowed or fullscreen and... that's it. No resolution choices though reportedly you can scale the game down by using -windowed -scale=2 as a command line argument. It didn't work for me though.\n\nHavent tried multiplayer but it seems like it's well implemented. There's co-op in either split screen or online and you can set players to join only if they're on your friends list or allow all. Or you can invite manually.\n\nThere is gore and violence but since it's done in a pixel art style, it isn't graphic in a way comparable to modern shooters or horror games. It is violent and over-the-top as much as the artstyle allows, so if you're concerned about that, then skip this game. It's fun and fitting and wonderfully old-skool and enemies explode in chunks of violence and gore. It's meant to be fun of course, but it definitely isn't to everyone's tastes.\n\n\nRepetition is fine for as long as you're having fun playing. -Recommended.","July 25, 2015","true","22.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This game offers nothing new or really interesting in it's gameplay and in the end you are just doing the same mindless stuff for hours on the same maps.

Not many games have made use of the delicate pixel art that Metal Slug introduced us to. Why you might say?

However this game is just beautiful pixel art throughout the whole game, never getting repetitive or unfulfilling.\n\nThe game takes the shoot-em-up game, arcade style gameplay and mixes it with metoridvania free-roaming and item-gathering concepts to pimp up the Metal Slug-like gameplay to a more modernized version.\n\nWith hundreds of mission, carried out on several map levels, with endless of materials, gadgets, tech, armor and weapons to build and customize this game has shown us what the shoot-em-up genre will look like in the future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshtendo/recommended/218820/","joshtendo","Jitters","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joshtendo/","304 products in account","Mercenary Kings = Metal Slug + Monster Hunter (with just a dash of metroidvania). Unfortunately as good as this combination sounds, Mercenary Kings doesn't live upto any of those games, instead it seems to awkwardly straddle the divide between them.\n\nIf your expecting a fast paced sidescrolling run and gun game like Metal Slug or Megaman X, you will be disappointed. Movement is in no way terrible, but in comparison to games that excel in the genre the characters will seem sluggish (I know that running speed is affected by equipment weight) and the controls will feel loose and a bit unresponsive (especially jumping). Also being unable to shoot diagonally seems like a big oversight for a game like this. Don't be expected to be oneshotted by enemies but at the same time be prepared to spend more taking enemy grunts down. Once again though this doesn't make Mercenary Kings a bad experience, you just need to manage your expectations.\n\nAnyone familar with Monster Hunter will be right at home with the way that Mercenary Kings handles missions and crafting. Missions are selected from an npc in the hub basecamp, mostly fetch/kill quests which take place over a handful of levels (encouraging you to explore new areas of each map) with a few boss battles sprinkled through each tier. A new tier becomes available after completing specific missions which usually involve the introduction of a new boss, which can be captured or killed depending on the mission and/or your preference. Enemies(and Bosses) will drop items needed to craft new gun parts and knives. Just like Monster Hunter to get your favourite equipment you will find yourself grinding. All though this formula worked great with Monster Hunter, unfortunately Mercenary Kings doesn't pull it off half as well. Although maps in Monster Hunter were reused in every mission, you didn't have to wade through 15 min of the same pattern of enemies to get to your objective, you could generally just run there. Weapons in Monster Hunter varied greatly, feeling very different to use and with very different stats, in Mercenary Kings it really just boils down to dps. I also feel like there are some real balancing issues with the different gun types. Who wants to grind for gun parts when the guns just feel like reskins of your current weapon. For grinding to be viable gameplay in a game like this bosses really have to be something special, with random attack patterns and unpredictable AI, every fight needs to feel different. This is also something that Monster Hunter gets away with but Mercenary Kings seems to struggle with.\n\nI don't know if this review will help anyone and I really have just scratched the surface on what to expect but overall although there a lot of questionable design choices in Mercenary Kings, I HAVE enjoyed my time playing it, especially with my friends. It may not compete with other games from similar genres, but what it does do is provide a enjoyable unique hybrid experience, and for that it was worth my money.","January 30, 2014","true","120.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Though from what I've experienced it seemed more like a watered down Mega Man game with some mild RPG mechanics.\n\nIt's not a badly made game in any sense, but it feels a bit too sluggish for an action junkie to enjoy.  The fact that it's mission based and most of the time you'll be farming materials to make new guns parts and what-not adds to that.\n\nPros:\n-It has very appealing aesthethics and animation\n-There's a lot of customization options for your gun (though not right out of the box).\n-It has online multiplayer (up to 4 people)\n\nCons:\n-You gotta farm a lot to be able to get better gun parts (which is bad for those who just want to get into the action).\n-The Action itself is pretty slow paced (it also doesn't seem at all challenging)\n-Playing with friends doesn't make it any more hectic and actually slows it down even more since you have to wait\nfor each player to catch up to go to the next area of the mission.\n\nIn Short:\nIf you like a action based games that play similar to classics like Metal Slug, Contra, or Mega Man. This is probably not the game for you.\n\nIf you happen to like farming and don't mind slow pased action and find quirky and bouncy artstyles a good enough reason to buy a game. Then go ahead and get this title.\n\nEither way I recommend you wait to get it on sale before grabbing a copy for yourself or a friend.

This means planning ahead; while at the home base / lobby you will spend money and materials gained during missions to unlock new gun parts, knives, and mods, and outfit yourself as you like;  Do you set yourself up with an optimal plan for your next mission, or just go with what seems fun? Either way, you have a LOT of options to choose from.\n\nAnother unique quality to Mercenary Kings is the large and non-linear qualities of it's maps;  While each of the different levels gets reused for multiple missions, each one is HUGE with numerous interconnected rooms.  Some missions task you with exploring these maps at large on the look-out for specific enemies or materials, while some give you a clearly marked point to reach (or numerous potential boss locations) and you simply need to navigate a favorable route.\n\nWhatever the individual mission objective, it becomes easier and more fun to accomplish with friends.  The co-op REALLY shines when done locally, with two to four friends together in split-screen.  Equally viable is to invite friends online, using steam voice chat or skype for communication.   Public, auto-join online co-op is also available but it's far less ideal, as your only means of communication are a series of quick voice-macros, and there's no way of knowing if the player in charge is thirty missions behind you or thirty missions ahead.   No matter how you choose to do it, the game encourages you to split up and comb different areas of the map, trying to reach or search for your objective, and then meeting up to take on tough bosses together.\n\nSpeaking of which, the bosses are another area where the game truly shines.  If you've played earlier in the beta, you'll be amazed at how much improvement was made to the game's varying bosses;  each has a wide variety of different attacks and patterns it will follow and each is equally deadly, enough to challenge the most hardcore action-platformer fan.\n\nIn summary, Mercenary Kings draws inspiration from a LOT of things, but it's as new and original as it is nostalgic, and worth checking out.","March 29, 2014","true","78.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

That's the missions part, now let's get to the camp part. The camp is a place you roam between the missions, it's split into two parts:\n1) The main camp\n2) Hunting grounds (You can go here to get animals' food, and harvest fruits)\nThe whole point of the camp is that it consists of different members, that do different functions, you can go here to customize your weapons, cook yourself a meal, forge yourself a knife, choose a mission, search for games, customize your tent (Your bragging place, that you can show to different players that join you, here you can have a banner, and ornament, and three of your favourite weapons sets created by youself shown), upgrade armor. Although I didn't play through the game fully yet, this is probably all of the functions that will be available. At first not all of these functions will be available, you must get them through specific missions\n\nGUNS N' KNIVES. THEIR STATS\nThis part feels very entertaining, you can create a bunch of variations of EVERYTHING, quick advice though, negative stats can make your gun better, depending on what you're trying to do. About knives, you can't customize them, but there's so much of them, that you wouldn't want to.\n\nPLATFORMING\nVery good, uhh, I think that's all I can say, there's a weight system though, it's determined by your knifes and guns.","July 25, 2014","true","12.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

It's just a weak Metal Slug ripoff. The missions all take place in the same locales, and the objectives are always kill x of this enemy or collect x of this item. Some times you have to capture a boss, but there is no explanation beforehand as to how you do this. I'd battled through the stage only to mistakenly kill the boss because I'd ran out of the item needed to capture him. Both yours and the enemies projectiles are painfully slow. There are only two directions you can shoot in whilst not jumping. Up and left / right. This makes fighting certain flying enemies a major pain in the balls. Especially when they knock you off of a ladder or a zipline when you're just trying to get from A to B. The boss fights are rubbish too. You do so much damage to the boss and then he walks through into the background and appears at a random location on your map. And unless you pay for one of your people to spot the boss, you're left running through the stage blind. Battling the respawning enemies. The worst are easily the slow moving flying drones. Slowly followed by these little jumping turnip headed ♥♥♥♥ers. They are very difficult to hit unless you have a shotgun, due to them springing about all over and your projectiles being telegraphed.\nI haven't enjoyed my time on this game at all.

Confusing layout, lots of little unconnected rooms, and tons of elevation changes; apparently just to screw with you.\n3) Very poor mission choices to start with, including a gathering mission and a rescue 8 hostages mission which, combined with the annoying map layout and the fact that the stuff you're looking for isn't marked on the map (most missions are kind enough to give you an 'x' to head towards,) seemed to have been chosen specifically to weed out new players.\n4) Your extremely limited choices to upgrade, once you finally manage to pick up some crafting supplies, really don't give you the tools to significantly modify your weapon.\n\nAll told, it'll take you somewhere around an hour and a half to get out of that horrible slog.\n\nSo why am I recommending this game?\n\nBecause as soon as you start to move up the ranks, all kinds of new stuff is unlocked which greatly improves the experience. You start getting all kinds of real choices for your weapon: bullet hose machine gun or single-shot sniper rifle? Shotgun or pistol? Submachine gun or magnum? Your choice! Mix and match pieces from each to completely customize your experience and unlock the ability to use special ammo types with a variety of effects.\n\nYou'll also start seeing some interesting choices for hand-to-hand weapons: Do you take the tiny knife that won't weigh you down, or a massive sword or spear that can inflict massive damage at range (and never runs out of ammo!)\n\nThe ability to choose two perks that can really help customize your character. Need to throw more bullets at things? Double your magazine size or pick up faster shooting. Looking for crafting materials? Make it so that enemies always drop items and/or make them drop rare items more often.\n\nBetter maps!  Now, not going to say it's all roses (I really didn't like the temple, which is another extremely vertical level), but it's all a step up from the starting jungle map.\n\nMission choices! Past the first rank, you generally don't need to complete every mission to get to the next rank. Have a mission that's kicking your ♥♥♥? Skip it, then come back in a rank or two with a bigger, better gun.\n\nPros/Cons:\n+ Great pixel graphics.\n+ Great music.\n+ Great customization.\n+ Epic boss fights.\n- Horrible starting levels.\n- Control scheme that sometimes feels like it's fighting you.\n- Why can't I shoot diagonally? (Most of) the enemies can!\n\nOverall:\n+Worth the starting slog.","May 10, 2014","true","30.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If It would be possible, I would give this neutral.\nSo this game is basicly 2D run-shoot-loot platformer, and it accomplishes it well. The gameplay works well, though the default settings for keys were a bit weird for me. The shooting though could be better, because there's no diagonal shooting, but otherwise it works pretty well. The reload "quicktime event" is a pretty cool touch too, but I don't understand the bad bullet thing (makes half of the damage).\nLooting and moding your skills are the main thing is this game, like if you want to get somewhere, you have to upgrade your guns (with many ways). This is nice idea, but every level has a timer, which sometimes makes the looting and gathering materials really hard. Also, the missions themselves are a bit booring.\nThe enemies are mostly pretty okay. Not too easy to kill, neither too difficult to kill, but the placementof the enemies  feels a bit disturbing time to time. Like these flying robots appear while you try to platform to another place, guys with spears (a bit of more health than usual) are placed on small platforms, making it almost sure that you'll get hit etc. So far what I've stumbled boss fights, they're pretty okay.\nThe graphics are really nice. The enviroments are kind of cool looking, the NPCs and the player itself looks really nice, the little animals look adorable, and the ballistics are pretty nice too. Only a bit annoying thing though is that levels are maybe a bit too repeative.\nSoundtrack isn't really special, maybe a bit booring if you ask me.\nThe biggest problem of this is that it keeps crashing for some reason, which is really annoying.\n\nSo, summed up:\n+gameplay\n+crafting and moding\n+graphics\n+/-guns feel nice, but should have diagonal shooting change too\n-timer makes gathering materials hard on some levels\n-keeps crashing for some reason\n\n7,8/10","June 30, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mercenary Kings is not Metal Slug and should not be treated as such. It's 2D military Monster Hunter down to the core.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, for starters, there's a certain set of areas that you'll be redeployed to again and again and again, and larguely these areas will have the same enemies every time, but your goal will be different depending on the mission you take. You might have to gather certain items, destroy a certain object, rescue hostages, clear an area of enemies, kill a boss, and so on. All of these missions also have a time limit, so you can't just take your sweet time looking around, but you'll pretty quickly learn the levels and enemies as you run missions in the areas. All of these are elements pulled right out of Monster Hunter really.\n\nWhat's somewhat different is the crafting. Yes, you go out, gather materials, and them come back to base and cough up some resources and cash to get new equipment. That's the same as Monster Hunter. Where it differs is the depth of customization in your weapon. You get to mix and match parts of your gun to produce different stats and behavior, so you can take a magnum and stick machine gun parts on it if you wish to do so. That said, in reality, what you've really got is a pistol, a machine gun, a burst rifle, a shotgun, and a homing missile launcher, and beyond that you'll just be tweaking stats to manage reload times, reload ease (the game uses an active reload system that can give you a 10% damage boost if you do it perfectly), accuracy, damage, ammo capacity (before reloading, you have infinite ammo otherwise), fire rate, weight, and bullet propeties (homing, elemental, bursting into smaller projectiles, scatter shot, large size, and rebounding). It's actually pretty simple, but there's certainly some joy in tweaking your weapon to suit the situation or match your play style.\n\nNow let's talk about enemies. The enemies in the game all follow very simple behavior patterns, including the bosses, and there's not generally many of them on screen at once. The game certainly has some difficulty when you first encounter enemies and don't know what to expect, but once you learn them it does become somewhat repetative. After all, you're going to be fighting the same enemies on the same levels quite a bit. Nonetheless, I certainly find some joy in being able to rush through levels that I once had difficulty with. That said, as said, the bosses are pretty simple too, so while this game share a whole lot in common with Monster Hunter, don't expect to get the same feeling of accomplishment from downing a tough big bad, because there's nothing quite that scale here.\n\n\nIn any case, the game is pretty fun, but just keep in mind that it's really a Monster Hunter styled game, and that means you're going to spend a whole lot of time looking at the same scenery and fighting the same enemies. If you want an arcade action game with a bunch of hectic levels, this isn't it.","March 28, 2014","true","40.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The shooting mechanics are decent, but not perfect. For instance, you can't shoot upwards while moving, which feels unintuitive and confining. There are also some irritating things about the way the menus work that should clearly be changed, but this stuff is minor compared to the main flaws...\n\nAs much as I am growing sick of games about collecting and crafting, I think I would actually enjoy collecting materials in this game, if it weren't for the fact that enemies respawn in EXACTLY the same spot. And I don't mean the same spot every time you play the mission, or even every 30 seconds, I mean as soon as their spawn is off screen. This does two terrible things: it forces you to manage the screen's position or risk being mobbed by the same enemies repeatedly, and it makes material collection extremely trivial. For example, the first mission I played was in the hunting grounds, to acquire two pelts. This doesn't mean exploring the map like it should. What it means is knowing where one fox spawns, then repeatedly trying to kill it before it RUNS FIVE FEET AND DISAPPEARS FOR NO REASON. Then I move to one side and run back and do the same thing again until the mission ends.\n\nIf I can bring myself to continue the game, I can't imagine changing my opinion later on. As others have said, this is a game that's ultimately about grinding for materials and crafting, but that one single design choice completely undermines that. Enemies need to spawn in random locations, and they probably need to NOT RESPAWN AT ALL during a single mission. Even if the overall amount of content in the game is limited, I believe those two changes would make the game infinitely more playable than it is. As things stand, I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone.\n\nIf the game could be heavily redesigned from what it is, I could see it improving in one of two ways. The first would be to have more authored content, distinct levels that were meant to be played in a linear way from start to finish, but could be repeated to collect more ingredients, money, etc. In Metal Slug, I played those levels over and over for no reason except that they were fun. By comparison, I get bored of a Mercenary Kings level before I even finish it once, because it's so stagnant.\n\nThe second option would've been to move towards heavier randomization, perhaps procedural areas that would mean not repeating content at all, but could perhaps result in less interesting levels. But even in its current state, the only thing that needs to change to vastly improve this game is the enemy spawns, which seems like a totally doable change to me, though it'd be a fair amount of work to rebalance objectives and alter the enemy spawns to suit it. But IMO, it needs to be done or the game is not worth playing. Which is a shame, because there is a lot of stuff to like about it.\n\n","July 26, 2015","false","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It has a great retro aesthetic that moves and feels like an SNK classic. The most obvious comparison being Metal Slug of course. The music is good as well and captures that same era perfectly and is generally catchy and unobtrusive.\n\nMissions are boring and styled after MMO/RPG cliches of kill so many of this, gather so many of that, etc. and the big kicker is you can't double up on missions. Each one must be completed separately which wouldn't be unbearable if the game didn't re-use the -exact- same map for 10 or so missions. Meaning that you see the same map, with the same infinity re spawning enemies, far too much. Especially since there isn't much in the way of enemy variety nor are enemies challenging or satifying to eliminate. Even bosses are a bit of a bore considering the slower paced nature of the combat and the GoW style active reload system. Which in a better developed or more fully realized combat system would be extremely satisfying.\n\nThe game also makes a big deal out of the different gun parts and plethora of combinations possible but the sad truth is most are pretty worthless and to be frankly honest a base nearly unmodified pistol will do just as well as a custom designed toilet/saxophone/chaingun. Which sort of misses the entire point doesn't it?\n\nAll in all what could have been an excellent 2D  hybrid of Borderlands/Metal Slug/Contra became a tired chore of repetition.

It is like that cool game you heard about but never played. Like you cousin told you about the NES Metal Gear's plot, and you thought it would play like Contra. You also made it look cooler than it ever would on the NES. You made the perfect game a violent 11 year old would want to play in the 90's. Not one a violent 11 year old would make, but one they would play. This game is pretty polished, even though it has a little to much grinding. Also this game really is not like Metal Slug at all, it's like Contra. Sure the art style and sprites are similar, but the game play is more like Contra with slower (not slow) gameplay than Metal Slug. Also despite all the different levels, you will play the same levels with the same robots, and the same backgrounds over and over again. This makes the game loses a lot of its luster long before you can actually finish the game. Some of the ideas are interesting, the hunting, the upgrades to the guns, and the supporting characters. These all have flaws though. The hunting is repetative and gives few real rewards. The upgrades are confusing, with some bullets not working after you change one part of you gun. The supporting charaters are basically just fun one-liner machines, and while I like them they should have more lines, or somethings. Currently they just feel very repetative. That really is the main flaw of the game, how repetative it is.  It should have had a few things cut, or more levels and enemies. It should provide hours of fun though.","May 3, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

All the old school charm, but none of the crappy controls. You get to build your own custom guns, upgrade your merc, and they didn't phone in the level content. I'm looking forward to trying the multiplayer.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind. This game is a chore. The gun thing is fine, but there is not as much customization as you might think. Most combinations just make crap guns. In order to use special ammo, you pretty much have to use parts wou may not want or that may take away aspects of the gun you like. I suppose this was done to keep people from making caustic longrang auto shotguns or something. The reload mechanic is alright. I still love the art and the gameplay is tight, but man the boss fights generally suck. Not the challenge or the pattern or the attacks! All that is fine! The problem is that they change locations. You pretty much get the first encounter to defeat them and if you don't smack them completely, in the first go, they flee to another part of the map, immediately spawn (if someone is there or not) and start going through their pattern. By the time you get to the location where they spawned, you get a few prescious seconds to attack them before they flee again. Now, you could leave the game running where they last spawned and eventually they will come back to that location, but that is boreing. So basically, it is a lame dynamic that greatly detracts from the game.\n\nThis is not just one boss- but one boss they use over an over again.\n\nAlso, the massive amount of levels are mostly repeats. I could have done with a more cogent/crafted set of story driven levels, one leading to the other, or an open world, or a big overworld map, but this constant revisiting of places I just wooped up on and finding them completely repopulated with bosses that flee and hostages and all that . . . jeez. This little war is being severely mismanaged. I understand that he is cloning soldiers and repopulating the levels, but come on! The same levels over and over again? Why not hit the cloning facility ASAP! Cut off supplies to the facility, sabotage the AA guns, drop some mercs in over the wall with that heli (or use a teleporter) and  de-CLAW the general! You have time to think about these things as you are running through a level for the 16th time chasing a coward in a jet.\n\nThe fix? Make more of the repeat levels optional and make the bosses only spawn in their next location when a player actually shows up there. That should only require an if/then check to see if a merc is in the battle area! Again, the game could be a lot of fun, but it is a chore, and thus, not fun. The more I play it the more I am disapointed, but I'll eventually finish just becasue I like Paul Robertson's art style and the action is pretty good.\n\nNiche fanbase.","November 18, 2013","true","23.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, it plays more like Mega Man. You have a life bar so you don't have to play perfectly, and there's a little more platforming than a Slug game. No insta-death traps or pits, which is nice. It's got that Gears of War reload action bar; can add tension or be a distraction in the heat of the moment. All around, gameplay's pretty solid if not easy to a Mega Man veteran.\n\n100 stages is misleading; it's really 100 missions spread over a handful of branching-path areas that are reused. You'll see the same zones multiple times. Good for getting familiar with the terrain, but revisiting the same places gets repetitive.\n\nDowned enemies can drop materials that're used for gun/knife/perk crafting. And there's lots of gun parts to craft. Some are interesting, others seem nearly identical stat-wise. Gathering rare mats can kinda suck, but it gives you more to do in-game than just run 'n gun all the time.\n\nBoth local and online multiplayer available.  Haven't tried either one, but hear it's good.  When picked up, crafting mats are given to everyone (though the resultant item can be different from player-to-player due to individual perks) so no ninja looting required.\n\nThere are bugs that need squashing. They'll be tweaking and adjusting gameplay/menus/UI. There's a lack of challenge for some.  It's missing a compelling reason to keep playing besides a basic story and unlocking new craftables.  But in an unfinished state, it's not bad and will only get better. Can't fully recommend it yet, nor would I discourage anyone to try it out if they like this style of game.  At the very least, it's worth keeping an eye on for the future.\n\n#1 tip: Utilize dat map!!\n\n#2 tip: Magazine size affects your gun's power. Big mags, low damage. Small mags, death machine that needs constant reloading.","July 26, 2013","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As much as it tries to paint itself out to be run and gun, it simply isn't. Too often you're forced to stop to jump kill an enemy, or wait for 3 or more cycles of a shield trying to kill you while you try and kill it. A vast majority of the enemies are simply slow moving or didn't move at all. I felt like I was grinding the beginnings of an MMO with no story.\n\nPlaying this game without a controller is hard and playing full screen hurts my eyes (that's less to do with the game and more the 2D medium.)\n\nThe pros are the customizablity that comes with the game. It was an unexpected twist to an old classic.\n\nSorry Tribute Games, I'm struggling to get past the first 45 minutes, and I doubt I'll give it the play time to see if it gets better.

First of all I have'nt played metal slug "don't scream at me" but I can still relate this game to monster hunter which I have played. The game has amazing audio and the art style is great. I never say "this music again" or "that drone is so annoying". The concept is nice but the story is meh. You go on missions with various objectives which sometimes can be unclear but don't give up. As you complete missions you advance on to new tiers that unlock new gun parts, knives, and progress you through the story. The best part is creating your own weapons. The wepon parts are divided into 6 parts, reciever, stock, barrel, magazine, sight, and ammo. Also there are different types of weapons like smgs, shotguns, snipers, magnums, and so on and so forth. You can mix and match or you can make a 100% shotgun to craft unique ammo only for shotguns. If you get 100% or over on a weapon type you can craft new ammo for it. And multiplayer too! There is 4 player co-op and it is a ton more fun with friends. Sometimes this game can get rather boring though, as many of the missions are rince and repeat but it keeps me going because I am always looking to improve my gear and unlocking new areas.

Now go away, I wanna keep playing it."\n\nMercenary Kings is hand drawn pixel art at its finest, brought to you by the same folks who rendered the Scott Pilgrim game. The art alone is enough to gawk at, making expert use of animations, sprites, silhouettes and the like. What's important about it, and why it deserves such attention, is because that EVERY pixel was lovingly and knowingly placed to give Mercenary Kings a very distinct look and feel.\n\nThe plus side is that when you start putting that much effort into every pixel, you start to care about where they're all going - the controls in this game are tight and responsive, especially if you play with a game controller. Layered on top of this are several fun and exhaustive features, including but not limited to active reloading, collectibles, and a unique brand of rocket jumping that involves a minigun.\n\nWhere Mercenary Kings falls short, however, is in its pacing and length. The game has a lot to offer, A LOT, and one might even argue it has a bit too much. Grinding drops for better gear isn't always a bad thing, but it can get tedious mission after mission during the long campaign of the game. What's more, the formula doesn't change much over its course, so in time the game itself can feel like a grind.\n\nHowever, all in all, this is action gaming done correctly. While the metroidvania genre only recognizes two games, it's important to know that Contra, Megaman, and more added a worthy third style of game to the mix that involves a few more guns - Mercenary Kings is the pinnacle of that.","June 22, 2014","true","16.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It will. It just will.\n\nMercenary Kings is, at its core, a perfect blend of Contra, Metal Slug, and Monster Hunter, all represented with stunningly crafted sprites and an artstyle that is just amazing. The gameplay is satisfying and precise like Contra, from the shooting to the platforming and the controls. On top of that, it has the addictive collecting and crafting of Monster Hunter. You will find yourself unable to stop as you want to collect more items to personalize your character.\n\nThe personalization is top notch. Weapon customization is absurdly awesome. There are tons of options to mix and match to create a gun that really fits your play-style, and all of them are very well-balanced. You could spend hours just trying out all of the combinations to see what you like best.\n\nThe game is currently in alpha, but it has a level of polish like no other early access game I've seen. It is fully playable with seemingly no bugs in sight. Its truly astonishing - I really feel they could have called the game finished already, but nevertheless they are still cranking out updates for it, so don't let that "early access" label scare you off.\n\nAll in all, I was pleasantly surprised at just how fun this game was. Playing this game has actually gotten me to say "Wow, this is fun" out loud, something that not many games can do. I was hoping for some fun, Contra-styled platforming - and this game did more than deliver.","February 23, 2014","true","14.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjaSnarl/recommended/218820/","NinjaSnarl","NinjaSnarl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NinjaSnarl/","372 products in account","I wish I could recommend this game, but I really, really can't.  The controls are sluggish, jumping is floaty and aggravatingly unresponsive, weapons either take too long to kill something or spend too much time reloading, and the entire experience is a slow-moving slog.\n\nThe underlying issue with this game is that EVERYTHING is designed to take far too long or is intentionally tedious.  There are many missions with mission timers 25 minutes longer or more, with the goal of just scouring each and every room to find weapon parts.  If this sounds like MMO fetch quests, you're right, and these missions are just as grindy, made even worse by the fact that you will do them on maps where you have ALREADY been through the map 4-5 times already.\n\nMovement speed?  Way too slow, even with light weapons.  Even the firing mode is lousy, giving you a pathetic 4 firing directions instead of the bog-standard 360-degree joystick- or mouse-based method that has been around for decades now.  The view frame is much too zoomed-in, meaning you frequently can't see where you're going, causing you to blunder into enemies or traps, as well as triggering incredibly excessive amounts of off-screen enemy respawns.  Map layouts range from mediocre to aggravating, with a great many paths hanging just over your head that you can't access unless you walk halfway across the map to a ladder or something.\n\nThe customizable weapons system SEEMED interesting at first, but it's both poorly balanced and based on grinding out items to get the items to make decent parts.  Machine guns have low damage and high magazines, making dealing with many standard enemies, and especially several bosses that have only limited vulnerability, very tedious.  Shotguns deal huge damage and have low magazines, with their "balance" mechanism being semi-auto firing; this means you spend HUGE amounts of time mashing the fire button, which is just plain ridiculous when they could have easily just left the shotguns as full-auto weapons for the simple sake of ENJOYMENT.  On top of that, many of the parts look different, but have minimal performance differences.  And even the bullet types are blocked off by forcing you to have the right level of compatibility with your current weapon parts, so custom weapon diversity is severely curtailed if you ever want to use different ammo types.\n\nThere are also dozens of missions, but without much actual variety.  Go fetch these crafting items, kill X soldiers in area Y, destroy this thing, and hostage rescue is about it, with maps recycled CONSTANTLY.  There is a severe mission bloat, with you doing the exact same things over and over and over again on the same levels to make the game seem longer/bigger than it is.\n\nThe perk system is also pretty poor.  Unless you enjoy scouring recycled maps for boss/target locations, you'll just end up slapping up on the perk that puts targets on your map, which, in other games, would be part of the standard game design anyway and you wouldn't need any sort of silly perk to see them.  The roll maneuver is almost entirely useless until you can get a perk to give it invincibility which, again, should've been a completely standard thing anyway.\n\nI could honestly go on, but it would just be redundant.  The artwork looks solid, but the game itself is mediocre and entirely third-rate, suffering from a whole raft of fun-robbing design choices.  Basically, unless you legitimately enjoy grinding out item collection for MMO-esque "make this weapon that is sliiiightly better than your current one", skip this game and just get the Metal Slug games.","June 7, 2014","false","11.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

In reality the game is pretty open, dropping you a large map with no guidance where to go. The missions are often fetch quests, leaving you to, completly at random, stumble upon whatever it is you're required to find. The in game map doesn't record where you've been, or where objectives are.\n\nAddded to this unfocussed gameplay, is the odd addition of Gears of War style 'active reload', which is just an annoyance, surprisingly bland and forgettable music, and a needlessly complex weapon upgrade system.\n\nIt all just feels like a bit of a mess, and is simply dull to play.

It looks great and the premise gives off the vibe that it's going to play like a Metal Slug, Contra or any other fast-paced 2D action shooter.  It doesn't and almost every aspect of the gameplay is poor.\n\nYou'll notice immediately the intentional jump delay.  I don't know why the devs were so tied into this mechanic, it's terrible in this type of game.  You can get away with deliberate jumping in some titles, but not this one.  The jump delay makes the game feel so off.  MK also has reloading.  Why?  I don't know and having to reload constantly brings nothing positive to the game.  There's also the issue that you have to press down to pick up items, and you'll have to pick up items constantly and it breaks any flow the game manages to create.  I wish the whole crafting angle wasn't even a thing because it doesn't appeal to me in the least and from I've read, it's not any good even if you're into crafting.\n\nSupposedly the game is super repetitive and grindy as well, but I didn't last long enough to find out.  If you're looking for some fasted-paced 2D shooting action on PC, you're much better off with the Metal Slug ports, even though DotEmu didn't exactly do a great job on them.","November 14, 2015","false","3.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

I play with the keyboard and don't like the controls, they don't feel natural and so I really had to get used to them. The missions are not very challenging more so annoying if anything. You just go around the map and have to collect a certain number of this or kill a certain number of that. The maps themselves are the same ones over and over again, there are maybe three different maps in total. The game gets really repetitive at least for me. One good thing though is that you have a lot of missions, I've played for about 6 hours and still haven't completed all the recruit missions and that is just the start. I really like how you can craft weapons with the materials you pick up, allowing you to make some pretty awesome and overpowered guns. The knives aren't worth buying, they don't give you much more damage than the one you start out with, and you will be using your gun for the majority of the time anyways since there is no limit to bullets, you just have to reload. All in all the game is pretty mediocre, it's pretty fun for the first couple of hours but gets boring quite quickly and I can't help feeling like I could be spending my time playing something more enjoyable.","September 24, 2014","false","7.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The fact that there are timers in it didn't help either because it forces you to speed things up and in the process get yourself killed.

Mercenary Kings (MK) does borrow a lot from SNK's long running series (like rescuing hostages that say "Thank You!" after or the general look of the game), but it also borrows ideas from other games, like Metroid, Metal Gear Solid, and Contra.\n\nMK is best played through local co-op, at least so far to me. I haven't played it online with other folks, just my girlfriend and so far we're hooked. For a $10 game (on sale), I've squeezed 20 hours of gameplay out of it and we're not even half way done with all of the objectives. We're having a blast playing this -- splitting up on missions to accomplish multiple objectives efficiently or teaming together to take down a nasty boss. It's very fun.\n\nThe music is really catchy as hell, too. Has that NES/Genesis vibe to it and you'll be humming the songs in this game at work every day because they get stuck in your head. The art direction is really nice, too. If you liked Scott Pilgrim The Game, this is up your alley.\n\nEven at full price of $20, MK is worth the admission.

For what Mercenary Kings offers in terms of gameplay, the art style matches up nicely and makes the game feel cohesive.\n\n- Mercenary Kings offers a plethora of weapon customization options. The abundance of options enticed me to spend hours mixing and matching parts across different weapon categories in order to perfect a gun suited to my specific play style.\n\n- Surprisingly, the game has a entertaining story with multiple twists. Mercenary Kings was definitely improved by this because it justified playing through the absurd amount of story missions (112 unique missions in total) in order to reach the conclusion.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- I loathed how Mercenary Kings portrayed their women antagonists and protagonists. The overt objectification only served to reflect that the designers are out of touch with where modern audiences are in terms of gender relations.\n\n- The mission structures, goals, and levels in Mercenary Kings are extremely repetitive. While the goal might change between missions, you’re frequently placed in the same level to achieve this objective. Additionally, the objectives also lacked diversity - for example, often you’re collecting an object, neutralizing an enemy, or capturing a specific enemy.  Unquestionably, the central problem of Mercenary Kings is quantity over quality.\n\nIn order to acquire the necessary number of parts to construct banners, ornaments, gun parts, knife parts, and mods you’ll have to grind far too much.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nMercenary Kings looks like a Metal Slug clone (this is actually the reason I bought it without first researching the game), but it is far from that. The gameplay is much slower, and the RPG elements take center stage as opposed to a straightforward shoot ‘em up action adventure. I can’t recommend this game at full price. I purchased this game for 1.00 (humblebundle), and I had fun, but after the first ten to twenty hours it became an endeavor to simply complete the game. However, because of what I paid, I didn’t feel cheated.\n\n6/10.\n","September 14, 2015","true","45.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Want to make a machine gun that shoots wall piercing rounds or a pistol that shoots guided missiles that split on contact?\nWell... you can.\n\nThe gameplay is really good, movement, jumping and shooting feels really nice. The jump in this game requires some commitment since its hard to change directions once airborne, kinda like classic castlevanias but not that extreme.\n\nThe Bosses feel good to be taken down and have a nice variety (not counting color swaps), and thats nice since you will probably be fighting them more than a couple of times for its drops.\n\nThis is an awesome game if you dont expect it to be a metal slug clone.

Can safely say it is a great multiplayer game with some actual balance between all the kinds of guns you can make.  Challenging platforming action, hilarious writing, and cartoony graphics are all in this quality package.\n\nHowever, beware the way multiplayer is handled.  Enemies seemed to spawn based on the host player's location, so as a guest in the game, enemies would oftentimes appear out of nowhere or teleport around the area, resulting in free hits.

What’s harder is to give it a twist that makes it a game of it’s own. In Mercenary Kings you craft weapons, armor and mods with loot you pick off of enemies. This is not just for giggles though, the game is hard and you need to craft your own chance at winning.\n\nPlaying as a team of up to four is a lot of fun, but the scenery is repetitive and even annoying when you are trying to kill a boss and he runs off into another part of the map.\n\nAwesome art and funny dialogue in a somewhat monotonous gameplay. But it is still in development, so it has a lot of potential.\n\n7 slugs out of 10.","May 25, 2015","true","6.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I figured "Hey, it looks like fun, it's multiplayer, and it looks similar to Metal Slug" In some regards it is, but in others, it's a whole other beast. First, I'll draw the similarities.\n\nWhen you first start up Mercenary Kings, you'll notice, "Hey, this plays a lot like Metal Slug" (if you're familiar with the series). Controls are a little strange at first, though I'd recommend changing them, but once you get down to the nitty-gritty stabby-shooty, you don't seem to notice as much. There's the familiar, arcade-style run-and-gun type gameplay that you'd expect from the screenshots, but what really makes this game unique is the differences from which the game breaks the stereotype.\n\nThe crafting system is extensive that sometimes it can be overwhelming, but if you're the type that loves to tinker around and figure out what works best (which varies, depending on the mission), or if you fancy yourself a virtual gunsmith, then you will love this crafting system. A few RPG elements are added in that there are a few stats to keep in balance as you prepare for each mission, but other than that, there's not too much else to the game. I do, however, really like the way multiplayer (both local, on one machine, or over the Internet) is handled. From the in-game base camp, players can join their friends or find other players online and team up to accomplish missions seamlessly (think drop-in/drop-out style, but only for this one area).\n\n\nIn short:\n\nPROS:\nExcellent and fun selection of weapons\nFamiliar gameplay style feels fresh\nSeamless multiplayer matchmaking - You can find a team rather quickly, and if they leave you, there's no penalties to you. (A big bonus!)\nLots of pew pew pew\n\nCONS:\nControls can be a bit awkward at first. I felt like a noob who never played arcade games before\nCrafting system can be a mite overwhelming for players who just want to jump into the game\nMissions can be repetitive if you're grinding for crafting materials\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game, it was worth every penny.","May 31, 2014","true","95.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

In my opinion this title is best described as a mix of Mega Man and Monster Hunters all while being skinned to have the appearance of Metal Slug. If you don't have a friend(s) to play this with the missions can definitely seem less fun and  more drawn out as you will have to do all aspects of a mission by yourself. Even with that being said, you will probably still feel like a savage when you have killed two bosses, saved all the hostages, and set a new fastest time all in a single solo mission. Nontheless, having competent team mates is awesome and the most fun experience as the multiplayer is where this game truly shines. Mainly because of the fact you can split up to wreck missions more aggressively and faster since you will be able to cover the various terrains more strategically, and more efficiently overall. Like they say, "four brains is better than one" lol.\n\nMy only true gripe with this game is its lack of controller configuration. I personally play this game  on a Fightstick (arcade styled joystick). So while my controller worked right out of the gate the button layout was all wrong. JoytoKey and Xpadder would usually fix a problem like this, but for this game it doesn't. The game will just continue to read the controller inputs and the keyboard inputs at the same time which will make you have binded actions you literally don't want. To fix this I actually had to go into the .CFG file this game made for my controller and switch around the button ID which took forever to figure out, This should be fixed honestly! Tribute Games just let us configure our buttons properly not just our keyboards please. Also, since I dont have a "right stick"  on my controller of choice I can't scroll the map either lmao. Another way to scroll the map would be nice too.\n\nEven with the controller and map issue I am having. I still have a blast running and gunning destroying everything in site, finding rare items and feeling like a super bad ♥♥♥ savage when my friends and I are all doing different things at the same time to bring a mission together like a true Mercenary. The better your weapon, and the more efficient your skills, the more fun you begin to have! Scrubs need not apply.

That all.\n\n-Sweet, SWEET "American Heroes" Theme game!!! Merceneries Kings Versus the Evil Army CLAW!!!!!! Cliche as f*ck, but for that reason is enjoyable.\n\n-The Empress is my waifu. Sorry King....[I'm not].\n\n-Metal Gear Solid Codec Transmission style. I love this game already.\n\n-The camp you and your fellow Team members use, is a nice break from the missions you accomplice.\n\n-OOooOOooooOohhh yeah!!! Lots of Guns and Knifes for you to use to annihilate your enemy! Also you can spend hours to create your own personal Gun. Who wants to use a Toilet-Snake Shotgun :3? Me, me, me!!!!!\n\n-Music......Oooh the music man!!!!! Is SO enjoyable I literally go to youtube to hear them all the time [my pleaser, my sin]. My favourite is this one. Just listen:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dadZJ5OQ0RY\n\nJesus the song is so damn good!!!\n\n-Good enemy and Bosses variety. From normal military soldiers to Giant Robot Dogs controlled by a dog with a eyepatch!!!\n\n-By the way, Eyepatch dog controlling a Giant Robot Dog is a Plus.\n\n-Enjoyable Death animations of your enemies!!!\n\n-Kickstarter Backers you must save from the hands of CLAW!!!! I love them for backing this game!!!\n\n-All the Map from the Missions are Gigantic and you will play them multiple times. However all the missions have specific routes you must strictly follow so you can finish your mission. Not because is the game linear, the opposite, you are free to explore the whole map if you like. The reason is the time limit you have.\nThe combination of Time limit  and the smart use of the map to complete a mission, is a perfect dose of adrenaline to make bumped with excitement. Music help a lot too.\n\n-Some interesting Cameos from other Videogames.\n\n-A giant secret you can find while you are hunting innocent animals :)\n\n[Cons]\n\n-Very cool Knifes for you to use, but sadly I didn't use them very often. Honestly, I only bought two knifes....I used them for the robot Dog Boss Fight.\n\n-Sometimes you must be very precise with your jumps. A failed jump, maybe cause you to lose precious time....\n\n-The concept to create your own weapon is cool, but only for a while. You will realised soon you will only buy the gun part to power your weapon, not to make it more beatiful. I am a little sad about that :(\n\n-The grinding for materials is painful sometimes if you want to create a specific weapon......\n\n-Random Spawing Spot of the Boss. Why the f*ck I need to seek the Boss in a Giant Map? Why? At least you will realised if you call a secret agent, he can tell you where the boss is.\n\n-My Biggest Problem of the game: If you don't kill the Boss quickly, the Boss will leave and find another spot in the Map....WTF!!!! Why did you put that gameplay merchanic here?!?!? Do you think I have the patience to run over the Map all over again just to continue a fight with the Boss?!?!?!? NNNNNNNOOOOOO!!!!!\n\n-Oh! And hear the best part!!!! If you are late to find the Boss in time to fight it once more, guess what? IT WILL LEAVE AGAIN TO FIND ANOTHER SPOT!!!!!! F*ck you game. I love you, but f*ck you!!!!\n\n-And guess what again!!!! If you combine the above with the limited time you have to finish a mission......you must play the mission again!!!!! I feel so much joy to play a mission for over 30 minutes again because the Boss was moving all the time like he was a tourist......NOT!!!!!!!!!!! -2 point!!!!!\n\n-Oh! I didn't expect that........what a twist.......*sarcasm*.\nThe twist was so painful obvious [for me], it was painful even for this kind of game...\n\n[Final Thoughts]\n\nA very good Platform-Action game which obviously loved by its developers and of course by the backers of Kickstarter. The Pixel art and Animation are top notch, the music great, the action delightful. I highly suggested for the people who love games like Metal Slug or Contra.\nSadly I must warn you: Even if the Boss Fights are awesome, it is VERY frustrating to hunt them down just only to finish fight them....I hope in a sequel the developers remove this gameplay mechanic entirely from the game. This is also my personal reason why the game doesn't have high score....\nBut I digress, it is still a great game.

Neither the steam page nor any gameplay video, now or prior to its full release, ever promoted this game as being similar to Metal Slug.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's come out and say what it is: this is Mega Man x Monster Hunter. The controls, level design, enemies, and gameplay are all explicitly cribbed from Mega Man, while the mission design, gear crafting progression, and boss mechanics are lifted from Monster Hunter. You accept a mission, from something as mundane as killing a couple mooks, to hunting two of a particular boss, and you're dropped into the level with the supplies you've brought with you. Certain supplies can be gathered in the field, as can materials, and you traverse the rather sizable level completing your objective, after which you return to base, where you resupply, craft guns, knives, and skills, and select a new mission. Much like Monster Hunter, this game encourages cooperative play, so rev up the online or bring along a friend, or you're quickly going to find yourself frustrated by how long later missions take to complete.\n\nIf that sounds at all appealing to you, by all means, pick it up. You could easily squeeze at least 20 hours out of it, and it's an excellent couch co-op title.","December 30, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game plays very similarly to Metal Slug and games of that nature but with a bit more forgiveness. Gameplay's pretty standard and fun without too much innovation in terms of controls and whatnot but what keeps it interesting is the customizable weapons. You completely customize your loadout with 6 different weapon parts at any given time that have different stats that affect how your character plays. Will you take a handgun with only 2 parts and be super fast and agile but with limited firepower? Will you take a huge minigun with tons of ammo that pierces walls and completely destroys things before it gets on screen with the side-effects of moving slower than a slug in molasses? The entire game revolves around finding loot to craft new weapons and mods that change how you play your character. It works extremely well because of the focus that it has on variety and uniqueness to each weapon. It's not perfectly balanced yet but it's still in development so it's not an issue. An excellent game that really gets the visceral fun of just raining bullets down pat.","November 26, 2013","true","29.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can find resources during missions, use them to create new gun parts, then customize your gun in any way you choose! The difficulty curve of the missions also scales rather well, providing a decent challenge for players as they progress.

The murmurs of the game being grindy and tedious are unfortunately true. The game is mission based. You pick a mission from your starting camp and load into the area to complete the mission. All missions are quite repetitive as they are either; save hostage(s), find and talk to npc, gather resources, find and kill/capture character. It didn't take me long before becoming bored at the tasks i was given.\n\nAll the areas are for the most part the same with the exception of where certain objectives are placed. Typically the areas took upon the same variation of an industrial warehouse.\n\nThere is customizing in the form of guns. This is the most interesting aspect of the game. You can rearrange an assortment of gun parts together to create some rather amusing but effective guns. Although acquiring new gun parts requires you to finish a chapter of missions. These missions again are chore to go through as it seems you're constantly doing the same thing.\n\nThere is crafting which consists of gun parts, passive perks you can wear, and a few other items. To craft you gather resources dropped by enemies or found in crates along the progress of your mission.\n\nOther than the graphic style and gun customization there isn't much else to this game. The areas are bland and lacking variety. The missions are highly repetitive, laborious, and uninspired. I had fun initially, but quickly noticed the flaws that became harder to overlook and enjoy the game. I would only advise those interested to purchase on a sale.","July 5, 2014","false","4.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

Bought this game with the intentions of playing with a friend, but even from the get-go (And all the way up till the end boss) I had nagging issues that continued to hamper my experience with the game.\n\nThe foremost offender is the incredibly awkward controlling.  Characters react based on how heavy their weapons are, but even with light equipment, jumps can be incredibly pixel percise with a slow reaction to pressing the jump button.   This becomes incredibly annoying on bosses that rush from side to side on the screen, and you think you press the button early enough only to have the wind up time keep you from clearing your foe.  Aiming can also be an issue when trying to shoot smaller enemies that move through the air (Not to mention chase you after the camera changes and moves them off screen), theres no way to shoot diagonally which means you'll have to constantly run under vertical enemies to hit them or lead them into your shots.\n\nAs you get further in, you notice that the mission strcutres all fall into the same few catagories:  Find stuff or kill/capture stuff.  It becomes more tedious in the latter half of the game as the levels expand, leaving you and your friend(s) to traverse large boring structures with occasionally respawning enemies that even with high health and defense items, can still tear away large portions of your health.  And with limited carrying space for items, trying to heal in our outside the hospital zones can be incredibly tedious as there's no ingame way to speed up the hospital healing process.  I suppose thats why most missions have extra long times (Anywhere between 15-30 minutes usually), but it just bogs down the experience.  The bosses are far to repetitive too, having to face the same lot multiple times across the games ranked missions and an occaisonal unique boss at the end of most ranks.\n\nThe weapon crafting is an excercise in patience, having to always constantly change out one gun trait for another, taking time in order to get anywhere close to a satisfying weapon.  More so, since the crafting system relies on the materials you find in the stage, you may be forced to run back into earlier levels and hope that enemies respawn AND drop the items you're looking for.\n\nIf I'm pressed to say anything positive about it, the presentation has a nice psuedo-Metal Slug/SNK feel thats still unique enough to be a full rip off, and the music often catchy.  But thats not enough to get a recommendation here, its just not fleshed out enough to be fun either by yourself or with friends.","July 17, 2014","false","16.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Defeinitely gets repetitive quickly, though.\n\n\nRight away this game kinda jumps back to some older gameplay styles, it's highly intuitive. It teaches you some of the base mechanics right away in the intro, but it doesn't really give you the whole bag, it kinda makes you figure the rest out, which I personally enjoyed. There were a lot of "I can do that?!" moments throughout gameplay.\n\nThe platforming works really well, and the controls feel responsive enough. The design is a real eye catch, everything is gorgeous and so lovelingly animated. It's highly reminiscent of Metal Slug in a lot of ways. The actually gameplay feels a lot like MS, and the atmosphere is similar in a lot of ways too. I actually started to pick up a few silly references to MS, and other games similar, including Metal Gear Solid.\n\nBoss fights at first were kind of a pain in the ♥♥♥, though once I got the swing of things, they again became very intuitive and doable. They brought a Monster Hunter feel to it in how you had to track the bosses around the map.\n\nLast good note I'm giving is the weapon crafting system. That ♥♥♥♥'s fun. Nothing gives a more personal feel to combat when you yourself had to scrounge up the pieces and put together your own weapon. Their are so many different pieces, and it's all together a very nice touch. It could have easily been replaced with weapon drops and no one would have noticed, and that shows the care put into making this.\n\nNow onto the negative: It's REALLY ♥♥♥♥ing repetitive. You have set stages per rank of mission and you keep going back to those same maps continuously. This was kind of my deal on Peace Walker, though it wasn't nearly as bad there since the maps cycled more frequently. Here, you end up dealing with the same map per chapter.\n\nLast thing I'm gonna mention, I saw a few rags on storyline. I kinda didn't feel like the story was all that important here, given you're a mercenary. The characters all had a bit of personality, and your actions felt like they mattered to the world, so it was good to me.\n\nTo conclude, 8/10 would recommend.\n","August 1, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For what Mercenary Kings offers in terms of gameplay, the art style matches up nicely and makes the game feel cohesive.\n\n- Mercenary Kings offers a plethora of weapon customization options. The abundance of options enticed me to spend hours mixing and matching parts across different weapon categories in order to perfect a gun suited to my specific play style.\n\n- Surprisingly, the game has a entertaining story with multiple twists. Mercenary Kings was definitely improved by this because it justified playing through the absurd amount of story missions (112 unique missions in total) in order to reach the conclusion.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- I loathed how Mercenary Kings portrayed their women antagonists and protagonists. The overt objectification only served to reflect that the designers are out of touch with where modern audiences are in terms of gender relations.\n\n- The mission structures, goals, and levels in Mercenary Kings are extremely repetitive. While the goal might change between missions, you’re frequently placed in the same level to achieve this objective. Additionally, the objectives also lacked diversity - for example, often you’re collecting an object, neutralizing an enemy, or capturing a specific enemy.  Unquestionably, the central problem of Mercenary Kings is quantity over quality.\n\nIn order to acquire the necessary number of parts to construct banners, ornaments, gun parts, knife parts, and mods you’ll have to grind far too much.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nMercenary Kings looks like a Metal Slug clone (this is actually the reason I bought it without first researching the game), but it is far from that. The gameplay is much slower, and the RPG elements take center stage as opposed to a straightforward shoot ‘em up action adventure. I can’t recommend this game at full price. I purchased this game for 1.00 (humblebundle), and I had fun, but after the first ten to twenty hours it became an endeavor to simply complete the game. However, because of what I paid, I didn’t feel cheated.\n\n6/10.\n","September 14, 2015","true","45.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Want to make a machine gun that shoots wall piercing rounds or a pistol that shoots guided missiles that split on contact?\nWell... you can.\n\nThe gameplay is really good, movement, jumping and shooting feels really nice. The jump in this game requires some commitment since its hard to change directions once airborne, kinda like classic castlevanias but not that extreme.\n\nThe Bosses feel good to be taken down and have a nice variety (not counting color swaps), and thats nice since you will probably be fighting them more than a couple of times for its drops.\n\nThis is an awesome game if you dont expect it to be a metal slug clone.

What’s harder is to give it a twist that makes it a game of it’s own. In Mercenary Kings you craft weapons, armor and mods with loot you pick off of enemies. This is not just for giggles though, the game is hard and you need to craft your own chance at winning.\n\nPlaying as a team of up to four is a lot of fun, but the scenery is repetitive and even annoying when you are trying to kill a boss and he runs off into another part of the map.\n\nAwesome art and funny dialogue in a somewhat monotonous gameplay.

I'm going to give this a no, but if I could I would simply give this a neutral vote or both, and if you can stand the grind then it's quite a lot of fun I feel, and would highly recommend it to those with sufficient patience to enjoy this game. I'm only giving this a no cause I personally couldn't stand the grinding. Honestly, my biggest problem with this game is that some materials are just way too hard to get in any kind of significant quantities. To get around this problem I suggest having higher tier enemies drop rarer materials instead of the common materials I already have literally hundreds of that all the lower tier enemies already drop. Also, the netcode could use improvement.

Enemies spawn exactly where they were previously, and for a lot of reasons that makes the game unentertaining and to be frank a bit routine. Also enemies that flee do so until they despawn about 5 meters from where they started.\n\nA better idea for the game would have been to set a certain number of creatures per level, and have them move freely around. Write scripts for aggressive enemies allowing them to hunt you with a certain range. Every enemy killed should drop a item (or maybe you'd have to kill a group to get something). Basically take the tried and true method from monster hunter - you hunt things, they hunt you, the victor gets some spoils.

In less than an hour of playtime, the game managed to show every possible hint of amatuerism in its design. A design based on games from decades ago that had better control schemes.\n\nThe biggest flaw with this "game" is the incredibly poor design decisions. The first mistake was the addition of reload for what should have been a relatively simple run-and-gun experience. It breaks the flow of gameplay and often just leaves you huddling behind some barrels until you've reloaded. Not that taking cover matters; The enemies barely move and the barrels are always taller than you are, so you have to jump into enemy fire anyway. This is compounded by absolutely byzantine level design that makes backtracking endless and goals impossible. It doesn't help that enemies respawn faster than this game being pushed out the door. On top of that, the game often imposes time limits on your escapades. The result is endlessly frustrating. The "developers" clearly haven't taken much notice in the games they were so intent on emulating: You can't shoot diagonally. Even Contra, a game released in the late '80s, allowed the player to shoot diagonally. There's no reason this could not have been done here.\n\nMercenary Kings is so bad I thought it was an Early Access title because it has no features and is overpriced. It looks like someone took a game with one level and no interesting game mechanics, gave it a nice art style and called it a day. Normally, I would cut the devs some slack, seeing as it's a Kickstarter and probably their first game, but the pricetag is just insulting for the amount of content (that I've read about; Apparently there's a useless crafting system). Only a Kickstarter could raise $100,000 for a game to be $20 and have the same content as a gif of the opening and closing animated sequences. The lack of gameplay coherence and common sense gives me the sneaking suspision that the game was mostly an ego trip for an art student.\n\nI don't recommend this game at full price. I don't recommend this game on sale. I actually got it on Humble Bundle for a dollar and I still can't recommend it. No, wait, my brother paid for that bundle, so I got it for free. No, wait, my brother owes me twenty bucks.

While the beginning of the game and overall pace is a bit slow, the game  becomes very fun after you have created your first weapon.  The fact that you often replay the same environments with different objectives may become very repetitive to some especially given the length of the game.  It can come off as difficult to some depending on their previous background with games of similar fashion but overally the difficulty rises gradually although trading waves of enemies for respawning enemies who patrol their areas.","October 21, 2014","true","18.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Borrowing heavily on the Metal Slug formula, the gameplay has been updated to current "standards": added replay value, massive crafting system, customization or sidequests just to name a few. If those are not inherently bad, they are not well suited to an arcade-y scrolling shooter.\n\nIf blasting through ennemy legions is your thing, be prepared to spend most of your time gathering materials by doing the same missions over and over again in order to get better weapons or equipment, some of which are not luxury items or hoarders' prizes but much needed firepower. Completionists will cry tears of blood.\n\nI would rather have had a two to three hours fun ride than having to grind my way through the game. If I end up recommending the game it's mostly due to Paul Robertson's amazing pixel art animations and the fact that the game is well designed.

A crafting system that doesn't give much of an opportunity to experiment or preview weapon builds before spending your resources and too many stats to compare, very little incentive to really use different types of weapons or ammunition when caustic bullets pretty much handle everything. Reload mechanic is frustrating and disrupts the flow of the game, game does not pause when your viewing the map leaving you vulnerable to the reappearing enemies that may lurk off screen. Retrieving items from your backpack is slow and also disrupts game play you should really be able to toggle through items with a single button click rather than having to hold down a button then navigating a menu and then select your item, you also have go through your backpack to get the walkie talkie out just to call someone so you can leave a mission so many clicks for such a simple thing.\n\nI wanted to like this game but I just couldn't get over the frustrating gameplay mechanics. The comparisons to Metal Slug make no sense this is nothing like Metal Slug not even close, If you wanna play a fast pace action platformer play Metal Slug if you want something slow, repetitive, and grindy play this game.","April 10","false","10.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The main point of the game is to fire your weapon, but wait you cannot fire your weapon up or down while moving nor can you fire diagonally. The enemies also respawn once they leave your screen which is really annoying when you're trying to explore the map. When you die, you don't respawn near your death location instead you're teleported back to the last respawn tent you passed and you have to fight your way back through all the enemies that respawned.

Now to be honest, I haven't gone through the entire game as yet. But I figure that I've logged in enough game time on it to give some first impressions.\n\nAdmittedly, what initially drew me to this game was the design itself. It was like Contra meets Scott Pilgrim-- similarly designed sprites, chiptune music and such... so it was something of a guilty pleasure.\n\nAs a run-and-gun game, there's nothing TOO exceptional about it. The levels are fairly linear, even though there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore. The story line is okay, though the characters are amusing enough that the plot doesn't plod on.\n\nThe real challenge lies in trying to master the levels. Not just in the speed-runs, but also with the secret objectives. Things to help you earn the extra scratch and materials to forge new items to not only make the missions more interesting, but to also unlock hidden perks to get through some of the harder missions.\n\nMissions are basic in nature, but can vary in difficulty due to time constraints and game AI. And the game AI is basic enough to make taking enemies out both easy and frustrating at the same time. There's also the reload feature, which can boost damage, but requires you to pay enough attention to be a distraction at times.\n\nAll in all, this is still a fun little run-and-gun, and definitely worth the look when it goes on sale.","November 19, 2014","true","27.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are many complaints, but most of those complaints are about people thinking it's going to be similar to Metal Slug, which it's not. It takes inspiration from games like Monster Hunter and Megaman. And the reason I say a game like Monster Hunter is because the crafting system and online missions (Quests) are similar to Monster Hunter's. You have your sub missions and main missions, you must complete all the main missions to unlock your boss mission, or in Monster Hunter your "Urgent Quest," to move on to your next rank or "Hunter Rank."\n\nAs for Megaman, the game's enemies and precise shooting mechanics are very similar to the Megaman franchise. So close infact some enemies have the same gameplay mechanics, examples are the Floor Spiders acting the like Springers, and Riot Shields acting like the Sniper Joes from Megaman.\n\nSince Monster Hunter and Megaman are two of my favorite videogame franchises of all time, I love this game, but I understand how some people might go into this game expecting a Metal Slug type game. If that's the case, Metal Slug 3 and X are available on Steam, which I highly recommend as well.","July 30, 2015","true","12.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A good Gameplay, a decent storry and a good Soundtrack (even if it sounds like  16bit).\n\nFirst things first: If you want a High-End 3D-Shoother you´re ABSOLUTELY not looking for this game.\nBUT: If you enjoy playing 2-D Platformers (like the famous Megaman games or the early Castlevania games on the NES or SNES)  you´ll definitely have a lot of fun with Mercenary Kings.\n\nThe graphics look a little like the games back in the good old times of the SNES. But thanks since these times have passed its looks are more smooth and less edgy. The designers put a lot of time and thought into creating the levels and models.  8/10\n\nThe storry itself has no big twists  and unforseen turns but the Characters are designed with a lot of love. 8/10\n\nThe gameplay is simple and easy to learn (what´s not so surpising since we talk about a Platformer^^)\nA nice idea that sure keeps you going is the almost infinite gunsmithing possibilities. Every part you equip can change how you move and shoot. It takes about 15-20 hours to beat the game (15 if you rush through the game, 20 if you take care of all the small sidequest that alsmot every mission has). 10/10\n\nThe soundtrack is as retro as the looks of this game and therefor a perfect match. No fancy orchestral sound, no incredible guitarr riffs but still an enjoyable and throughout the whole game well matched music. 7/10\n\nOne of the greates features of this game is the co-op mode where up to 4 players can join the fight.\nIt never gets old to play a game like that with your friends ;)\n\nOverall Rating, 8.5/10","January 9, 2015","true","31.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's got a quest system with goals for every mission you do, including secret goals.  You've got an absolute ♥♥♥♥-ton of things to buy to upgrade your character.  You've got multiple different parts for your gun to interchange.  Stuff like a barrel, magazine, stock, etc.  You can have anything from a lightning sniper rifle to a fire submachine gun and everything in between, even being able to tweak how many bullets and your overall damage.  You've got a knife that you can also have many different versions of.  Useable items like first-aid kits, grenades, c4 to open some doors.\n\nIf you're a person who wants to get everything, buckle up.  It's going to take you an awful long time to afford everything.  Every mission is timed, which is a bit annoying at first.  Especially when you haven't had a chance to familiarize yourself with a particular map.  It's probably the biggest drawback to the game if you don't like being rushed.  You'll normally have plenty of time, but some missions don't give you much room to breathe.\n\nLuckily, there's co-op to help you through some of the tougher missions.  You and up to 3 other people can join in the fun.  Tons of bosses, tons of quests, tons of guns.  It's how Metal Slug should've been designed in the first place.","December 30, 2014","true","43.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yes it isn't Metal Slug, but just because it looks like it, it shouldnt play like it. This a Metal Slug style with a Monster Hunter vibe to it. The ability to customize your gun into any shape or form is the drive to this game. Now unless you wanna unlock every gun part, yes it WILL be a grind, but if you know what you want, you'll blaze through this game. By want I mean, you know what kind of gun you'll want to make. Spread patterns are all the same (this aint Counter Strike son), so a gun with 90% Acc will be the same across all fields, is just the ammunition that affects the pattern (Buckshots will not follow the same predetermined path as a Magnum Bullet). The only downfall this game has is there is no seamless map, you'll have to do different missions to go to the different maps. You will be doing the same maps over and over a couple of times, but you will be doing different parts of it to complete objectives. This can be a good or bad thing, as the missions are planned out so you know where to go for the main boss of the area (As bosses can/will run away to different parts of the map, and will need to know how to get there from previous playings). I find this game enjoyable, as others not so much, and for vain reasons.\n\nPROS\n-Customized Weapons\n-Variety of Parts\n-4 Player Co-Op (Both Online and Local)[Unknown if it can be mixed]\n-Great Boss Battles\n-Rainbow Dog of Doom that craps rockets at you\n-Large Maps\n-Shared Items in Co-Op mode (When finding, not crafting)\n-Tougher Enemies in Co-Op mode\n\nCONS\n-Low Replayablity\n-2 Characters\n-Enemy Variety is low (In the beginning)\n-Farm to Unlock all Parts\n-Few Maps\n-You will hate Rainbow Dog of Doom\n\n\nPretty even list of Pros and Cons, but my experience with the game as been fun, and I have been playing Solo. I think the Pros outweigh the Con in my experiences, this not a game for everyone. If you want a Metal Slug game, then buy, its there in the store, just do it. If you want a nice Side-scrolling, Action Platformer, with Customizable Weapons, I would get this.","December 29, 2014","true","19.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sometimes right after you've finished a mission but before it saves said mission. Very annoying.\nThe progression of "unlocking" the interesting stuff in the game is slow and doesn't feel rewarding. It's a bit too arcane to figure out how it all works together at first glance.\nAbout the best thing the game has going for it is Paul Robertson's visual flair (because, *ahem* bewbs). Unfortunately because of the gameplay hindrances and for me, the periodic crashing, it wears out its welcome quickly. Nice idea, crowd-funders, but please try again. I want to love what you're selling, but the magic is gone far too early.","March 17","false","10.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And even after doing the same missions over and over again, you feel as though the game isn't hard enough.\n\nAnother issue is that there is no difficulty option. You have to start the game easy and than work your way up to the harder missons; but by the time you get to the hard missions, the game just feels easy because you've already got better guns and better armor. So bascially, the game feels the same, throughout; with the exception of some bakground changes.\n\nAll missions take place during the same map, depending on the ranking in which you choose (i.e. if you choose the first rank, all your missions take place during the jungle; and so on, and so forth). Only differeance is that some missions have a larger map, while other missions don't.\n\nBosses can just leave whenever during the battle, which is annoying; because they move to another part of the map so you might need to backtrack to the start and/or find their new spawn; before the time runs out.\n\nThe game is trying to be a "Run-N-Gun" but contradicts itself by allowing players to create a sniper rifle build. So you just stand where you spawn, pan the camera to the right and take out people from a far, and just free walk. And even than some of the enemies are bullet-sponges, so it takes a couple of shots to even kill them.\n\nAlso the knife is pointless. It does low damage and you rarely use it, with the exception of an achievement or two. It relfects bullets, but if the enemy is higher or lower than you one by 1 pixel, you'll still get hit. You're better off just shooting and ducking.\n\nI wouldn't recommend getting it at full price, but if it's on sale, its a decent shooter, that can be fun to play with others who don't really want to do much.","December 29, 2014","false","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love the style of the game, of course it reminds of games like Metal Slug and so on, but that doesn't make up for the repetitive and frustrating gameplay. There is a hub with missions, merchants and weapon crafting NPCs and things like that, which is cool, but the missions get way too annoying after a while. Especially because they use the same maps over and over, making you explore it again and again to get all the objectives done. What also drives me crazy is that enemies respawn all the time in the way of super old games like Ninja Gaiden, go too far in one direction and the enemy respawns is just not a good way in my opinion. The crafting system is cool, but doesn't really adds that much to the game. I really really wanted to like this game, but the repetitiveness and dull gameplay just can't convince me at all to recommend the game. I know its in beta, but they would need to change a lot to make up for it, which just isn't realistic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalerodelsol/recommended/218820/","metalerodelsol","metalerodelsol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalerodelsol/","133 products in account","\nIt seems odd to me that people didn't get what Mercenary Kings was before it was released. When I watched the gameplay footage, it was very clear that the game features mechanics as Monster Hunter such as collecting materials for crafting (a LOT of it), 3 lives per mission in total (especially important in multiplayer), and timed missions. Unlike Metal Slug, which is a really fast paced 2D game, MK is more tactical, forcing you to think your approach on enemies, or die and respawn at the start point of the mission (kind like Castlevania). This creates tension, and challenge. I don't understand why people complain about not being able to shoot in a diagonal direction, as you couldn't do it in Metal Slug either, but okay.\n\nGameplay variations come in bionic mods, which consist on equipping up to two ability enchaning mods, along with their respective penalties; then, there is the really extensive weapon crafting in both guns and blades. This is pretty much the core mechanic of the game. Gun parts will change your damage, ammo, firing speed, weight, element, bullet compatibility, etc. Properties for knives such as range, speed, element, and others also apply. Craft enough parts of the same weapon type, and you get proficiencies, which work as an additional mod, but with no penalties. If you have played Monster Hunter, Valdis Story or any other game which focuses a lot on defeating enemies to finally get the item you need, it's worth the time, because a new kind of weapon completely changes the way you approach enemies.\n\nMission types go from eleminating enemies in a certain area, to rescue missions, hunting missions, capture missions, material finding, etc. etc. Yes, you may feel that you have to replay maps a lot, but factors such as time, starting points, and even enemies will change as you progress through the game. Backtracking and respawing enemies work in a way that you have to very careful about not wandering mindlessly and be on your toes, as enemies will be there again, but you will encounter them from another angle, making you think twice about how to kill them once again. This also works in your favor for material collecting purposes. The fleeing Boss mechanic, I felt, works as a time and ability challenge. It can work for or against you. The thing about Bosses escaping, is that you can open the map, and you will see the skull icons where the boss actually is, so it's about how fast you can get there and finish the job.\n\nMultiplayer is a blast, as you and your friends can tackle the missions from different points. You are not bound all together in the same screen, but can work individually when it comes to finding enemies or items in order to complete the mission. Also, if you pick up a material, all your friends will get it too, so it makes crafting a lot faster. If you hated going against a Boss solo, a multiplayer session will allow you and your friends to completely wreck those Steel Soldiers, Mechanic Hounds and many others. One thing of caution, though. I said that you have 3 lives in total per mission, not per player. So watch out for trigger happy companions, or loners, because if they day very far away from any support, "Mission Failed" is a highly likely scenario, so teamwork is never out of the question, and THAT'S the beauty of it. There are adrenaline shots to revive your comrades or yourself in these situations, but mind the inventory limit, as choices must be made, so once again, tactics is the word of the day.\n\nThere is also the platformer aspect of the game, so be careful about how hard you press the jump button. So, not only will you fight CLAW, but you will find the stages themselves. The reload mechanic is something you must master, as you must always be aware of how much ammo you got left before reloading. By reloading, you will see a black, yellow and green bar above you. If you time well your reloading and hit the green section of the bar, you will get a bonus damage for the amount of bullets your reloaded. If you miss, you'll be unable to shoot for a period of time, defined by the load time of the weapon you're carrying (So you better have a nicely forged knife to compensate). This mechanic adds even more tension to the game, because you won't always be standing still as you watch your reload bar, but you may be in a heated Boss battle, or sorrounded by enemies, so mastering your reload time for every weapon you carry is a must.\n\nFor the enemy part of the game, there is a nice variety of them. Not to mention that some enemies will level up in a way, and be stronger and change their attack patterns. The same goes for Bosses, and you will encounter some powered-up ones, which likely make your day harder (if you have played Monster Hunter, this if quite familiar). If you get into trouble at missions, you can always rest at the infirmary, which works both as a healing station (kind slow, so watch your times) and a spawn point, so if you die, you will respawn at the last infirmary you entered.\n\nAs I see it, people who really didn't like this game (and played for about 15 minutes of it), were expecting a super-fast paced shooting game, like metal slug. This is more tactical, as I said, like Castlevania, Metroid, Monster Hunter, etc. You can't be shooting endlessly or moving really fast with a full pleged machine gun in  your arms. Other were expecting things to be really casual and easy, but Mercenary Kings isn't that kind of game. If you can stand a challenge, and master the speed and mechanics of this game, satisfaction is a feeling that will get to you eventually. Also, after end-game, you can keep playing in order craft every weapon part there is, or just try the different kind of bullets and guns, just to see how you fare with them. Are you a revolver or hand-gun kind of person? Maybe shotguns are your thing. Maybe a Sniper Rifle, or a Machine gun. Maybe you like it close and personal, and your knife gets the best out of you. Changing a weapon type is pretty much changing your experiencie in the game, so give it a shot.\n\nDesign and artstyle-wise, the game is beautiful. If you like pixel art, the character designs are stylish, both friends and enemies. The game plays really smooth, and the map details are very well done. I'm not picky with graphics in videogames, so for me this really easy on the eyes.\n\nWhen it comes to controls, I'm the rare kind of player who prefers the keyboard. The default keys are what I use, and at first they're kind of weird, but using your right hand as a second WASD actually makes sense in this game (at least for me). The thing to watch out for are the roll and the knife controls. If you don't want to trouble yourself with the roll button, you can enable the double-tap option to get that out of your way. Now you deal only with shoot, knife and jump. Of course, there is the reload button and how you handle your inventory, but all it takes is a button configuration or a controller set-up to better suit your needs.\n\nAnyway, that's my way of covering how this game does what it does. I can see that it's not for the VERY casual players, or those who expect really fast paced 2D shooters (which I also love), but I wouldn't call it hardcore either. It's about letting Mercenary Kings grow on you if the general idea doesn't fully convince you yet, but I can't blame you if this isn't really the game for you. Just don't go with the "It's hard because I'm not super powerful" kind of reviews. This is a game that rewards your intelligence and your ability more than it rewards your farming for materials in order to craft the best equipment.\n\nI hope this helps you out in that decisive "Yes or No" for this game in particular, and keep on playing.","August 17, 2015","true","64.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BFab/recommended/218820/","BFab","DarkSparx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BFab/","86 products in account","I'm trying... so hard to enjoy this game.  I really, truly am.  I want to enjoy it.  It's actually pretty cool!  Controls are (mostly) tight, some of the music is catchy, the art style is lovely, and it's awesome for local multiplayer.  Plus I adore the weapon building system, aside from it being a little cryptic.\nI just have a few complaints outside of that.\n\nThis game is VERY player-hostile.  Outside of the tutorial you have VERY LITTLE explained to you, and that's just not okay.  The first time I found an adrenaline shot I was stressing out because I had absolutely no clue what it did, only to find out when I accidentally rolled into a spike pit and died.  I thought it was a small health boost, but no, it's a revival item, and it's ESSENTIAL for co-op if you're inexperienced.\nBy the way.  This game also doesn't spend a second explaining co-op.  Not one word is spoken about it anywhere.  You have no way of finding out how it works other than looking it up online or figuring it out for yourself.  Bad.\n\nSecondly: Difficulty spikes.  Just...  Why?  Why would you do that?  There's nothing wrong with making a game gradually more difficult.  It doesn't have to jump up all at once like this one does.\n\nThird, I think a couple of the bosses could use some tweaking.  I'm not as far into the game as I could be, but I still feel at least a little justified in this.\nEvery boss should have a pattern that's easy to see, no matter how difficult.  A couple of the bosses in the game, yes, that's true.  But then there are other bosses that seem like they're impossible to figure out, and then when you do figure them out, it's impossible to avoid taking damage from them.\nAnd then there's one boss in particular that literally can't touch you if you just stand on the edge of the barrier.  Seriously.  All you need to do is dodge every so often and you will not get hit.  That makes something that's supposed to be dangerous a mere waste of time.\n\nI also think that the weight system could use some work...  It's okay if it affects your movement speed, but it shouldn't affect your jump height.  There were one or two occasions where, I kid you not, I actually got stuck and had to quit a mission because the gun I was using was too heavy.  Being weighed down into moving slowly is fine.  Just don't mess with the player's aerial mobility.  That doesn't work for a platformer.\n\nAnd the elevators.\n*sigh*\nThe elevators.  Once again with the player-hostility.  You are not told how elevators work.  The first time I saw them, I thought I had to move far enough away to trick them into moving, then jump on, because they don't move when you're close or standing on them.\nAfter driving myself crazy over it for about fifteen minutes, I eventually figured out that you're supposed to press up or down while standing on an elevator to get it to move, depending on where it can go.  This is extremely awkward because there are times when you're standing on an elevator and need to duck to avoid incoming gunfire, only to send the elevator down with you on it.\n(Also, to jump down through an elevator, you hold up and press the fire button.  Why?)\n\nTo sum it all up, long story short, tl;dr, would I recommend this game?\nNot at full price.  It's not worth $20.  If you can get it on sale for $10 or less, I'd say check it out if it's your type of game.","March 5, 2015","false","55.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Pixelated but colorful art, old school with a modern touch, etc... that's all truth and likeable. But I really had a problem with the gameplay, something that should be a star in this kind of games.\n\nFirst, this does not play like Metal Slug in an aspect. May look like it, but is more like a cheap megaman knockoff. Yep, I'm this harsh because the scenarios and platforming is filled with lame and boring challenges, timed repetitive missions and enemies that are just not fun to fight.\n\nWeapon crafting is still pretty good, and it may intrigue you what you can build with what you find, but honestly, this is the reason I usually don't dig in this kind of mechanic: I have to wade trough repetitive gameplay until it's grating. I might be compensated with building great guns and upgrades, but with such lame enemies to fight, what's the point? It's like playing XBlades in a Turrican-Megaman uninspired perspective.\n\nIf you want to play Metal Slug, it's here on steam.

And as for weapon crafting all I truly remember was the pure tedium of crafting said weapon that usually is very unfun to use so instead of having these awesome powerups in Metal Slug which freshened the game up all you are left with is a tedius item screen and one weapon that usually took you hours upon hours of grinding the same stage.

Mercenary Kings is perfectly content to repeatedly send you off on the same 3 types of fetch quests in one of the same 3 maps, over and over, again and again, for hours.\n\nMercenary Kings is the equivalent of that FPS you play that isn't really outstanding, but also isn't bad, and turns out to be a really great way to just kill a half an hour. It's a game you can hop into quickly, and missions can take anywhere between 5 minutes up to 30 minutes. If you're just looking to kill some time shooting a couple dudes while looking at some great pixel art, then Mercenary Kings fits the bill marvelously.\n\nIf you're a fan of old school side-scrolling shooters (e.g. Metroid, Contra, Gunstar Heroes, Cave Story), etc, then you're probably going to enjoy this game well enough to make it worth the purchase (especially at a sale price). There is **EVENTUALLY** (very, very eventually) a variety of ammo types, and it can be interesting discovering how different ammo types can have unique effects on certain types of enemies (e.g. when you shoot an enemy hiding behind a riot shield with caustic ammo, the riot shield melts away and changes the enemy's behavior).\n\nHowever, I specifically say AMMO types and not GUN types for good reason. One of the most loudly advertised aspects of the game---and definitely one of the most attractive---is the ability to pick up various "materials" dropped by enemies, which you can then sell for money or use at crafting stations to create new parts for your gun or various other perks. The game is very proud of these mildly RPG-esque and clearly Borderlands-derived elements, but the implementation is hit or miss. The ammo types are implemented pretty well. The gun parts... meh.\n\nAfter dumping over 10 hours into the game (and having a fairly good time, mind you), and experimenting with different gun mods, my honest opinion is that the vast majority of craftable gun parts and passive skills are more or less pointless. The game undermines upgrades and customizations in the vast majority of cases by giving an upgrade with one hand while stealing it back with the other.\n\nFor example, suppose you currently have a clip size of 8 and a damage rating of 150, and you want to upgrade your clip size to fire more shots before stopping to reload. The game might let you upgrade your clip size to 12, but it knocks your damage down to 100 and slows your walking speed. Suppose you decide to skip the clip size upgrade then and just upgrade raw damage? The game might let you boost raw damage to 200, but it will reduce your clip size to 4 shots and slow your walking speed. Or it might alternatively lett you have the 200 raw damage while reducing your magazine size to 7, but the cost is your reload speed is now three times as slow.\n\nIn short, most of the unlockable weapon parts aren't so much "upgrades" as much as they are like sliders that you can use to change CHARACTERISTICS of your weapon, but which don't really IMPROVE your weapon overall.\n\nAlso, you CAN'T SHOOT DIAGONALLY in this game. Which is annoying, because enemies CAN shoot diagonally, and flying enemies will attack you from a diagonal direction. This is a terrible oversight. It might have been fine if being attacked from a diagonal angle wasn't such a problem, but the game makes you wish for that diagonal aim through enemy behavior suggesting that you should have it, and then for some reason, you don't. When I noticed that, I shook my head and I said hm. Just hm. Tsk tsk. What a shame.\n\nThat being said, once you get several hours in and get up to about the third rank, you start acquiring weapon parts that make your gun compatible with elemental ammo. Therein lie the REAL upgrades. You can even get up to a point where you can have an elemental version of a specific bullet type. For example, you can create a gun that shoots bullets that are both CAUSTIC and also PIERCING. Caustic bullets burn away at enemies (and sometimes melt away their defenses) while piercing bullets can travel through walls and objects to hit unsuspecting enemies on the other side. Piercing bullets can also travel through several enemies in a line. And, of course, the damage is better. Now THESE are upgrades.\n\nIn short, the various weapon parts don't add a whole lot outside of letting you use custom ammo. The custom ammo is the real game changer.\n\nThere are other craft stations not related to weapon crafting, but these also don't offer anything that significantly improves your character or game experience. Some of them are terribly pointless. One of the better examples is the ability to craf better armor, which provides a definite and noticeable boost to the amount of damage you can sustain. The craftable passive skills, on the other hand, aren't particularly interesting. They COULD be, but are implemented poorly. For example, there is a passive skill that brags it can burst your speed, but at the cost of some of your physical defense. Again with the giving with one hand while taking with the other. If the benefits made the trade-off worthwhile, then it might not be so bad, but the "speed boost" you receive is so slight that I found myself turning it off and on again to test whether it was actually working. Not exactly the sort of "speed boost" I would sacrifice defense for.\n\nSome of the crafting options I even find downright ridiculous. For example, you can give a bunch of your materials and some money to the chef who will craft a meal for you, which gives you a perk in the next mission only. But the perks are laughably negligible. Things like a 5% increase to maximum health. Five percent? This kind of thing could just as well not exist and I wouldn't even miss it or notice it was gone.\n\nHonestly, I played all the way up through Corporal rank using the STARTING weapon. No mods offer significant enough changes to be worthwhile up until that point. I bought a lot of the upgrades to advance toward some of those skills that unlock with a certain number of purchases, but I didn't equip any of them. Didn't see the point.\n\nThe game's hugest and most serious problem, however, is recycling. I have played the game for 10 hours and completed nearly 50 missions. All of these missions have taken place in the same 3 levels. I am very sick of the jungle.\n\nOn the plus side, the boss battles are pretty fun (but also recycled).\n\nTLDR: Mercenary Kings  isn't going to win any awards, and it recycles too much, and its weapon customization is mostly talk, but if you just want to spend a few minutes shooting some 2-dimensional dudes while looking at some great pixel art, then Mercenary Kings is a great game to kill time with.","July 5, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's not the sort of Borderlands-meets-MegamanX that I was imagining.\n\nThe Merc characters feel clumsey and sluggish.  The guns (so far) are very limited ( "shotgun type parts" or "machine gun type parts").  It's common to sink missions-worth-of-earnings into building a worse gun.  There are no items or abilities aside that make you feel awesome, give any strategy or variety.  You're (so far) just a dopey run/jump/duck/shoot/roll character, fighting the same 10 enemies with predictable patterns and no real reason (i.e. relevant loot or an xp system) to grind through.\n\nEnemies feel like they're just in the way of the objective, fighting through the same stage over and over to complete their many missions.  A lot of time is spent hoping that the effort it will take to, yet again, trek through the same grid of caves, cliffs and structures, will be worth a few lines of character dialogue and the assumption that all the stuff you've been picking up will be useful some day.\n\nThe story, characters and artwork are all very pleasant, but the game mechanics/design makes most of the game a chore to slog through, unfortunately.  No randomized content.  One stage of the same stuff for hours.  Beyond that, I can only guess the formula repeats itself.\n\nPerhaps after only a few more hours, something along the lines of interesting/useful weapon options, character abilities (wall jump?  double jump?  wall slide?  crawl?  lock on/aim? Grenades? ect.), more stages, or anything else that feels like a reward will emerge.  Until then, it's just chasing repeat bosses that move before you even get to them for hours, and grinding through armies of annoying bad guys for obscure matterials.","December 20, 2014","false","4.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Those were fast-paced and interesting. This game, however, is not. When I first started playing, I learned quickly that it had no joypad or mouse support. I can understand having no mouse support since you only fire in four directions. You could always use third party programs to play with a joypad, but joypad support is something that you find in pretty much any game on PC made past 2008 or so. It's probably the game's single largest missed opportunity.\n\nAnd the reason why it's such a huge missed opportunity is because the keyboard is possibly the worst method of playing. The learning curve is enormous on a game that doesn't need the complexity this game has. When you're not struggling with learning the eighty million keyboard shortcuts, you're going to be struggling to learn things like weapon customization. Which, by the way, is almost completely useless. It's a lot of work for little reward. Speaking of rewards, the missions in the game are glorified fetch quests and get tedious very fast.\n\nThe only saving grace of this game is essentially the online multiplayer. If you can find friends to tolerate the game enough to learn the basics and play with you, it can be fun enough to tolerate for a while.\n\nIf you love Metal Slug enough to slog your way through the opening hour or two, by all means, purchase the game. Otherwise, wait for a Steam sale that brings the game down to around $5 or so. 'cause, frankly, that's about how much the trouble you'll be getting yourself into is worth.\n\nEasily in my top ten games I wish I hadn't supported monetarily.","March 25, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

UNTIL YOU READ!! SERIOUSLY!!!\nIf you are expecting this game to be like Metal Slug, Metal Assault, or Contra. Turn away right now. The game is better with Controler (HIGHLY RECOMENDED) With Keyboard, it is hellish to play.\nSo this game seem to have something new to it's style, unlike METAL SLUG. This game offers Crafting weapons, buying items, character customization and varrious mission to play. Not to mention online co-op for friends to join.\n\nSO WHAT WENT WRONG?!\n\nLevel Design choices\n\nUNLIKE METAL SLUG, this game is a CHORE! Most of the mission is  fetch quest style mission. The first mission was finding ONE hostage. (seems okay) Then the game do the exact same thing for second mission WITH 8 HOSTAGES! By the way, it's on the same map. (OR it look very similar, which make the game feels repetitive)\n\nYOU DON'T FEEL LIKE A BADASS!\nThis game is more difficult than Metal Slug, GOOD! However..., the game refuses to throw any retaliation! (I'm going to compare this to Metal Slug again.) In Metal Slug, you will encounter TANKS, 10+ Footsoilders, HELICOPTERs, and so on. This make the game fun, and give that satisfying feeling of destorying everything like any RUN n GUN game should be. But all you'll encounter in this game is just repetitive respwanable enemies. For example, sending 3 melee soldiers and die by 1 SINGLE BULLET. Or having 1 or 2 riflemen attacking you. Compare that to Metal Slug or Contra.\n\nSLOW EVERYTHING IS SLOW.\n\nThe fact that this game force you to do search n destory, or fetching an objective. Forces you to wonder around the map trying to find that LAST GUY WHO YOU MENT TO KILL. Again, unlike Contra or Metal Slug, this game doesn't proceed quickly. Infact, it probably force you to GRIND. That's right, having a crafting system is good, but you need to grind for the materials. I don't want to do that, this is not an MMORPG. The game does give you in-game money allowing you buy items. BUT NOT MATERIALS. NOPE YOU GOTTA GRIND FOR IT. May I ask why!?\n\nCombat Mechanic\n\nHonestly, very disappointed. I'll make this short. Why is there a reload mini game? Does it have any purpose? It was more like a punishment rather than FUN. I mean, reloading itself is already difficult. Or maybe it's not difficult in this game? BECAUSE THE GAME HARDLY throw enemies at you! While it adds abit of challenge during boss fight, I find it more... annoying. There's no real reward for hitting the right time for reload minigame, but only punishment when you hit too early or too late. I rather just hit reload and just wait. Other than that the mini game mechanic, is a waste of space.\n\nFinal things I would like to add.\n\nWHY DO I ONLY HAVE A PISTOL!? Where's my nade?\nWHY IS THERE A TIMER!?\nWHY DOES IT COST MONEY TO DIE?! Isn't losing one life not enough!?\n\nFor PC, IF YOU HAVE NO CONTROLER! DO NOT BUY!! Was expecting something like Metal Assault, which was an MMO but have a very good mechanic, you can use your mouse to aim, and shoot with LF-Click. SIMPLE!? Why didnt the developer think of this?!?!\n\n\nBuy, at your own risk. Good Day.","April 1, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's not the sort of Borderlands-meets-MegamanX that I was imagining.\n\nThe Merc characters feel clumsey and sluggish.  The guns (so far) are very limited ( "shotgun type parts" or "machine gun type parts").  It's common to sink missions-worth-of-earnings into building a worse gun.  There are no items or abilities aside that make you feel awesome, give any strategy or variety.  You're (so far) just a dopey run/jump/duck/shoot/roll character, fighting the same 10 enemies with predictable patterns and no real reason (i.e. relevant loot or an xp system) to grind through.\n\nEnemies feel like they're just in the way of the objective, fighting through the same stage over and over to complete their many missions.  A lot of time is spent hoping that the effort it will take to, yet again, trek through the same grid of caves, cliffs and structures, will be worth a few lines of character dialogue and the assumption that all the stuff you've been picking up will be useful some day.\n\nThe story, characters and artwork are all very pleasant, but the game mechanics/design makes most of the game a chore to slog through, unfortunately.  No randomized content.  One stage of the same stuff for hours.  Beyond that, I can only guess the formula repeats itself.\n\nPerhaps after only a few more hours, something along the lines of interesting/useful weapon options, character abilities (wall jump?  double jump?  wall slide?  crawl?  lock on/aim? Grenades? ect.), more stages, or anything else that feels like a reward will emerge.  Until then, it's just chasing repeat bosses that move before you even get to them for hours, and grinding through armies of annoying bad guys for obscure matterials.","December 20, 2014","false","4.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'm sure at some level this was what the developers are going for, a nostalgic game they would've liked to see, indisriminately taking the things we all loved about platformers etc.\n\nSadly, it's more like the best and the absolute worst aspects of games from the 8bit and 16bit era. It's as if the developers have learned absolutely nothing from modern game design. This game is extremely frustrating, and most of it comes down to horrible design and core mechanics.\n\nThe biggest issue I have apart from the bad overall design, is that while the developers have tried to combine many different elements from successful games, the overall experience is worse off than any of those individual games it tries to imitate.Some gameplay choices don't play well with each other and their attempt at syncretizing these becomes detrimental to the overall experience,\n\nI tried playing this game with multiple friends, and it's hard for me to insist on it when it's obvious no one is enjoying a single second of it.\n\nA real shame, but the era for frustrating pieces of ♥♥♥♥ that you just love to hate are over.\n\nHowever, if you're one of those people that is scourging through the reviews to find reassuring confirmation of why you'd love this game, and are desperate for the possible potential it might have I would in fact recommend this game. You might not play it for very long, but it does have an allure of enjoyment, one that it doesn't really deliver on, but afterall, like the developers, sometimes we like the idea of something over the actual thing itself.","August 6, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This game does revisit the same areas. What it does right about this mechanic is that it will often lock certain areas of that map until you clear specific missions, and the variety of the missions more than make up for this.\n\nThe crafting and customization that a person can use to suit their playstyle is varied enough to suit anyone's taste. Homing guns, projectiles that explode with shrapnel on impact, piercing rounds, elemental rounds, and even player buffs that can make a melee build one of the most lethal.\n\nThe multiplayer co-op is the most fun feature of this game. Whether local or online, the players are free to explore separate areas of the same map, versus locking you in the same screen (as does Metal Slug, a game that cleraly inspired this one). The only negative part that players may find is that local co-op is split screen, so plan to be close to the screen if it is not a large one. Also, players can leave whenever they feel like it (even the host) without forcing other players to quit, and players can join at any point in between missions.\n\nThe most impressive ascpect of this game is the commitment that the developers have to ensuring that it is a great game. Their persistence in ironing out bugs is rare for an indie team. This is reason enough to buy the game, and to buy future titles from this team.\n\nGraphics are one of the last thing I care about so long as the game works, and it does. On that note, the art style in this game is fantastic.\n\nTL;DR: Lots of crafting and player build customization, varied missions, drop in/drop out co-op campaign, great art style/graphics, dedicated developer team.\n\n9/10","December 4, 2014","true","81.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Oh hell yeah!\n\nIf you're a Monster Hunter passionate, such as myself, you will definitely LOVE  this title. The feeling you get is very close, and a lot of mechanics are present in both games:\nWeapons can be forged, and they come in various shapes and colors. Not only that, but weapon parts are divided in categories which alter the way they work.\nThe main area is a small village, where all the NPCs live. Many of them also resemble ones from Capcom's franchise: the general who gives you missions, the cook who... erm, cooks you food (which gives fixed AND chance-based bonuses), the gunsmith who forges all your gun parts from monster materials, and so many others.\nAreas work similarly to how they do in Monster Hunter, being divided in zones and having enemies indigenous to them. However, in this game most enemies tend to respawn as soon as they leave your field of view.\nOh, and I didn't talk about boss fights yet! Bosses can be killed OR captured, and overall the pattern-learning process behind defeating them for the first time feels the same.\nThen comes CoOp. You can play together with up to four people, and you all share the same lives. There's a built-in voice-command system, too.\nI could go on, but I hope you get the point.\n\nIf, however, you're considering buying Mercenary Kings for the Metal Slug part, you'll be slightly disappointed: while it mantains all the glorious 2D shootin' goodness, it lacks a bit of the fast-paced and action-packed gameplay that makes Metal Slug what it's well known for. Also, there are no power-ups scattered around the map or dropped by your foes, for instance.\n\nOverall? I don't even know where to begin: some great but not overly complex pixel-art, an amazing soundtrack, interesting characters, an addicting gameplay and the CoOp mode are all important points that give a strong first impression.\nMaybe it's not really worth €20, but you should totally get it if it drops below €15.","April 15, 2014","true","36.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The game that could have been good.\n\nMetal Slug meets Monster Hunter, how could that be bad? Easy. The development team is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nThe game mechanics are slugish and unresponsive making the game slow and stiff. This becomes an issue durring the many glitched boss fights, fights that are nearly impossibly without a second players help to exploit the boss' patterns.  This is to say, the game is hard. But not hard in a way like Dark Souls or Mario, where it is your fault when you die, but in the most unfair of ways. A good example is a later level where there are falling platforms over spikes and offscreeen enemys fire at you durring your jump arc from one falling platform to another. Your options are get shot and take damage, or fall and take damage.\n\nThis is my issue with the developers. Between being too lazy to fix old content before adding in things nobody asked for like pizza statues for a tent that serves no purpose and pulling bull ♥♥♥♥ like making art and stories for each member of the playable characters team only to tell the players who bought the game excited to play as them that they are all dead in the story and the guy and girl characters are the only ones you can play and you should be happy about it. Oh, but they had enough time and money to make the sprite art for their own personal sprites for a circle jerk achivement at the end of the game.\n\nAll developer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t aside. Is the game good? No. Any of the Metal Slug games are a better purchace for the same or cheaper price.

Controlling your character is a chore due to speed, the poor hit direction of your attacks, and the delay of movement you suffer after landing a freaking jump. The gameplay is far from "frantic"—deliberating your every move before jumping in to combat b/c of your own movement limitations is just inexcusable. Perpetually spawning enemies can be bland: they either spawn right in front of a doorway, or in the exact same spot they were killed a minute before. Search and rescue/destroy missions take forever due the circular level design in some areas.\n\nIronically, MK really shines with it's non-Platformer elements. I love the idea of crafting weapon upgrades from found materials and dealing elemental damage. The reloading system is surprisingly fun: time your reloads, and dispatch your foes with high powered rounds of ammunition. Of course, the multiplayer is a plus, albeit a standard one.\n\nPart of me thinks I've just been spoiled by the gameplay of Metal Slug, but there are so many things that MK can do so much better.\n\nAs it is, I cannot recommend Mercenary Kings, even with the $5 discount. Here's to hoping for a more polished edition after development is complete.","July 23, 2013","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is very reminiscent of side scrolling action games like Metal Slug, but with material drops on enemy kills and in chests, etc. Rather than build levels in the traditional sense, your ranking and what missions you have completed determine what missions are available,  what areas are available, and what weapon parts become available as progress is made; Therein lies the sense of progression and accomplishment. You’ll find yourself repeating missions to farm certain materials, but the grind never really feels repetitive.\nBuilding new gun parts and outfitting the new crafted weapons with new ammunition is always fun. The build your own weapon mechanic is surprisingly deep as there is no one right way to build. Same goes for crafting the knife weapons, though they are a little more straightfoward.

Overall, it is a fun game if you're into the Metal Slug kind of gameplay mixed with Loadout's Depth of Weapon Customization (changing head, body, bottom of a gun with sight + ammo) with the Monster Hunter's Mission Rule Set of 'Three Strikes and you're Out' and it's 'RPG-like' drop-rates. There are way too many guns to customize so experimenting what kind of gun you like is the fun part. Since this game focuses more on the 'gunplay' than any other part, if you are coming from Scott Pigrim vs. The World Video Game, the 'melee' part of the game is a bit lackluster since there are basically three different ranges of melee. Short, Medium, and SPEAR LONG. There's no 1-2-3 combo built behind them, it's only a melee swing.  The other issue is that exploring is a bit discouraging when it comes to examining what's inside the houses. 80% of examining the inside of a building results nothing. Followed by 10% Indoor Level that's fleshed out and 10% there's a guy you have to rescue in there! However, the outdoor exploration is vast and nice to roam around. Soundtrack is somewhat limited, but it's in Alpha state atm. Is it worth 15$ (current price)? If you really want Metal Slug/Run and Gun Retro-Style arcade game and miss Tribute, the same guys who made Scott Pigrim, sure give it a shot. Multiplayer makes it exponentially more fun without ruining the game. There isn't even an option mode at the moment so you have to adjust the sound through the Volume Mixer. The price tag for 15$ may sound a bit steep for the penny pinchers. 10$ would be fair, but prices excluded, the game does what it does right: Executes Metal Slug while adding Gunplay Customization that feels just right.","July 27, 2013","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It features gorgeous pixel art reminescent of the 16 bit era, heavily inspired by the arcade classic Metal Slug, and a glorious chip-tune soundtrack.\n\nOne might expect Mecenary Kings to fully lift the run-and-gun stylings of Metal Slug given it's style and theme, but instead it actually picks and chooses a wide selection of mechanics from the Mega Man franchise. It notably draws on the Mega Man Zero and ZX series, with a wide selection of collected gems from across the earlier titles.\n\nThe game features missions with a variety of optional challenges that are a delight to revist with different armaments; the same level feels different when approached for speed or when explored thoroughly for resources, and players are well rewarded for become familiar with enemy patterns, level layouts, weapons and items.\n\nI was actually very surprised when I started joining in on multiplayer efforts with how wonderfully multiple players integrate, and just how diverse the weapon selection is among players. While it seems natural for players to gravitate to a single weapon layout to me, it turns out that there is little consensus between players on what equipment works best; clearly the weapon crafting system does an excellent job of addressing individual play styles. There is something for everone.\n\nThere are some short comings. It is difficult to construct weapons that utilize the unusual ammo types, generally forcing one basic gun type; stocks and sights don't really contribute much to weapons overall except to craft weapons for very specific ammo types. Biomods and Proficiencies are good overall, but there are a wide range of abilities that just aren't present. It's not that the options available aren't significant, it's just that there is a great deal of options that could be added, like modifications to rolling, or jumping (like double jumping). It feels a lot like the more unusual options aren't present for the certainty of avoiding game-breaking bugs or opporunities; it's not bad but it feels overly "safe".\n\nAlso, while materials within the game are broken down in to common, uncommon and rare drops, it isn't clear that this doesn't actually reflect the value of any individual drop. While boss drops are only obtainable in a few, or single locations, it's easy for a player to grind for one or two of those individual drops, where some "common" materials, like Rubber, Chromium and Regular Pins, are found only rarely but are required for a substancial amount of crafting. Players can burn an enormous amount of time digging for some less interesting items like Scarlet Pelts just to craft a few basic items.\n\nMercenary Kings is a game I fully believe exemplfies the ideals of the Indie Game development community; deserving high recognition. And the end credits drop hints for a sequel, which cannot come soon enough; my hope is that it will carry the existing bar of excellent, and push further by promoting more dramatic, more experimental gameplay options. That said; even just an expansion of new maps and enemies would be well worth my time.","May 24, 2014","true","93.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hope that this review will help you make your decision. The game is certainly not for everyone, but I will go into it's pros and cons shortly.\n\nFirst, I would like to adress many of the complaints I have seen in other reviews.\n\nMany seem to think that the controls are clunky. This is true- at first. after 30 minutes or so of gameplay, the controls seemed natural to me. If they really bother you, you can always remap them quite easily. I also read many reviews which stated that the jumping seemed unresponsive. The only time I have noticed this is when I have attempted to jumo when in a prone position (laying down). Otherwise, the jumping mechanic seems just fine to me.\n\nSome also complain about the reusing of maps. I can certainly see why some people may become irritated by this, but it doesn't bother me. Since you're always completing a different mission, the maps do not seem too repetitive.\n\nLet me just say that Mercenary Kings is a fantastic game that deserves a lot more attention than it is currently getting. The retro-style gameplay combined with the endless weapon customization makes for one of the most enjoyable gameplay experiences I've had. The character animations are worthy of an award, and the maps and backgrounds look fantastic. I'm not too far into the campaign, but so far it has been fantastic. At first, it may seem overly difficult, but if you just do some part swapping with your gun, you should be fine. I will update this review with some of my favorite beginner weapon setups soon.\n\nThe only thing I have found irritating about this game is the lack of a chat menu in multiplayer games. This is extremely minor, however, and will most likely be fixed in a later update.\n\nOverall, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a great retro-style gaming experience. It's well worth the $20. I hope this review was helpful to all of you ladies and mentlegen.\n\n13/10\n\nLet's kick some CLAW!","June 21, 2014","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've ever played or seen Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World The Game on consoles, you've seen some of this guy's work already. The basic gameplay works fine enough with you jumpin', runnin', knifin' and shootin' (not diagonally though) through an assortment of levels with a bunch of goodies hidden about. When you get into the groove and master the controls it can definitely trigger some nostalgia from cartridge/arcade cabinet days of yesteryear.\n\nThe BadTo deck out those guns and upgrade your gear, you're going to have to do quite a bit of grinding for ingredients (random drop or otherwise). Expect to revisit a bunch of areas for this purpose and have to deal with monotonous mission objectives, time-limits and silly boss fights where you have to worry about tracking them down across the whole map to fight them some more until they die if you take too long. All while the timer ticks down in the background. No pressure to find your way to one of those boss arenas scattered about the maze-like maps while the boss periodically shuffles around (leading to some particularly cruel instances where you can finally make it to a boss-zone where it's at and it just walks away after three seconds) or anything. There may additionally be some problems with the game on certain monitors or comps but I didn't personally run into this myself\n\nThe UglyEven with this game's short-comings, there IS fun to be had. As such, there is definitely an audience or two to reccomend this to. Just be prepared to have a bit more Monster Hunter in your Metal Slug sandwich than you perhaps initially bargained for.

"Pixel-art"-like graphics are, in my opinon, a standard for this kind of games, and it suits very well with the features and gameplay it offers (even animated boobs, no jokes).\n\nGamplay\nEasy to learn, pretty easy to master (at least master on specific type of weapon / ammo). I personnaly used an xBox 360 controller from the very beginning, so I cannot relly talk about the Keyboard / Mouse controls.\nControls are intuitive, and even if it's not at the beginning, you really have the time to master it.\n\nMercenary Kings is quest-based, with a "Hunting ground" (aka time / quest-free zone) where you can hunt animals and such to get missings compenents for your gear.\nIt offers a crafting system for your guns. You have to build from components a parts of weapons, then you can assemble whatever part of any gun you like together, it will make a working gun (probably not as working as you expected).\nSome weapons have a certain "synergy", making you able to use special ammo (6 differents types) like shrapnels or rockets, and sometimes two of them at the same time (piercing rockets, omfg).\nYou can also build knifes, which I thought to be unless, does really matters from middle to end-game.\n\nThere's equipable "mods", which makes you carry more, run faster, shoot elemental bullets, or even makes you insensitive to certain elements.\n\n\nI don't really want to talk about the rest of the features, since it would probable spoil a bit.\n\nMultiplayer\nI didn't test multiplayer yet, I will update this review as soon as I tested it.\n\nGeneral impressions\nLike I said, probably the best Shoot'em up I've ever played. I did finish the last mission, but I would really enjoy play this more. There's a really great amount of quest, stuff to craft, secrets to discover, and all kind of things.\nI didn't find anything that really upset me here.\nI'm kinda sad I couldn't test multiplayer yet, but as I see it, it would be as epic as the rest of this game.\n\nNote: 10/10. (Really.)\n\nN.B.: As a non-native english speaker, I apologize for any mistakes / bad words or such in this review.","November 9, 2015","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it would be much more accurate to describe this game as something very similar to Mega Man or Cave Story that is wearing Metal Slug's clothes.\n\nThe plot consists of...  Um...  Mutant mandrake plants...  Some typical generic bad guys...  Doin' some stuff...  Bad stuff...  Something something elite team of super-juiced mercenaries are gonna kick some ♥♥♥!  Okay, so, the story isn't where the game shines.  That's really okay though.  The charm of the characters, the art, and various pop culture and gaming references is going to win you over in that department.\n\nA typical session consists of gearing up at the games's hub, Camp Crown, and then selecting a mission to play.  There are several different objective types, however all missions are mostly identical in nature.  Roam around a lovingly-created level, back and forth, for the umpteenth TIME, shooting the same handful of baddies OVER and OVER, picking up endless crafting ingredients, leaping through somewhat sluggish platforming segments, and killing a boss you've probably already fought 3 times before.  All before the time limit runs out.\n\nThen you come back to camp.  From here you get into the game's laborious crafting feature.  It is a straightforward collect-a-thon where you exchange various materials found from enemies and chests in order to build new melee weapons, armor, guns or bio-mods.  There is certainly a writhing mass of items to craft, more than I personally ever wanted.  You can create some pretty awesome guns by mixing and matching various parts (receivers, barrels, stocks, etc) and also...  Plenty and plenty of not-so-awesome guns.\n\nRinse.  Repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  AND REPEAT.\n\nAccept this mission if you...\n\nREALLY love action-platformers.  I mean... REALLY love them.  Deeply.\nCan't get enough of Paul Robertson's bouncing pixelated boobies.\nAre looking for a content-heavy action game that you can sink a LOT of hours into.\nTake the first chopper off the island if you...\n\nCan't stand grinding.  Seriously, turn back now.  Run.\nCan't stand backtracking and repetition.  You are going to be running through the same areas OVER and OVER again.\nAre averse to action platformers with a hint of RPG elements.  Uh, why are you even HERE then?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI started off loving this game.  Then liking it a lot.  Then being okay with it.  Then just desperately wanting it to be over.  Was it worth playing?  Yes, altogther I am glad I played it.  However it definitely wore out its welcome toward the end and became very needlessly frustrating.\n\nExample?  Picture running around for 20 minutes trying to complete a boss fight mission, and just as you reach one of the boss RANDOM spawn points, it retreats to another location, leaving you most likely needing to slog back the way you came, kill the dozen or so enemies you just plowed through 1 minute ago, and hop through the maze of spikes, lava, pitfalls, etc.\n\nThere is a ton of content to this game...  Too much.  I'm not normally the guy to say that, but its like being buried by stuff you can't bother with.  I have about 40 hours into this game but I've probably only unlocked less than a third of the junk to unlock.  The problem is that it can be so absolutely mind-numbing and frustrating to farm for the required ingredients that it's simply not worth it.  For the most part, the only worthwhile crafting you can do are the guns and I didn't even unlock half of those parts.  In theory it's a great system because you can mix and match different parts to create different effect and damage types.  A shotgun that shoots burning birdshot?  Sure.  An SMG that shoots corrosive bouncy balls?  Yep.  A rifle that fires wall-piercing homing bullets?  Indeed.  Unfortunately, MOST of these combinations aren't terribly useful and a lot are just absolutely useless.\n\nAnother disappointment is that despite being influenced by games such as Metal Slug and Mega Man, there are virtually NO vehicles (with only ONE very mediocre exception).  In fact, there is little to nothing to break the monotony of running back and forth between areas and shooting the same enemies over and over and OVER.\n\n*sigh\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I wanted to love this game.  I ended up liking it and still recommend it...  I just wish a lot of the redundant content was trimmed in favor of BETTER content.  The game could easily be 10 - 20 hours shorter, there could be a third of the crafting recipes that there are.  If getting rid of all that would have meant having some vehicles or missions with truly different mechanics then it would have been well worth it.  There could have been tank driving missions, a submarine boss battle that NEVER HAPPENS, or aerial segments where you shoot down enemies as you hang off the side of lovable ol' Choppy.  Instead, you are repeating a mission that you spent 30 agonizing minutes on because you couldn't find some hidden piece of junk before the timer ran out.\n\nThe ending leaves open the possibility for a sequel.  I'd love to see one done proper with a lot more variety.  For now...  It's a lovely game with loads of personality and content that just really wears thin after the first 20 hours.","April 2, 2015","true","40.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you progress, rarer hidden parts become vital to unlocking the best weapons, which offers great replayability.\n\nIt's fair to say taht the game does get a bit samey at times, and some of the levels can feel like a chore to replay, but overall I found this effect rather minimal to my enjoyment.\n\nI should also add that I bought this game on sale, and would feel more comfortable recommending it around the $10 price range, rather than the $20. Also, I think you will enjoy the game a lot more if you have friends to play it with. While the single player is great, I think the game shines at sharing your mix of weapons and working together to explore the map and bring down the bosses.","March 27, 2015","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At a glance, it may remind you of Metal Slug - and, at a very surface level, it does bring you that feeling and experience, however, MK is far more than that.\n\nMK introduces several new and refreshing concepts to the classic run-and-gun platfomer.  As you defeat enemies, you pick up material drops.  These are used to craft weapon and armour upgrades, knives, and well as character "perks" if you will.  Though I'm not through the game, there are probably thousands of unique weapon configurations that can be created by mixing and matching different parts that you have created.  Armour upgrades are much more vanilla, a simple "material for boost" trade.  Armour upgrades are linear, and one-piece progression.\n\nWeapon crafting deserves a bit more talk.  The gun consists of several different parts, each of which may effect weight, range, power, clip-size, shot distance, reload speed, and special effect (armour piercing, caustic, electric, etc.).  Each part also has its own designed graphic which shows up as you play.  This allows some pretty zany and custom options for you to pick from.  You may also choose to build your gun as a "set" by picking each piece that matches the same name - there are some advantages to playing that way as well.\n\nAs for missions - there are A LOT of them to get through.  Missions are based on a few categories.  You've got your side quests and your primary quests, but they're also broken down by ranking.  You'll need to complete the main quests of one group before the next batch of missions are unlocked.  I can't see any reason to skip the side-missions, though, as you will collect a lot of valuable resources and cash to advance through the game more smoothly.\n\nThough the price of the game may seem a bit steep, you can really tell that A LOT of work has gone into creating this title - there's more content than I can list in one sitting, and there are PLENTY of missions to keep you going.  If you can't afford the $20, I certainly suggest grabbing it while it's on sale.  There are only a few games that have piqued my interest and hooked me in as well as this one has.  Kudos to the devs.","July 5, 2014","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I was incredibly impressed by how polished and wonderful it looks (because it does - it has that fantastic Metal Slug feel to its presentation), and by how fun the simple gameplay is. It's a lot of fun to traverse the non-linear levels, and most enemies are pretty fun to fight and kill.\n\nHowever, after playing for a few hours, I started to realize how much content is recycled, and how tiring it got that every mission is just a fetch quest. On the same couple of levels. This hit especially hard when I played a mission where you have to hunt down a boss that keeps escaping to different points on the level, making him almost impossible to find let alone kill (I had to find him four times in random spots before I was able to wear him down). A few missions later, they recycled the *exact* same boss and level, with the only difference being that you had to stun and capture him or something.\n\nI really wish the game didn't have so much excess padding, because it could've been one of my favorite indie titles ever. I have a few other gripes, such as the fact that it's pretty bad at explaining how all the customization works, and if you finish the main objective in a level you get no chance to finish the secondary before leaving. Also, the reload mechanic slows down the pace a lot, and makes single-shot guns very unfun.\n\nStill, it's a strong game at its core, and tons of fun outside of the annoying moments. It's not worth its full price because you're gonna get sick of it pretty fast, but on a sale for like 3-5€? Sure.","March 28, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the start you are given a game that is a mix of Monster Hunter,Metal Slug, and a dash of Gears of War. In theory this sounds quite awesome! In practice it shows how each one of these mechanics can work against each other.\nStarting with the Monster Hunter mechanic of finding loot to craft new guns, this forces the player to grind in a side scrolling shooter. At first it dose not seem to be an issue up until you face the 2nd boss in which kill you. Or in most cases, will time you out. Causes you to replay stages for better weapons because bosses in the game can run away from you if you don't kill them fast enough. Next is the two other mechanics described in which can work against each other.\nDue the reload mechanic you will be taking shots and you have no way to defend yourself. This could have been fixed with an instant reload rather than the timed reload. Adding another layer of frusteration. I tried going in wanting to love it. Even through the time on greenlight I tried holding hope. Sadly I can't say it is fun sadly. I give Mercenary Kings a 6.5/10.","March 28, 2014","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cascade_Range/recommended/218820/","Cascade_Range","Robot Maid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cascade_Range/","359 products in account","I've played this game for awhile, since Early Access. If you're a fan of games like Contra and Metal Slug, this is the game for you. The 2D run 'n' gun gameplay brings back that old retro feel for gamers such as myself.\n\nThe game itself is pretty solid with a decent bit of content. The game brings together two of my favourite games and meshes them together surprisingly well. The gameplay of Metal Slug with a gun crafting system that evokes the feeling of Monster Hunter. You even go on missions in a Monster Hunter-ish format. For those who aren't familiar with one or either of the aforementioned games, Mercenary Kings is a 2D side scrolling run 'n' gun adventure where you take on the role of "King" or "Empress", one of two members of the titular Mercenary Kings, a group of heroic mercs out to stop the dangerous organization CLAW.\n\nThe graphics, sounds, and gameplay all give that retro feel but retain mechanics not often found in older games. One such system being the crafting system where you can make an almost infinite combination of guns. Want to make a gatling gun that has the range (and possibly accuracy) of a sniper rifle that shoots acidic bullets? You can do just that. The mission difficulty curves rather well and, with over 100 different missions, this is rather impressive.\n\nThe missions themselves all follow rather basic procedures. Enter the map and fulfill objectives. These range from "neutralize" (destroying or capturing a boss target), "eliminate threat" (destroy all enemies within a certain area), "gathering" (find the specified quantity of a specified item), and more. While the objectives are more or less the same, the game manages to throw a few curve balls with special variants, such as bosses guarding target areas or different permutation of enemies in a given area.\n\nWhile this game is a great play by yourself, it's even more fun if you can play with friends. You and up to three friends can take on the evil CLAW! With this, even more possibilities open up. Do you and your friends split up and take on several objectives at once or do you stick together and back each other up? Will you all bring in LMGs and Shotguns in preparation for a lot of close quarters combat or will one of you pack a sniper and pick things off from a distance?\n\nBut not all is great for this game. While it's an amazing game either solo or with friends, playing solo does feel a little punishing. When solo, you may have to do some runs almost perfectly and that requires repeating a single mission several times (which can get dull). But with friends, it won't nearly be as bad, Missions like this, however, are few, and a little practice is always good, no?\n\nIt's definitely worth a look. This game may not be for everyone, but if you like arcade-y games like Metal Slug or Contra, this game is for you.","March 29, 2014","true","55.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is very similar to Metal Slug so it gives you that kind of nostalgia from when you played back in the arcades. Weapons are great and have so much variety. The weapon building system works marvelously and offers a wide range of funny and versatile weaponry. The fact that you have to pick up materials throughout the levels gives more purpose to explore and gain more currency. Characters in the game are colorful and are each are very useful when using thier skills to strengthen your character and help progress through the levels with ease. At this point in time, everything seems to work; havent experienced any bugs of any kind yet. The only critism that I could throw in would be to make inviting friends to join your game slighty easier. More along the lines of a joinable lobby, instead having to in game; talk to an NPC and then inviting your friends. All in all I had so much fun playing with my buddies and it was well worth the cost, even if I got it discounted when purchasing it from Humble Bundle.

We don't have any of that."\n\nThe game itself is a Borderlands style gameplay where you can play a level designed for multiple missions, but you are forced to play each mission one at a time, which seems to me like a lazy attempt to stretch out the gameplay. This also makes the only mission theme in the game grating and annoying pretty quickly.\n\nEnemies have a chance to drop junk which you can use to craft items to customize your guns, barracks, mods among other things. So quickly this becomes a game that's all about the grind. But don't worry, because you're not actually grinding when you're doing missions one at a time on giant sprawling levels, right? Some of the things you can craft are ridiculous. For example, a hamburger, pinwheel and pizza ornament all have a huge recipe of collectables (some of which can only be found in a level called the hunting grounds where you hunt harmless wildlife specifically to grind for materials) and a $1000 price tag. Even for completionists, I don't know who would have enough spare time to grind for the materials and money necessary to place an ornament of a burger in their barracks.\n\nOh man, I haven't gotten to the best part yet. You like boss battles? How about boss battles that move around giant sprawling levels for no reason? That's right, if you take too long fighting a boss, he runs out of the arena and you have to go through more of the level to find him again, sometimes he wanders off straight after you arrive! Fun! Yes, I like fighting bosses with attention defecit disorder.\n\nI'm a big fan of Metal Slug and I do somewhat moderately enjoy Borderlands, but this comes off as a horrible execution to combine the two. The deliberately stretched out gameplay and the need to grind to unlock items necessary makes this game pretty unenjoyable for me and I can't recommend it to anyone.","August 18, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are full of impressively detailed pixel art animations which match the story to give the game a lot of character. The majority of the enemies and bosses are fun to fight, and learning the sprawling level layouts is rewarding. After you beat the game speedrunning levels adds a lot of content and is thankfully pretty achievable, dependant more on knowing map layouts and enemy patterns than raw skill. The multiplayer is also really nice, but due to random matching you can get groups of folks who are very different skill/progress levels, which sometimes doesn't work out so well.\n\nThe gun crafting system is interesting and allows one to customize for their personal playstyle, but there are some combinations which are just better than most others and so are more widely used. Farming for materials shouldn't be much of an issue during the game, but the rarer end game achievements (craftsmanship, etc.) will definitely require a bit of farming.

At one point I was disappointed at the lack of new weapons as the game progressed but when I checked back again even that problem was solved with an update, the weapon count had probably doubled. So I made myself a couple of Magnum-shotguns (not making this up!), a pistol that would shoot armor-piercing shrapnel once the ammo was possible to obtain (It needs a material that doesn't drop yet, Quality Steel or something) and Anti-Materiel rounds that have yet to see a weapon that can fire them. Can't wait for the full game, I'll probably 100% it.\n\nTotalBiscuit described this game as "Metal Slug meets Monster Hunter" and I agree. The Monster Hunter part comes from all the crafting. Biomods, melee weapons, guns, ornaments... everything apart from your supplies has to be crafted from materials that drop from enemies and crates scattered across different missions and especially with some materials you WILL have to farm them. (Like those surprisingly special "regular pins".) The magnum shotguns I mentioned before required parts that only drop from big story bosses. Speaking of bosses, they are as classic as they get. Very punishing if you don't know what you're doing (the first time always hurts) but once you have their patterns down with some good reflexes it's as easy as breathing.\n\nThe keyboard bindings need some work but luckily you can bind any key to whatever you want. I recommend using a controller, though.","January 20, 2014","true","72.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These materials you could use to upgrade armor (health), build mods (add effects to your character), and craft gun parts which you could then customize the look and functionality of your gun.\n\nSo far, it's only early access.  It only has 60 missions, but later will have 100.  Hopefully we get to see more options for your gun, like choose the shooting tiype (like rapid fire, spread, etc).

The platforming wasn't too much of a challenge but can get tedious at parts, but I never gave up.\n\nThe story was interesting, and kept me hooked on it. I rarely skipped missions just to rank up and feel like it was well worth it.\n\nCorresponding with the levels, the music was truly amazing to hear. Never did I try to turn it down to listen to something else.\n\nCo-op seems balanced, but can add much more a challenge for those unprepared. Sharing lives can become harsh and the HP buff for the enemies can be a bit ridiculous compared to the overall damage players can spew out, so be warned when playing with 4 people.\n\nMy one problem though is farming the materials you need for certain weapon parts, sometimes you have to farm for hours to get what you want, but will only make you feel more accomplished after you achieve it.\n\nOverall, this is truly a great game, with hours of gameplay to be put into it.

Right off the back, the game's art style is the major thing that caught my attention. This game's art style is very well done, one of the few positives of this game. Now the gameplay functions and works fine. It takes a while for you to understand the controls completely before going into action. Now my biggest gripe about this game is the gameplay and level design itself. For starters, the first missions prove to be more difficult than I'd imagined for the first ones in the game itself. The game gives little to no indicators of what you're doing and where you're supposed to go; so you have to back-track over and over again. The first level itself is terribly bland and average in design, and enemy placement is a whole other story. Sometimes enemies will be placed in the most inconvient places, and will force you to take huge amounts of damage. As an insult to injury, you will lose a chunk of money you will earn by completing the mission. When you die too many times the mission will end and you will be taken back to the main hub. It seems like the game is punishing you by not giving you any variety of weapons to buy, even at the first three missions, making it incredibly difficult to beat any of the missions. I don't know how the game is further in deph, since I dropped my controller and turned it off after attempting the first three missions and failing all of them at least twice. Overall I do not recommend this game to anyone who will play it alone, it is clearly meant for co-op, if they can even manage to scrape the surface of the first three missions.","July 1, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gun customization is fun, and it controls and plays very well, sadly level and enemy design are not up to snuff to make it all come together.\n\nThe source inspiration for a title like this seems obvious to most players, but I don't know if the developers really got into what made those games work.  The graphics are great, building guns is fun and shooting enemies is entertaining.  The biggest complaint you'll see for Mercenary Kings is that it is too easy.  And this is true.  The enemies are placed in ways that make them easy to dispatch, and the ones that shoot don't do it enough to be threatening.  It's rare to have even two projectiles on the screen at a time, let alone enemies.  Even with that handicap on their part, your character can take multiple hits AND increase their health later on.  Because of this, the most dangerous parts of the game are the very rare pitfalls that actually kill you.  The game ramps up a bit towards the end, but considering how comotose the first five ranks are its just a little too late.\n\nNow, I put this as not recommended but that's only because there is no 'on the fence' option.  On one hand the game is entertaining enough and has an enjoyable art style, and on the other I can't lie and tell you this is a game you are going to remember.  I would consider this a casual side-scroller, and honestly that isn't a game I would recommend.  If you have no hands you may find this game challenging but this is something you play when an alternative would be to take a nap.","April 20, 2014","false","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keys for reset, confirm, and exit were all bound in real time, there are no limitations on key conflicts, and sometimes the keys just seem to plain screw up. Had confirm reseting controls, reseting controls after rebinding reset controls would never reset, and there was no master reset option as well as controls being held outside of player profile. 2 minutes and I permanently broke my control setup, dear lord, resinstalling now.

I hope that this review will help you make your decision. The game is certainly not for everyone, but I will go into it's pros and cons shortly.\n\nFirst, I would like to adress many of the complaints I have seen in other reviews.\n\nMany seem to think that the controls are clunky. This is true- at first. after 30 minutes or so of gameplay, the controls seemed natural to me. If they really bother you, you can always remap them quite easily. I also read many reviews which stated that the jumping seemed unresponsive. The only time I have noticed this is when I have attempted to jumo when in a prone position (laying down). Otherwise, the jumping mechanic seems just fine to me.\n\nSome also complain about the reusing of maps. I can certainly see why some people may become irritated by this, but it doesn't bother me. Since you're always completing a different mission, the maps do not seem too repetitive.\n\nLet me just say that Mercenary Kings is a fantastic game that deserves a lot more attention than it is currently getting. The retro-style gameplay combined with the endless weapon customization makes for one of the most enjoyable gameplay experiences I've had. The character animations are worthy of an award, and the maps and backgrounds look fantastic. I'm not too far into the campaign, but so far it has been fantastic. At first, it may seem overly difficult, but if you just do some part swapping with your gun, you should be fine. I will update this review with some of my favorite beginner weapon setups soon.\n\nThe only thing I have found irritating about this game is the lack of a chat menu in multiplayer games. This is extremely minor, however, and will most likely be fixed in a later update.\n\nOverall, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a great retro-style gaming experience. It's well worth the $20. I hope this review was helpful to all of you ladies and mentlegen.\n\n13/10\n\nLet's kick some CLAW!","June 21, 2014","true","44.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The missions often take place in the same few maps, merely putting the start and finish lines in different areas.  The reload mechanic is completely out of place in a game like this.  Boss fights are the worst because said bosses will randomly leave the area and require you to track them down anew.  The music is a confused mess, unsure of whether it wants to go full chiptune or not.  The overall goal is also muddled; the game rewards you for speedrunning missions, and also for taking time to explore and fulfill extra objectives, leaving players wondering if they should just play all the missions twice.  The gun customization is really lacking; most ammo types are unavailable unless you specifically build you gun to accept them, and nearly every combination slows your character's movement to an unplayable crawl.\n\nIt says a lot about the overall quality of the game that I can still recommend it, despite these awful downsides.  However, this is a very tentative recommendation; I bet there's plenty of people out there that would take those as enough red flags to stay away from Mercenary Kings.  Just download Cheat Engine and hack yourself a huge stockpile of crafting materials, and you'll enjoy the game so much more, I promise.","July 5, 2014","true","40.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each gun part has specific stats, the parts needed to craft them consistently drop from certain foes or items boxes in a given mission. The only RNG involved is hoping a monster will drop the material you need from the 2-4 predefined drops in their loot pool.\n\nAll in all, Mercenary Kings takes old school, tough side-scrolling shooters of the past (think metal slug, contra) and blends it with more modern RPG customization elements. Gear selection in a sidescroller isn't all that new, just look all the way back to river city ransom, but the incredible level of customization you can access to make cool guns definitely gives it a modern touch and adds a lot of depth. Add an enjoyable semi-retro 2D sprite art-style, a fun story/setting that doesn't take itself too seriously, and last but not least, local and online co-op,  and you have a well-rounded game with a lot of replay value.","July 6, 2014","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, it is a fun game if you're into the Metal Slug kind of gameplay mixed with Loadout's Depth of Weapon Customization (changing head, body, bottom of a gun with sight + ammo) with the Monster Hunter's Mission Rule Set of 'Three Strikes and you're Out' and it's 'RPG-like' drop-rates. There are way too many guns to customize so experimenting what kind of gun you like is the fun part. Since this game focuses more on the 'gunplay' than any other part, if you are coming from Scott Pigrim vs. The World Video Game, the 'melee' part of the game is a bit lackluster since there are basically three different ranges of melee. Short, Medium, and SPEAR LONG. There's no 1-2-3 combo built behind them, it's only a melee swing.  The other issue is that exploring is a bit discouraging when it comes to examining what's inside the houses. 80% of examining the inside of a building results nothing. Followed by 10% Indoor Level that's fleshed out and 10% there's a guy you have to rescue in there! However, the outdoor exploration is vast and nice to roam around. Soundtrack is somewhat limited, but it's in Alpha state atm. Is it worth 15$ (current price)? If you really want Metal Slug/Run and Gun Retro-Style arcade game and miss Tribute, the same guys who made Scott Pigrim, sure give it a shot. Multiplayer makes it exponentially more fun without ruining the game. There isn't even an option mode at the moment so you have to adjust the sound through the Volume Mixer. The price tag for 15$ may sound a bit steep for the penny pinchers. 10$ would be fair, but prices excluded, the game does what it does right: Executes Metal Slug while adding Gunplay Customization that feels just right.","July 27, 2013","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One part Metal Slug, with an inventory and crafting system, with that familiar 4 player game play.  Either for a 'serious' play, or casual, it's honestly fun.  Great old school handling and the soundtrack is a nice mix of classic bit work and modern rock.\n\nThe inventory and crafting systems are pretty simple.  You need X amounts of Y materials to craft Z part for your gun.  Plus some cash.  And for those of you who like to customize and build and have MULTIPLE gun builds? They have you covered.  Everything from pistols, carbines, assault rifles, shotguns, machine guns, toilets, and trombone's (to name a few), with elemental ammo, armor piercing, buckshot.  Lots of options here for scoring some ludicrous gibs (yes!).  OH and knives too. But who needs a knife when you can build a freakin' minigun?\n\nThe game handles well, overall. You move your character, and they get there.  Feels like something taken right out of an arcade cabinet and put into your hand with such simplicity it's nuts.  Any fan of the Metal Slug franchise WILL feel right at home here.  You needn't worry.  For everyone else?  This game is quick on the uptake.  You shall find no sloppy handling here.\n\nMy one issue is that the default input is a keyboard. I would highly. HIGHLY recommend the use of a game pad.  Otherwise the keyboard controls are a bit spaced out and kindof irregular.  The gamepad makes everything RIGHT at home.\n\nOverall, for a game that's in 'early access' it feels fairly rock solid and fairly 'done'.  Yet they keep adding to and tweaking the game.   And the price tag certainly makes this a worthwhile investment.","November 5, 2013","true","44.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's easy to see where Mercenary King comes from, but it's definitely it's own game.

Gun customization is fun, and it controls and plays very well, sadly level and enemy design are not up to snuff to make it all come together.\n\nThe source inspiration for a title like this seems obvious to most players, but I don't know if the developers really got into what made those games work.  The graphics are great, building guns is fun and shooting enemies is entertaining.  The biggest complaint you'll see for Mercenary Kings is that it is too easy.  And this is true.  The enemies are placed in ways that make them easy to dispatch, and the ones that shoot don't do it enough to be threatening.  It's rare to have even two projectiles on the screen at a time, let alone enemies.  Even with that handicap on their part, your character can take multiple hits AND increase their health later on.  Because of this, the most dangerous parts of the game are the very rare pitfalls that actually kill you.  The game ramps up a bit towards the end, but considering how comotose the first five ranks are its just a little too late.\n\nNow, I put this as not recommended but that's only because there is no 'on the fence' option.  On one hand the game is entertaining enough and has an enjoyable art style, and on the other I can't lie and tell you this is a game you are going to remember.  I would consider this a casual side-scroller, and honestly that isn't a game I would recommend.  If you have no hands you may find this game challenging but this is something you play when an alternative would be to take a nap.","April 20, 2014","false","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keys for reset, confirm, and exit were all bound in real time, there are no limitations on key conflicts, and sometimes the keys just seem to plain screw up. Had confirm reseting controls, reseting controls after rebinding reset controls would never reset, and there was no master reset option as well as controls being held outside of player profile. 2 minutes and I permanently broke my control setup, dear lord, resinstalling now.

However, it would be much more accurate to describe this game as something very similar to Mega Man or Cave Story that is wearing Metal Slug's clothes.\n\nThe plot consists of...  Um...  Mutant mandrake plants...  Some typical generic bad guys...  Doin' some stuff...  Bad stuff...  Something something elite team of super-juiced mercenaries are gonna kick some ♥♥♥!  Okay, so, the story isn't where the game shines.  That's really okay though.  The charm of the characters, the art, and various pop culture and gaming references is going to win you over in that department.\n\nA typical session consists of gearing up at the games's hub, Camp Crown, and then selecting a mission to play.  There are several different objective types, however all missions are mostly identical in nature.  Roam around a lovingly-created level, back and forth, for the umpteenth TIME, shooting the same handful of baddies OVER and OVER, picking up endless crafting ingredients, leaping through somewhat sluggish platforming segments, and killing a boss you've probably already fought 3 times before.  All before the time limit runs out.\n\nThen you come back to camp.  From here you get into the game's laborious crafting feature.  It is a straightforward collect-a-thon where you exchange various materials found from enemies and chests in order to build new melee weapons, armor, guns or bio-mods.  There is certainly a writhing mass of items to craft, more than I personally ever wanted.  You can create some pretty awesome guns by mixing and matching various parts (receivers, barrels, stocks, etc) and also...  Plenty and plenty of not-so-awesome guns.\n\nRinse.  Repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  AND REPEAT.\n\nAccept this mission if you...\n\nREALLY love action-platformers.  I mean... REALLY love them.  Deeply.\nCan't get enough of Paul Robertson's bouncing pixelated boobies.\nAre looking for a content-heavy action game that you can sink a LOT of hours into.\nTake the first chopper off the island if you...\n\nCan't stand grinding.  Seriously, turn back now.  Run.\nCan't stand backtracking and repetition.  You are going to be running through the same areas OVER and OVER again.\nAre averse to action platformers with a hint of RPG elements.  Uh, why are you even HERE then?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI started off loving this game.  Then liking it a lot.  Then being okay with it.  Then just desperately wanting it to be over.  Was it worth playing?  Yes, altogther I am glad I played it.  However it definitely wore out its welcome toward the end and became very needlessly frustrating.\n\nExample?  Picture running around for 20 minutes trying to complete a boss fight mission, and just as you reach one of the boss RANDOM spawn points, it retreats to another location, leaving you most likely needing to slog back the way you came, kill the dozen or so enemies you just plowed through 1 minute ago, and hop through the maze of spikes, lava, pitfalls, etc.\n\nThere is a ton of content to this game...  Too much.  I'm not normally the guy to say that, but its like being buried by stuff you can't bother with.  I have about 40 hours into this game but I've probably only unlocked less than a third of the junk to unlock.  The problem is that it can be so absolutely mind-numbing and frustrating to farm for the required ingredients that it's simply not worth it.  For the most part, the only worthwhile crafting you can do are the guns and I didn't even unlock half of those parts.  In theory it's a great system because you can mix and match different parts to create different effect and damage types.  A shotgun that shoots burning birdshot?  Sure.  An SMG that shoots corrosive bouncy balls?  Yep.  A rifle that fires wall-piercing homing bullets?  Indeed.  Unfortunately, MOST of these combinations aren't terribly useful and a lot are just absolutely useless.\n\nAnother disappointment is that despite being influenced by games such as Metal Slug and Mega Man, there are virtually NO vehicles (with only ONE very mediocre exception).  In fact, there is little to nothing to break the monotony of running back and forth between areas and shooting the same enemies over and over and OVER.\n\n*sigh\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I wanted to love this game.  I ended up liking it and still recommend it...  I just wish a lot of the redundant content was trimmed in favor of BETTER content.  The game could easily be 10 - 20 hours shorter, there could be a third of the crafting recipes that there are.  If getting rid of all that would have meant having some vehicles or missions with truly different mechanics then it would have been well worth it.  There could have been tank driving missions, a submarine boss battle that NEVER HAPPENS, or aerial segments where you shoot down enemies as you hang off the side of lovable ol' Choppy.  Instead, you are repeating a mission that you spent 30 agonizing minutes on because you couldn't find some hidden piece of junk before the timer ran out.\n\nThe ending leaves open the possibility for a sequel.  I'd love to see one done proper with a lot more variety.  For now...  It's a lovely game with loads of personality and content that just really wears thin after the first 20 hours.","April 2, 2015","true","40.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you progress, rarer hidden parts become vital to unlocking the best weapons, which offers great replayability.\n\nIt's fair to say taht the game does get a bit samey at times, and some of the levels can feel like a chore to replay, but overall I found this effect rather minimal to my enjoyment.\n\nI should also add that I bought this game on sale, and would feel more comfortable recommending it around the $10 price range, rather than the $20. Also, I think you will enjoy the game a lot more if you have friends to play it with. While the single player is great, I think the game shines at sharing your mix of weapons and working together to explore the map and bring down the bosses.","March 27, 2015","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it would be much more accurate to describe this game as something very similar to Mega Man or Cave Story that is wearing Metal Slug's clothes.\n\nThe plot consists of...  Um...  Mutant mandrake plants...  Some typical generic bad guys...  Doin' some stuff...  Bad stuff...  Something something elite team of super-juiced mercenaries are gonna kick some ♥♥♥!  Okay, so, the story isn't where the game shines.  That's really okay though.  The charm of the characters, the art, and various pop culture and gaming references is going to win you over in that department.\n\nA typical session consists of gearing up at the games's hub, Camp Crown, and then selecting a mission to play.  There are several different objective types, however all missions are mostly identical in nature.  Roam around a lovingly-created level, back and forth, for the umpteenth TIME, shooting the same handful of baddies OVER and OVER, picking up endless crafting ingredients, leaping through somewhat sluggish platforming segments, and killing a boss you've probably already fought 3 times before.  All before the time limit runs out.\n\nThen you come back to camp.  From here you get into the game's laborious crafting feature.  It is a straightforward collect-a-thon where you exchange various materials found from enemies and chests in order to build new melee weapons, armor, guns or bio-mods.  There is certainly a writhing mass of items to craft, more than I personally ever wanted.  You can create some pretty awesome guns by mixing and matching various parts (receivers, barrels, stocks, etc) and also...  Plenty and plenty of not-so-awesome guns.\n\nRinse.  Repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  And repeat.  AND REPEAT.\n\nAccept this mission if you...\n\nREALLY love action-platformers.  I mean... REALLY love them.  Deeply.\nCan't get enough of Paul Robertson's bouncing pixelated boobies.\nAre looking for a content-heavy action game that you can sink a LOT of hours into.\nTake the first chopper off the island if you...\n\nCan't stand grinding.  Seriously, turn back now.  Run.\nCan't stand backtracking and repetition.  You are going to be running through the same areas OVER and OVER again.\nAre averse to action platformers with a hint of RPG elements.  Uh, why are you even HERE then?\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI started off loving this game.  Then liking it a lot.  Then being okay with it.  Then just desperately wanting it to be over.  Was it worth playing?  Yes, altogther I am glad I played it.  However it definitely wore out its welcome toward the end and became very needlessly frustrating.\n\nExample?  Picture running around for 20 minutes trying to complete a boss fight mission, and just as you reach one of the boss RANDOM spawn points, it retreats to another location, leaving you most likely needing to slog back the way you came, kill the dozen or so enemies you just plowed through 1 minute ago, and hop through the maze of spikes, lava, pitfalls, etc.\n\nThere is a ton of content to this game...  Too much.  I'm not normally the guy to say that, but its like being buried by stuff you can't bother with.  I have about 40 hours into this game but I've probably only unlocked less than a third of the junk to unlock.  The problem is that it can be so absolutely mind-numbing and frustrating to farm for the required ingredients that it's simply not worth it.  For the most part, the only worthwhile crafting you can do are the guns and I didn't even unlock half of those parts.  In theory it's a great system because you can mix and match different parts to create different effect and damage types.  A shotgun that shoots burning birdshot?  Sure.  An SMG that shoots corrosive bouncy balls?  Yep.  A rifle that fires wall-piercing homing bullets?  Indeed.  Unfortunately, MOST of these combinations aren't terribly useful and a lot are just absolutely useless.\n\nAnother disappointment is that despite being influenced by games such as Metal Slug and Mega Man, there are virtually NO vehicles (with only ONE very mediocre exception).  In fact, there is little to nothing to break the monotony of running back and forth between areas and shooting the same enemies over and over and OVER.\n\n*sigh\n\nDon't get me wrong.  I wanted to love this game.  I ended up liking it and still recommend it...  I just wish a lot of the redundant content was trimmed in favor of BETTER content.
