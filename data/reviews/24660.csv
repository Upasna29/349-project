If you can keep the PC on at long times then no problem using this game. This game managed to hook me pretty well quite quickly even without save: there just is something in it trying to manage a huge freight train, or trying to keep up with timetables when you move passengers. Steam or electic trains for choice, Simple toy train DCC controls or realistic CAB control modes spice up the experience well.\n\nThings go sour if you really must have save and dont have any other trainz game that saves sessions properly like Trainz 12.\nI'll be playing that game now. Working save. Better content and proper tutorials that this game lacks.\n\n","January 12, 2014","true","2.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Even sounds and actions were co-ordinated, more than I can say for Rail Simulator 2013!  Pity about lack of instructions though, but that is common in all these simulator games.

Problematic UI and lack of content are only some issues with this unoptimized mess of a game. It's good to acknowledge this is only a standalone expansion though so it explains the lack of content. If you're looking for fun, you won't get it from Trainz: Murchison 2, you can crash the trains but it doesn't do much. As for it being a train simulator, it still isn't the best option for the genre I think, though I'm not an expert. But I'd definitely say look elsewhere to spend your money unless you know the train simulator stuff and already are in love with this game type. If in doubt, don't buy this.","December 12, 2013","false","1.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
