With three people you hate. While every other driver on the road is either drunk or deliberately trying to run you off the road. And you only have one sandwich left. And no head lights. Thats basically what the first few missions feel like. After that, it only gets harder because your driver has been blighted, your navigator was killed, and the other guy ate the sandwich because he had been driven insane. Eventually, after replacing a few people, you get to the point where, after a few pit stops, you manage to get rid of them and youre happily riding along with great people, and you think nothing bad is going to happen because youve got the perfect group of passengers. Then an eightteen-wheeler smashes your car killing all of you.

To people just starting out, it can seem baffling, unfair, and deliberately obscure. To people who have been playing since Early Access, and who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsolete, the Steam reviews page is more of an extension of Reddit than anything else - a place to air grievances (legitimate or otherwise) over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time to.\n\nWhat a lot of these reviews miss out is... y'know... the actual review part. On that front, I would say the following: the core gameplay is rock solid. At its heart, Darkest Dungeon has taken a minimalist, turn-based, four-man combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair. Figuring out the best role for each of your heroes (chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes) and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying. Unlike a lot of games, it doesn't feel like there is a a ring-fenced area of "correct", vanilla play that only the very high-level players can get past; instead, you are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go. The central combat system is smart, it pushes you to experiment, and there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your own, unique creation.\n\nHOWEVER! If that's all Darkest Dungeon was, it would be a neat tablet-based distraction, but ultimately sterile. It is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue - and also the source of a lot of the frustration you'll see directed at it. As a typical RPG player, you naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your character(s), and it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure. DD refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routine, and a massive enemy critical attack, an ambush in pitch-dark while camping, or a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seemingly-unassailable position to a very desperate one. The potential for a fail-cascade is what turns off many new players, and even drives experienced ones to the occasional rage-review, but it is also vital to the fundamental risk-reward balance of the game, which is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your part.\n\nAs you progress through a dungeon, you constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of light, food, sanity and health (although they can be restored in some ways), while also trying to complete objectives and collect much-needed loot with limited backpack space. Usually, this is the sort of gameplay I dislike; feeling that there is a time-limit, that I can't plough through something at my own speed in relative safety, is an uncomfortable experience after most games. However, the actual result is some very effective tension. In a normal RPG (say... Diablo), the steady drip of ever-increasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of way, but in DD the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a  moment  rather than just a nice bonus.\n\nIt can initially feel punishing and unfair, since most gamers are hard-wired to see a hero death (which is permanent), a catastrophic turn-around, or a "tactical retreat" as a failure. Likewise, the element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewarded, like you're just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no God or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong.... It takes time to realise that you were never  meant  to have it easy, that it's  always  been a gamble, and you can't expect a perfect S ranking - all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have. It takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the game, rather than a failure.\n\nEven I rage quit every now and then - but I always come back, because, as I said, Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game. You invest (real) time and (fake) money in your group of heroes, the odds are massively stacked in the House's favour, none of your guys is going to come out unscarred, you are going to face some serious setbacks, but you return because actually making it, actually landing that last hit at the last possible moment, realising you've scraped through again, is always a surprise, and an amazing one at that.","January 25","true","257.8"," 1,265 of 1,404 people (90%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","90","265","1","43","42"

Be prepared to experience the consensus "cons"; which can be blisteringly frustrating in the early game.  If you think those things will be enough to trump the enjoyment you would get from the things the game does well, do not purchase it.\n\nThe most common criticisms of Darkest Dugeon are the inability to turn off combat animations, combat speed, dialogue animations causing you to be unable to interact with anything until completed, and RNG.  All of these things exist in varying degrees.\n\nCombat animations + dialogue have the potential to draw combat out for far too long.  The animations themselves, while cool, can start to feel really repetitive if you're having a bad stroke of RNG (missing a lot, despite a high chance to hit).  They also are very herky-jerky (there's a zoom during an animation) that leaves me feeling like I'm rocking on a boat.  If I play on an empty stomach, sometimes I feel slightly nauseous.\n\nThe chat bubbles also leave something to be desired.  They become repetitive very quickly and interupt the flow of exploration and combat.  I suspect they were included to create atmosphere, but I find they actually detract from it because of how herky-jerky they become - this causes your immersion to be regularly broken up/halted.  This is typically only an issue if your party is afflicted by negative quirks or your torchlight is dimming.  Characters become more talkative when things are going poorly.\n\nRNG.  I originally wrote that I didn't find this particularly irritating and chalked up the experience to most people just being unfamiliar with game mechanics (IE Chance to Hit, Resistances, etc).  I've chosen to recant that.  RNG is crippling, but only in the early game.  Darkest Dungeon's biggest  problem, in my opinion, is the early vs late game balance.  Early on, resources are tight.  You don't have a ton of gold that can afford you to recoup your losses if you have to abandon a mission.  You don't have a town that has been upgraded to reduce the cost of removing negative quirks/high stress levels.  Due to this, you often feel overwhelmed - particularly if you have a bad stroke of RNG (IE. You get crit multiple times early in a dungeon, multiple characters have very high stress levels from it, etc).  Later in the game, once you've upgraded your town some, prices aren't has crippling (maybe 750-1000 gold instead of 1500) AND you're getting more money from missions.  In addition, you might be able to remove quirks from 2 characters at a time, instead of just one.  As the game progresses, you almost start to feel overpowered - not in the traditional sense, as things can still go terribly wrong, but when compared to your early experience where EVERY thing feels stressful.\n\nGetting crit increases stress by 15-20.  Landing a crit reduces stress by 5-10.  Therein lies many of the inherent problems in every facet of this game.  When something goes wrong it is always nearly TWICE as punishing as the beneficial aspect of something going right.\n\nMy personal biggest qualm has to be the lack of an easy way to discern combat attack order.  There exists a "SPD" stat, which I assume is speed and I also assume determines attack order.  Rifling through each monsters' stat in an effort to figure out what will be attacking when is not an intuitive, efficient, or easy system.  It also feels like the order isn't static, as the encounter progresses the same monster isn't always attacking in the same spot (or so it seems - I could be incorrect in this claim).  The reason this is problematic is because it forces you to pay astronomically close attention/have an excellent memory of when something attacked to determine whether you should disable (stun) or gamble for a kill (powerful regular attack).  This becomes further complicated when trying to "combo" attacks.  IE. Stun with a character so another class that has an attack with a dmg increase against stunned targets can eliminate it.  Since combat positioning matters, if I stun, then my character gets pushed into a different position, and the new position renders me unable to use my bonus dmg against stunned targets attack, I have essentially wasted that initial action.\n\nBeyond some of these troubling mechanics, most of which I foresee being tweaked to be less punishing/better tuned, the game has some very neat features.  Stress, while annoying to some, was a big selling point for me.  I would like to see stress become more balanced around fight/flight.  What I mean by that is, currently, it feels like the vast majority of stress mechanics are negative.  Indeed, I would say upwards of 80% of the time my characters have become stressed they have suffered negative mechanics as opposed to positive.  I would like to see this number brought closer to 50/50.  Not to get too invested in "real life" comparisons, since this game is hardly reminscent of "real life", but stress serves a pretty strong evolutionary purpose and definitely is not something that is 80% negative (even if it has been shown to reduce your life span).  The same could be said of what happens when you "gamble" on opening chests/sarcophagus.  It feels, more often than not, like this is a greater risk than potential reward.\n\nCombat positioning and class synergy are very cool.  Unfortunately, I don't think they are explained in a proficient way for new players which leaves one floundering in the dark for quite some time.  This type of trial and error experience feels a little bit exhausting.  Perhaps the addition of a tutorial or "practice" mode that has some examples of "combos" would be helpful.  IE. a guide that says, "Try using class X ability Y following using class Z ability T".\n\nThe town is also neat.  The availability of upgrades makes it highly customizable and meaningful.  Much like the class system and synergy, though, it can feel quite confusing and overwhelming.  Resources are definitely finite early on and with so many different options and features to upgrade, I have often felt at a bit of a loss.  Discerning what is important in the early game versus what can be ignored until resources start to become plentiful in the late game is extremely difficult.\n\nI've heard some argue that upgrading character abilities and weapons/armor doesn't feel worth it for the cost.  I whole-heartedly disagree.  Upgrades are ABSOLUTELY worth it.  Sure, your damage doesn't go up astronomically, but your accuracy does.  Accuracy, to me, is probably the most important stat.  Also, they aren't that pricey as long as you invest in reducing cost - something that I think people aren't doing.\n\nClass balance could be improved.  There are a few classes that just feel worthless when compared to their counterparts.  I think both Plague Doctor and Leper are worthless.  Jester, other than people abusing their "stress heal" mechanic, leaves a lot to be desired as well.\n\nUltimately, this game is really about two phases of gameplay.  Early game is soul-crushing and you feel like a victim to every mechanic.  When I read negative reviews, I can see why people are frustrated.  Early game can be THAT frustrating.  Frustrating to the point of wanting to smash your keyboard against the wall.  Most of these things are resolved by mid-late game, though.  If you survive early game, Darkest Dungeon opens up and becomes incredibly fun.  My hope is we will see some tuning regarding early versus late game.  I suspect we will.\n\nIf you don't think early game will be too frustrating or are willing to soldier through that frustration, pick up Darkest Dungeon.  The game is done remarkably well and, despite being in an older genre, has a lot of innovation which makes it stand out from its peers.","February 5, 2015","true","31.9"," 570 of 631 people (90%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","90","570","631","18","44"

There's not much to tell, I'm sorry to say. I came here, same reason as you – for glory, for gold. And not one man can fault me with cupidity, no. I tempted good friends, capable friends, spewing that very promise, HA, and don't let them tell you, CONVINCE YOU, that their hands were forced. They came willingly, yes.\n\n“Like pigs to the slaughter.\n\n“The first month was uneventful at the estate. Harried heroes came and went, but my friends and I were heartier fare. We spent what treasures we pilfered on libation, often causing a ruckus in the tavern. New adventurers would swagger in, ♥♥♥♥♥ure, and we'd put them right in place. We'd usually frighten the greener ones off... the rest would perish, often crying out – for God, for their mother, for the sweet release of death. Fools.\n\n“My friends and I, we don't adventure anymore. We tend the estate, greet would-be heroes such as yourself, to give fair warning. All your skills, all your learning, all your experiences past mean nothing here. You will die, likely alone and raving in the dark. Death is all that you can count on. Death is all you will know.\n\n“What, my necklace? No, these are no ordinary charms, child. These are my friends, you see. I carry them with me still, even after death. They quiet my mind, when the dark comes, you see. It was the least I could do; their bodies gave me sustenance – their bodies give me sustenance, HA, and don't let them tell you, CONVINCE YOU, that their hands were forced. They came willingly, yes.\n\n“And so will you.”\n\nDarkest Dungeon is an RPG turn-based roguelite dungeon crawler – and yes, I've written this phrase so much it autocorrects genres without prompting. I've named my dog “RPG turn-based roguelite dungeon crawler” and he hates me. But I digress. Story is that your wealthy relative has died, not before sending you a letter, urging you to come to the ancestral ♥♥♥♥ hole to spruce things up and purge the ancient, unknowable evil that lurks, broods, and taints up the place like an unruly teenager. The game starts off with a neat little tutorial, explaining some of the nuances of gameplay: tactical placement of characters, attacks, effects, etc. These are all standards we've come to know and love in the genre, nothing out of the ordinary. But there are a few twists that set Darkest Dungeon apart.\n\nWhen you set out on a journey you'll select your adventurers, and there are a lot to choose from. Some are tanks, some are roguish, some are healers, and some suck (stupid damn plague doctor I HATE YOU SO MUCH). You can select your character order as well, and right clicking on a portrait provides insight into their ideal placement. Different heroes provide different bonuses, like scouting ahead to spot traps and treasure. After you pick your team you'll need provisions, a risk and reward proposition...  are you detecting a pattern? You'll need food for characters, particularly on the longer treks (there's even a camping/survival mechanic to replenish health and stress for such undertakings), or they're liable to starve. You'll need torches  to light the way and keep characters from intermittently having nervous breakdowns. And you'll need various health items to keep bleed and blight effects in check. Does this sound like a lot to juggle? Because I am not doing the death-defying, chainsaw spinning, greased up, foot juggling spectacle justice, I assure you. There aren't enough words. After your quest these provisions don't carry on to the next journey, unfortunately. So do you risk spending too much, or spending too little? Both carry consequence.\n\nBut there's more.\n\nEvery hero and heroine has a stress bar beneath their health. With each enemy encounter, trap, and the act of WALKING, the adventurers will accrue stress. This is countered by killing blows, critical hits, and some support abilities. Inevitably someone will reach their breaking point after one too many knock knock jokes and one of two things will happen: they'll rally courageously, lowering their stress and everyone elses, or become afflicted. This affliction, whether it be cowardice, masochism, irrationality (and more!), means you won't always be in control of that hero, often to their detriment and the team's.\n\nAfter you clear (or flee) a dungeon you return to the estate, a hub where your weary adventurers can get some much needed R&R. Mirroring the core gameplay, your decisions in the hub world are deeply tactical. Some characters are religious, and will only be willing to visit the abbey to relieve stress. Others will happily drink and gamble their sorrows away. And as less savory quirks develop (buffs and debuffs gained through adventuring and R&R, separate from affliction), you can send them to the sanitarium, where presumably all the fun is. All of this is costly in time and money, and you'll have to manage carefully. Fresh heroes and heroines are wheeled into town after every adventure, but they are newbly in nature. With each subsequent successful quest, estate properties unlock, providing you the ability to upgrade abilities, armor and weapons, survivor traits, and more (you can upgrade your town's buildings to improve their respective output). Expect to spend a lot of booty.\n\nAfter enough victories more procedural dungeon locales unlock, bosses become available to fight, and the game gets tougher. I'm not joking when I suggest that YOU, the player, will experience every quirk, affliction, and solace your characters do. I was paranoid. I was stalwart. I was masochistic. I was even hagiophobic (the last time a game introduced me to such cool vocabulary was Eternal Darkness). That is an accomplishment. And it was all worth it, every second of crawling, creeping madness, to play this game.\n\nIt's only February 2015 and this will easily be a contender for GOTY, of that I have no doubt. The art direction is spectacular; beautiful and visceral at the same time, like an old, dusty, medieval anatomy book. The turn-based attacks are so cool, so varied. The enemies are bizarre, terrifying, and menacing. The heroes and heroines are flawed, heroic, almost real. The dungeon crawling is rewarding, the victories are often bittersweet, and the office cooler conversation potential of this game is off the charts with so many variables. But the narration, sweet tap dancing Allfather, Allmother, and every Allrelative in between, the narration is amazing. It's omnipresent, in the hub and dungeons, raising hopes and dashing them in dulcet tones. It's like Vincent Price and Paul Frees' (Disney's Haunted Mansion) voices got married and Cthulhu officiated.\n\nI have a few teeny, tiny criticisms. The game can be unrelentingly punishing at times, unfair even. And while there is no fail state per se, things can get so bad that you'll want to just restart. I'd like the option to play a game in which I can save. XCOM has a save mode AND  an Ironman mode, and I'd prefer that option here as well. There are also little technical glitches here and there, grammatical and spelling errors occasionally. That's about it. That's the sum of my complaints. I'd like to be able to save and there are a few little errors. And this title is in Early Access, which means we can anticipate lots of fine tuning and HOPEFULLY some cool additions as well. But what's already here, what's already been done, is spectacular.\n\nIt would be a grave crime against the Elder Gods to pass this up, and madness will surely follow.","February 3, 2015","true","131.6"," 675 of 768 people (88%) found this review helpful 208 people found this review funny","88","675","768","208","18"

Here's why: because I would very, very highly recommend this game... to a certain breed of gamer. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, the good.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a masterfully crafted game. The artwork is beautifully grotesque and animation is smooth. The game is balanced fairly well, even if it is balanced towards the "hard" end of the spectrum. Even in early access there is nothing about this game that feels sloppy or poorly considered.\n\nThe stress mechanic, in which your characters accumulate stress which can affect them in various negative (and sometimes even positive) ways, is a really interesting idea and something that you don't really see a whole lot in video games. The only place I've seen anything like this before would be the Cthulhu games, and I honestly feel like it's handled a lot better here.\n\nOh, and the fact that it's constantly auto-saving, while intended to prevent save-scumming, also has the effect of allowing you to quit and pick back up whenever you want without losing progress, great for people who don't have a lot of time to sit down and play a game.\n\nThe game wasn't my cup of tea (I'll get to why in a minute) but I can't honestly call it bad just because of that. It's not bad. In fact...\n\nKR Rating: [5] GREAT\n\nBut wait, don't stop reading yet, because now it's time for the bad. As I said before, Darkest Dungeon is a hard game.\n\nWell, no, that's not really accurate. Etrian Odyssey is hard. That's why I like that series, and it's why I thought I would like this game too. Darkest Dungeon is not hard, it's unfair.\n\nSee, you can be riding high one minute, dominating every encounter and getting a ton of good items from the various chests and cupboards (called "curios" in the game) that litter the dungeons. Then you get into that one battle. You know the one I mean. It's the one that doesn't even seem like it should be all that hard. It's the same enemies you've been wasting with ease this whole time. Except this time you do nothing but miss your attacks over and over, while they stack critical hit upon critical hit. Before you can even click the "retreat" button half your force is at Death's Door... or through it. It's a little like Dark Souls in a way.\n\nAnd the thing is, that's not an accident. I said this game was masterfully crafted and it honestly is. This isn't poor game balance, it's the entire point. It's the underlying design philosophy of the game.\n\nThe developers never intended this to be a game where you train up max level badasses and retake the estate.  There are no badasses in the Darkest Dungeon. There are no heroes.\n\nNo, this is a game where you recruit expendable idiots by the wagon-load (literally) and send them to die for the greater good. (This is also why there are so few levels of upgrades for your characters: so that restarting when your top character dies is easier.)\n\nThat's why I say, I really wish that Steam allowed more options than just "recommend" or "not recommend." Because, on the one hand, the game is very well made. It has become exactly what I feel the developers wanted it to be. It is a GREAT GAME.\n\nBut "great" and "universally enjoyable" are not the same thing. A lot of people don't like hard games. I do like hard games and even I was turned off by the unfairness and the inability to properly take care of my people.\n\nIf I really had to choose (and for the purposes of the Steam version of this review I kind of do) I would say that I don't recommend the game, if only because I think the number of people who would enjoy it are in the minority.\n\nThat said, if you're the type who thinks you might enjoy that then by all means buy the game right now. It's only $19.99 USD on Steam right now, and for that you get one Hell of a solid classic-style RPG with an interesting twist.\n\nIf you're more like me and you get attached to your characters and don't want to see them die (or if you just don't like hard games) then skip this one.\n\n(Read the review on Knight's Reviews by clicking here.[knightlyreviews.blogspot.com])","October 1, 2015","false","10.4"," 1,682 of 2,032 people (83%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","83","682","2","55","62"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slaya47/recommended/262060/","slaya47","abcismasta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slaya47/","279 products in account","I feel like I have to post a new review because all of the reviews that are pre-December, site problems that have been addressed. Red Hook released a huge bug fix and ease of use patch that was specifically designed so that players who dislike certain mechanics (like the stress for "delaying" a fight) can just turn them off. Red Hook is a company that does pay attention to the player base, the problem is that the player base is greatly divided. There is also an extremely vocal minority running a massive smear campaign on the internet, going so far as creating new steam accounts for the sole purpose of going through every positive comment and marking them unhelpful. While I don't want to get into that, if you want, you can absolutely find information about it.\n\nNow that the game is released, you may have seen a certain top review, I urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks (which includes the time since the game was actually released), and notice that he has not played the game since the release, which means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved. He has been attacking the game for months, and was (as far as I can tell) initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic vision, please keep this in mind when considering your purchase.\n\nThis game is amazing, and I've been playing since early summer. It has come incredibly far, and anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgements, or flat out lying. Darkest Dungeon has XCOM levels of difficulty. It has XCOM level "WTF" moments. Occasionally you will miss 99% chance to hit attacks, and occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings. But just like XCOM, through base building and experience, you can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThis game is challenging, but not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe. Most of them say things like "The devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy" or "the game is anti-fun now", but in reality, I haven't met any players new to the game that have problems with it. This leads me to believe that throughout the development of the game, players found certain strategies that were drastically over-powered (which is why in the discussion boards, there are players that rant about the game being too easy), and the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies (which in any other game would be considered a "balance patch", but apparently in this game, people think it is intended to be "fun-killing"). One of these strategies (early on) was to get 4 of the same class, and use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything. This is no longer possible. This seems like a reasonable balance patch to me.\n\nI'm really disappointed that I have to write this review in this fashion. There is no reason I should be justifying the game against the recent torrent of bad reviews. This is an amazing game for anyone who likes strategy and/or Lovecraft. I have 300+ hours for a reason, you might not get that much time out of it, but for context, out of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeons, I didnt hit level 2 until 80ish hours. I really hope you give this game a chance.\n\nEdit: Due to some feedback, I would like to make something clear, this game is not XCOM. It does not have XCOM's production value or quality, and it is not worth 60 dollars. It is certainly worth it's current price tag, and buying it on sale is a no brainer.\n\nRelease Edit: Now that the game is out, I can say that the devs really came through, they added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release.

Your monument to success here is built atop a mountain of failures. And that mountain will be staggering. Your characters will die, either going down swinging valiantly or from something extremely stupid because the entire world was out to get them at that particular moment. Learn to cut and run and use the resources you gained to upgrade your various systems in town to better maintain the next batch of troops. Sometimes you're just using recruits as stepping stones to get more upgrades to maintain your main fighting force, who are still traumatized from their last incursion or who are getting their negative traits tortured out of them in a medieval sanitarium. The game is designed around this, it expects you to do this, and it will passive-aggressively chide you for doing it. You burn through more recruits than a standard game of XCOM: UFO Defense, and that's an accomplishment.\n\nSo despite all the suffering, is the game good? Extremely. It is remarkably complex, difficult and addicting. You will almost never have an ideal scenario, so you have to learn to adapt to every scenario, learn who or what is worth investing in, and work towards that as your goal. Another body in the ground is another cobblestone on your road to success, and expect the ground to be littered with more corpses of adventurers than you will remember. To you it was the most important day in your life when you saw your companions die from a heart attack, bleed to death, and get mangled by a buzzsaw, but for me, it was Tuesday, and soon enough, it will be Tuesday for you as well.\n\nGrim/dark","July 5, 2015","true","211.3"," 244 of 276 people (88%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","88","244","276","42","4"

I picked this game up right after its release and unlike most people I like it now more than I did before, allow me to explain why this game is easily worth the $20.\n\nFirst of all you won't like this game if you fit into the following two categories:\nIf you don't like turn based games or RPGs this game isn't for you, pretty strait forward.\nIf you don' like a challenge, and I mean a real challenge, if you put most of your games you play on easy and then prance through them congratulating yourself on a stellar job this game will bury your pride along with your party of heroes pretty fast. Its hard.\n\nWhy do I like this game (the pros):\nThe narrator is great. fits the mood so well and makes everything come to life with the expansive vocabulary and deep timbre.\nThe artwork. Its superb, every review out there whether positive or negative will say it. It has the best art of any game I have seen a long time and like the narrator it helps the world come to life. The animation, though minimalist, is beautiful and powerful and really helps you feel the game. The sound is also great and helps build mood as it changes depending on how dark it is in the dungeon. At pitch blackness you hear the squeals, groans, shouts, or other sounds of the dungeon enemies off in the distance and during battle the music is louder and more ecstatic, making everything so much more tense. The aesthetics of this game alone make it work and suck you in, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg.\nThe gameplay (I said it, and I'll talk about why other people be hating later). I have always loved tactical turn based and this game is the cream of the crop. There are so many options when it comes to how to defeat your opponents. The enemy monsters are varied and that determines the tactical choices you make. It is brutally unforgiving and thus it takes actual planning to get a good hero lineup and execute with top efficiency; however no hero, ability, trinket or consumable is overpowered (some people say monsters are overpowered... but I'll get to that later). and there are so many ways and lineups to be used to clear dungeons. The tactical battles and overall strategy (the economy, stress heal, and leveling up) go hand in hand.\n\n\nSo why are other people not suggesting the game?\n\nYou can scroll through all the negative reviews but you only really need to read one to read all it basically: "the patch ruined everything." But yet I don't buy into that train of thought and I will explain why:\nPre-corpse and hound patch the game way simply too easy, it was all over the forums too. "This game is too easy its boring" or "after early game its a walk in the park" were the complaints. Unlike currently there was an "overpowered" strat where they would take a crit loaded team with two powerful front line hitters and two back line supports into a dungeon, snuff the torch, and then go ham destroying the front line enemies thus exposing the back line enemies while the supports buffed them up to hit even harder. Battles could be over in two turns. Heroes that didn't work into that formula were never used, like the grave robber, plauge doctor, crusader and bounty hunter. Yes every hero was viable but nothing could clear dungeons like a crit loaded dark run (they also gave you the most gold because as the dungeons get darker the more gold you can find).\n\nThe Corpse and the hound added two unique mechanics that threw off the crit loaded dark runs. The first was corpses. Now when you kill and enemy his corpse remains, meaning that the weaker back line enemies can stay safely in the back line and keep throwing their stuff at you. This screwed over the crit-dark runs because now you had to hack through an enemy and then hack through his corpse to clear a path the back lines, making the battle go longer and thus their crit-dealing heroes took more damage.\n\nThe second mechanic added was PROT or protection to enemies, heroes had always been able to get PROT by the means of a trinket but it was never that big a deal (why would you get a PROT trinket when you could just get a trinket that would boost your crit chance for your crit-dark runs?) PROT basically mitigates damage taken, and now that enemies had it (some had very high amounts) it took the crit-dark run damage dealers a few turn to hack through what used to be an instant kill. Both these additions made battles last longer but also opened the space for new mechanics and strategies. now dark runs were much more risky because of the amount of damage you could rack up (in the dark monsters hit harder and more accurately). But an added mechanic was the DoTs (damage over time affects) like poison and bleed completely ignored PROT and if you killed an enemy with DoTs it didn't drop a corpse. The heroes that had DoT's were the heroes that were considered useless before the patch, they didn't become super overpowered they simply became an actual option that could work.\n\nBasically "the patch" made the game harder and that cause a lot of long time players that had forgotten difficulty and were (to use game analogy) "fattened by decadence and luxury" to rage because they were unable to adapt. People say things like "This game used to be a gem and now I would recommend it to ANYONE!" the unfortunate thing is that if the game had had these mechanics since the beginning everyone would have loved it due to the difficulty. And even if you are scared by all the "the patch ruined everything" reviews, know that the developers knew this would happen. In the corpse and hound patch notes they said at the end that "we will be tweaking these mechanics because we won't know the exact results until after implementation" and they have as of 8/18  nerfed enemy protection and made corpses weaker.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nI love this game, and the devs, Its only gotten better for me. I encourage anyone looking for a challenging game that will pull them into the lore and world to look past the negative reviews that all say the same thing. I wrote this review because I feel obligated to let everyone know why some people are mad. At the end of the day, despite the "patch" or PROT I thoroughly enjoy this game and recommend it to anyone remotely interested.\n\n10/10 would go stalwart again.","August 18, 2015","true","147.6"," 502 of 619 people (81%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","81","502","619","22","113"

Obviously, I was familiar with and intruiged by DD for its excellent art style already, but generally I am the type to wait for something to be complete before I give it a shot. However the sea change from unabashed praise to seemingly universal criticism was so comically severe you'd have thought the game had actually reached out and harmed them.\n\nSo thank you, dear, angry, entitled, (imo) wrong-headed (but certainly allowed to have and express your opinion, which you most certainly do, oh yes, you do...) players, for without your concentrated, delerious ire I may not have discovered one of my favorite games of last (and now this) year! For me, everything about this game is a win. The art, animation, music, sound design, narration, and general presentation are all top-notch. The prose itself is a particular highlight, as is the tongue-in-cheek brutality and general tone. To me, they really nail it.\n\nIt's hard for me to address the criticisms leveled at the gameplay itself, because it seems to me the game is pretty straight forward about what it intends to be. DD is a procedurally-generated, turn-based dungeon crawler with an emphasis on difficulty (with reference to Dark Souls) and light RPG elements and squad-management (with reference to modern X-Com).\n\nI concede that this can be considered grindy. Dungeon crawlers are generally grindy, even great ones like Dungeon of the Endless or Legend of Grimrock. The distillation of the various aspects of the form, the massive selection of character classes, buffs, debuffs, monsters, the writing, the aesthetic, these come together to give it something more than the sum of its parts. However if you don't enjoy that core to some degree or other, I don't know why you'd be considering this anyway.\n\nPersonally, I never had a problem with corpses, because I never played the game without them. Over 50+ hours, I managed to beat a number of the bosses, level characters up to the top tiers, etc, ect, and only stopped because I felt like I had gotten far enough where I was ready to play the game in a finished state, and didn't want to master too much. I also died a lot. Then I died some more. And it was fun the whole time!\n\nAs the year went on and waves of negative Steam comments continued to roll in, I felt like I was inhabiting a completely different universe from those players. As they railed against it getting harder and harder, for example, I found myself reflecting that the game seemed to be being tweaked to make it easier. I certainly wasn't dying as much. Maybe I was just somehow very good at it? I don't know. I still die all the time in X-Com. I don't think of myself as a master gamer or tactician.\n\nThe other critique I saw a lot, which is one that really prompted me to put my words out there in defense of this thing and those involved in crafting it, is that the devs somehow didn't care about the criticisms, that they don't listen, or that they were corrupt, or that they had abandoned the project like does actually occur in the Early Access community, that this game was somehow some kind of scam. That's just ridiculous. There were three major updates from the time of my purchace to the end of the year, which added all kinds of content in various ways. They were constantly tweaking the game to find the balance that worked. They were communicative, and they were clearly listening and being involved (and also making the game, for goodness sake, cmon).\n\nGetting back briefly to the Great Corpse Outrage 2k15, for example, corpses were made a voluntary opt-out in the options menu pretty much from Backlash Ground Zero. Not that a developer has any reason to do something like that, but to then deny that it happened, or to say that they don't listen, that they're somehow scamming you, that the game is ruined forever is just a hysterical, petulent, garbage argument. I can't understand what this aspect of the community actually wants, for the life of me. If the game isn't for you, you certainly don't have to play it. But a certain amount of the negativity (which borders on outright hostility) strikes me as being like that guy who orders and eats the burger and then complains to management it wasn't cooked to his liking. Still, you have to admire (if not boggle at) their conviction, and their sheer verbosity of it all.\n\nFor me, this game actually sold me on the idea that Early Access could be an enjoyable, worthwile process of participating in the honing of a project that you enjoy and want to support and I couldn't be happier with my decision to do so, and I look forward to playing it for another 50 hours or longer. Hopefully this small review will serve as some kind of counterpoint and let those bored few who got this far know that there's a worthy, enjoyable, wonderfully-crafted experience at the center of everyone's opining.","January 19","true","95.0"," 1,315 of 1,685 people (78%) found this review helpful 215 people found this review funny","78","315","1","215","271"

I did hit a bit of a burnout with the game (not suprising given the 36 play time in something like 70 real life hours).

If the situation was dire, I'd do my best to get the sane ones back to my sanctuary to get them ready for the next run.

However I took the plunge with this one, and at 40 hours (to me personally) I am very satisfied with my purchase.\n+ Updates: Game has only been out 6 days, so can only speak for that time.

Before I might have shrugged this off, assuming it was simply clever writing done to help set an ominous tone. But I’ve played enough of this game to know that this is more than just a line, it’s a warning.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a fantastically illustrated roguelike dungeon crawler with a sense of style unlike any game I’ve ever seen before. The gothic-inspired visuals are extremely appealing and are paired perfectly with a haunting soundtrack as well as one of the best narrating voices I’ve ever heard in a game. Beyond this impeccable atmosphere and great writing there lies a game that is incredibly fun and addicting.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple; you have inherited the estate of a deceased relative and now must enlist the aid of various adventurers to help you explore the dungeons that lie below your land. In order to do so you must build up a network of these heroes and send them into the dungeons, four at a time, to complete various tasks. Achieving the quest at hand requires a bit of thought as you must take into account various aspects which your success hinges on. This includes your heroes, their mental and physical well-being, their equipment, and the supplies they are carrying to help aid them and keep them alive.\n\nThere are a variety of classes of heroes to choose from, each with their own unique abilities that bring a different advantage to your group. Your heroes travel through the dungeon in a line, and their placement in that line dictates what abilities they can use and what positions they can attack in the enemy’s line. You must ensure that you are using heroes that are best suited for the dungeon and/or boss you are about to face and have them arranged in a way where their abilities will not be hindered.\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of Darkest Dungeon is the affliction system, which dictates the psychological state of your heroes. Every hero has a stress bar which displays their current stress level. If their stress level gets too high, they will respond physically to their emotional state. In rare cases this might actually give them a bonus, but in most cases it will cause a penalty which will negatively affect your chances of making it out of the dungeon alive. The stress system is not something to be ignored, and doing so will cause you to witness your otherwise healthy heroes to suffer heart attacks and die before your eyes.\n\nBefore even setting foot in a dungeon you must go through the provisions screen, where you will have the option to buy items to aid your heroes in that dungeon. It is important to pay attention to what dungeon you are going into; as certain dungeons will contain enemies that focus on a particular type of damage. By paying attention to these things you can better equip your heroes with supplies that will prove useful while saving your hard earned gold. It is worth noting that the items bought here do not carry over if you are left with a surplus at the end of the dungeon. This might be an annoyance to some, but I think it adds a bit more strategy to the game as it forces you to find a balance in how you handle your money.\n\nWith the game saving automatically as you go along, there’s no ability to fall back on save-scumming to avoid disastrous situations. A mistake in planning can prove to be fatal, causing you to lose not only your heroes that you spent precious time leveling, but also the rare trinkets you had them equipped with. In order to avoid this heartache you will likely find yourself consulting outside sources for information about the boss you are about to face. Making an effort to think ahead and plan can help get you through some of the most difficult encounters. Progressing past the more difficult fights gives an immense feeling of success that I believe only comes with games that actually challenge you.\n\nI truly love this game and can’t recommend it enough to those who will not let death deter them but will instead soldier on to the next darkest dungeon.","April 22","true","103.4"," 315 of 392 people (80%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","80","315","392","17","19"

To summarize, Darkest Dungeon used to be significantly easier. Before the devs bumped up the difficulty I only had a handful of characters die, and I knew people who managed to get characters up to their highest rank without ever suffering a death.\n\nThe changes the devs made are not unfair. New mechanics were added to prevent players exploiting situations to fully heal every battle, and existing mechanics were changed to better fit the original vision—your characters are not heroes. No matter how powerful they become, being hurt is always something you want to avoid, overwhelming stress is not something you can ever just ignore, and manipulating the formation of both your party and the enemy party is crucial to winning each battle.\n\nBack before the changes, dungeon runs required significantly less forethought, and most runs could be completed relatively painlessly. Combat took only slightly more strategy than the typical random encounter in a Final Fantasy. Now each fight is a struggle for your life, and while this certainly makes the game more challenging, that kind of challenge is what was intended from the beginning. No doubt I'll get a half dozen angry messages berating me about something or other, but oh well.\n\nTL;DR: The game used to be much easier and full of ways to manipulate the system to breeze through even the hardest dungeons. Now people are upset that it was changed to punish people for trying to use cheap exploits. It's a very challenging game, and RNG can kick your butt, but you can ALWAYS avoid permanent death by cutting your losses and abandoning a mission. You are in control. Greed and overconfidence will be your downfall.\n\nAs for an actual review, I'll be brief: the overall aesthetic is wonderfully dark, and the whole game reflects the same sinister feeling of vain hope, of struggling towards an impossible goal and clawing your way forward. Success is short-lived and defeat is painful, but the journey is fantastic. Classes are all well balanced and monsters are varied and unique. Bosses will push you to your limits. There is some aspect of grind, and leveling up a large roster of characters can be time consuming, but I enjoyed myself the whole time.\n\nIf you're on the fence with the one, the best thing you can do is stop reading reviews and watch some live streams to see if it looks like something you would enjoy. It's not for everyone, and there are a lot of different things to manage which can get tedious if you're not into that sort of thing. Still, I recommend this game to everyone I know, and it gets a big thumbs up here.","January 20","true","62.6"," 411 of 534 people (77%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","77","411","534","14","5"

The game is unapologetically difficult, with things like an automatic up to the second autosave to prevent "favorable reloads" when you get in a jam, and it was made that way intentionally. People seem to like the challenge. Even the sound is good. The price is reasonable as well.\n\nSo this isn't a terrible game, and it is still early access so things might get even better as it nears "completion" (only 3 of 5 dungeons are playable at this time).\n\nBut recently there have been several game design choices that have pushed the game from "hard but enjoyable" to "too many things that make the game tiresome", which I have been sorry to see.\n\nThey recently introduced a "corpse" mechanic, that drops when you kill a creature without using a damage-over-time attack. This was a step back for gameplay and a change not alot of people like, as it makes combat more of a chore to have to "kill things twice" in order to get at the remaining creatures. This change has made several character types less effective (those that have no DOT attacks and can only attack the closest enemies) and really made combat less fun. It also makes several character types "necessary" even if you don't want to play them. This is compounded by the fact the computer opponents for the most part can attack any of your characters from whichever position without penalty.\n\nIn addition to this, there were recent reductions to player damage, which again changed a lot of things that were "hard but fun" into a a boring slog. Damage on critical hits was reduced, making fights take longer. Creatures were given "protections" running up to 80%, making fights run a LOT longer, especially at the higher levels. Even to the point that the game "penalizes" you, for thinking you are dragging the fights out on purpose.  For some creatures, the combinations of increased protection, lower player damage, and corpses getting in the way of the flow of combat, has taken the fun out of things to a large extent. Add to that the fact that a lot of creatures will spam AOE attacks that hit your entire party, turn after turn, and again, the fun factor really takes a dive.\n\nThere are also the usual number of growing pains with an alpha title, but those will likely get worked out.\n\nAnd there is certainly time for this game to "recover" before launch. And I hope it does.\n\nBut right now it is over the line "hard but fun" into "a slog that I no longer feel like playing much".\n\nI would hold off buying at this time.","July 25, 2015","false","261.1"," 706 of 947 people (75%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","75","706","947","12","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ellbent/recommended/262060/","ellbent","ellbent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ellbent/","403 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor a lot of people, Darkest Dungeon is going to feel like the game they've been waiting for. The team behind it has done a great job.\n\nIt's impossible to discuss Darkest Dungeon without praising the beautifully stark art direction; it channels the deep shadows of Mike Mignola (of "Hellboy") perfectly, and the colors shift and suppurate everywhere from the doomed hamlet at the foot of the Darkest Dungeon to the deepest and most Godforsaken pit you'll chuck adventurers into like a wood chipper. The music deftly changes between ominous, somber, and stirring as the situation demands, and the narrator keeps the tone set wonderfully, commenting (though not annoyingly so) on every turn of fate in a Tony Jay timbre.\n\nEven putting aside the excellent and cohesive creative vision on display, the core mechanics of Darkest Dungeon are brutally satisfying. You'll begin the game tentatively sending small, untested and largely unfamiliar adventurers (I really suggest you not bother naming the poor souls yet) on short jaunts through nightmarish corridors -- keep the torch brightly lit in these beginning forays! -- in the hopes that some of them will back come out the other end with cash and relics to upgrade your town, relax and medicate your mercenaries, and keep the gears (the pulping, threshing gears) of your little dungeon-centric industry going.\n\nThe dungeons themselves are hesitant strolls punctuated by combat where every single point of health and stress counts. Darkest Dungeon keeps its numbers small: it'll be exciting when the Leper smacks a bandit for 11 damage, whether or not the Crusader heals for 4 points will be a matter or life and death, and the first time the Bounty Hunter gets a critical hit on a Marked target with Collect Bounty, 40 damage will seem miraculous. The first three-digit enemy will be more than a little worrisome. The RNG is still as fickle as ever though, so be prepared for even the best-laid plans to get ruined by bad luck.\n\nThose tools at your disposal -- the mercenaries -- are a really great puzzle in themselves, too. Where should each fighter stand? What skills can even be used where they're standing? Is it too risky to have a mercenary who's useless if he's knocked out of position by a spell or an ambush? Is having a mercenary who can act in every position going to leave him spread thin? If you put two skills on an adventurer that can only be used in the very back row, what happens if someone in the party dies and there IS no back row? Should you send a very stressed Occultist with a fresh group of mercenaries and risk him driving them ALL mad? Is it safe to send a half-useless and untested Jester with three experienced pigstickers if it means his death will ruin their morale?\n\nThis decision-making only gets worse (better) as the game goes on, and opens you up to a really great obligation to constantly shift, rearrange, retrain and reassess your bands of brethren. Missions will get longer, necessitating that your heroes stop to camp and comfort each other with incense, mockery, medicine, or prayer. As you start to get a few of your hires to a higher level of skill and bravery, sometimes so high that they'll refuse some missions as being beneath their abilities, the management of the town transforms from a largely between-dungeons concern to a much greater part of the metagame.\n\nYou'll swap afflicted but useful madmen in and out of the sanitarium and make decisions on whether it's more pertinent to cure your Bounty Hunter's accuracy-ruining case of The Yips or purge him of Deviant Tastes apparently so unspeakable he's not allowed at the brothel.\n\nYou'll wish a million painful deaths on the Caretaker because he took the last seat at the bar and your Hellion who's psychologically coming apart at the seams -- the Hellion that you NEED for the next outing -- can't relax with anything but a tall tankard.\n\nYou'll stare at the weekly report that tells you than your Crusader, who you sent to meditate his cares away, decided to leave the hamlet on a vision quest and take his holy wrath with him when otherwise your whole 'A-team' skeleton demolition crew is ready to go.\n\nThe town influences your quests into the subterranean meat grinders and vice versa. Parties that before seemed perfect will be split up because the Grave Digger needs her Rabies cured and the Plague Doctor's medicines seem more appealing when faced with the Blight-dripping porcine residents of the Warrens. It keeps the player out of complacency in a really satisfying way; fans of X-COM or other high-stakes strategy will love the feeling of having to scramble in the face of disaster or cut their losses and tell the veteran Vestal and Leper to abandon the quest as well as the bodies of their compatriots.\n\nDarkest Dungeons is a satisfying, strategic game about risk, reward, and reanimation. The dungeon crawls revitalize a task that's otherwise become almost a joke; there's no hazardous smashing through pinata baddies filled with loot here, and each time you hit 'Embark' you'll never really be sure what will be left of your party, if anything at all. The town management is a compelling game of its own, echoing "worker placement" board games and charming you as you hone blades, upgrade skills, and wrangle holy alcoholics into their barstools.\n\nThere's still some rough edges from Early Access here and there. Placeholder dialogue pops up occasionally and the central story has been held off until it's done, but even unfinished and in a mostly sandbox state both halves of Darkest Dungeon interact with other in a way that'll have you coming back for more. More, and more, and more, until in the folly of your hubris, the keening susurrations within the deepest abominable chambers beneath your lineage's empty-eyed manse ring out across the blighted land in an unendurable cacophony of gibbering and most terrible doom.","February 3, 2015","true","20.4"," 167 of 203 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","167","203","12","9"

My general rule: do not purchase pre-release games of any kind, but watching a few play throughs on Youtube peaked my interest and had me break my rule for a second time in my life. The game looked (and still looks) gorgeous, and seemed challenging and fun to play.\n\nAfter two restarts, one being a quick play through on another computer, I got the hang of the game.\n\nI so want to like this game, and while I do have hope for it in the long run, I don't recommend this game in its current state.\n\nWhat? I can't recommend the game and I still like certain things about it? Absolutely! Here's a few things I like about this product:\n\n* The art. It's beautiful, effective, and it works. The artwork was, and still is my biggest draw. Some people put what appears to be tremendous love and attention to detail in this part of the game. At about 20 hours invested into the game, I'm clear I was sold on the art work more than anything else.\n\n* This is a strategy game, not a tactical game. I get to be the invisible hand that guides the estate, running a stream of adventurers into dungeon after dungeon, building my coffers, choosing the ones I want to live, dismissing the broken, and sending the fodder to their doom. So many games bill themselves as strategy but end up being minutia based click-fests. Of the actual game mechanics, this subtle aspect is my favorite part of all gamey things found here, and I hope it doesn't get lost in the development of the game.\n\n* I am very pleased with the implementation of the stress system. The stress system gives me a subtle factor that I need to handle beyond the usual hit points. I'm more afraid of stress damage than of HP damage during combat. It's novel, and I hope that the system gets more love and attention as the game develops.\n\n* The spirit of the difficulty level is spot on.\n\nAnd yet the main reason I can't recommend the game in its current state: I don't feel there's much _game_ here.\n\nI feel that this game is the most beautifully painted set of dice that I've ever laid my eyes on. The dice talk to me, they invite me to their (slightly scary) parties. And even though I try to convince myself they're more than N-sided polyhedrons, they remind me that I'm just a useless skin bag whether I'm rolling Critical Hits or Critical Misses.\n\nBefore writing this I read reactions to the game posted here and elsewhere. I found it odd that I sided with people who were saying the game was too difficult and at the same time sided with people who said it was too easy.\n\nIn a completely non-scientific study, I took a few notes about my game play, and summarized my experience: arbitrary. The arbitrariness swings too hard, both for the good and the bad. Examples:\n\n* Earlier build than the current, but I got 4 (egads!) hunger events across 5 rooms of travel.\n* Then of course I have dungeons with zero hunger. Zero. We got meters for everything else, and hunger is a classical part of roguelike games. How about a hunger meter?\n* My first foray into a level 3 dungeon I took two level 2 people and two level 1 people. Made it almost to the end, went an extra room, and got obliterated by a really scary monster, seems fair, although I was surprised I made it so far without a hitch. Then...\n* ...my second foray into a Level 3 medium dungeon with my A-team, appropriately equipped. One non-starter room and two total and unavoidable battles in I have a death's door highwayman, a 60% stressed Hellion, and everyone not on death's door was beaten (HP wise) quite badly. This made me take a break for about a day...\n* ...and then I came back and accepted I might lose my A-team and went trekking into the dungeon a bit longer, ready at any moment to quit the mission. Almost nothing happened and I completed the quest by exploring 90% of the rooms with only minor battles. Really?\n* Then my next two dungeons with full light had like no monsters and I got lots of treasure.\n* Then I spent a frustrating dungeon with consistent 75%-100% light getting surprise after surprise and being eaten by those gnashing dogs, whatever they're called. So much bleeding everywhere, so much being surprised. I even got Rabies, not personally thankfully, but my Vestal was frothing. Had to put her down like Old Yeller.\n* Then I make it to the hag, and everything is going pretty well, but almost didn't beat the hag because I let my leader stay in the cauldron and die, and then my Bounty Hunter got thrown into the pot after the leader died, which shifted my party order arbitrarily forward, and with the load out of my guys only my Vestal could attack the hag. Almost defeated by party order, so silly.\n\nWhen I do well at things, or even just making my toddler smile (which is a feat in and of itself) I can often look back and see what worked. Despite the moments when I get frustrated, whether I lost another run in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup or lose a hand of Poker, I can often pinpoint what went wrong. But here, whether it's good or bad, it seems like the overriding factor of success or failure is out of my control. I wouldn't go so far to call the gameplay Darkest Cookie Clicker, but it's very alienating as a player. There's no joy in my successes, and losses, while frustrating, make me shrug my shoulders only to hire more bodies from the stage coach to throw back into the meat grinder.\n\nBut this game could have substance, and a lot of it, if the same love and care that went into the art goes into polishing the game and the mechanics.\n\nWith all that said, since this isn't my game, I have a qualitative request to ask the staff and developers of this product:\n\nPlease, you have so much going good for you already in early access, but my expectation was to find a game that was more solid and art/UI that was less solid. Instead I found the reverse. (Despite some UI quirks, you have a very solid UI overall, something that is no easy feat.)\n\nTake a week off, not just a weekend, regroup, and please don't just shove spot fixes in to try to fix things. Please step back, take a holistic view of your game, and do the work to make the game mechanics and the game play itself as solid as the things that do work.","February 17, 2015","false","22.0"," 785 of 1,071 people (73%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","73","785","1","59","32"

I've lost heroes because of my own mistakes, underestimating opponents (♥♥♥♥ing Ancient Webbers), and (rarely) RNGesus, but it's never been because the game was too stacked against me.\n\nTo earn gold, you HAVE to budget. In early stages, when you're upgrading your Hamlet, you have to learn when Heroes are more trouble than they're worth and to let them go (i.e. their stress reduction cost total > the gold you're taking in, too many diseases, bad quicks that are locked in, etc). Everyone in the beginning is expendable. The overall goal is to accumulate wealth and upgrade that Hamlet.\n\nSimply said, you're not going to get to level 6 on your Heroes from the very beginning.\n\nAfter a while, gold and upgrading become less of an issue. Gold farming is incredibly easy to the Champion level dungeon runs (presuming you survive), with 15K gold as a reward for completing it, and it cost me about 4K to get more than enough supplies to survive. Adding in all the loot that I got (around 14k on my last run), the difference is real. Putting in about 6K in stress reduction, and 4K in quick-removal/disease removal, I still came out on top.\n\nEven with the ease of gold farming in later stages of the game, your Heroes can AND WILL die. I lost nearly an entire party of level 6 Heroes to Webbers because I had gotten into a "click, kill" mentality, and thought that the blight damage would be under control. Wrong.\n\nYou have to think about each move you make, because every encounter has the possibilty of going south.\n\nUpdate (Jan 5 2016): I'm very pleased that the featured reviews are all recommended like this game deserves, instead of the people who raged when updates happened and couldn't think critically about it.","December 25, 2015","true","133.8"," 456 of 612 people (75%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","75","456","612","13","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwaiN/recommended/262060/","SwaiN","Fuji","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SwaiN/","156 products in account","I've had Darkest Dungeon for a while now and I'm pretty upset with the direction the developers have taken with it.  DD has always been a somewhat difficult game that can be really cruel with RNG, especially as you frist start out.  Many people say that there is no "fail state", but you feel like a failure when you lose about 10-20 hours of progress per character you lose.  There have been ways to be careful, risky, and successful while mitigating the risk of horrible RNG; however, the developers have taken it upon themselves to not only patch out the clever ways you can make your characters not die, but also introduce new facets that screw you over more.\n\nThe reason I don't recommend this game is because I feel like the developers are heavy-handed with their patch fixes based on how players are deciding to play their game, rather than actually fixing the bugs and features that aren't working properly.  Several trinkets simply don't work, several skills don't work as intended (looking at you, Man at Arms with Guard, thanks for getting my Arbalest one shot), several of the buffs and debuffs don't work as intended, and now the enemies and dungeons are for the most part broken.  Since the patch, I've had to retreat from all 5 dungeons because of the new enemies, the limitations on items you can bring (for instance, there were 2 wall curios in the first 3 hallways in the Cove, and since I was on a scouting mission I ran out of shovels and couldn't complete the dungeon without clawing through the other 5 wall curious I saw).\n\nIn short, the game has always been hard.  The game has always been out to get you, and set you back on time you've spent playing it (by getting your hard-earned heroes killed with crits).  Just like the intro says, DD is about making the best out of difficult situations.  The game in its current state, and with the way the developers have been taking it, is pure masochism.   I'm not sure if the developers playtest their game, because if I were them I sure as hell wouldn't want to.\n\nIf you've made it through this wall of text to this far, please excuse me if I seem like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing.  I actually like rogue-likes, and I'm familiar with the concept of being set back in time and losing things permanently.  Nobody likes being treated unfairly, and it feels like the game is a chore.  If the idea was to make it stressful, it's just annoying.  On the plus side, the developers ARE active and DO create new content frequently, but on the negative side a lot of the ideas they take from the community are pretty stupid.\n\nAll in all, if you're thinking of purchasing this game, it might be a good idea to wait until it's finished.\n\nEdit for clarity:\n\nAfter seeing the positive reviews that mostly knock players for not understanding the mechanics, I figured I'd approach those mechanics from a different angle than the positive reviews, since I do understand the mechanics.\n\nThe trinkets:\nI feel like they simply aren't balanced.  Most of the "Ancestral" (legendary trinkets) hurt more than they help.  For instance, one gives 5% increased crit to melee, but adds 5% stress damage to your characters.  That character will be targeted by stress attacks by the AI if he has the lowest stress resist and is in a position to be targeted, and you will be dished out more stress damage by the two to three enemies that deal stress damage than you will ever be able to recoup with your one turn and 5% increased crit.  On the plus side, at least this trinket works as intended.\n\nThe increased prices:\nMost people aren't complaining about the increased prices because it makes the game "harder", it just makes the grind longer and makes it more of a pain in the ♥♥♥.  Also, the sting of defeat hits a lot harder and your start is a lot rougher.  Has this specific issue bugged me?  No, not really.\n\nCurios:\nHonestly, they're not that big of a deal except for the item limitation imposed now.  When you have a bank, you want to overprepare - now you can't.  You can always just ignore curios and get rid of quirks that force you to interact with curios.\n\nHealing:\nThe devs don't want you to faceroll everything with damage stacking, but they also don't want you to be able to heal your heroes against lone targets.  So they add stun resistance to monsters for multiple stuns, then they add stress damage, then they add increased stress damage for stalling, then they add monster reinforcements.  Has this ever affected me personally?  No, because for the most part I manage my heals pretty well and bring balanced parties that are tailored to specific dungeons.  Do I find it stupid that the developers are punishing people who ALREADY take a tedious and careful approach, gut it, and make the game even MORE tedious and punishing?  Yeah, but for for the most part this facet also hasn't really affected me.\n\nFacerolling:\nDo you have Legendary heroes with max equipment and skills?  Did they ever completely faceroll everything?  Or do you still get your Occultist eldritch pulled into a treebrance smackdown from a giant?  Yeah, same here.  The game has never been "too easy" or "too hard", but as your heroes leveled and upgraded your start to reduce the variance which leads to a catastrophic collapse of your party.  One bad move, one bad stress hit crit, one bad bleed stack, one bad smackdown crit could all lead to damage you cannot recoup in A SINGLE BATTLE.  The recent patches have made even non-room battles more deadly.\n\nClass choices:\nLet's face it, some classes are just underpowered.  I use the Grave Robber just because she's one of my favorites, and she's a great support unit.  Depending on where you are, you can remove blight and bleed, make her a dodge tank, or turn her into a crit monster.  The Jester and the Man at Arms are both great units to use in conjunction with her, but her low health has always made her vulnerable.  Guarantee she's going to hit death's door at least once, maybe three or four times if you're taking her to a boss battle.  I use her not always because she's the optimal choice, but I like the concept.  With the new patch, I pretty much only want to use Bounty Hunter for my scouter.  The Houndmaster is pretty cool, but again he's pretty underpowered as well.  Weak 1-2 damage AOE hits with bleed only serve well against maybe one fight, and that's the formless flesh.  In other words, there's cases where heroes have a skill that is useful in only ONE portion of the game - also looking at you, Man at Arms skill Guard - which doesn't always work by the way, especially against the Prophet.  In a game where the developers nerf heroes that are being used to "faceroll" things and do large amounts of damage, the other heroes which are underpowered and suboptimal in pretty much every dungeon are left untouched.  If anything, it shows a lack of focus and forward thinking on the developers part - flaws that will be fatal to you as the player in a dungeon, but compeltely acceptable for the game's creators...\n\nFor the most part, I tend to leave the game specific gripes out because people thinking about buying the game... haven't played it.  But for those of you complainig about the negative reviews and saying "those who reveiew negatively just need to git gud and stop QQing", there are legimate reasons why people don't like DD.  I've loved this game since the beginning, but l don't like the direction the developers are taking it.\n\nIf you enjoy the game as it is, please direct your butthurt elsewhere.

The content and game-play are there, and the final product may work well in the end, but as it is now, its a game of luck, and not a game of skill.\n\nIt starts out like a sick game of chess.  Your moves must be thought out, and sacrifices must be made.  Unfortunately, once you get deeper into the game, the mobs are clearly designed to play on the fact that death is not a big deal for them and that they do not have to deal with "stress".  There are a number of mobs that simply bomb your team's "stress" from a distance and cause diseases without thinking of defending themselves.  So instead of the enemy mobs playing smart, they just throw themselves into you knowing that its the next fight that will kill you.\n\nAnother failing aspect of the game is the crit system.  The enemies have WAY too high of a crit chance.  EVERY time that I lost a hero that I spent time working on, spent money on, and built up to take on the heavy fights, I lost him/her to a string of OP crits that I could do ZERO to prevent.  -- Fight starts: first enemy attacks, crit, 1/2 hp lost.  Second enemy attacks, crit, down to 0 hp and now have a DoT.  My turn: DoT kills my highest level hero before I can do a thing.  --  Not a fun mechanic in the least.\n\nThe game has also gotten worse as it has been updated.  Instead of building upon the old game, the devs are forcing the players' hands to play the game the way the devs want.  Literally changing some mobs to have such high defense that you are meant to be forced into using DoTs... That's not my play style, so I am punished for it.... no thank you.  This  also takes away from creative party builds.  Now you have a checklist that you have to meet and to hell with your play style.\n\nOn top of the fact that there seems to be no direction at the moment.  If you stay in a fight too long, then your party takes more stress damage.  But with that game mechanic in mind, they add the NEED for DoTs, and enemy corpses that will block your melee units thus drawing the combat out and once again designing combat that clearly bolsters the monsters.  If a monster falls, there is a corps that keeps the ranged enemies in the back where they want to be, and EVERY monster has an attack that can reach from the back row, if one of your heroes falls, no corpse, your ranged guy is forced to move forward... The devs want difficult, and that's fine, but not at the expense of logic.  A corpse actually causes problems in a fight because your veteran fighters are too thick to step to the side?  * Scratches head *  Thankfuly, with the latest patch, they added the option to have corpses on or off.\n\nThen there is the preparation for the fights.  Some dumbass opens the gates of hell, so he calls upon heroes to fix his mistake, then charges you 250 gold for a shovel?!  A shovel that you cannot bring back if you don't use it?!  Is there a hole in my backpack that  only lets things fall out that I will have to buy again for the next fight?  Am I the only one who is lost here?  Your adventurers have no problem bringing back gold and stones, but any supplies that will cost you money next time will be left in the dungeon.  Why?  Because the devs say so.\n\nAnother problem is the fact that your heros are ALL likely to end up with a debuff at the end of a dungeon, even if you do well.  I gotten through a dungeon or two that I took minimal damage, minimal stress, and left with a sack full of loot,  full bellies, and full health only to have ALL of my characters come out with different afflictions and zero positive attributes.  There are plenty of punishing games on the market that don't punish you for a job well done.  This game becomes a grind due to the fact that you are punished for doing a good job just as much as you are punished for doing a bad job.  It's easy to just stop caring all together because you  are going to end up worse off no matter what.  Hell, you can even be punished for trying to remove stress in town because your characters will disappear for days on end binge drinking, or will "witness troubling activities" and can no longer pray for stress relief.\n\nSo if you want a game that is going to push your strategic skills and make you care for your heroes because if you play it smart, you just might prevail, DO NOT BUY THIS.\n\nIf you want a game that will throw all of your hard work and preparation away due to one unlucky fight, go for it!\n\n*Started a new game 10-3-15 to try out the new updates.  Started a new game, and when I got to the first fight with my two starting characters, I preceded to miss five out of eight attacks, and the three that I landed were  two stuns and a bleed, all of which were resisted.  The enemy missed zero attacks, scored two crits, and I resisted none of the bleed or push-backs.  I was dead before getting to town.  STILL an unbalanced game of LUCK*","July 21, 2015","false","64.7"," 534 of 735 people (73%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","73","534","735","15","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/262060/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Darkest Dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler game, developed by Red Hook Studios. The game was initially released in Early access in January 2015, before leaving Early Access in January 2016.\n\nGameplay in Darkest Dungeon leaves you in control of a roster of heroes; you control almost every aspect of your hero’s journey throughout the game. Initially you start out with two heroes from the tutorial, and you can expand your roster by visiting the stage coach in the main game hub, here you can select from at least two heroes and have them join your group. The central hub of the game also includes various other useful locations too, such as an armour smith, weapon smith, a tavern, hospital, and many more. Each of these locations becomes key to the progression in Darkest Dungeon.  The dungeon crawling side of the game is done from a side scrolling perspective, as you explore randomly generated dungeons in search for loot and treasure. The combat in this game is turn based, and very tactical. Each of your party of 5 heroes will have their own preferred location in your group and will only be able to use certain attacks based on their location too. Each of your characters has 4 active abilities they can use in a dungeon; you can swap and change them as you please in the main hub provided you have learned the skill beforehand.  Your party will also contract diseases, afflictions, blights and wounds throughout their journey and most will probably even die or become useless. You can cure these by visiting the hospital in the hub, but some may render your character pointless to have around. Like the game says at the very start, you really have to make the best out of a bad situation most of the time.\n\nGraphically, it isn’t very intense; however the art style which is presented is just wonderful. The art style is really important to this game, as it shows the essence and feel of the game perfectly. The hand drawn look to the game is one of my favourite styles in gaming at the moment, and Darkest Dungeon wets my appetite beautifully there.   What is really important here though, would be the game’s user interface. As there is a lot of information needed to be able to progress successfully through the game, you are obviously going to need a clean and clear interface to show that information. The game’s tutorial at the start of the game explains a lot of it quite nicely. However a lot of the information is left for you to find out for yourself.  All of your characters information, stats and equipment are all a click away, as well as your map and inventory screen. I was really happy with the interface, a few changes I would of made is to add a lot of information to show right on the screen straight away, rather than having to hover over the item, or bar – it just felt like an unneeded hoop to jump through to get the information I wanted. The ordering of the turns can be quite difficult to keep track of as well; I still have no idea how it is worked out, but I would of liked to have seen maybe a time line of the battle somewhere on the screen to make it a little easier for you to plan your attacks; maybe this was considered already but was specifically not added so the game is all that much harder, that to me is the only logical reason for not having something like that included.\n\nThe audio in Darkest Dungeon is also spot on as well. First of all, the narrator is just plain awesome. His rusty voice sent shivers down my spine at times; it is very much on par with other great narrations like Bastion and Transistor. Sound effects are all really nicely designed too; the attack noises and monster sound effects are very nice and add an extra level of immersion to your game play.\n\nThis may be the hardest video game I have ever played. The game is so unforgiving and you will get screwed over, and you will probably die from your own stupid mistakes over and over again; but that is the whole point of this game. The aim to finish the game is very hard to hit and when you do hit it, you will be able to give yourself a very well earned pat on the back, because you will have just completed a monster difficulty game. I have never actually completed lost all of my party members, there seems to be an endless supply of them in the game’s hub, so you will never “lose the game” so to speak, you can just keep retrying (all be it with lower level characters).  This is one of those games where I had to spend a sufficient amount of time outside of the game, in the wiki and on forums just to give me that little extra edge over the unforgiving game play; I am not ashamed to admit and you shouldn’t be too if you have to check little bits of information out.\n\nDue to playing the game a lot offline this week due to PC problems, a lot of my time has not been tracked, but I have put in roughly 30 hours of gameplay. I have still not finished the game, I have managed to hit max level with about 6 of my characters but I have been spending quite a while farming and grinding money for me to upgrade them more before taking on the final stages of the game. Due to the game’s randomness, the replay ability is extremely high even when you manage to finish it the once. This is a game you can easily get at least 100 hours out of without growing bored of it.\n\nTechnically I had no issues what so ever. It is definitely a game you have to use a keyboard and mouse on, just because of the amount of information you require access to. There aren’t any graphical options available sadly but it should run on just about anything as it isn’t graphically intensive. Although it isn’t exactly a technical talking point, but a nice added feature here was that you can actually turn off some of the game mechanics right out of an options menu, yes this may make the gam experience differ and may even decrease the difficulty, but I personally don’t see this as a real issue in a single player game.\n\nMy conclusion on Darkest Dungeon is that it is one of the best games to come out via the Early Access system. Even when it was first released, it was a better game than most, but now it has been fully released this year it is an absolute must play title. All other devs looking to release a game into early access really need to pay attention to these guys as it was done so perfectly and hassle free. I can easily say that it is my up most favourite roguelike game ever. The game’s regular price on Steam for £18, 99 is a good price point, there is tons of content and extremely high production values put into this game. Do not hesitate for a second more and pick this game up.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

The Game\n\nThis game... where to begin, *Sigh* I bought this game in Early Access a week after it came out, I was looking for a Horror game- surprisingly this popped up under the tag (It's not a horror game btw unless you consider 2D monsters as "scary") and when I checked the trailer I said, "Oh what the heck, forget the horror game this looks interesting" I bought it, played it... and was very satisfied that I didn't search for that horror game because this game is a Flawless Gem...\n\nIt's a Dark Fantasy RPG Rogue Like - ...Whew what a mouth full - It's inspired by H.P. Lovecraft (Yes the author of the so called "Cthulhu Novels") & Dark Souls. The Game's Immersion is extremely well done with the narrator\n- Wayne June his name is...\n\nVideo with his narration.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rClHWMt9AWI\n\nHis voice creates this immersive... tense atmosphere. The Narration is done in such a way that he narrates your combat actions, how you're exploring the dungeon and when you find unique enmies. The feeling I get when I play this game is like when playing a D&D tabletop with my friends in a dark room and we're exploring an ancient dungeon, except this game makes it appear visually, seriously if you like D&D you'll love this game. I sometimes get so immersed into my character "Reynauld" in the game I repeat the stuff he says when walking down the corridors of a dungeon! Haha! This game really is amazing to me.\n\nThe creatures are exceptionally well done they look creepy and will fright your heros and yourself quite a bit. The heros are very well done.\n\nLevel Design is outstanding (It really feels like exploring a dungeon).\n\nThe Sound- Excellent! It may seem that I'm saying excellent everything, but if you don't believe me, experience it yourself. (Gameplay Vids on YouTube, isn't an "Experience") I suggest before you buy it... try it... and by that I mean go... you know, download it... for free "somesites" that I don't know and then if you like the game go BUY it and support the developers cause they deserve it as much as you enjoying their game for free.\n\nPeople say the game gets repetitive- which I don't know how it is possible, because this game has a story which people with 200+ Hrs havn't even completed yet, aswell as UNIQUE cinematics for each boss/lvl and sercret rooms. (There are over 14+ bosses and 50+ Quests 50+ unique items to collect.) If you play the game right and Explore like a person that knows how to play an actual RPG like this... - You'll find so many secrets that keep you from the main quest and prolongs gameplay even more...\n\nSecondly... The Concerns Surrounding The Difficulty\n\nThe game is OBLITERATINGLY HARD - literally the game is so hard that you have a chance to get both your tutorial characters killed (If you really have no idea of what you're doing) -or at least one of them. A lot of negative reviews is about how hard the game is, yet one of it's insparations are Dark Souls - which is renown for how insanely hard it is and yet no complaints about it's difficulty, and that FURIATES me to a very unnerving extent, because people now read the negative reviews of what people wrote & then they have like barely 20 Hrs of gameplay - they think the game is either accidentally made like this because of the RNG or the Devs are Insane, but actually if you run the game... after the intro it says that the game IS unforgiving - for that it is its nature... and on the store page.\n\nThe game is meant to be this hard and unforgiving - you require skill and patience when fighting you can't just select a skill and click on the enemy and expect it to die! You need to look at the bottom right on the "Enemy Info" tab for the "Chance to hit, Chance to Crit, the Debuffs/Buffs you get from using the skill and the Damage Probabiblity (Google the word "Probabability"\n\nPlease, if you don't like dying and starting over almost constantly... don't buy the game, because I can garantee you 100% that if you don't look at the "Enemy Info" Tab, or try to learn combining classes in a party... or if you're LAZY to take your time and think about what to buy before entering a dungeon... you will suffer mercilesly and painfully...\n\nThe point is, just because your characters die because you dont know how to play the game (By that I mean learn it because you learn through trial and error) and immidiately quit after 10-12 mins of playing... and now go write a negative review about RNG and stuff you don't know... I bet you most of the people who have RNG written in their negative reviews don't even know what it means and what it does when encoded in a game... (Random Number Generator) unless they quickly google it.\nIf you can look past losing/dying constantly, and know eventually when you learn the game you'll improve indefinitely... then this is the game for you hardcore gamers cause this game is meant to test your limits.\n\n:EDIT:\nIf you really want to, because of all the NegReviews the devs recently made a settings TAB where you can choose to remove Heart Attacks, Stress, Corpses and more difficulties. But that's the game for wusses, It's not meant to be played like that.\n\nThirdly... Game Mechanics\n\nCharacters traverse the dungeons in single file, their position in the line dictating which abilities are able to be used and the enemies on which they are able to use them.\nTo have fun and not die you'll need to gather your 4 leaf clovers for some luck, because the game...sadly (for some) is RNG based, you'll also need to know your basic and some complex abbreviations for RPG's that's why the game has a glossary book when your at your Estate menu on the bottom right of the screen.\n\nYou can CAMP!!! This is the first Dungeon Crawler That I found where you can camp!\nYou get a few types of dungeons:\n\n- Short\n- Meduim (Where you can start camping)\n- Long      ^\n\nWhen you camp it's almost like when you play D&D with your friends, you first decide which survival skills to use and it spends time points that hover above your campfire for example, every class has Combat Skills <Self Explanatory (Used in Combat) and Survival/Camping Skills (Used in the camping menu when you choose to set up camp in a dungeon/room)\nThe crusader has this one skill where he gives everybody stress relief with a speech he gives and where others can take watch while the rest of the party sleeps... all those skills take "Time Points" (The hovering number above your camp menu) and eventually when you decided you've used enough of those points the rest of the time is how long the party sleeps- the longer the more they heal and stuff.\n\nA TIP: After you bought the game, when you enter it and it shows RedHook Studios' logo don't press Esc. otherwise you'll skip the amazing cinematic Intro that gives you the starting lore you need!\n\nPROS+ & CONS-\nPROS+\n\n-Game is Hard\n-Lore is Great\n-Narration is Excellent\n-Lots of Loot\n-Variety of Monsters\n-Interesting story\n-Addictive\n-Great Immersion\n\nCONS-\n\n-Game is Hard (It can be good & bad from 3rd person perspective - Personally  I feel it's a pro cause it gives me bragging rights if I beat lvls)\n-Can be Frustrating\n-May Get Reppetitive (Depending if you Roleplay or not I.M.O.)\n-Realistic (Monsters that look like this I imagine won't be easy to fight in real life and people complain)\n-For HardCore Gamers only (By that I mean if you don't change the Misc settings for Heart attacks, Removal of stress ect.\n\nThank you for your time in reading my review. If you feel I spent to much words on the difficulty please feel free to criticise in the comments and if I should add some stuff!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/junRSA/recommended/262060/","junRSA","June","http://steamcommunity.com/id/junRSA/","140 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI recently purchased Darkest Dungeon and I haven't been able to stop playing it.\n\nBefore I write my review I wish to state that there are far too many negative reviews that are completely unjustified. Yes, the game is unforgiving however it is nothing like what the other reviewers have stated.\n\nA lot of the people complaining are the same crowd as the 'casuals' you find in other games suggesting changes to allow them to 'win more often'. For example, "“Some traps for example are not visible and will just hit you without any counter option (but luck as in dodge)”. The traps become visible if you have 'scouted' the map. I have 112 hours at the moment and I do not lose any heroes  at all (your heroes have permanent death) and I have a full roster of heroes of every class. I can only imagine that the people who are finding the game incredibly difficult are struggling to understand the mechanics of the game. You will see below as to why it is identical to the 'casuals' you often find in other games.\n\nPeople are a complaining about balance changes. For example, "“The developers … seem to be haphazardly throwing illogical and badly though-out game altering patches (sometimes game breaking in terms of fun)”. People were just AoE'ing enemy characters to death, removing any skill from the game as players could kill the enemy characters before they could even react. This was changed so you couldn't just 'no skill' AoE mobs down and people are complaining about this. People were double and triple stacking classes because of this and just mindlessly using the same AoE abilities (You can see this in YouTube videos before the changes). Know the abilities, choose classes that compliment each other and play smartly; this is how the game should be, right?\n\nThe other complaints is that everything is too expensive. For example, "Players who came into this new update with their towns half finished and their parties mostly set up will be fine, but if you're just starting out, the unforgiving gold deficit will keep you in crippling poverty and grind progress to such a slow and repetitive crawl".\n\nI started after the patch and although I dont have a huge amount of gold, my whole roster is upgraded to the max levels. Previously it was absolutely ridiculous and you never had to worry about how to spend your gold. It was just an unnecessary resource as you made an insane amount of gold and it cost nothing to upgrade skills/abilities, armour/weapons or use 'stress recovery' options for your heroes. Gold must be a reward for completing a dungeon and you should have to spend it wisely, not sit with it in thousands and never have to make a decision on how to spend it.\n\nPeople in the Steam reviews have used the cliched "it is not polished enough" which is the complete opposite of the truth. I do not think you will find many games as polished as this where the passion of the developers shine in their work.\n----------\nReview:\nDarkest Dungeon to me has been a refreshing experience. It features the narration of Wayne June in the most unique way I've ever encountered in a game. The narrator will essentially comment on the combat pushing the sound design from Darkest Dungeon to a new level. When you land a critical hit, Mr June will make you feel it.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game has a very dark art style to it. Everything is very well drawn. The creatures are hideous (in a good way) which adds to the dark theme of the game.\n\nSound:\nThere has been no cost spared in sound design. As someone with a degree in Music Production, Sound Design and Music Business, I really have a lot of appreciation for what they have done here. As mentioned there is the narration of your combat, but the amount of sounds they have created for the skills, which sound really good, is unbelievable. They all sound like the ability should. They have even gone as far to make unique sounds for when the abilities fail. Monster sounds are just as scary as the monsters are gruesome, making it easy to immerse oneself.\n\nGameplay:\nI see the Steam reviews are saying the game is unbalanced and too difficult. I find the game to be almost perfectly balanced, if not too easy. I have 2 final bosses to finish and I have not wiped or died on any of the final bosses so far. I find the AI is a bit too forgiving where it could have got a kill it instead attacked a hero with more health.\n\nThe game uses a unique system that when you get to 0 hp, you reach the status of 'Deaths Door'. You then do resist checks against attacks and if it fails, you receive a 'Deathblow' and that hero dies permanently. This is unforgiving however you have the option to retreat from combat and the dungeon if it is not going your way, which you should be as doing.\n\nOverall:\nOne of the most unique games I've ever played and I only hope the developers look past the negative Steam reviews because this game is absolutely a diamond in the rough; a complete winner in my eyes.\n\nIt is being released in January 2016 I believe however I feel that the game is already complete and I have not once felt like it was an 'Early Access Game'","November 25, 2015","true","160.2"," 609 of 853 people (71%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","71","609","853","22","119"

From the start it looked very fun, interesting and most importantly...difficult. It wasn't a game like so many where it's tailored to just get you from start to end. Where you mess up any number of times and just get more chances. With Darkest Dungeon there is room for error, but it's a very small room; and most the time you have to take a loss of some sort.\n\nAnyways into the real details.\nPROS:\n- Game looks, feels and sounds amazing\n- Combat system is fun, alas very random.\n- Upgrade system is very well done, with 4 different types of upgrade mats\n- Stress system is great, you get broken down mentally and physically, which is what seemed so interesting\n- Random dungeon layouts proves for a fun new adventure every time you embark\n- The game is VERY fun!\n\nCONS:\n- As it's been said so many times before in other reviews, good and bad; the RNG is not only too random, it's BEYOND frustrating. I fell this is by far the biggest issue with the game at current development. I'm not sure if it's a tooltip issue, or programming issue, or what the underlying cause is; but the RNG is far too random. I've literally (meaning literally not OMG "literally") had a 85% hit chance skill miss 9 times in a row. Now with 15% miss chance, sure it's not impossible, but this happens often in sperts of "bad RNG". It wasn't just a single time. When you have "low light" from your torch you're supposed to have a higher crit % according to the tooltip, but I don't think I've ever crit while doing a "no light" run. All in all, if you get angry at games on any level whatsoever, this game will definitely ♥♥♥♥ you off from time to time...often enough.\n\n- The Sanitarium is a joke, not only is it ridiculously expensive, with having to reduce stress after almost every dungeon, you never have time to put your characters in there. ESPECIALLY since you get a new affliction (debuff) almost every single run as well. So what is really the point of it? The Sanitarium needs to reduce stress as well, not as much as the Abbey or Tavern (otherwise they would become worthless in place of the Sanitarium), but by a 50% rate or something.\n\n- The in-dungeon character dialogue. They like to talk a lot, and when they do it stops whatever you are doing. It becomes increasingly annoying when they say the same things over and over as well. So you're not just being stopped to hear something interesting, you're being stopped to read the same thing over and over. It becomes unbareable when they get full stress and break, because in the battle they say something non stop and you spend 50% of the time waiting for them to shutup.\n\n- There is no structured combat rotation, it seems characters can go whenever they want. It's never "your turn" and then "enemy turn". Also, sometimes in particular with "surprise" attacks the enemy can go multiple times in a row, before you can. So at that point you're so far behind in the dungeon with almost maxed stress and no HP it's a miracle of you get out with all 4 people alive, or finish it at all.\n\nIt's early access, so we'll see where they take the game, but right now it's still worth playing if you can deal with moments of being annoyed and hating your characters sometimes. Even with all the at length CONS, I still highly recommend the game.","February 8, 2015","true","117.8"," 117 of 144 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","117","144","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qualbert/recommended/262060/","Qualbert","Qualbert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Qualbert/","671 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMost depressing game? Quite possibly.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a game I only recently discovered, and I'm very glad I did.\nAn incredibly punishing game that should please masochists the world over - Darkest Dungeon combines a variety of gameplay elements spanning several genres, and heavy influence from Lovecraftian mythos with dark gothic themes.\nPlaying as somewhat of an RPG/DnD/adventure/roguelike hybrid, the game focuses upon building a party and completing quests through side-scrolling exploration riddled with turn-based strategy for combat. This may sound fairly stock-standard, but the added element of "stress" adds a layer of depth unlike any I've seen in a game.\n\nEach character has a set amount of HP. Simple? Yes.\nEach character has a set level of stress at any given point in time. Simple? Not quite.\n\nActions while questing, fighting, resting and returning to town in-between quests will all have an impact on a character's stress; this is what turns an otherwise fairly simple RPG into a challenging, punishing experience of a game. Once stress level on a character hits 100, they turn insane: acting irrational, spreading stress among party members, attacking of their own accord in battles. This is exactly what you want to avoid.\n\nI could go on about Darkest Dungeon for several pages, but that would simply be detracting from the amount of time you could be spending actually playing it. Though early access (at this moment), it's easily worth the purchase and will have you cursing for hours on end as your party members trudge through dungeons, are faced with insanity and eventually perish.\n\nBuy this game.","February 25, 2015","true","18.3"," 102 of 123 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","102","123","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mathies/recommended/262060/","mathies","@MathiesSC #yuritopia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mathies/","65 products in account","EDIT: There has been some misunderstanding stemming from my opening lines. The key point is that the development team behind the game has tuned the game to target a unique player experience that makes Darkest Dungeon unique and rewarding to play.\n\nDarkest Dungeon isn't just another RPG, and I don't blame anyone for approaching it like one. There are plenty of on-screen cues and tips that guide the player, but for players who have played since the beginnings of Early Access, it's easy to overlook them and not start from square one. Players who are completely new to Darkest Dungeon are likely to heed these in-game suggestions and warnings at face value, and may have a better experience as a result.\n\nI do not think the game is perfect, but it's pretty great and worth your time and money to experience.\n\n\nThere are a lot of negative reviews gaining traction with a severe misunderstanding of the way the game is currently intended to be played, and I want to shed some light on why this game is actually AMAZING, and has CHANGED over time to become BETTER. There aren't going to be ANY story spoilers here, just basic mechanics--more or less just the hamlet's features and how they interact with the core gameplay.\n\nIt is a difficult game, and it is an RPG. When the going gets tough in a traditional RPG, there's usually a couple ways to deal with that: grinding monsters for money, gear, and experience, completing sidequests, and so on.\n\nIn Darkest Dungeon, you have a variety of resources at your disposal.\n\nYou have Heirlooms (used to upgrade your Hamlet facilities), you have Gold (required to use your Hamlet facilities and stock up on supplies before an expedition), you have trinkets(a way of customizing your heroes and buffing their abilities), and you have the Heroes themselves--a renewable resource. Each of your heroes has their own set of resources and attributes: Resolve Level, Sanity, Quirks, Disease, Equipment, and Spells.\n\nHere's the part where people go wrong: they try to min-max, they try to save their heroes, they'll make sure their heroes have all of their gear and spells upgraded before sending them out. This game restricts your resources far too hard for that, and makes your gains from doing so miniscule--you do make a profit, but its tiny and takes a long time. The profit margin of gold on maintaining perfectly geared heroes and sending them on optimal missions is almost non-existent, and players see this as being the 'grindfest' as they slowly approach the endgame, often trying to circumvent this game's difficult mechanics (popular Steam guides are guilty of this!) by 'grinding it out,' using strategies such as suicide-gold runs (which are a time sink in and of themselves, adding to the grind illusion)...\n\nThose narrow margins of profit? The seemingly unending grind? Its a losing strategy that was made worse by the developers to discourage that style of play, and those players aren't adjusting their gameplay.\n\nProgression through this game's intense difficulty isn't made by grinding out the perfect heroes, its by taking what you have and going for it. You're going to fail. You're going to lose heroes. You're going to hit brickwalls. But you're going to learn the absolute limits of every hero, the absolute limits of your style of play, and you'll push those limits. Your profit margins will double or triple as you start to play every situation perfectly, taking advantage of good luck and avoiding the bad luck from having an opportunity to take you down.\n\nBrute-forcing a grind through the game is technically possible. But you shouldn't do it.\nThis game wants you to face its depths head-on, and as soon as you do, it drags you further down and constricts you even more.\n\nWhen you finally get it though--when you finally make your way through the most difficult sequences of the game--there is very little more rewarding. It doesn't happen because you grind. It doesn't happen because you followed a strategy--it happens because you got dealt a hand of cards and made the absolute best of it.","February 8","true","79.6"," 210 of 283 people (74%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","74","210","283","19","218"

I thought at first that this was a cry for help regarding a puzzle in Portal 2 so I obligingly came over the the Darkest Estate to help.\n\nAlong the way I met a shady fellow with a musket and a SCAdian in a coach.  After being waylaid by the local hoodie wearers we arrived at what is known locally as "the hamlet".  It comprised a seedy old church, a run down sanitorium, and a tavern, as well as a woebegotten old "caretaker" who I am 90% sure is actually undead based on his distinctive "cologne".  Take care indeed, he likes to mooch around taking advantage of the facilities on your penny.  Heaven knows but he spends too much time in the brothel and the flagellation chambers.\n\nSo what can I say ?  Uncle had shot himself with a dueling pistol, the old bandit, and left me with a property that is impossible to insure or sell.  On the other hand there seem to be an endless supply of friendly imported labour eager to go and clean it out for me for the most spurious and ridiculous of reasons, and best of all, they bring back money, family antiques, and even paperwork to help me do up the hamlet.\n\nAdmittedly it is a bit hard on the folks I send up there.  They generally come home gibbering mad, if they come home at all, but lately as I have been upgarding the hamlet's facilities and sorting out proper training programs and toys for the poor louts they are doing a lot better.  The Sanitorium is immensely helpful at treating all of the stomach complaints they seem to get, (poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s come home spurting from both ends half the time), not to mention how often they come home with syphilis and/or rabies.  Yes !  I checked the Brothel (once I could get those Lezzie Vestals to pull out of for 5 minutes), they are definitely getting the syphilis from their expeditions and don't ask me where.  I am sure it all gets a bit "Deliverance" up there at times, what with all the squealing we hear.    We now have extensive facilities and have murdered the full litany of monster royalty in the ruins, weald and warrens.  I am looking forwards to seeing what is in the Cove and the Manor itself.  There are 23 new gravestones in the hamlet's "boot hill" and a roster of 20 more likely candidates, but lately they aren't dying nearly as much, which is probably a good thing.  In fact I think I can see the light at the end of the Darkest Dungeon.\n\nI hope to turn the place into a holiday resort and theme park.  Please do come and see for yourself.  You'll love it.

I'd recommend the hell out of this game, but recently, there was a huge update, and while I thought it was just a class addition, it was total chaos.  I had read a review suggesting that the game had became unplayable, and I can safely agree with this, I felt the need to write an actual review for this game because of it in the hope that it'll at least get someone to tell the devs that they ♥♥♥♥ed up.  It's a damn fine game, it really is, but the new update added protection to basic level enemies, yes I understand that they can't take full damage from EVERY blow you dish out, but basic enemies, with wooden shields, hooks, and metal cans on their heads shouldn't be able to stop 3/4's of the damage that is coming at them, it makes sense in cases like the Brigand Cannons or large enemies but not for regular opponents, it was made to a point that maggots are actually a team kill, having armor, debuffs, AND stuns, as well as above average speed.  Yes, you're making the game more difficult, but you're also making the ability to clear any of the dungeons a horrible thought, you'll only complete a dungeon on rare cases now, considering enemy crit seems so increased that where you'll score a total of three crits in one dungeon they'll score a grand total of 12.  Added protection, and adding the fact that the buffs that are actually good can now be replaced with things you don't even want, as well as having to pay gold up to fix a characters "disease" of being worried, all of this is new, unwanted, and really, really not needed.  This is turning into a factor where you'll lose to a hallway encounter before getting through a room, I've only done short dungeons with the new update and I tell you I cannot imagine one winning in the longer runs, given while you may never have your health dented, the balance of health loss and stress is overdone, you'll walk out of a fight, untouched, with minimal injuries, but everyone of them seem to leave an etching on your men's souls that makes them panic extremely easily, and overall succumb to heart attacks at an intense rate, there's no getting lucky with heart attacks, you panic, become weaker, and if you don't get away before they stress you further, you get a 100% chance to lose your man simply because they thought it was a good idea to make your fighters the biggest weaklings out there.  Overall, you deal less total damage as fighters, they made a lot of the good abilities completely not usable, they made stress your worst nightmare, they made the perks your fighters have nearly uncontrollable since you can only save so many from so many problems at once no matter the money, enemies with weak hides and pathetic armor are oddly stronger than they should be allowed to be, you'll find fighting larger monsters is easier than fighting the peons, and finally, CRITS ARE NEVER GOING TO BE IN YOUR FAVOR REGARDLESS OF THE CHARACTER OR MOVE YOU USE, No, it doesn't seem like they bumped down your crit chance, but when it's compared to that of the enemies, it's generally 25% of their total crit chance as an estimation, I wouldn't buy this game unless you either pound the idea into the developers heads that they're making the game terrible, or they fix their mistakes on their own, but if the game goes on sale for half off and you have the money to spend I don't see why one wouldn't try it out to say in the least.","July 20, 2015","false","63.7"," 440 of 627 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","440","627","11","25"

That being said, the finer details in Journals that you will find as well as the only voice in the game are done flawlessly. I could listen to this guy read a phone book and be enthralled.\n\n-Replayability: some may find the scope of the game rather small and they wouldn't be necessarly wrong. It isn't the completion of the game that was/is my goal. I actually was reluctant to finish it because I was worried I would lose interest.

You have a bunch of heroes going through random dungeons which tear them down both physically and mentally. The art is grim and dark, very much like Mike Mignola's work on Hellboy. The different classes are fun (Grave Robber, Jester, Leper, Crusader, etc.) are a nice change from your general wizard, rogue, knight (though they'll fill the same sort of roles). And the traits are pretty interesting. I don't remember all the names but I had one hero who loved dead bodies, another that talked to unheard voices in various lanugaged (including coding), and another who decided they didn't want to fight anymore and would pass every time it was their turn.\n\nThe game plays very well, especially being early access and I definitely think is worth youre money BUT not before some major balancing. And I'm really hoping the people at Red Hook make some changes because this game has so much potential for stealing hours of my life.\n\nSHORT VERSION:\n- game is poorly balanced\n- too much grinding\n- some unintuitive design choices\n\nIN DEPTH\n- The upgrade system is much like Rogue Legacy. You bring back money from your dungeon raids. However everything is far too expensive making a lot of your characters useless. More on that later\n- You have to bring items with you into the dungeon. Food and torches are a must. However for the minimum amount, you're looking at about 1500 gold per run. And if you run into some bad luck, you're gonna be screwed for awhile on your next trip.\n- stats system is never explained and is not very intuitive.\n- While there are a lot of classes, there really isn't that big a difference between them. They all have ranged and melee attacks. Some have buffs, some have debuffs, but they all feel rather similiar, which is a shame.\n- You can get new "heroes" after every dungeon. However by the end of their first dungeon, more than likely they will be riddled with either mental or physical ailments. Now this is part of the fun but to it costs about 1500 gold to heal someone of a single ailment or to bring their stress down. Early in the game you aren't going to have any money for that.\n- A couple of upgrades don't actually do anything. At least the stats say they don't. I also had a skill up reduce the damage my hero did, but bring the damage window (possibility of lowest and highest amount of damage) just 1 closer. So not really worth it because of the huge gap\n- There are ways to buff your heroes sanity, but your heroes will be losing sanity at such a constant rate, it's not worth it at all. We're talking you buff for 4 on a character (using that heroes turn) only to have an enemy land a hit and cause a hero to lose 28 sanity, and 14 to those around them. And that's one attack\n- You don't know the turn order of attacking. So less strategy\n- The heroes talk all the time, adding some flavor text, which is fun. HOWEVER, the game stops when they do. So you're walking, you have to stop and listen. You're fighting, you have to stop and listen. And they are REALLY chatty. It ends up getting pretty frustrating because it breaks up the flow way too much, especially with all the grinding you'll be doing.\n- When trying to pick heroes from the wagon, their speech bubbles will block the hero above them, making it impossible to pick the hero you wanted for a short while\n- Various dungeons you can enter open and close for no forseeable reason. Want to play the randomly generated version of the first dungeon? Maybe you can, maybe you can't.\n- The game is too much about grinding. It sells itself as being really hard. And it is but for all the wrong reasons. The Dark Souls games are hard but because they're very well designed to slow down the player and play cautiously, using your head. Darkest Dungeon right now is hard because all the numbers are off. Stuff is too expensive, damage is too varied, and stats might as well be in brale. (I had a hero who I think had an 80% accuracy but would hit maybe 30% of the time, with no debuffs). The game quickly feels like you're grinding through the dungeons (often without much success) to give yourself a better shot later off with very little payoff.\n\nAgain, I think the game at its core is great. But there needs to be some major balancing and a few design fixes to get it back on the right track of being an awesome game of seeing a group of heroes unravel and try to recover from the horrors they've seen in the dark below.\n\nI look forward to seeing this game grow.","February 3, 2015","false","5.0"," 695 of 1,023 people (68%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","68","695","1","19","21"

The different classes and abilities mean you can play two runs in a row with totally different battle play styles. The narration and theme are amazing and consistent and add a ton.\n\nThe concept works really well. Rebuilding the town with dungeon crawlers as your expendables fits "money run" or "artifact run" into the theme of the game so even when you are grinding for something it still feels like a natural progression.\n\nThe balance is (IMO) really good. You are low on things and people for a long time, by design. Your dungeon crawlers die a lot, by design. But it's all in service of the theme, and as you rebuild and get better everything else gets better too.\n\nAlso, importantly, they have added a lot of options to change the gameplay to make it easier by toning down or eliminating various types of difficulty. I find the default difficulty fantastic but I'm also a big believer in letting people choose to turn off things they dislike.\n\nI paid $20 for this the first week it was on Steam, and played it for over 100 hours while it was still in Early Access. Now that the final game is out and there are new classes and areas and story content that I've never seen, I feel confidant that I will get another 100 hours.

With only the "Positive" and "Negative" options to work with, it makes it really difficult to accurately rate games that fall inbetween the two. Darkest Dungeon, to me, is one of those games. Also the review character limit makes it difficult to cover all aspects of a game at times. If a "Neutral" option were available, I'd flag this game with it. Darkest Dungeon has a lot going for it, but it also had a lot of things that are holding it back.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nDarkest Dungeon is essentially a sidescrolling, turn-based RPG that takes place on/underneath your ancestor's estate. The estate serves as the game's hub, where you can hire new party members, buy or upgrade gear, buy supplies, relieve stress, or even pay your respects to the fallen heroes by visiting the graveyard. You can only have up to 4 characters in your adventuring party at any one time, but you can have up to 20 characters on standby back at the estate. There are 13 different classes currently available, with 2 still waiting to be implemented. Each class has their own unique skills and abilities.\n\nWhen in the dungeon you have to manage a few 'resources', the most important one is stress. This is by far one of the most aggravating mechanics when mixed with the game's other features. To reduce stress, you can either camp in the middle of a dungeon or leave your characters at the Tavern in the estate. Leaving them at the tavern costs a pretty penny, and makes your parties extremely unbalanced. Some skills can lower stress mid-battle, while some camping skills lowers stress as well. When stress gets too high, some characters may refuse to quest with you, and should you attain high stress mid-dungeon, that characters risks a Heart Attack...which can kill the character. When HP reaches zero, characters enter a state called "At Death's Door". When this is reached, they don't die yet, but any attack afterwards has a chance to kill them. Death is permanent, but you can replace dead characters with more new hires. This, however, means you'll spend some time getting the new characters back up to snuff, which means more time grinding and more gold spent. Speaking of gold, let's say you complete a quest and earn...4,500 gold. Ok, that's a respectable haul, but most of it will go towards stress relief, food, and supplies, leaving you with a trifling amount leftover. Almost all of your gold is spent maintaining your characters so that they do not die.\n\nAnother thing you need to manage, which isn't anywhere near as bad as stress, is light. Bringing torches will help keep light levels high, which offer bonuses to your party such as the aility to scout ahead and see what each corridor has in store for you. Low light levels mean stronger enemies, but greater rewards. Use your best judgment to determine if the risk is worth the rewards or not.\n\nThe large majority of the game will be spent in combat. Any skills you have unlocked will be useable here, with combat playing out in turns. As you take damage, your stress levels will go up. Instead of leveling up, your character's Resolve will increase. Battles and random events in the dungeons will test your Resolve frequently, earning you perks or afflictions. Perhaps the most annoying part of combat are corpses. When an enemy dies, they leave behind a corpse; these serve no purpose other than holding an enemy formation together. This can make targetting enemies in the rear difficult until you get rid of the corpses. This is completely unnecessary, and only make battles even more drawn out than they already are.\n\nAlot of players complain about is how unfair the RNG seems to be. There will be battles where you will miss 4 turns of attacks, while your enemies will crit every turn. It seems like the game itself is against you, but I honestly think it's just RNG being RNG.\n\nThe dungeon crawling itself is quite bland. On the bottom right of your screen you will see the dungeon map. To travel to a room, click it and then hold the cursor and mouse button down ahead of your party in the direction you want them to go. You will find all manner of things as you explore, including enemies, traps, treasure chests, curios, relics, or any number of other random encounters. Sometimes you will find unused torches which can be picked up and added to your stock, other times you may find relics that can offers bonuses to your party once cleansed.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nThe game has an intense gothic, Lovecraftian look/feel to it, and is by far the best thing abotu Darkest Dungeon. Character designs are unqiue and thought out. Combat animations are simple, but effective. When actions are taken the affected characters are brought front and center on the screen, so you can focus on what's going on. Characters stand idle and have a small amount of animation to show then breathing while idle. This is a nice little touch that more games need to bring a sense of realism. As characters and enemies are damaged, small blood splatters are shown in corners of your screen.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe music is another good thing. It's very dark and gothic; fitting for the setting of the game. The estate has a somber tune, and the dungeons have a dark, ambient tune that makes you feel like you are definitely deep inside a dark dungeon with little hope of escape. Battle music is fast and blood-pumping; coupled with the battle sound effects and stress mechanics, this can turn most battles into quite intense encounters. I also *really* liked the narrator in the dungeons.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nThe game runs beautifully with little to no issues whatsoever, at least for me it did.The one complaint I have is that sometimes loading a dungeon can take AGES. Sometimes it loads right away! Not sure what causes this, but it happened to me a couple of times.\n\nAside from that, it ran at a steady framerate and I didn't have any odd crashes or bugs. The game is played mostly with the mouse. I can't see how this game could be played comfortably with a controller, so I stuck with the mouse. It worked very well.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nDespite the downsides, I found myself enjoying the game quite a bit, and that is why I gave it a thumbs up rating. It's a really engaging dungeon crawler, although it can sometimes be really unfair and requires quite a large amount of grinding to be able to afford the upgrades you need. Still, it's quite challenging and I can safely recommend this game to people who like grinding and have that feeling of fulfillment when they reach goals. If you can look past the flaws the game has, you will find a somewhat enjoyable game within the Darkest Dungeon, although with a little more work and a few updates, it could be a great game.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/mPfXVxKn7eQ\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nSomewhat Recommended\nNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an unbiased informative review.

It is currently in Early Access and is being developed by Red Hook Studios.\n\nIn this game you are the heir to a manor that has been abandoned by your family due to a gateway being opened, allowing monsters and evil to be released and corrupt the land. You are tasked with ridding the lands of these mosnters and this evil, as well as to restore the lost glory and riches of your family. At your disposal are countless up and coming adventurers, enticed by the promise of fame and riches. Their mettle and their wills are tested in each dungeon. They will be stressed, they will be driven mad, they will ultimately die in this quest.\n\nPros:\n+This game is beautifully narrated, and adds to the dark, gothic overtones of the game.\n+The artwork has a dark, hand drawn feel to it, which also adds to the gothic overtones of the game.\n+The storyline, though not the most original in the scheme of things, is very nice and the concept of it works well.\n+The stress mechanic your heroes face as they are used, abused, injured, and driven mad from the dark is very original.\n+When your heroes die, they die permanently. There's even a little graveyard for them.\n+Great music which is very atmospheric and adds to that dark feel of the game.\n+Your heroes have a great selection of classes which have their own unique abilities.\n+There are a decent variety of monsters and bandit enemies to fight\n+The game is difficult, but not overwhelming to the point you want to put your fist through your computer monitor.\n\nCons\n-The game can get grindy and repetitive after a couple of dungeon areas.\n-There can be a lot of micromanaging and planning  for the dungeons, which normally would be a good thing, but this game takes it to another level.\n-Randomness of the fight encounters can and will be unfair at times.\n-There is a learning curve and the difficulty of the game can be a disadvantage towards casual players.\n-The game itself has been in early access for a while and at this point is unfinished\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nOverall I've really enjoyed playing this game. The dark overtones of the game greatly add to my immersion, and has been unlike any other roguelike game that I've played. The difficulty level of this game requires me to think, plan ahead, and treat each battle in a different way. I normally do not care for Rogue Like style games, as most just don't have enough to keep me immersed. I am disappointed that this game is still in Early Access development, but I'm hoping that it's due to the developers wanting to balance some things within the game. I paid the full price for this game, and have not been disappointed. Would I recommend this game?  Wholeheartedly. It is a very fun, unique, and challenging game. It is worth the full price. I would not, however, recommend this to people who don't enjoy challenging roguelike games. I rate this a 8/10.\n","April 25, 2015","true","6.7"," 73 of 90 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","73","90","0","4"

If you are looking to buy this game then you are probably like me, a fan of difficult games (Dark Souls comes to mind). Let me go ahead and give you the warning that I feel I didn't get from looking at reviews...this game is not difficult in a way that is remotely satsifying.\n\nWhen I play a difficult game I want to feel something after a tough battle. I want to feel like I really earned my sword, my armor, my loot, my gold. I want to feel like all the progress I've made is deserved, because I learned from my mistakes and overcame my ignorance of the world's mechanics. At some point I want to feel successful, and look down upon this horrific world that I've made my way in and say, "Heck yeah this place is scary, but I have at last become one of those scary things in it."\n\nDarkest Dungeon is not that game. (Spoilers)\n\n1a) Stress Damage (Too High): Stress damage sounds cool right? Very Lovecraftian. But the problem here is that you are already walking such a razor thin margin of success that all you need is for your main damage dealer to go insane to wipe the party. Each character has about 100pts of stress they can take before giving in to madness...which really isn't much when enemies do anywhere from 15-20pts of stress damage per attack.\n\n1b) Immersion Breaking: There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of logic to what causes stress or how much you take. Seeing a reanimated corpse shambling towards me would stress me out more than getting splashed with a cup full of blood...especially if I am a Crusader, Leper, or Highwayman who is...probably used to being splashed with blood.\n\n2a) Trinkets: I want to say that the items you use to "boost" your characters stats are worthless. That isn't true; it's just that they are nearly worthless. Yes you can find the rares, and you can get the ancients but the drawbacks are so significant that I almost never wanted to equip them. A bracer that gives +25 damage? Yes please! But it also gives +20% stress damage...when I'm already taking 20 stress a hit?\n\n2b) After playing Darkest Dungeon for 30hrs I have yet to find a single piece of loot that made me happy. Not a single one and for the life of me I can't understand why the developers went with such a harsh Catch-22 for all these items. If I don't care about finding gear to boost up my characters then why am I even delving into these dungeons?\n\n3a) The story. 30hrs in and I am tired of hearing the narrator as he constantly sputter 12-letter words ripped directly from the pages of your favorite Lovecraftian horror story. Excusing that, my problem with the story is that the narrator explains everything in the intro scene. Quite literally. As you delve through the dungeon and find notebook pages you slowly come to the realization that they do not reveal anything new.\n\n3b) Immersion Breaking: I start to ask myself...what in the world am I doing down here? Maggots can apparently appear from thin air so it's not like I'm going to live in this hellhole after I clear all the monsters and bandits out. My ancestor is hecka dead so...I'm not here to save anyone. ...Why am I sending all these people to die again? I mean...It's not for money. Only people making money in this game are my vassals (tavern owner, abbey, guild, blacksmith) who, setting aside the fact that they are charging me straight out the nose for things, apparently require I give them dozens of family portraits and land deeds in order to fulfill the orders that I just paid (and continue to pay) them for.\n\n4a) The Bosses: Back to Dark Souls 2 for a second. One of the most frustrating fights for me was the gargoyles in the belltower. More than almost any other fight it felt unfair, as you get swamped from every direction, skewered, and suffer multiple deaths. But eventually you get it. You learn the pattern, match it to your fighting style, and succeed.\nThere is none of that here. What seemed interesting and innovative to me in Darkest Dungeon was the number of classes and the combination of parties you could make. But gradually you realize that some of the classes are truly worthless (Antiquarian comes to mind) and even worse, that the game requires that you bring certain classes to certain dungeons. It curtails the way that you play and I am not at all a fan of paying money for a game only to have it pretty much micromanage my fun.\n\n4b) Immersion Breaking: The Wizened Hag. After fighting six different room battles I finally come upon the hag only to discover...she sits in the back row behind an unbreakable cooking pot and cannot be moved. Literally...cannot be moved. So why in the world would you give me so many characters and abilites that change the enemies battle positions?  Why give me a power and then say, "No, not here where it might be used best." After the Wizened Hag fight (which I narrowly won thanks to a Crusader with Spear of Light) I looked up tactics for every single boss on the wiki, something I would normally be ashamed to do on my first playthrough of any game. Why? Because I'm not about to lose 4 to 5 hours of gameplay and grinding because Darkest Dungeon in unfair. Not difficult, but actually just unfair.\n\n5a) Darkest Dungeon is simply unfair. Not in a sense of "It's okay, I can still get through this limping through the dungeon" kind of unfair, but in a "Hey, your characters are going to die today, and that's all there is to it." Kind of unfair. I have had a geared up team stunlocked to death by spiders in a hallway. I sat for four turns (all the spiders go, all my team recovers from stun = 1 turn) while the spiders stunned, marked, and killed my team. I have had enemies focus down my team one by one, from the healer in postion 4 to the tank in postion 1. Not with damage, but with stress, so that my characters pass instead of taking their turns and get picked apart. I have walked into a hallway and gotten surprised at 90 light, then walked into a room and gotten surprised at 80 light, and then gotten surprised leaving that room into another hallway at 76 light. I have watched as characters on my team repeatedly miss hitting the enemy 3 times in a row despite having no debuffs at all, and then watched as enemies debuffed to detract from accuracy, speed, and damage, proceed to get a critical hit, every hit, that takes my characters to deaths door and then the grave.\n\n6a) These situations are common, which brings me to my last point. The game is unfair, so there isn't a real reason to get attached to your characters. So... If you aren't here to take your home back, and you aren't here to save your ancestor, and you aren't here to become fabulously wealthy, and you aren't here to lead a team of chosen warriors through hell and back...what is the point of playing Darkest Dungeon?\n\nI ask this knowing that there isn't one.\n\n\n*****EDIT 5/21/2016\nAt this point in time only 0.9% of people who have purchased Darkest Dungeon have beaten the game on normal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/messernesser/recommended/262060/","messernesser","Centimeterworm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/messernesser/","111 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet me preface this by saying how much I dislike turn-based combat.  In all my years of gaming, games like Final Fantasy and, well, any JRPG really, rubbed me up several wrong ways when I came back to the realization that my party and the enemy were taking it in turns to stand in a forest clearing and kick each other in the shins until the guy who didn't bring enough healing potions fell over.  The only game with turn-based mechanics that I ever liked, even loved, was XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which felt like playing a massive, high-stakes board game where tactical positioning and cover was of the utmost importance, and the turns progressed in a way that made sense.\n\nWell, after several years of being in a Pathfinder group, and about a decade of being in love with gothic horror in general, Darkest Dungeon did for me what XCOM did.  It did the impossible.  It got me to like turn-based combat all over again.\n\nThat said, calling D.D. a "turn-based" game is doing the fantastically well-implemented RNG elements a disservice.  RNG is infamously difficult to get right, especially in rougelike titles where they basically hold up the entirety of the experience, but D.D. has found that precarious balance between unrelenting and fair, where challenges feel surrmountable and all of the numbers mean very important things that become gradually evident over time.  There's this problematic occurance in a lot of RNG games I've played where the slightest mishap in balancing the numbers is the single, tenuous line between monstrously unfair and insultingly easy.  D.D., to its credit and my endless amazement, has found the balance upon the edge of the knife.\n\nAnd, holy crap you guys, this game is still in Early Access.  Oh my good lord, but I cannot WAIT to see how these guys polish their formula, because it's already a mirror finish.\n\nIn general, there's a whole bunch to love about D.D., but I'll rattle off a few things that I find immensely pleasurable:\n\n--The "crowquill" art style and gothic, Lovecraftian influences are drop-dead gorgeous.  Props to their art designer (and also to Mike Mingola, who kind of started the whole thing) for making some of the creepiest, grimiest, flat-out prettiest aesthetic choices I've seen since Dark Souls (the first one, that is).\n\n--The varied player classes and character builds makes for some damn fun experimentation and augmentation as you build up resources and plan your parties' ventures.  I love how almost every class is viable in almost any position with the right build and gear.  I've already had great fun trying out new kinds of parties, mostly failing, and learning a lot from those failures.  There's some deep, rich mechanics under this game's surface, and I, for one, am eager to puzzle them out.\n\n--The tactical positioning mechanics.  Holy crap, this might have basically sold the entire thing to me.  As I mentioned previously, turn-based games aren't my thing.  Turn-based tactics, on the other hand, now there's an entirely different bugbear.  The way you suss out how different squaddies fit together, the best party orders, the best adventuring combo teams, and then watching in abject terror as your team gets suprised and jumbled and your entire oder is screwed up and you have to scramble, sweating and swearing, to reassemble your precious roster row before that dreaded, incoming TPW.  Glorious.  Simply glorious.\n\n--The weight of the player's decisions.  Everything matters in this game.  Every little decision the player makes can have massive consequences in the short AND the long.  I seriously have not played anything so maschostically challenging, nor as powerfully rewarding, since Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.\n\nThat's about it.  There's so much greatness in this game, and so much I could talk about.  It is in early access though, so I think a brief list of more things I'd like to see is in order:\n\n1. Random events in dungeons: coming across a lost family searching for a way out, or perhaps an ancient tome of eldritch power that the party can't decide what to do with, or maybe recuing a hapless villager from the clutches of the swine hoards.  Those are pretty simple examples off the top of my head, but this game is absolutely RIPE for the odd proc gen, or maybe even scripted events that can only occur once per playthrough, that comes along to mix up the formula.  Some great opportunities for challenging mechanics-driven decision-making here, guys.  Love to see it implemented.\n\n2. More character classes: yeah, there's already a lot, and I know some more have been planned, but holy crap guys, I cannot believe how many concepts for classes didn't make it in to a game like this.  The Huntress, the Archaeologist (Indiana Jones, anybody?), the Librarian, the Investigator (I'm thinking Shadow Over Innsmouth), the Sheriff (or maybe Marshall?), the Muskateer, the Assassin, and that's just right off the top of my head.  Seriously, to see more awesome adventuring dudes and dudettes to send to their untimely demises would make me just the happiest.\n\n3. More insight into the world and the story of the Ancestor: seriously, the bridging narrative (what there is of it) in this game is turning out to be some sick, twisted, wonderfully macabre worldbuilding.  I want so much more.  I seriously can't get enough.  If there's a way to implement it (as perhaps in a way similar to number 1 up above), more story missions would be the absolute tops.  It's already great, you guys.  I just want more.\n\nSo, yeah.  Early Access.  Already an absolute gem.  Only going to get better.  GIVE THESE GUYS YOUR MONEY.  THEY EARNED IT.  Want to see more of it.  Probably will.  Eagerly await new content and alterations.\n\nPeace.","February 24, 2015","true","103.0"," 72 of 90 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","72","90","2","0"

The combat is awesome and diverse, the dark atmosphere is perfect, the random nature of the game makes the dungeon runs very fun every single time - overall, this is a great game, let down by two major factors:\n\n1) The Catch-22 equipment upgrades, caused by the fact that your characters level far faster than you generate the necessary money for their upgrades.\n\nso, let's say you've leveled four of your characters from level four to level five. There's a game mechanic where high level characters will refuse to go to low level dungeons (which are beneath their dignity).\n\nSo, the four champions can only do level 5 dungeons.\nBut you can't beat a level 5 dungeon without the equipment upgrades.\nBut equipment upgrades costs money.\nBut to get the money you need to beat the level 5 dungeon.\nBut the champions cannot beat it!\n\nSo to solve it, you get a B-team doing the dungeons as well, but then you need to spend money on the B-team! The only solution is to recruit new characters (recruiting level 0 characters is free) and duing suicide runs with them, which is extremely grindy and boring.\n\nBut this is nothing compared to...\n\n2) The Endgame\n\nBasically, once your team of four best characters of the highest level, the finest characters, goes into the first level of the final dungeon and beats it...\nThey can never go there again!\nSo you level four more best characters for level two of the dungeon.\nAnd they also can't go there again!\nSo you do it again for level three, and level four.\n\nAssuming no one dies (which is impossible), this is 16 CHARACTERS you need to level up to level 6!\n\nThis is the worst game restriction I've ever seen, I don't even know what to compare it with - it's like in Skyrim you would have to start a new character from scratch for every single boss fight.\nAnd for people saying "this is hardcore" - no, this is not hardcore, stupid restrictions to artifically prolong the game's life by making you do a ton of unnesessary work and grindfest are not hardcore!\n\nWith these two factors, I cannot recommend the game in its current state.","February 2","false","26.3"," 610 of 937 people (65%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","65","610","937","41","98"

While travelling through dungeons you not only fight the monsters that lurk there but also stress which can be even more deadly at times.\n\n+Really nice hand-drawn art style which suits the game well and looks great\n+Ten different hero classes each with their own abilities and combat roles\n+Party order effects what abilities your heroes can use and adds another level of depth to the combat system\n+You can upgrade your heroes' equipment back at your estate\n+Lots of loot to find in the dungeons\n+Many different enemy types including a number of boss-level enemies\n+Bosses provide a good challenge without feeling overpowered or unbalanced\n+A few different locations including 'The Darkest Dungeon'\n+The different parts of your estate can be upgraded to provide more benefits to you\n+Permadeath really is permanent due to the game frequently saving so every choice has consequences that cannot be undone\n+Dungeons are procedurally generated so you'll never see the same layout twice\n+Outstandingly good narrator\n\n+/-The combat system is completely reliant on RNG including in what order your heroes and your enemies get their turn. For the most part the combat system is fun (so long as you like RNG) but having no idea when your heroes or enemies will have a turn is incredibly irritating and often leads to the enemy team having numerous attacks before you get your first. Due to the RNG system it is also possible for you entire team to be wiped out before they even have a turn.\n\n+/-The stress system, like the combat system is a bit hit and miss as well. Stress increases very quickly when you are playing which is understandable against powerful enemies but when your heroes get stressed after a low-level enemy attacks it can be frustrating. Stress also brings out the best, but usually worst, out of your heroes, when their stress level reaches 100/100 they will either develop a positive trait (increasing their combat effectiveness and boosting your team's morale) or a negative trait. It's the negative traits I have a problem with, when a hero develops a negative trait you lose almost all control over them (for the most part they will either refuse to take their turn or you will have no control over which ability they use on which enemy which can be rather frustrating), as well as this most characters with a negative trait (such as paranoia) will refuse medical help from your other characters even when they are on death's door which can quite easily lead to them dying.\n\n-While on a mission you can only heal your characters in combat or by setting up a campfire (only available on certain missions and has a limited number of uses)\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nDespite a couple of flaws this is great dungeon crawling game so long as you know what you're getting in to. If you're unsure what RNG is or haven't played a game involving it before then I suggest you watch a number of gameplay videos before playing the game.\n\n*** I used a stemkey provided by the developer for review purpose ***\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Just SOME things this 100-hour player (including 20 Level 5 heroes with level 5 everything - each class at one point or another, at least twice over) has to say:\n\n- The dev's, like many before, do not understand that RNG cannot be let loose on it’s own - it needs to be there for some games, but it should never be left to it's own devises.  You need to make sure that nothing can Crit over and over and over and over, nor can you have misses happen over and over and over (90% chance to hit misses more than 50% in other games, IOW).  Dear RedHook, learn the same thing that GGG did with their evasion mechanic:  allowing pure rng made the mechanic broken.  They learned that they needed to enact a system where too many missed or too many hits could not happen - you can read about it on the Path of Exile wiki.  PLEASE NOTE:  I AM NOT HAVING AN ISSUE WITH RNG ITSELF, OR HOW MUCH IS LEFT TO RNG - I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANY DEV WHO JUST ALLOWS THE RNG TO PURELY DO ALL THE WORK.  CONSTRAIN IT!!!  EX - Any programmer will tell you that if you write code to randomly spit back 0 or 1, and you just use RAND() (or whatever the function/method/class in your favorite language calls it) - you can run it hundreds or thousands of times and check the results, only to see, 1 come out sometimes 20 times in a row.  So your programmed a 50/50 chance, yet what happens?  You get one of the two values repeatedly.  You could have the same thing happen if you randomly generate 0-9 or whatever you want.  My point is, few find unbridled rng to be fun, and I imagine they might like some sales from hardcore lovers who like their hardcore fair, not full of lazy AI and mechanics.\n\n- AI needs work!  If the rng wasn't there to give it a kick, and they didn’t hide turn order (with a laughable excuse for why they, RedHook, won’t), it would be a total joke.  The only thing "smart" I have seen it do is target a specific player (randomly, it seems) and have most or all the mobs fight him.  Not a bad tactic, I guess, but it feels cheap, and then the AI changes target just when they were close to killing the first.  I have also seen the AI "pull" a teammate to the front (there are pull and push abilities), only to push them back the very next round (the AI has no memory of actions, except, I guess, to pick one target and stick to it, until RNG says to move elsewhere.  Lot's more crap like this to experience...  I have zero faith this will be fixed because most gamers are too stupid to notice bad AI, and even if they did, it's that last consideration (possibly below bug fixing, if that is even possible).\n\n- The economy is in need of adjustment.  Not really much to say there, I believe the dev thinks so too, just not sure when it will happen (unless you find a "broken" party setup that clears content easily) as far too often you feel stalled in progress due to there being lots of ways to spend money but no many ways to earn a nice amount, until late game... which reminds me...\n\n- Early game is unforgiving, mid game is brain dead easy, and then end game is ridiculous in how it swings between the two, but when it gets unforgiving (in the bad way), you will litterally want to uninstall the game and swear the devs off.\n\n- Trinkets continue to drop that are broken - that is - they provide bonuses for a class that cannot help them (increased chance to blight and bleed for a class that does not have any poison or bleed skills, e.g.).  They say they are aware and will fix it, but update after update, this is still broken.\n\n- WAY TOO REPETITIVE (this coming from some that loves randomized-content games).  No matter how many times you run a dungeon, level it up, kill one of the three levels of the boss for that dungeon (same boss, exactly, each time - YAWN!), it’s the same tile sets, and the randomization is rather lackluster in terms of how the rooms and connecting hallways are laid out.  Having the last two dungeons added will alleviate this a tiny amount, but it's just going to end up repetitive again.  Why can't dungeons get altering tile sets and layouts as they level up, or at least for the boss runs?  Why, if this game is supposed to be random in its layout, have I seen the same layout NUMEROUS times?  This is a game that is begging to be paid for hundreds of hours, but I guess the devs don't have the same vision (which is odd, games that give you so much value end up selling post-release content at a way higher rate, and the sequel does better too).\n\n- Stess system is broken. Getting crits give, on average, way more stress than giving them takes away. The walking around stess is also a poor decision. Level 4 heroes with Level 5 skills, armor and weapons should not get random stress from walking around in a Level 3 quest in a level 3 dungeon. Stress received and taken away needs some consistencey. +10 to you +5 to party/close-by friends if received, -10 for your and -5 for party/close-by charecters if you give one. Or have the scaling, since it also seems based on how hard you crit, also be as consistent. While I understand that a character that has hit 100 stress might say thing that bother the others, most of what leaves the mouth of these toons isn't stressful for anyone already in a very stressfull situation (fighting to the death).\n\n- Hunger system is purely RNG'd and tiles are secretly labeld "hunger" - instead of travling distance and fighting rounds making this something consistant, you can sometimes never get ungry, or get it twicein the same hallway, even right after a fire rest. How does a party who just had a fire and had a feast become hungry two hallway tiles away?\n\n- This game can be a performance hog on some system - which is crazy since this game is no way taxing of GPU or CPU based on the graphics.  (the art is good, I just don’t see how this 2d game can made some systems crawl)  My monster gaming rig has zero issues, beyond weird bugs and random hangs, but my tablet with a beefy enough cpu/cpu to plat CiV, has major issues with this game.\n\n\nAll in all, there is a great game to come of this prerelease version, I just hope the right changes are made -  at least they are allowing mods so hopefully we can change the things they don't.","March 4, 2015","false","100.4"," 237 of 359 people (66%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","66","237","359","17","27"

But if I had to sum up this game in just one word, that word would be "Stagnation." I had been following this game rather closely for some time and loved everything I saw, the game seemed PERFECT in my eyes, at least until recent updates to the game brought some "rebalancing." The latest updates saw rather drastic increases in the cost of... well... pretty much everything, heros cost more to train, town upgrades require more resources, and stress healing will bleed you dry. This, on its own, wouldnt have been too bad, had they not also considerably decreased the gold you'll get for going on expeditions. Many times ive completed a quest, only to spend most the gold i just recieved to lower my troop's stress levels from said quest, before saving what precious little is left to fund the next mission. Repeat this proccess about 5-6 times and congratulations, you now have enough to upgrade one of your heros' equipment or skills, and maybe a town building or two..... once. But if you're dedicated enough you can do this for long enough to have a fully equipped level 2 team, now you're ready to progress!\n\n\nOh, you got surprised by a horde of spiders who shuffled the order of your party and killed your healer and highwayman before you could do anything about it? Well, have fun starting over, see you in another 35 missions and we'll do this again.\n\n\n\nSo the point is this: Players who came into this new update with their towns half finished and their parties mostly set up will be fine, but if you're just starting out, the unforgiving gold deficit will keep you in crippling poverty and grind progress to such a slow and repetitive crawl that you'll actually forget why you're even playing, if you're unsure on whether to pick this one up, I'd hold off for now, wait for a few more updates and then check again.","October 27, 2015","false","6.1"," 260 of 397 people (65%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","65","260","397","11","15"

My review is after the december patch from 2015.  This game is not worth playing now.\n\nIt really pains me to say but i cant recommend this game now. Not because it is hard or unfair sometimes (now many more times after the last update). I actually only lost 5 characters that i cared about in this game in my whole time playing it while the rest were just poor souls i sent to their doom in lower levels to pass the time. So you can see im not one of "i lost 50 characters, this game is bad". The problem is is that with the last update they just murdered the sense of progression and the freedom you had to try different strategies, not to mention that there is little reward.\n\n\nI cant feel playing this game right now because i dont want to catch new  heroes, get lucky with some quirks, lock them and see them become useless because almost all enemies now are able to apply debuff. When in a single turn those precious quirks i locked in some characters make them as useless as a character with no positive quirk, i stopped caring for them. Why would i care for a vestal with higher hp, dodge and speed if she can  lose it all in a single turn? Why would i care for a lepper that have extra res in some status since the enemies that apply them buff them? What is the point of making a character unique? There is none, period. The devs just thought it was a good idea to m ake enemies able to debuff with their attacks (note, they didnt get any single new attack. Their attacks can si mply apply debuff and that is it now.) while giving nothing new to players to counter these tactics.\n\n"Oh, there are trinkets that make your character debuff res higher". Well, that's exactly when they start murdering the freedom. I dont want to go all 4 characters with one of the two slots availables for accesories to carry the same trinket while having only one room available for a trinket i would like. What is the point of getting new trinkets, try nem combinations of trinkets? None. That's that. I dont like being unable to create badass characters just the way i could. FYI, i went with a character with trinkets that gave him around 40 dodge in a level 0 run. That is a great number of dodge if you dont know the game. And the character is very fragile. No high hp, no way to buff his survival. Nothing. GHuess what, engage in a combat, 2 round later, his dodge was greatly decreased. And that was with the caracter with highest dodge from my party, you can imagine how "open" the other 3 were. Im not gonna to mention that 2 of these guys got more debuff as well.\n\nIt sound terrible, right? But, hey, cant you buff your characters? Yes, you can. But here is the thing, EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BUFF SKILL YOU CANT MATCH THE ENEMY'S DEBUFF. Simply as that. I think the aoe debuff i suffered is -10 for stack. and that for low level characters (you cant bring high level characters to lower level dungeons).\nThe highest buff for aoe dodge i can remember is 9. Exactly, 9, from a high level character. And a low level enemy can already outmatch him if im not wrong with the values. Nevertheless, even if the debuffs werent so severe, i dont like the idea of wasting one turn to buff a debuff. Simply because in a wasted turn is just the opportunity for an enemy to wreck you. And in this rng based rpg(dont listen to people that says that this game is very skill dependent. Even with top characters and trinkets, you could face some really bad situations) that can be very, very dangerous.\n\nBut, hey, that is not over yet. Ohh, you may start thinking "What, this is worse than it already is?"... And the answer is: yes. Here's the thing, now the devs implemented alongside with this atrocious debuff horde that you should be penalized if you are wasting time in combat. That includes buffing and healing your party. Exactly, it includes it. And it can be even worse than that. I was penalized because i applied a debuff to one guy, used heal in my party and let the two last guys attack the last enemy but it still survived. Oh, i was penalized because the guy survived. No, he didnt attack me or something. I got a stress attack (stress are almost a second health bar in this game. If you let it go too high... You might face serious, serious problems. In some extreme cases, your character dies). I gave up at that point. I was already winning the battle but it just felt i was being penalized even by playing right. What is the point of trying new strategies when the game focus now only on killing your enemies or else you're wasting turns? I dont feel like it anymore, dont want to try new strategies, specially considering ill know that in some fights ill have to "waste time" taking care of my group because i dont want to let them die.\n\nI have to write more about the trinkets as well, for newcomers, since they are one of the main rewards of the quests. A great number of them, include the most rare ones, "ancestral trinkets", are useless or unworthy. Really, the majority of top tier rarity trinkets are useless and easily overshadowed by other "not so rare" trinkets. The same rule aplies to the "Very rare" trinkets, which is one tier below. This happens because all of them have some drawbacks (- speed, -dodge) that make them less worth to use. And with the new patch, more of them became even more useless, which ends with the game being less rewarding. And, with all the bs the devs put now, there is really no reason for you to go to a boring quest suffer stress just to get an useless trinket.\n\nThe another reason that made this game even less rewarding is that the gold you get with quests became more useless. You use them to prepare your party for quests and upgrade skills and equipments (you can only get new armor and weapon this way). And you could spend any ammount of gold to prepare your group. Now, the devs got a brilliant idea: let's make the itens you buy limited. Yay. It's not like you already have a very small inventory if you want to be 100% prepared for everything and you want the rewards... Well, you can use gold to buy trinkets as well, but the majority of them are useless. So... No reason anymore to have tons of gold. And even less reason to play this game.\n\n\nWell, that is why i gave up with this patch. Not willing to try finding better trinkets, that are so few. The majority of them you may not use EVER. And that list may have just got bigger since now you'll have to focus on debuff res. Dont feel like trying to make builds for some places. Hero that gets more attacks, hero that endures more damage because i know they will get debuffed some way in most of the times which will render the advantages useless and the time  i waste creating one completly unrewarded. And the freedom i had to try new party compositions, new strategies, finding sinergy with skills is vanished, since i have to focus more than anything at obliterating my enemies before they obliterate me. cant go with a party that is "slow but safe". Have to go with higher risk. But, like i said many times, no reward for me.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, i really did. even in times i felt it was unfair, i could overlook these moments and still have fun and be glad i overcame them. Now, since the best the devs have done to "rise the challenge" is simply make it even more luck based than ever, i gave up. They crossed the line of hard but rewarding  to luck and unrewarding. And i cant feel any longer the will to play it, praying that my group gets luck, that in one round i dont get debuff to oblivion and be left with useless characters for the rest of the fight. That isnt skill reliable. Whoever think it is is completly mistaken. Gonna miss the art, music, dialogue and lore from this game. But, unless the devs do something about this, i guess ill watch the rest of the game on youtube. Far more enjoyable for me and less stressful","December 1, 2015","false","69.3"," 661 of 1,050 people (63%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","63","661","1","31","75"

Well you found a home here. With every step and corner you turn, death waits for your party and looms over them like a cloud of sickness.\n\n-Graphics: This game is 2D, but it's 2D done right, the art style is amazing and you feel the weight behind every swing of the sword and throwing of a bomb to take out your foes. The enemies come to life and spew their disease upon you, stab you deep and make your blood paint the ground, and stun you with their screeches of terror. Overall I couldn't be more pleased with this. 9/10\n\n-Sound: Narration and effects help paint a wonderful picture as you dive into each hole and hope to come out on the other side victorious. The slashes, splashes, clinging and banging of swords against armor and skin are very nice and doesn't feel like some cheap call in for effects. The music for your journey is sometimes overdramatic but it's not supposed to be a joyful trip. Overall, very nice and whenever you hear that tune chime in at the end of a hard fought battle, it's extremely worth it. 8.8/10\n\n-Gameplay: The very meat and potatoes of every game and I'm glad to say this shines and keeps me coming back for more. With every journey you take, you will bring back a number of materials and gold to help soothe your warriors, strengthen your stronghold, and tune your party up to face what dangers lie with the next trip. The game centers around this hub and you go forth selecting what members to take, what supplies to carry, and what quest to take on and hopefully succeed. Party members range from brutish fighters to sly and trick filled jesters to help lay waste to the evils that lie underground. The last dungeon is not available to play yet but still there is already 70+ hours of gameplay for you to tackle while you wait in the meantime and prepare your party to take it on. Players experience stress with every negative event they encounter, they will get abusive, they will become masochists and will refuse healing. Managing their effects and taking care of what you need to concerning their minds is key if you want to win.  I've rage quit a few times and lost some very dear veterans but their monuments and achievements still remain with me as I bring some fresh new faces with me to avenge them in the depths. Randomly assembled rooms and dungeons are present and allow for an excellent amount of replayability even if the objectives and boss enemies are the same. Overall this game also shines in the gameplay department and delivers. 10/10\n\n-Controls: Very smooth and responsive, the controls haven't presented any frustrations or been the source of any of my failures and that makes me very happy. While there is potential for some tweaks and additions, the controls get the job done and just leave room to add on to and not patch to fix right away and leave it unplayable. Overall, great controls. 9/10\n\n-Replayablity: As mentioned previously with the random assembling and roguelike elements, this game allows for multiple revisits even after completing the main game whenever we can. Overall, a decent amount of replayability. 8.8/10\n\nFinal words: This game is Early Access first and foremost, but just know that this is an extremely polished and fine example of EA done right. You're not taking a chance at being severely disappointed by purchasing this with all the other information you have here. Will you get your 19.99 worth out of this game? Absolutely, this game can only go up from here and is a pleasure to play even if it isn't complete yet.

They said that you should prepare for an unforgiving and painful gaming experience, where all of your heroes are in the constant danger of dying within the next few minutes.\n\nI will tell you the same, but that's not all to it!\n\nAfter 6 hours of playtime, watching a bunch of videos and beating the first boss I think I have understood the main concept of the game, though I haven't seen everything of course.\nIt is true, it isn't that casual game for a short round now and then. You have to get into it and you have to understand, that every decision you take might be the last for one of your characters. You must be aware of the items to bring into the dungeon, the special abilities of your enemies and also your own. And then you have to calculate your risks and opportunities. Risk going for the next room? Or rather safe your precious characters and lose quite some gold for getting them good to go for the next run?\n\nAs it is a rolegame with some features, which take a classical approach, a good part of the game also relies on RNGs. But in my opinion it really is a good part, and not way too much.\nSo far I got just one character who died, but I know that it was my personal fault. RNGs just pointed my mistakes out. I knew it wouldn't be the best decision to take a healer into the dungeon, who already is almost completely stressed out. It was just my only healer who didn't need to recover from an exhausting dungeon run. So I wasn't surprised when she abandoned my tank in the midst of battle cause she just didn't want to heal him anymore... It still was a great experience.\n\nWhat I want to tell you by this is, that in my opinion it really is a skill-based game. Even though RNGs of course can mess you up, it happens mostly after some bad decisions from your side.\nIf you want some succesful dungeon runs and maybe even a decent team of heroes, who survived for quite some time, you must get into this game. From my experience so far, that is totally worth it!\n\nIt isn't called "Darkest Dungeon" for nothing, right?","October 9, 2015","true","25.8"," 109 of 159 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","109","159","3","2"

Here you will upgrade buildings that will allow you to upgrade heroes that will make higher level dungeouns easier, relieve stress and remove negitive quirks. gathering the resources to upgrade your town isent easy and will take some time.\n\nthe stress system - in most games your heroes look upon the horrers they face and while their diolauge may reflect shock and terror this never effects game play. Here it does, your heroes are not unstopple demi-gods of war who eat 12 story tall deamons for breakfest (at least not at first). here they will panic, devlop quirks that effect them negitavly, positivly or both they can also become virtuous where instead of decending into maddness they find the strength to carry on. with the recent update if the stress bar fills twice then the hero dies from a heart attack, this would be a con imo but due to the way in which stress can be mitigated (and almost ignored later on) i like it as it does make your stress bar somthing to watch.\n\nCons\nthe town - when the town is fully upgraded then thats it, no more resource mangment in fact you'll be tossing resources out of your bag to make way for other things such as gold (which by that point wont be a problem either)\n\nyour first game (for lack of a better word) - so what does that mean? it means that i suggest you treat your first game as a complete test run, even with the in-game tutoriols and the community on steam (who are very helpful and welcoming for the most part) the game runs off of rng and due to that the game can screw you particualry when you dont know whats what.\nnow i do not think that the rng in this game is all that bad but with the steam community having a few threads on this i feel its worth mentioning.\nThis is not a pick up and play game to an extent it has a learning curve but its not going to be gentle with you while your learning it there is no easy mode and your heroes are going to die untill you get your head around the combat system how heroes work together, which heroes work together and which heroes work for you and what i mean by that is i hate the occultist i cant make him work for me but there are those on the steam fourms who swear by him. when you have that figured out though the game becomes much easier and bearable which is why i suggest that for your first game just use it to learn the game and find out what works and then take it serioulsy for your second attempt.\n\nbosses - now i dont mean that the bosses are bad the bosses are very well designed each reqiureing diffreant strats and group comps to beat, so whats the issue? there is absolutly no in-game way of knowing what the strat is untill most likely you've already lost a squad or a hero to it (before you run away). now with hero recuirtment being free and heroes expendable that issue is mitigated but its still worth mentioning\n\nStress - stress in the late game almost isent a factor high level heroes have a high ammount of stress resist, i'm in two minds about this on one hand it shows that your heroes have progressed that they have gotten used to the horrers they fight and i like that on the other it makes the mechanic almost a non factor late game which isent a good thing.\n\nThe question\nthis game is in early access as you can see and with games like the stomping lands simply dissapearing without being completed or the game being in early access for years with little to no progress the question is will this game be finished? In my opinion at the time of this review being made 100% yes. The devs have just released a big content patch and in fact released two to three bug fix and balencing patchs on the day of the content release (and several more since) i remeber when i first bought the game months ago that a thread actully popped up on the steam fourm asking them to slow down the ammount of patchs being released (no serioulsy). The devs area passonaite group and i believe they intend to see this thing to the end in fact iirc they plan to release the full game later this year.\n\nDiscalaimer\nEverything said here is subject to change there are still two dungouns to be released the cove and the darkest dungoun (the latter of which the devs promise will be really hard and may fix stress being a non issue) its possible that this review will be of no use a couple of months down the line. But that is the nature of early access.","June 7, 2015","true","241.1"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","45","55","0","1"

It's balls hard but once you learn hpw to manage resources and make the best of a bad situation you will excel at this game. Expect to lose characters a lot a first and even much later. Each dungeon area has different status effects and troubles you will need to be prepared for which keeps the game fresh as it encourages you to build up multiple characters rather than have one mega party of the same 4-5 characters.

Except for the lack of story ending and access to some of the dungeons, it could totally pass for the feature-complete product. It's nice to know, though, that developers are still going to add even more content - if they accomplish that goal, the finalized game well may reach such remarkable quality level, that it will set a new reference standard among indie game projects.\n\nGood things\nGame mechanics\n\nDevelopers managed to find the fragile balance, making game mechanics deep, but inuitive and easy to grasp at the same time. You won't be completely lost from the very start, but there is a bit of intriguing sophistication to make sense of later. The "Stress" system is an especially good addition to the gameplay.\n\nInterface\n\nThe bane of number-crunching, turn-based games, the interface is well-managed here. Well-proporsioned and unobtrusive elements blend into gameplay process fast and easily.\n\nDifficulty and replayability\n\nIn spite of the waringins about "making the best of bad situation", the game is not too hard for a more casual player. Hardcore dungeon explorers may find it a bit lacking for their taste. But the balance is good, and the game finds amusing ways of bringing even the experienced player down to earth sometimes. In my second playthrough, just as soon as I started to think that I'm dealing with things too well, the tide of events made a sudden turn and I found myself escaping the dungeon with only half of the team, badly beaten. And, to my astonishment, it feeled just as a natural matter of hard luck, not a difficulty-balancing smite from the game engine!\n\nStyle\n\nDespite everything mentioned above, the game could still come out relatively mediocre, if not for the visual, sound and narrative style.\nThe disembodied voice of narrator gently but firmly guides you through the early stages and offers timely comments later, which greatly enriches the atomshpere. Unvoiced phrases of your heroes really make the story shine, though. You'll have a lot of fun watching them express their opinions and emotions while in action. Not to mention the heroes bickering, which is hilarious, but disasterous for their combat effectiveness\nVisual style is in carefully crafted superposition between self-irony caricature, Lovecraft-ish illustration and all-too-serious dark fantasy. Play the game for a little while, and be engulfed in its atmosphere.\nSound only adds to the effect. The soundtrack links to the game events well, but it doesn't leap to the foreground.\nThings to wish for\nMinor loading screen glitch fix\n\nSometimes the level loading screen seems to be stuck - and if you try to nudge things along with a mouse click or a keystroke, the game may crash. I've only encountered the glitch a couple of times.\n\nMore content\n\nThe more, the better. More character phrases, more dungeons, more monsters, more bosses with peculiar stratagies!\n\nAll in all, the game is not only good already, but has a lot of potential to become better! A nice example of a well-made Early Access project, for a change.\n\nAbsolutely recommended.","February 24, 2015","true","41.0"," 49 of 62 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","49","62","0","0"

Stubbornly trying to finish a dungeon that's gone badly from the start leads to a deathmarch.\n\nThis game rewards the detail-minded. Did you remember to unequip your trinkets? Did you re-equip them? Did you check to see if that monster is going to easily resist that attack? Dude, did you even make a provisions checklist?\n\nThis game rewards the heartless. Sometimes the best thing to do with a syphilic, boozed-up "hero" with a bad case of nerves is to fire her. Sometimes deciding to let her die of a heart attack gets you a shiny.\n\nThis game rewards the persistent. Not giving up after a humiliating party wipe is more of a key to success than flashes of tactical brilliance. Completing the game in less than 99 weeks (each week is a dungeon run that takes up to half an hour) is considered fast and gets you an achievement.\n\nThis game rewards the flexible. Sometimes you don't have a lot of choices. Your healers are all too diseased and crazy this week. Your tank went AWOL, and your barbarian needs to have a pesky trait removed. Can you scrape together a viable party? Or maybe your tactics went well only up to a point.

I enjoy challenging games...but this game is not challenging in a fun, engaging way, as with games like Super Meat Boy or Dark Souls or whatever else.\n\nThis game constantly punishes the player in petty ways. Rampant early disease, the expense and limitations on treating disease and stress between levels, the restrictions of your inventory forcing you to leave behind treasure (especially if a character dies and you have to recover their trinkets), and the fact that you can't even use your higher level characters for lower level missions past a certain very early point (I can't send a level 3 character on level 1-2 missions?) are just a few of the things that suck all the fun out of this.\n\nProblems also tend to compound such that if you really screw up (especially early) I could see it being insanely difficult to recover. Couple that with the fact that even beyond the beginnings of the game, your high level characters with solid trinkets, armor and weapon upgrades, and upgraded skills can still get one-shot doing same-level dungeons...no thanks.\n\nI absolutely adore the style, art, theme, atmosphere, and narration of this game. I want so badly to like it, but Red Hook has really severely missed the distinction between "fun" difficult and "frustrating" difficult.","December 29, 2015","false","13.5"," 223 of 350 people (64%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","64","223","350","13","0"

What early access? This game is amazing as it is... oh, man, I can't even begin to imagine what will it look like when finished!\n\nI bought the game during the summer sale 2 days ago and I easily clocked in close to 17 hours already, and that is already telling, don't you think? But let's not get ahead of myself. As usual, I will take a look at the good and the bad. This review is as of build 9007, with the man at arms and the arbalest included, along with the new bosses.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. Ironman - this game is for true rogue-like genre fans, the ones that do not whine and complain in the face of adversity and overwhelming odds, but for ones who seek options and avenues of advancement to combat this adversity.\n2. Rogue-like at its best - you never know what the game will offer you. You need to cope with the resources at your disposal. For example, you may be forced into weeks and weeks of hardships simply because the game won't pity you enough to give you another Vestal or Occultist character, but instead shower you with tanks and pitiful healers.\n3. Procedurally generated dungeons - while you could try to assume and predict, based on the area you chose to explore, layouts they are still largely random, so you need to plan ahead big time. Fight or flee has never been a bigger wrench of a choice before.Or that What if... queston on the back of your mind...\n4. Memorable stories - the game creates stories on its own, for example, how you got wiped twice, forced into meager runs but managed to get back on your feet and actually complete all the objectives, or, say, how you were forced into a 4 highwayman run cause you had nothing else to use, or, how your cleric went crazy and abusive and started britching(:P) about anything others do, which tunred into an avalanche of abusive stressed out individuals who care not about each other? Those things are in the game. This is one of the few games that makes you go to the forums or post a status about what happened just to vent off or share with your friends.\n5. Various missions - every time you complete a mission you get a different set of consequential encounters for you to choose, all of them with various objectives and varying rewards.\n6. Bosses - there are a number of bosses in the game, each one with different mechanics, meaning you need to bleed, boil and hurt till you learn what the boss does best and how to best combat him/her... it.\n7. Your very own mini-village for you to develop as you see fit. Will you neglect armor and weapons for the sake of more skills and buffs during camping? Will you choose to be skilled and better equipped and protected, but suffer everything the RNGesus throws at you cause you didnt upgrade the amount of new heroes who want to join you and the means of reducing stress through the abbey or the tavern? All up to you, and my, it is a big deal to select a good path of advancement. This alone creates memorable stories to post and share.\n8. Varying areas each with its own enemies, expectations, and bosses.\n9. The Light system, which alone makes for very interesting gameplay. More stress, but more loot, a normal run, or a safer run with less loot but little stress and lots of happy characters? Up to you!\n10. Wonderful level progression system with a set number of skills per character and quirks you gain for completing dungeons or various other conditions.\n11. Being dark and moody, making you crigne when something happens - it only enhances the experience.\n12. Value for the money - I like judging my game hours like 1 for 2, or 1 for 3 for bigger games. So, for every 1 euro I pay I expect 2 to 3 hours of gameplay. I can tell you, I could do 10 times the price I paid for this game.\n13. I have come back to the game since the review and I was absolutely baffled by the amount of content the devs actually dumped in. Well done, people. Let's go Darkest Dungeoning again!\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Early access - yeah, many features are still missing, even if the game is great as it is.\n2. Ironman - the game is extremely punishing, sometimes to the point of frustration. Some enemies can crit you out and kill a character while you're gaping at the screen with a "holy crap" ready to roll out of your mouth.\n3. You get to work with what you're given - you may find yourself sorely lacking in resources, passable heroes, meager parties, and worse.\n4. Cheesing out - the game can be cheesed out to make more money and save yourself from a dire situation, or to win a mission somehow.\n5. There is a stupid caretaker that may occupy the only freaking place where your most valuable character has to go to relieve stress.\n6. Dungeon layouts may completely foil your plans.\n7. Wipes and bad stuations - yeah, it can happen, especially while you still dont know what you're doing and what each thing does.\n8. Character balance - characters are not perfectly balanced as of yet. Then again, this game being a rogue-like,  dont mind having an underdog in my party just because I dont have anything else to use.\n\nConclusion:\nBUY THIS GAME - simple as that. You will spend lots of gameplay hours on it in its early access - I would say 30+ to complete all the caretaker's goals, and lots more when the game gets fully released. That being said, while I am a tad generous with the play time for a single run, I have 2 separate play-throughs (as I wanted to see the game from 2 different standpoints) and I can easily say that those play-throughs are as different as the sun and the moon. This is downright amazing, and I sure as hell hope they will continue adding content this way. There are still 2 more areas to unlock in the future, and they are surely going to be amazing.","June 14, 2015","true","111.5"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","45","57","0","6"

I created a new save file, started playing... and despaired. But I decided to keep playing, and to not stop playing until I had seen all the changes and could properly grasp what the game presently had to offer.\n\nSo it is now, after over 30 hours of gameplay time, that I want to write this review and say that I do NOT, in any way or form, recommend this game as it currently is. It is no longer the game I played back then. It has changed into something that is barely recognizable; it -is- technically the same game, but it most definitely does not feel the same. And it comes nowhere near what it once was in terms of enjoyment.\n\nI've read many bits and pieces of (sometimes conflicting) information as to why this happened, namely:\n\n-A highly-vocal group of "fans" steering this game into its sad current state\n-Developers which have a very particular vision for this game, and scour strategy guides and topics for things to nerf in order to take away any and all slight advantages a player could afford\n\nSo before I get into any details, I want to make this clear: I am not familiar to any such forum drama, I do not know who holds the blame, and I have no idea whatsoever as to why the game changed into what it is today. The one thing I know for certain is: it did change. Badly.\n\nThis game is now unquestionably an anti-fun game. By "anti-fun" I don't mean overly hard, I don't mean overly grindy, I don't mean overly complex. I mean it is a game that seems carefully tailored to remove all sense of fun from playing it. Practically all enjoyment is gone, all progression feels meaningless for the most part, all achievements help you in basically no way whatsoever.\n\nChief among the worst offenders are two mechanics: corpses and heart attacks. And yes, I know you can turn corpses off, but then we are not playing the game "the way it's meant to be played", we are not experiencing all it has to offer. And so, to elaborate:\n\nHeart attacks - having a hero reach the 100 stress threshold was already a terrible thing to happen before, in a GOOD way. It was a challenge to be overcome, it was an entertaining encumbrance. That lone hero would bring the entire party down the path of stress soon enough, and you'd usually end up with a group of raving lunatics cutting themselves, refusing heals, shuffling about, acting on their own... and a lone hero who passed the Virtue check going strong and carrying the expedition. It was a predicament, it was not a situation you wanted to be in at all, but it was FUN.\n\nThis is not the case anymore. Stress accumulation is now roughly 2-3x higher than it once was, everything stresses out our heroes greatly and continuously. And it doesn't stop at 100 with a potentially compromising situation which would force you to seriously consider withdrawal, while still having a chance to go forth in case other conditions were favorable. No, now it NEVER stops, and it is guaranteed to erase hours of game time and tens of thousands of gold that you spent treating, training, and equipping the heroes that WILL inevitably die from it at some point. You used to be able to bring a mildly-stressed hero on an expedition; doing so now is signing a death sentence for that hero and possibly the others as well, and a virtual guarantee that the expedition will fail\n\nI will not even touch with a 10-foot pole how unrealistic it is for everyone to be getting heart attacks left and right, and will simply leave it at: This is not fun. This is not acceptable, even. It is not enjoyable to have to constantly be worried because stress, something you can't effectively heal from, is an ever-present threat of almost instant death, which, thanks to this game's unforgiving RNG and mechanics, is VERY usually the same as instant death. Heart attacks could maybe, -maybe- be acceptable if they happened at 300 stress. And this is still a VERY big maybe. But as it is, it is undeniably an anti-fun mechanic that serves only to aggravate players for things we are unable to control.\n\n-------------------\n\nCorpses - This is by far the worst offender of the two, and that's without even touching how stupidly unrealistic it is for a lone, butchered body to be effectively keeping an enemy out of our reach. This mechanic kills the utility of certain classes, artificially inflates the usefulness of certain skills which, for the most part, are otherwise generally useless, and perhaps most importantly it can cause catastrophic situations for essentially no logical reason. Enemies are -never- inconvenienced by corpses unless we use a move skill on them, and even then, most enemies will quickly return to their preferred position since every other skill of theirs causes them to move in their preferred direction. It is simply and legitimately a mechanic meant to drain the enjoyment and sense of accomplishment from the game, causing us to need more turns to take out a priority target that's out of reach, thus taking more damage and stress for, again, -no reason whatsoever-.\n\nBut I want you to fully appreciate the actual stupidity of this mechanic. Corpses appear when the enemy is killed with regular damage that isn't a critical hit, which is like 90% of all killing blows, give or take. If the enemy is killed by a critical hit, bleed damage, or blight damage, there won't be a corpse. BUT:\n\n-If the enemy is bleeding/blighted, and is killed with a regular attack, there will still be a corpse!... that is bleeding/blighted. For some eldritch reason, if the enemy doesn't have those last 2 HP taken by bleed or blight damage, it suddenly turns into a corpse that CAN take a load more bleed and blight damage. Absolutely fantastic.\n\n-If the enemy is killed by a critical hit that does 2 damage, there won't be a corpse. If the enemy is killed by a regular attack that does 30 damage, there will be a full HP corpse. Being labelled a critical hit apparently means more than what makes critical hits important, which is their damage.\n\nBoth of the above points happen for a very simple reason: artificial difficulty. Forcing you to not attack an enemy and kill him instantly this turn, and instead have him bleed out over 2 turns so that you won't be wasting a turn dealing with its corpse. Taking the ability to avoid corpses away from your hands and into the RNG's by making it so the blow has to be a critical hit, and not just a powerful hit. Because attacking bleeding/blighted enemies, or hitting near-death enemies with powerful skills, so that they wouldn't leave corpses behind? Those would be things the player could control, and we wouldn't want that, now would we?\n\nIn order to make corpses borderline bearable, at -least- the following changes would be needed:\n\n-Any enemy that dies while bleeding/blighted would leave no corpse\n-Any damage beyond what is needed to kill the enemy would be subtracted from the corpse's HP. For example, if you deal a 5 damage blow to an enemy with 2 HP, the corpse would lose 3 HP right as it spawned\n\nAnd again, this is so corpses would be more bearable. It is no substitute for the fact that, much like heart attacks, they shouldn't exist at -all-.\n\nThis is a game I loved and I'm actually really sad that this is the state it is currently in. But I cannot, at all, recommend this game. Regardless, I will update this review once the game is completed\n\nUPDATE: Game is completed, nothing really changed.","January 2","false","32.8"," 370 of 608 people (61%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","61","370","608","20","110"

Your idiot ancestor, in fine Dunwich Horror tradition, opens a portal to unspeakable things in the caves beneath your family estate. This triggers a sort of eldrich Chernobyl, which you seek to battle back with the help of some incredibly suspect mercenaries. You send expeditions down into the corrupted places to battle monsters and secure treasures, at the cost of your team's health and sanity. Back at your hamlet, you manage your people, training them, outfitting them, and treating the different neuroses they pick up from their journeys. This is the heart of the game, the struggle between pushing back the darkness and keeping your troops from succumbing to it. Stress mounts over time if not managed, and adventurers pick up more and more quirks as they gain experience. Some of these are helpful, like familiarity with certain dungeons or stronger wills to resist stress. Most of them are not, and can range from claustrophobia to full-blown insanity.\n\nThe management half of the game is very much an XCOM affair, training and outfitting your mercs as you upgrade your hamlet. Aside from skill training and forging new gear, there are structures like a bar, a church, and an asylum for helping your team deal with the stresses suffered and treating the different psychoses and maladies they pick up. Successful dungeon crawls will earn you enough money to improve the lives of your crew and still have leftovers for further upgrades. Bad runs can cost you dearly, though there never seems to be a point where the situation is unrecoverable. There are always more hapless souls to send into low-level dungeons, after all. Upgrades to the hamlet reduce costs, improve effectiveness, and open up new options in terms of gearing and skill builds.\n\nOnce you're ready to venture forth, you pick a mission from one of five dungeons (only three are available now, hence Early Access) and form a party of four. Missions can focus on completing battles, finding artifacts, or scouting rooms, but they all really come down to exploring as much of the dungeon as you can. You spend gold on provisions like food and torches and shovels, and then you're off. I'm glossing over a lot here, because party formation and provisioning is super important for ensuring you don't have to bail on a dungeon. Dungeons themselves are randomized networks of rooms and hallways. Rooms have the major treasures and battles, while hallways can have ambushes, traps, and smaller rewards to find. Once you complete the mission objective you can leave at any time, so if your party isn't coming apart at the seams yet you can keep trawling for loot. In fact, you can retreat at any time, but your adventurers will suffer stress penalties for failing in their duty. Longer dungeons even have a camping mechanic where your party members can tend to each others' needs. Crawls tend to be tense and measured, trying to keep your torchlight up and your progress matching your provisions.\n\nCombat is where the game really shines. It's a simple turn-based system; all your people and their people get one action per turn, the order determined by their speed stat. Both parties are in lines of 4, and the skills available to use are dependent largely on position. Melee attacks might only be used from the front two positions and target the front two enemies, or a ranged attack might only be used from the back row and target all enemies except the one in the front. Each class has 8 skills, 4 of which you can have equipped in a dungeon. Skills always have a ton of features, like status effects or interactions with other systems like your torchlight, meaning there's really no basic "hit with sword" attack. There's a ton of strategy to using skills in concert, and the interface helps with this, giving you very complete tooltips on the odds and results of one specific attack on one specific enemy before you use it. It's very much the RPG equivalent of XCOM combat, with you forming strategies to minimize risk and overcoming unforeseen consequences. The RNG is out in force in this title, with massive crits and misses swinging battles back and forth wildly. This is mitigated in part by the Death's Door system: If your HP hits 0, you don't die, but any additional damage has a chance to kill. And when that character dies, they're dead for good, so dancing around Death's Door is a pretty thrilling part of any difficult dungeon crawl.\n\nHP is healed when you finish a mission, but stress sticks with your characters. Everything from suffering crits to just being in the dungeon for too long stresses your characters, and when that stress reaches the breaking point, things go to hell. Your mercs can get special sanity effects like Paranoia and Masochism. These can lead them to stop listening to your orders, going their own crazy ways, and stressing out your other party members. Back in town you can treat them with sundry activities like drinking, whoring, and self-flagellation, but even these have their drawbacks. My Occultist suffered a paranoid breakdown, and after being assigned to flagellate his fears away, decided to go on a journey of self-discovery and vanished from the roster. Honestly, that was less of an inconvenience than the Plague Doctor who "achieved a state of profound emptiness" while meditating and refuses to stop, or my Crusader who suffers religious delusions in battle and won't do anything except pray. We'll see what they have to say when they make it out of the asylum, though.\n\nI probably don't need to mention this by now, but the presentation is incredible. The art is a beautifully-animated pastiche of thick lines and limited colors, looking very much like a love-letter to the works of Mike Mignola. The music is bold and oppressive, and the sound effects are rich and impactful. And I can't pass up the chance to talk about the narrator, because he's one of the best this side of Bastion and The Stanley Parable. Every word out of his mouth is the most overwrought, overdramatic thing you could imagine, bordering on parody but working so, so well with the pitch-black airs of the game. I mean, when you light a new torch he says "THE MATCH IS STRUCK; A BLAZING STAR IS BORN" for God's sake. Watch the intro if you don't believe me, or just do it anyway because it is brilliant. Aesthetically the game is absolutely dripping in polish, in stark contrast to its Early Access status.\n\nIf you want to send hapless adventurers into nightmarish hellholes to bring you back ancient treasures at the cost of their sanity, this is the title for you. As far as Early Access goes, there's no real reason to wait on this one. The game is missing two dungeons, one of which is supposed to go in this fall, and is still being balanced but right now plays just fine. In terms of pricing I expect this to be a Kerbal sort of situation, with no greater discounts until the full release (early?) next year. If you get it now you can ruin a whole bunch of peoples' lives for a few dozen hours, forget about it until release, and come back to an even better game.","August 20, 2015","true","67.7"," 78 of 116 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","78","116","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VexingVision/recommended/262060/","VexingVision","Vexing Vision","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VexingVision/","327 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is early access. There are some rough edges around the slightly unresponsive UI (selecting the rooms which to explore, etc), balance of classes (Jesters are fun but everyone else does what they do so much better at it) and difficulty curve (there's an immensely ugly spike from level 3 to level 5 dungeons and it's not entirely unreasonable that you WILL die during your tutorial battle).\n\nBut that's Early Access. And even now, even limited to "only" 10 out of 16 hero classes, and 3 out of 5 dungeons, the game is absolutely glorious in art and feeling. From the very first time I've set my eyes on the original trailer to accessing Kickstarter-Backer-only Pre-Early Access, I've been in love with the game.\n\nFinally there is a meaningful "flee" mechanic. It makes sense to abandoning a mission - you won't get the rewards, your heroes will be unhappy about it, but at least you get them out alive and all the loot they've gathered so far. And this loot will determine if you can afford their drinking sprees and self-flagellation practices in town to get them to function like normal beings again. Normal adventurer beings.\n\nDon't get too attached to your heroes. They will die, whether in a hag's cooking pot (what an amazing boss fight!), poisoned by sentient fungi or hacked to pieces by giant undead skeletons. They will die, and they will grow mad (or, rarely, heroic) and those who survive will develop most unpleasant traits during the weeks of their adventurers' life.\n\nAnd still you'll be hiring new faces, new classes with new skill sets to send them to their doom underneath your family's ancient manor while using your loot to slowly build up and expand your hamlet and base of operations.\n\n\nIt's the best and most complete Early Access game I have every played - if this sounds like something you enjoy, go for it. I certainly do not regret a single cent spent on the Kickstarter.\n","February 4, 2015","true","102.2"," 46 of 62 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","46","62","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamdownlord/recommended/262060/","iamdownlord","downlord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamdownlord/","3614 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is a very solid turn-based dungeon crawler with rogue-lite elements that keeps you coming back for more.\n\nTL;DR\nA fantastic Early Access game that is well worth the asking price, and has the potential to be one of the greatest dungeon-crawlers ever. The game has tons of content, enjoyment, playability, and polish going for it. With the upcoming content additions, I'll definitely be playing this for a long long time. It's relatively bug free already, but I think it does need some minor balancing done here and there.\n\nGameplay:\nSolid, incredibly hard, but not unfair, and very addicting. Combat is rarely a cakewalk, and you need to be calculating in your choice of classes, their positions, their moves, and targeting. The current classes are pretty varied, but ultimately boil down to melee DPS/tanks, ranged, and support/healer classes that you are used to. The classes are all very good in their own right, but their does definitely need to be some balancing done between them imo, as some classes are objectively better than others.\n\nCurrently melee classes like Leper, Bounty Hunter, and Crusader are far better than the others. They have high HP+DEF and do far more damage than any other class, so if it weren't for the fact most of their skills can only be used if they are in the first two positions, you'd just want to fill your ranks with them. Ranged DPS sucks for the most part, and the support classes really onli have very weak buffs/debuff, very low damage attacks, and/or very weak healing spells.\n\nI don't think the melee should be nerfed entirely, but tanks shouldn't have high dmg output, and vice versa: DPS shouldn't be invincible. Ranged should have low DEF/HP, high damage instead of low HP/DEF and low damage, and support classes should have higher stats on their buffs, and at the very least, do better healing. Healing skills tend to be less than 50% of what a single enemy attack does, so there is almost never a point to using them atm. There are no HP potions, and food doesn't heal for ♥♥♥♥, so something is definitely needed to allow some reasonable degree of healing without removing the games difficulty. Classes like Plague Doctor and Jester are currently not worth the slot they occupy atm, unless you have no other options for those back two slots.\n\nThat said, the framework and skills of the classes, even the ones I'm complaining about are honestly pretty wonderful, it's just a matter of changing some numbers around slightly, which I do hope happens. It is an Early Access game after all, so these kinds of things are to be expected, and expected to change over time as the final product takes shape. The gameplay tons of fun of even now, it's just frustrating sometimes when you're stuck with one or more party members that can't pull their weight at all.\n\nContent:\nAlready there are many hours of content. I'm ten hours in and have barely scratched the surface. (A few bosses down, chars still lowish level, etc.). This is partially do to the game's difficulty, slow pace,high-ish (but not necessarily steep) learning curve, rate of progression, and the fairly large variety of classes and missions already available. The game (currently) definitely requires plenty of grinding, but that's pretty par for the course in the genre.\n\nCharacters very level slowly (if you can keep them alive in the first place). Upgrades (two kinds - overworld upgrades ala Rogue Legacy, and character skill/gear upgrades through gold) aren't terribly expensive, but much of your gold will be spent de-stressing characters and buying consumables before each dungeon so their isn't much left to spend on character skills/gear, and overworld upgrades are earned pretty slowly through completing dungeons.\n\nYou can also find random loot items in dungeons, or as a reward for completing certain dungeons. However, of the dozens of items I've found so far I've equipped exactly zero of them. Every item has a benefit (like +dmg) with a cost (-HP, for example), which is good, but currently it seems like every item I've found has, at best, marginally more COST than benefit, and more often than not, is more of a gimp than anything. These items definitely need some balancing as well imo to provide at least somewhat of a net benefit. The idea is already implemented and cool, it just needs some tweaking.\n\nMechanics:\nThis game has lots of cool mechanics, however the two that make it unique are the stress mechanic and the light mechanic.\n\nThe stress mechanic is awesome and definitely makes sets the game apart, but it might be a little heavy. For most games, you will be lucky to get your characters through a single dungeon without at least one hitting 100% stress ("afflicted"). They then have to be relaxed in the overworld, which takes them out of rotation for a whole dungeon, and costs a significant amount of gold. Even if they don't hit 100% in the first one, you can almost never take them through a second dungeon back to back without relaxing them first, or they will quickly get to 100% in your next run, stressing out your other characters in the process, and often dooming the whole run.\n\nThis brings me to the light mechanic, which is really cool by itself. The higher the light, the better the chance to scout ahead between rooms, and the higher the chance to 'surprise' any enemies, causing them to skip their attack phase during the first round. Light is based on consumable torches. The light bar decreases as you progress, and you can use torches to replenish it. If you let light fade, you increase your stress levels, but also increase the loot. Sounds cool, and it can be. However, because you get sooooo much stress in dungeons as it is right now, it's almost never wise to not just keep the light topped off, just to delay hitting that inevitable 100% stress level, so you don't really get to use it much.\n\nYou get stress walking (full light or not) you get stress from mob attacks (like 15+ stress per hit), traps, items, damage, and your other characters. If one char gets crit, HP down to "1", or hits 100% stress, guess what? The rest get tons of stress too. It adds up quick really quick, and a few bad hits in an early encounter in a dungeon can send the whole thing snowballing down quickly to the point you have no option but to retreat, abandon the dungeon, and lose any items/gold you had earned, plus now you'll have to send all 4 characters to 'relax' and pay thousands of gold for it. If stress were nerfed just a little bit, even in one area (like not getting random stress when walking at 100% light), then the light mechanic could be utilized a lot more.\n\nThat said, if it sounds like I'm bashing these mechanics or the game, I'm definitely not. I like them, and I'd definitely recommend the game to anyone who likes the genre, there's just some minor numbers that need to be changed for balance here and there. Or hell, maybe I'm just really bad and just need to L2P. Either way, I wouldn't change a single thing about the functionality of the mechanics or game itself, just tweak the balance a bit\n\nAtmosphere:\nExcellent, the voice acting that exists so far is perfect, and the game has a beautiful graphic novel style Lovecraftian aesthetic. It's hard to overstate how nice this game looks and sounds.\n\nEarly Access Comments:\nGame definitely does not feel much like an EA game. The only bugs I've experienced have been very minor, except for two CTD's after several hour play sessions, but since the game autosaves constantly, it was really just a minor inconvenience, and may be fixed already. There is a ton of polish and content already. If it didn't get another update ever again, I think it'd still be worth this price. I don't think that's the case, as Red Hook seems very committed, but ya never know 100% with EA. If this is just the beginning, I can't wait to see what's coming next.","February 3, 2015","true","17.6"," 47 of 64 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","47","64","0","0"

Your move Crusader. Man, if only King Arthur, 1st of His Name, Biggest of Jockstraps, Defender of the Realm and Slayer of Harems had thought to bring a band-aid to get Ol' Compost the Leper off of death's door then he might have lived. Oh wait he totally has that skill. You just didn't equip it because biggest sword is best sword. Big RNG crits sink happy little adventurer's ships, so run a very low level heal skill on 3/4 characters and a stun on 1 to keep people alive when terrible things happen. The Leper lives, and you don't have to go home and tell his, ah, remaining foot that the rest won't be coming home. You do get better at the game, you are rewarded by learning from your mistakes. I've run 20-30 level 5 long dungeons in a row without losing a character. To those who say "TOO MUCH RNG, NOT EVEN A GAME": proper prior planning prevents ♥♥♥♥ (urine) poor performance.\n\n2) "TRINKETS ARE TRASH, NO REWARD!!!"\n- Trinkets have upsides and downsides, why not combine two trinkets? *brainexplosion*\n\ne.g. +30% heals, +20% stress. "THIS IS TERRIBLE I'LL DIE OF STRESS" says big bubba. Oh wait what's this? A trinket that says -20% stress? What if we added those two together and now suddenly we have a dirty dirty healer at the back of the team that'll poke your organs back in to roughly where they should be. Legendary trinkets are legendary, proper use of them and being able to manage the drawbacks make them very powerful. There's no free hand outs, use strategy and planning to win dungeons.\n\n3) "THE GAME IS TOO MUCH OF A GRIND!!!"\n- If you're taking forever to finish the game, then you're losing too many people. The game is easily finishable within 60 hours. True end game dungeoning can take a long time, because of certain factors which come into effect. However at the end game there are catch-up mechanics to speed up levelling and get you where you need to be fast. Procedurally generated rogue-like games such as this, you are essentially doing one dungeon after another. The only time it becomes monotonous is when you can play the game safely every time, and by then you should be finishing the end game bosses, which have their own surprises.\n\nI wholly recommend this game to people who are fine with:\n1) Difficult gameplay, where consequences are real.\n2) Brothels\n3) Tentacles","April 2","true","132.1"," 90 of 137 people (66%) found this review helpful 78 people found this review funny","66","90","137","78","0"

It really takes heavy cues from H.P. Lovecraft on how man was not meant to see what lies just beyond the torchlight.\n\nIt uses a turn based system and RPG elements as well as some cues taken from roguelike games, such as permadeath.  The game rewards quick thinking in a bad situation and preparation and priorities can truly determine weather your party comes out from the caves alive, or are ripped to shreds by nameless horrors.\n\nThe Art style is phenomenal and you'd be hard pressed to find a indie game with such evocative soundtracks and voiceover.

Some people may cry that the computer can pull these amazing succession of criticals leaving your characters ripe for slaughter next turn, but I've found that if you prepped correctly, prioritized your healing, and use status effects (like bleed and blight) to your advantage, you'll make it by the skin of you teeth and escape the dungeon.\n\nIn this game, you gotta know when to call it quits and leave the dungeon with what loot you can carry.  It's ok to run and come back another day with a stronger party and better supplies then to lose a character you've upgraded significantly.  And I love that about this game.  In H.P.

The exploration segments have a fairly small number of decision points. Characters have a limited number of moves to select from in combat, and character building is limited to a small number of skill and item choices. On the one hand, the game lacks somewhat for depth as a result of this aggressive minimalism. On the other hand, it's freed of a lot of pointless micromanagement that plagues more detailed games. The concept is that you have a smaller number of more meaningful decisions to make, although I can't say the execution is without its flaws--too many decisions are plagued by trap options, leaving the player with fewer real choices than they should have. It's still fun, but has room to improve.\n\nGenerally, though, the tactical elements are pretty decent. There is a large element of randomness, but the game does a good job of providing tools to mitigate risks. Careful and thoughtful play is consistently rewarded, but there is a strong risk/reward element to the gameplay, so if you play fast and loose you can still accomplish amazing things if you're lucky--or die horribly if you're not.\n\nThe highlight of the game is definitely the aesthetics. The art direction is awesome, the voice work is superb, and the story (while sparse) is surprisingly good. The tactile feel of combat is extremely enjoyable. The game's themes and motifs are woven throughout the art, story, and gameplay in a really satisfying and cohesive way. The ending, while somewhat predictable, is executed brilliantly. Most dungeon crawlers have the bare minimum of story necessary to explain why the player is off to kill monsters and collect loot, so getting an interesting narrative out of the ending sequence was a pleasant surprise. It's a very well done piece of horror.\n\nThat does bring us to the elephant in the room: the grind. Dungeon crawlers generally tend to be largely about grinding when you get down to it, and Darkest Dungeon is not really an exception. It's got 14 classes to play with and heavily encourages (eventually outright forces) you to use more than 4 characters, so there's enough diversity in the roster to keep gameplay somewhat fresh and interesting. And the difficulty curve is well done, with enemies picking up new tricks to challenge you throughout the game. Even so, there are points where the game ends up dragging. A full campaign is likely to take 30-40+ hours, which is a huge time commitment for a relatively simple game. The game could really have been shaved down by 5 or 10 hours without really losing anything.\n\nIn general, I would recommend Darkest Dungeon if...\n...you want to play a streamlined version of old school dungeon crawlers with a major roster management component.\n...you'd like to see a game pull off a gritty gothic horror theme and turn classic RPG archetypes on their head.\n...you enjoy tactical combat optimization that doesn't get bogged down in minutiae.\n\nOn the other hand, you may consider staying away if...\n...you get very attached to your characters in RPGs and hate when bad things happen to them.\n...you enjoy micromanagement and having control over a lot of fine details.\n...you're a fan of traditional heroic fantasy narratives and love seeing the good guys win.","January 22","true","154.6"," 90 of 138 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","90","138","10","0"

I decide to leave my Plague Doctor at home too; his kleptomania and plutomania make him compulsively raid every chest along the way, which is setting off traps and stressing the hell out of everyone.  In their stead we take a Hellion and an Occultist, and back to the ruins we go.  Storming through the gates, my lads and lassies are crushing everything in sight.  Whatever for evil may take, be it bone soldiers or cultists, all fall before my steel.  Pressing on, however, we realise that we didn’t bring nearly enough food or torches for this mission.  Do we soldier on, or to we turn tail and run home?  By the beard of Poseidon, we go on!  Inevitably, things start going hairy once the torches run out, and a bunch of spiders thrashes us with impunity. We’re all hanging on by threads, the pitiful 1-2 hp from my Vestal’s group heal the only thing between us and oblivion. My crusader’s resolve is tested, but his brush with death awakens his heroism, and he storms back.  My occultist, however, can’t take the heat and turns abusive, berating the other members and stressing them out even more.  We finally manage to squash the bugs, but the whole party is in bad shape.  Stress levels are high, hp is low, and all the food is gone.  We only have one more room to go through to complete the quest, but the odds are that we won’t survive another scrap.  Embracing recklessness, we push on to the next room, where bone soldiers and spiders await.  The enemy surprises us, the shock throwing my Hellion and crusader to the back of the formation where they can’t attack anything.  By the time I’ve got my part into a fighting formation, it is looking particularly grim and frostbitten for us, and that bloody rapscallion of an Occultists constant stream of abuse and slander towards his comrades isn’t helping. My crusader hits a stun on one of the spiders, giving me a brief chance to get back in the game.  I risk it all on my Hellion’s Break Thru ability; if it doesn’t hit, we’re toast.  It hits, and it bloody critical hits, sending our foes back to the nether from whence they came and allowing my heroes to leave the dungeon alive.  The snide Occultist earns a trip to the sanatorium for his crimes; a week in a padded cell might straighten his shenanigans out.  With the loot we earned we can update the town, learn some new skills and beef up a bit. Thankfully, my highwayman has ended his week-long pub crawl and is ready to rip it up again.  I just hope his newfound love of alcohol won’t get the better of him…\n\nHow many games let you craft your own stories as good as this game does?\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a classic triumph of a small, focused and creative team of indie developers beating the snot out of the AAA market.  From the fantastically grimy art direction to the harrowing baritone narrator, DD is dripping in lovecraftian atmosphere and hammy gothic horror, and has the world has such striking personality and depth that it is always a pleasure to venture into dungeons and watch your heroes die.  I’m not gonna go into details on game play here; just go on you tube and you’ll see what it is all about.  What I will say is:\n\n•	This game is addictive as hell!  Once I got a taste for this dungeon crawling rpg gore fest there was no turning back.\n\n•	It is not as hard or as punishing as people seem to make out.  There is a steep learning curve, for sure, and you must make careful preparations while wisely choosing which characters will go a questing; more than a few of your party will die before you get the hang of it.  However, in the humble opinion of yours truly, this is not as frustrating or as difficult as people make out\n\n•	That said, it is still bloody difficult, and a lot of the time it revolves around the luck of the RNG.  Relish the challenge and come to terms with the fact that sometimes, no degree of skill and planning will save you from death.\n\n•	This game is just bad ♥♥♥.  Plain and simple.\n\n•	This game is SO METAL it is unbelievable.  If you listened to Slayer or Dark Angel during the 1980s you’ll know what I’m talking about.\n\n•	You can’t heal outside of combat.  Deal with it.  Healing out of combat would destroy what makes the dungeons so exciting – its about surviving the horrors or succumbing to them.  Also, you can camp and eat to get a small bit of health back, so the game isn’t unjust towards you.\n\n•	This game takes the traditional RPG standards and throws them out of the window in favour of things infinitely cooler and more creative.  Sick of the old warrior/mage/rogue trinity that is the foundation of JUST ABOUT EVERY RPG EVER?  How about plague doctors, occultists, jesters and lepers?  And there are more classes on the way….\nThis is the coolest, most bad ♥♥♥ RPG I’ve played in ages.  Let it be said that if you play RPGs for the storylines and stuff, and there’s nothing wrong with that, then perhaps DD isn’t your best bet.  If you like challenging RPGS and have a bit of a masochistic streak in you, then this is your destiny.  Embrace the darkness.\n\n(P.s. I found that listening to any good thrash or death (SkeletonWitch, older Slayer, Absu etc) really goes well with this game)\n","March 17, 2015","true","51.5"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","34","43","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Davoski/recommended/262060/","Davoski","Davies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Davoski/","398 products in account","Darkest Dungeon is a 2d turn-based dungeon crawler, created by Red Hook Studios.\n\nUpon starting the game you are greeted with the news that a dear estranged relative of yours has been up to some pretty bad stuff and essentially leaves you to clean up his mess. The mess in question being the multitude of ghouls, horrors and other assorted ne’er-do-wells that now inhabit the family manor and the hamlet that surrounds it. This is the premise of Darkest Dungeon and it works as well as any other to start our adventure.\n\nThe bulk of the game revolves around leading a group of four characters through an assortment of randomly generated dungeons and doing battle with the creatures that inhabit them. Characters traverse the dungeons in single file, their position in the line dictating which abilities are able to be used and the enemies on which they are able to use them. For instance some characters will do better on the front line while others will thrive at the back of the group. Setting up your group is key to a successful endeavour. This is where the games hub comes into play.\n\nThe Hamlet is a small group of shops and buildings that acts as the games main hub. From here you are able to make use of a wide variety of amenities as you decide which heroes to send out on their next adventure and with what supplies to pack. New heroes are able to be recruited from the stage coach, armour and weapons upgraded at the blacksmith, diseases and quirks cured at the sanatorium as well as many other services being available for the right price. This includes spending money to reduce the effect of one of the games main mechanics - Stress.\n\nStress is an in-game measurement of a particular hero's mental state, a counter that goes from 0 to 200. If the hero's stress reaches 100 they will gain an affliction or have a chance to become virtuous. While a virtuous hero will only benefit your team with buffs and stress reduction. An afflicted hero has the complete opposite effect, increasing the stress of those around them and sometimes actively putting themselves in danger or ignoring your command completely. If your stress becomes too high, your hero is at risk of a heart attack which may kill them outright. This may be compounded by the games quirk system, where in certain situations a hero will develop a positive or negative quirk that will affect how they act, or how you must treat them. These can range from increased stress gain to a compulsive need to examine every item you come across and many more.\n\nWhen it comes to presentation, Darkest Dungeon gets full points. The gothic 2d art style oozes personality without being overly busy or confusing and a good use of depth of field stops the game from feeling flat. The interface is incredibly well designed and remains simple, despite the amount of information housed within. There are a few changes I would make to make viewing information a little easier but overall the interface does what it sets out to do very well.  The graphic style of Darkest Dungeon conveys the mood of the game perfectly and only strengthens its theme, ESPECIALY when paired with the terrific audio design and the phenomenal voice acting of the narrator.\n\nThe Audio design in this game is on another level when stacked up against its peers. as the light fades so too does the music’s simple nature, giving way to an erratic tune that becomes more maddening the more you venture forth, the weighty sounds of attacks as your group goes toe to toe with all manner of horrors, and of course the absolutely shiver inducing tones of the loquacious narrator as he pontificates about his "Venerable house" and the "arcades of antiquity".\n\nAll of these elements come together to make Darkest Dungeon and absolutely unforgettable experience. the feeling of felling an enemy with a perfect strategy leaves you in awe of yourself as a brilliant tactician while other times becoming absolutely downtrodden as you lose the hero you've been cultivating for so very long. Darkest Dungeon is a game about making the best out of what you are given and sometimes when life gives you lemons, well I hope you like lemons.\n\nOverall my Experience with Darkest Dungeon has been incredibly satisfying, having put 40 hours into the game I can see that I am in fact not even close to finishing, nor do I feel the fatigue that I usually would after playing most any other game for such a long period of time. When I first saw it in early access I was itching to play it, but decided to hold off and wait until the developers were confident enough to say that it was a finished product, and I am so glad that I did.\n\n\n\nIf you are a fan of X-Com, or don’t mind a bit of punishment to get true satisfaction out of your gaming experience then I don't have any problem telling you that\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a MUST PLAY.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review consider leaving a thumbs up, or if you have some constructive feedback to leave, feel free to comment.","February 15","true","51.4"," 80 of 122 people (66%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","66","80","122","8","0"

As you walk forward the clock ticks down.  If you loot something, there is a good chance you will lose 15 seconds.  If you don't have enough torches the clock ticks down even faster as you move.  If you get into a fight and take too long trying to survive, you lose additional time.\n\nIf you are critically hit, EVERY party member loses fifteen seconds.  If you critically hit someone, one or two of your party members may gain a few seconds back on the clock.\n\nOne player class has the beneficial ability to sit in the back row and give one team member three more seconds to an individual timer.  In comparison there are common enemy special abilities you will constantly encounter, that deal a small amount of damage , while taking another 15 to 20 seconds off of one party members timer.\n\nEnemies have group attacks that hit every party member and removes another 20 seconds from your play timer.  There is no friendly equivalent, not even something small that gives everyone 2 or 3 seconds back.\n\nIf one character hit's the halfway mark and is down to only two minutes remaining, roll a ten sided dice. If you roll a one through nine, that character instantly loses an additional 30 seconds, and each other group member loses 30 seconds as well.  That character will then randomly take away another 10 seconds from each player while walking, and in combat will continue to drain time away from the entire group about every two rounds.  If this triggers a second group member hitting the 2 minute mark, that person will then have a %90 chance of suffering something similar, and draining even more time from your play.  There is hope though, if you get that slim one-in-ten victory at the halfway point, you will gain a minute and a half back on your timer, and once every six to eight rounds of combat you will give out a party buff.  This experience will feel like winning a five dollar scratcher.  Sure, you won, but now you have to go back to the gas station.  Hooray.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it, a lot.  Great sound effects, incredible voice-over work, and perfectly moody and atmospheric soundtrack.  The game play is fun and interesting, unique leveling system and very cool buffs and debuff's that can arrive quickly and randomly.  Sadly, if the stress system doesn't get a whole lot more attention, this game will be doomed to bear the ultimate video game sin of being boring.  The stress meter has a lot of potential to create exciting or scary swings towards victory or defeat, akin to the random elements you normally expect from critical hits.  Unfortunately, the only thing the stress meter actually adds to the game, is redundant timer.  Regardless of preparation, or player choice, the stress bar is essentially a one way trip towards character heart attack, and that stress meter can suffer random spikes towards maximum from every single action you take or enemy you face.  There are methods in-game for reducing stress for party or characters, but those are comparitively small when measured against the steady swell of incoming stress.  Initially this feature is quirky and interesting, but when you realize how it works, and that it steadily and reliably defeats you with no recourse, the game becomes boring.  It's similar to knowing that tax season is around the corner, and you are going to owe again.  This game is not as difficult as some make it out to be. There is simply a pre-lit fuse over every action you take and that you can't put out, only slow down, poorly.\n","July 26, 2015","false","60.2"," 201 of 329 people (61%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","61","201","329","15","3"

In short, should you buy it? YES.\n\nImportant things to know:\nThe game is technically early access and I'm sure you've heard (or been subject to) the horrors that could potentially come from a title with this tag. But one easy way to know if this game is a legitimate seller, or just a shameless grab for money; is to look at the news/updates for the game. The game has very steady updates, which are usually packed with either a lot of fixes and tweaks, or full blown new elements to play with. Overall the developers seem pretty committed and there is a large pool of gamer genres it caters too, making the community reasonably sized.\n\nBuy this game if you like:\n-Challenging yet rewarding game-play\n-"dungeon crawlers" (aka Diablo, etc.)\n-Unforgiving games like Dark Souls (See negatives)\n-Awesome medieval/gothic art style animations\n-Strategy games\n\nSetting:\nThere really aren't many spoilers to give, so long as you've seen the videos offered on the game's store page; you've got the gist of it. You are the heir of a noble bloodline, who's family owned a castle and a big chunk of land, which subsequently became overrun with demons, undead, etc. You are directed by the, amazingly well voice acted, voice of your ancestor to cleanse the grounds of all evil and take back your home.\n\nGameplay:\nThe character you play as (the heir), is never actually seen (except for a brief silhouette in the window of a stage coach). The game is seen mainly through the eyes of the adventurers that get hired to wander the halls, sewers and gardens of the grounds. Their are several different classes to choose from, as well as an enormous number of random traits assigned to every new character arriving on the stage coach (think of Rogue Legends).\n\nThe explorers are sent in to accomplish various tasks: map the area, kill baddies, purify alters and exterminate bosses; all the while collecting gold, jewels, trinkets and other important things. You control them as they travel from room to room, managing supplies and food consumption. A major mechanic of the game is stress, which regularly proves to be more lethal than most of the enemies by themselves. If an adventurer becomes too stressed they become "afflicted", resulting in various negative behaviors including hurting themselves, whimpering in fear, reckless abandonment or just further stress.\n\nOnce the adventurers stagger out of the dungeons with loot in hand, they return to a small town just outside of the grounds and deliver it to you. It is then your duty to manage your money to fund various important tasks such as: paying to let characters reduce their stress (praying, drinking, etc.), upgrading their gear/skills, investing into town services to upgrade their benefits and a myriad of other things that I'll let you find for yourself.\n\nNegatives:\n-The game is very punishing. When enemies "Crit"(critical hit) they not only deal extra damage but usually cause the stress of all your party members to go up. VIce versa, your heroes crits will heal some stress; but the enemy do not experience stress so its not much of a loss for them. Also heroes, if not careful, die a lot. It may get to the point where each expedition ends with you hiring an entirely new team.\n-RNG. Random number generators are used for a lot of the unseen calculations that determine whether an attack hits or misses and how much damage is dealt. Recently they've implemented fixes to make it so enemies can't crit 5 times in a row, completely wiping your party; but like I said, early access.\n-Trinkets are Unbalanced. Sometimes your adventurers might find a trinket that can enhance certain stats/abilities. Most of the time these trinkets benefits are far outweighed by their negatives, making all but a specific few trinkets essentially useless (except in more advanced play).\n\nPositives\n-Looks great, sounds great. The art style is very gothic and edgy, wrapping up the whole "Darkest Dungeon" feel. While the animations themselves are very simple, the game has an excellent audio board full of tasty sound effects. Mainly though your ancestors voice steals the show, narrating just about everything in an aristocratic, gravelly tone. "A SINGULAR Strike! The fiends must be driven back, and what better place to begin than the seat of our noble line."\n-Endless combinations. You can take four adventurers into a dungeon. The various classes, plus the positive/negative traits they all have, plus the trinkets they're carrying, plus the specific dungeon area, plus the various skills they possess; lead to a new experience every crawl. Experimenting on what works well with what is half the fun, giving it a really strong replay value as they add new content all the time.\n-Intense Crawls. Never before will you look at a dungeon crawler the same way again. The adversity that you must overcome, coupled with trying to keep your characters from ending themselves, is delectably painful. Your characters will seem to take on personas of their own as they single handedly take on a boss or go insane and starting acting manically.\n\nClosing statement\nBuy the game. They just added two new characters for free. You won't regret it.\nOr maybe you will, once you've entered...\nThe Darkest Dungeon\n\nUPDATE 8/11\nStill playing and the game is only getting better...","May 28, 2015","true","100.7"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","33","42","3","0"

It's nice to see the early access state to finished barely changed anything, except add in more fake difficulty.\nPros:\n-REALLY, REALLY good artwork and style, some animations could be a tad better, but they're mostly 99% good most of the time.\n-An interesting gimmick of stress and the psychological horrors that adventuring could have.\n-Unique quirks system making every hero feel slightly different.\n-Interesting classes, all with unique dialogue.\n-Pretty simple game to grasp.\n-More game options to get rid of... unwanted gameplay aspects.\n-Super easy to mod, the devs even encourage modding (In case anyone wants to know, just make a comment in the review asking how, and I will be glad to share on how to mod the game).\n-Death's door to prevent complete and utter insta-kills/give a fighting chance.\n-Wayne June does an AMAZING job as the ancestor. Honestly, I would say it's the best thing about this game.\nCons:\n-The gimmick of stress is just one huge annoyance, the chances of actually getting into 100+ is by doing a dark run or getting gimmicked by stress attacks.\n-Heart attacks, 1. Stress takes many years to actually start having health issues, you don't have a heart attack instantly. 2. If you get hit by it once, you now go to insta-death's door, a second time? Bye bye, hero.\n-Quirk system, most are just annoyances that, once again, are just gimmicks.\n-Disease system, most are, again, annoyances, however, it needs more balancing (i.e. hero gets Black Plague, throw hero away or cure it because they literally can't help now. Hero get rabies, leave it, it's more of a buff than anything. Hero gets Griping in the Guts, annoying, but it's easy to get around.)\n-Afflictions and virtue chances, virtue chances are so low, I think it might be possible for someone to have 100+ hours into the game and never get a virtue. Afflictions are major gimmicks, reducing nearly every stat for the hero and making them do random things. You can generally keep going with an affliction, but if the player has more than about 2 rooms, you will have to cut off the run short, only to do... nothing.\n-Above, why does it do nothing? It's mainly a farm and grind game, any gold you need can easily be obtained just by slamming heroes into dungeons, with or without supplies. The upgrades to the town make it to were you need less gold. Everything is an infinite amount of gold and heirlooms.\n-Because everything is an infinite supply, including heroes, it makes it more smart to upgrade your town first rather than try and play normally.\n-Heroes are on infinite supply, no matter what, this game will never truly be hard if there's no true way to "lose" since gold and heirlooms can be farmed. If you lost all heroes without upgrading the stagecoach, what happens? 4 fresh heroes right there.\n-Champion dungeons become a long, slow, tedious grind to the boss. It also requires some serious number crunching and near perfect min max team comp, leaving barely any room for expirements.\n-...The only way you can figure out this game is legitimately rolling low numbers on purpose is modding. How? Perfect example, as a joke, I made the Jester (funny stats for a funny character) do 0-9999 damage with a modifier of 100+% damage increase... he would constantly hit from 2000-4000. You start off with 67% of a death resist, I even increased it to about a 75%... they still have a good chance of dying from 1 hit.\n-The numbers ROUND DOWN. A double edged blade, to an extent, since it also applies to the enemies. Need an example? A vestal can heal for 7-8. Adding a trinket that gives a 33% heal buff, lowest heal she can get is 9 (9.31, to be precise). Highest would be 10 (10.64, precisely). Instead of rounding up when it hits a .5 and above, it rounds down. This effects the player mostly though because even if they still get rounded down, the enemies can outdamage any negative things that happen.\n-Class balance is fine for the most part, except the classes that outperform the others, outperform them HEAVILY. A vestal can NEVER outheal any damage, only prolong them from death. An occultist? He can not only have the best debuff in the game, but outheal the damage to a character. Hellions? Best meleer in the game. Why? She's the only class in the game that can hit ranks 2-3 while in rank 1-3 and 4 in rank 1. Lepers cry because once they get pushed to rank 3, they literally can't do anything worthwhile. When they're in ranks 1-2? They can only hit enemy ranks 1-2. Does he have the damage to make up for it? For a normal class? Sorta. Hellion though? She's barely a few points off of leper damage except she can add a bleed DoT.\n-DoTs... bleed is pretty much the only good DoT. Blight upon hit does 0 damage and at max rank does a DoT of a whopping... 7. Yay. A hellion could basically hit for that along with a bleed that does about 3 damage. I don't understand Red Hook's obsession with blight doing no damage.\n-However, you need some DoTs because of prot and champion dungeons. With all these recent patches, they added prot which was a means of prolonging the fight to make it "harder" meaning use some more DoTs just for them. Also, there is no possible way you can get up to the jacked prot the enemies have. The best you will get will probably be 15%, using both trinket slots.\n-These devs constantly buff enemies while nerfing heroes. Matter of fact, the entire every team is viable has been bogus since the release of the game and has only be stomped more into the ground with these stupid nerfs.\n-Final level is filled with nothing but stress gimmicks and enemies that tank (granted, they can do a lot of damage, esp. with crits + DoTs) that wants you to min max a team.\n-There's a slight more, but I won't touch on them except... the crazy, annoying doomsayer. ♥♥♥♥ him. I hope they remove him. His yelling sounds like some bad, cheesey, low budget porno that doesn't make any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense.\nTL;DR version: The game is good if you're gonna play a small amount and then move on. If you plan to spend a lot of hours in it, pass or wait for about a... 75% sale, at least............. Also ♥♥♥♥ the doomsayer, ♥♥♥♥ing remove him already.\n\nSide note: Before I get ♥♥♥♥ stormed by I'm bad, casual, not helpfuls, etc. I have played enough "hard" games and even relatively obscure games, Dark Souls (not really obscure, but "hard, but fair" which a I call bull and beaten it), Legend of Grimrock 1&2, Pillars of Eternity, a few Ys games, and more. I can say, this game would be good for a mobile, up until champions, which can take up to an hour from the tankiness of enemies. I am very far from bad, casual, etc., it's just the way the game plays, it's just meat grind simulator till you can use heroes leveled etc. (specific heroes too) and then it becomes 95% of the time, the house wins game. Huge time sink to even START in the higher level dungeons. Honestly, veteran is the most fun that can be had, and that was ruined by the crit focus every battle.\n\nSide Side Note: I have feeling the people upvoting this generally agree with what I have to say, but if you have read this far, please tell others to not just mindlessly upvote bad and/or good reviews. It doesn't help anyone, and it can possibly even mix opinions and facts. For example, if one says x game is bad because it requires too much number crunching whereas another one says x game is bad because it seems like the devs wanted you to be a 2 year old to play, then... yeah, kinda hard to truly tell where opinions and facts start and end. So, please try to spread the word of don't upvote/downvote till you know where this review is coming from. Also, don't upvote memes and joke reviews, it, once again, hurts to see where facts and opinions mix. Just... vote funny and move on.","December 27, 2015","false","61.3"," 217 of 357 people (61%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","61","217","357","14","38"

As a resuly I have I have become very attached to this game and honestly want to see it so well. So, bad stuff first.\n\nYeah so my squad just got critted a whole bunch of times, went mad and refused heals and I missed 5 escape attempts.  They all died, leaving me with no gold and no future prospects other than using some scrubs from the wagon to get some gold, and up until week 40 I only had 6 deaths. Now it's 13, their blood is on my hands and I'm slowly accumulating a pile of dead lepers and doctors.  Honestly I really love this game, but it makes me sad that a careful style of play is not rewarded (enough) and you just end up treading water to recover failed missions. At it worst it feels like playing a freemium game, but thankfully never for long. I feel like what the dev was going for was to balance your need to go forward against the personal needs of your heroes, and that's great, but I feel like it requires some balance in areas. It skirts the line between unfair and unforgiving and don't get me wrong, that makes for some exhilerating gameplay, but some fail safes on the side of the unfair would be much appreciated for those of us who would like to move forward with the least amount of bloodshed possible.  As an aside, both the conflicting quirks and the removal of incorrect quirks from the abbey were areas where the game could be unforgiving and have it not be a big deal, and they made sense flavour wise( why would medieval medicine be so much more effective than modern medicine and having only one stress outlet is unhealthy respectively).  I think they were removed or tuned down recently and I would be against outright removal.  However an upside chance alongside the downside chance would be nice, especially in regard to removal of quirks.  I realise this is more feedback than review but sure feck it I'm here anyway.\n\nThat being said, this game is amazing.  The mechanics, tone, atmosphere, voice acting. music, narration, art direction, stability(1 crash on day one, none since) and balance ( mostly!) all emerged fully formed from the developers tepid mind-womb.Also , I talk like that now so that's nice.\n\n9/10 for full release, 11/10 for early access.  Also those of you who are waiting for it to be on sale or waiting for the full release, or both, I wouldn't expect a sale in the next year since the early access period is 6 months.  However, I think if you Nomad level kickstart it for 15 bucks, you get it on release.  Not sure if you can still do that, but you used to be able to. You will not get early access.","February 8, 2015","true","48.3"," 56 of 82 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","56","82","8","0"

Some of the negative reviews have said that this game has an unfair difficulty system, that you will randomly be matched up against enemies that are simply impossible to beat for the level that you are at, and this was the only thing intially holding me back from getting it. This isn't true, the enemies are tough but it is also fair, I am yet to lose a character and I feel that if I ever do it will be down to my own mistakes.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who love roguelike games, RPGs, Lovecraftian fiction and horror as this game uses all those elements beautifully. The game looks fantastic with an incredible art style, plays beautifully with a well structured and balanced combat system, and has an awesome narration voice that adds to the overall atmosphere.\n\nGet this game, you won't regret it!\n\n\n\nUpdate @ 12 hours in:\n\nI've now lost 3 important characters and each loss has been emotionally devastating. Each was lost due to my poor tactical choices and greed for more loot and pushing to finish the dungeon when I knew it was taking a massive risk.","July 5, 2015","true","31.1"," 52 of 76 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","52","76","3","8"

Every dungeons, classes, buildings gave me a great feeling of "God there's so much different things to do and try", and the first ten hours (because I like to take my time) were the funniest hours I've spent on a game since a few years.\nEvery characters (or class) feel unique, they all have their quality and flaws, they have damage or debuff or DoT or even heal/protect skills, they have some kind of specialities (like multi-targeting or crit or DoT...) and even some great art. Every building have a good impact on the game and makes you feel "doing what you are doing for a reason".\nThere's also Torch management, Inventory and objects management (as some object can be really usefull on fights), stress management, etc... I mean there's a lot of great thought features that will make you be really, REALLY happy at the beginning.\n\nYeah everything was fine, fun, balanced, and so much more, until I reached the level 5 part of the game (The maximum level is 6 by the way).\n\nThen monsters began to be completely unfair, most of them are going from 10HP 0% Protection, 10 dodge and 6-10 damage, to 26-50HP, 35% Protection 36 Dodge, and a ridiculous increase of damage (some hits for 30 crit even with 25% damage reduction, no jokes). You might think it's fair if you didn't buy the game yet because you can upgrade your heroes, but the main problem comes from the fact that if you upgrade TO MAXIMUM your characters, overall they'll win 5 damage/10 accuracy (depends of the class though), 10-20HP and 10 dodge, and they still have a completely unbalanced factor of damage/heal (like going from 5-8 damage to 7-14). What that means for real is that THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY MATTERS IS HOW LUCKY YOU ARE. Melee characters can't hit anymore and will miss 40% of their attacks even with a huge accuracy boost, ranged character will deal the same amount of damage to opponent than they previously were on level 1 because of the insane protection boost on monsters and will even miss 1/3 of their attacks, heals will go from 4-6 to 6-10 even fully upgraded which CAN'T follow the damage upgrade of your ennemies. You feel like being completely torn apart every fight, and struggle to make your characters survive even for a single turn. The stress management becomes impossible to handle, as on 100 stress most of your characters will begin to pass their turn, wound themselves, disagree to get healed or use the wrong skill, and you have to surrender most of the dungeons after 4 rooms because even 1 firecamp break wasn't enough to make them feel better, if you didn't lose someone already.\n\nSome classes will survive and "do" some things, but 60% of the other class (there's 15 on the game) will struggle so much that it's just impossible to use them. You'll have to spend half the gold you made to treat some disease that are impossible to avoid, to treat their stress as even if you are the best coach in the world, it's impossible not to reach the 100 bars on at least 3 of your heroes (and skills that reduce stress are mostly useless btw) which gives the game a more frustrating than hard feeling.\n\nAfter 40 hours of gameplay, I never tried the level 6 dungeon of the game and the only level 5 dungeons I made were short ones. There's a terrible grinding of gold to do because of how much you'll need to spend after every dungeon (but when you think afterwards, it's the most fun part of the game because you'll farm gold on level 1 balanced dungeons with funny/original strats or composition !).\n\nI first thought that I was just bad, or making bad decisions, but after trying so much builds, classes, and reading a lot of people reviews, it's just sad to say, but the game is NOT FUN AT ALL on the endgame.\nLosing character is a point of the game (as the developpers said), but if you lose them because it's really hard, or you took a critical strike, or your heal get stunned on the wrong turn, it's pretty funny actually, it happens, it's a part of the Roleplay, etc..., you'll have to be more careful or change your trinkets to decrease the odds of death happening next time. But here, it's just completely luck based, and you feel like you got absolutely no chances of winning and all the odds are AGAINST you. The only hope you have is if your character land the CRITICAL HIT OF HIS LIFE that you needed, which means that 1/18 of the time it'll be an okay fight only because of luck, none of your management has a real impact.\n\nIf I can add one last thing, is that your characters have positions, which basicly allows them to use some different skills. Great feature I have to say, but what I find unfortunate is that this positionning has impact on YOUR HEROES ONLY, it's changes nothing for the opponent, they do whatever they want to whoever they want. It would be even more fun if your positions changed the amont of dodge, or damage you take, of even damage you deal or accuracy I don't know, which could make "tank" be a real thing, or healer be less vulnerable. It would actually give a certain amount of strategy and credit to the combination of heroes you try to make.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I got no regrets for buying this game, and it is still terribly fun on the early part, but there's a huge difference (as everybody said) between "The games involves dying because it is hard" and pure frustration, pure madness, pure luck. To make a comparison, when you play Roulette, you choose the amount and the numbers you bet on. Here, it's like watching the bet table, only allowed to bet all your money on a single number, as you are not even changing your odds of winning, dying, or whatever, every time you enter a level 5+ dungeon or equipping different trinkets.\n\nI still have to give a huge shout out to the developpers, who did overall an absolutely beautiful and enjoyable game, one that we were waiting for a long time, one that is beating most of the other games out there and even big studios ones. But I hope that the future updates will give a brighter future to the game (and that unfair points will change to hard points), as more and more players are reviewing this game badly because of the sames problems over and over again.\n\nEDIT : For all those who says "You need to watch a playthrough on internet etc..." well if the point of the game is to take the same characters as an internet guy and do the exact same thing (because other things don't work as intended), it breaks COMPLETELY all the DnD, discover by yourself, experiment, point of the game, which is to me the best point of all. I took the Vestal for healing because it is more constant even if it heals less than the occulist, but everybody told to me "Naah don't take the vestal, just take the occulist", then what is the point of the game if it's just to play like hearthstone and brainlesly taking other's people decks ?

On the flipside, you can play like absolute garbage and have nobody in your party die ever because whether or not a character lives or dies when they're at 0hp is purely down to chance.\n\nI get that the design is supposed to force the player to make the best of a bad situation, and I can get behind that, but at this stage (As of today, "This stage" is the game as the devs invisioned it on release. There's no hope for change.) there are too many design decisions that force the outcome out of the player's hands. This is probably because the part of the game that is actually up to the player is so easy - if you've got at least a few braincells rubbing together, it doesn't take long to figure out how to play it optimally. So, rather than address that, the developers have decided to make it randomly kick you in the nuts every few minutes. This doesn't make it deep or challenging, just frustrating.\n\nThe golden moments where the game achieves what it sets out to do with it's chaos management mechanics are few and far between, and most RNG punishment tends to go around instantly eliminating one of your heroes. Rather than requiring you to adapt your strategy because of the loss of a character, you're able to just go back to a level 1 dungeon and start over because all it takes to replace a dead hero is to grind a few levels. It doesn't add any extra challenge, it just forces you to grind more.\n\nIt fits into the new-wave "Hardcore" trend following Dark Souls, where being "Hardcore" comes more from marketing and player perspective than actually being a difficult game and, as a result, that's the philosophy that drives the worst elements of it's design. What's more, players who picked up the game based on this marketing are willing to defend these elements to the death, because if the public perception were to change to see the mechanics *the way they are* without the "omg so hardcore" veneer, that would invalidate the hardcore gamer cred they feel they've earned by suffering through the game's grind. If you're feeling "Called out" at this point, that's great, because I think you're a tool.\n\nArt, storytelling and atmosphere are A+, and I'm going to come back to it just for that when the last of the content is added, but the game itself is a grind facilitated by RNG that shouldn't pose any actual challenge to anyone with a reasonable knowledge of CRPG mechanics.","January 5","false","28.6"," 104 of 167 people (62%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","62","104","167","11","1"

Early mechanics are fun, the art is amazing and the difficulty is certainly there.\n\nHowever, as soon as one hits the mid-game, difficulty turns into annoyance with ridiculously unbalanced stress on Veteran and higher quests.

For a game that relies on random numbers for power, using cheap tactics like this or monster corpses only make the game more tedious and boring, not requiring of skill.\n\nGiven Red Hook seems pretty bent on messing up the game with their patches and that any critic on the official forums is met with anger and insult, I see no reason to think these problems will be addressed soon.

Which seems to be a trend with this studio - they come up with game mechanics to fix problems, real or imagined, but never actually think whether those would be fun or fit the lore (not to mention being logical), which in the end brings more of a repetitious tedium than anything else without fixing much, if anything. Even worse - some of those new game mechanics introduce new problems which get "fixed" in the same fashion... All of that resulted in an illogical, frustrating and very much grindy experience. The truly spot-on art style, music and narrator could no longer offset the tedium and as such the game simply became un-fun. To the point where this happened:\n\nhttp://www.thejimquisition.com/darkest-dungeon-and-the-perils-of-early-access/\n\nas a result of which Jim Sterling, as a Steam curator, eventually decided to take down his own Early Access recommendation for this game...\n\n(On a related note this is a relevant read as well)\n\nThe devs’ desire to make the game hard(er) for the sake of it (and there is only one difficulty setting with no plans for adding more) thus meant that for example higher-tier maggots in dungeons had more armor than even your best armored crusaders in one of the previous patches. Maggots! Why? Because this is how this studio decided to increase the game difficulty - where each maggot was basically like a terminator sent back from the future to end your line. They introduced more randomness for the sake of randomness, grinding for the sake of "prolonging" the content, and introduced an overall, fake, difficulty increase (clad in the impenetrable armor of tedium) because according to the devs this is supposedly a roguelike game (which it really isn't - this is basically XCOM with Ironman permanently ON but with Cthulhu monsters instead of aliens and a lot more illogical randomness). It has randomly generated (and very generic) dungeon layouts, hero permadeath and a single automatic save – and that’s it. It has no fail state. You literally cannot lose. According to this it also never will. It will have even more grinding though. A lot more - once the last, fifth endgame dungeon is implemented it will require you to finish multiple missions, as it were, in it, only unlike the other four dungeons it would not allow you to retreat in case things get hairy. Which means that if your heroes fail their mission they will perish trying - which is perfectly fine. Problem is - in case your heroes are victorious they will get a perk preventing them from doing more missions in the endgame dungeon effectively forcing you to grind more heroes from level 0 (no, you cannot hire higher level heroes) in the other four dungeons as to attempt to finish the game. Basically you have to grind one full party of heroes per endgame mission and that is assuming you finish them all at first attempt. Yeah...\n\nDespite the game being in Early Access and the devs constantly proclaiming that they appreciate and value player feedback such game altering changes are NEVER put out for public testing prior to release, even if Steam allows beta patches to be installed by those who want to do so and test such changes before they make it into the live build. Such changes are also never discussed or even listed (anywhere) prior to coming to the live build. It is literally expected that people would simply take them for what they are, like them and praise the devs for their hard work. “Communication” with these devs is strictly a one-way street and takes the form of their patch notes. Criticism was simply ignored in the past. Now it is actively censored with people often getting banned and their whole post history outright deleted.\n\nAll of this has had its effect. According to this[steamspy.com] the game sold more than 400 000 copies on Steam so far. But according to this[steamcharts.com] between sales and major patches on average 700-800 people play it. Which put into perspective means that only 0.2% of the owners of this game actively play it for what it is. The other 99.8% do not, and as of writing this the numbers are still falling...\n\nIn its current state, as an Early Access title, I really cannot recommend this game. As a matter of fact I'd advise you to stay away from it. The developers do not seem to have a clear-cut vision of what their game is to be, seem to be haphazardly throwing illogical and badly though-out game altering patches (sometimes game breaking in terms of fun) and since they neither ask for nor heed any player feedback there doesn't seem to be much hope of them getting this right by the time it is officially released, which as of writing this is 3 months or so away.\n\nAs a conclusion I'd like to add that this is not my first Early Access game. Nor is it the most expensive.  Some of my other Early Access games have been basically completely abandoned by their devs and never got finished as such.  But despite all that Darkest Dungeon is the Early Access game that managed to convince me, once and for all, to never, ever, buy into Early Access games again.","October 30, 2015","false","17.2"," 194 of 324 people (60%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","60","194","324","15","10"

I played through the game and it was a blast.\nSecond time I played through after Men at arms and arbralest were introduced, 2 patches before the cove i guess.\n\nSo right before the release i started my thrid playthrough to be right at the darkest dungeon as soon as it is released.\nI am shocked. This is not the same game anymore. I used to be pretty RNG heavy throughout the entire early access phase but RNG was always less important than your decision making. Thats occours to be over now and Redhook failed in a very important aspect.\n\nIf you try to be hard but rewarding do it like the Dark Souls/Demon Souls/Bloodborne series and be FAIR and dont just try to artificaly incease the difficulty with stupid RNG and bad gimmicks wich represent the awful way of "quick and dirty" solutions instead of well thoughtout gameplay as it was in the beginning of the early access period.\n\nI am disappointed. Darkest Dungeon used to be my holy grail of the way early access games should be... to bad.\n\nIf any Redhook Dev reads this here is the hint of your lifetime:\nReddit is loud, but doesnt represent your community/customers/fans by any means. Its only a small portion. Make the game as YOU (!) want it, not as some random person on the internet thinks it should be. And if you want to satisfy all the redditors include a difficulty system like Bastion.\n\nLong text in short: If i wouldnt have  experienced the good times in early early access i would use the refund option now.\n","December 27, 2015","false","127.1"," 126 of 206 people (61%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","61","126","206","10","1"

I absolutely adore the camping mechanic in this game. It just oozes personality. Easily my favourite part of the game. In fact, there is a huge amount of tension in trying to keep your party members alive and sane. The stress mechanic is brilliant and adds a lot to the feeling of the game.\n\nThe Strategic Gameplay\n\nThe problems with darkest dungeon isn't that its a roguelike with crushing RNG; its the same with the other games of the same genre. The problem is that its is a very grindable rougelike.\n\nTo make sure your heros have the best equipment and ability available, you will have to upgrade your town with heirlooms. To upgrade your town, you have to find heirlooms in dungeons. To get heirlooms without jeopordizing your best characters, you'll run low level dungeons, repeatedly.\n\nThere is no check to this. In fact the game encourages you to do this with the tiered dungeon system. Your hero too high level? Well then it can't participate in lower level dungeons, you get this new harder dungeon! Don't have other heroes of the same level, well then you are either going to go into that dungeon disadvantaged (and lose hours of work when they die) or going to have to grind other heroes up before you can use the high level one.\n\nBecause of this, the tension of the early game completely evaporates when you get to middle and late game. There is absolutely no incentive to push for higher level dungeons until you are completely geared due to perma death and the amount of time needed to reach that point. There is no timed mechanic like in XCOM or FTL that causes you to continue pushing forward.\n\nThe Tactical Gameplay\n\nA huge part of the tactical gameplay depends on party composition. Everyone fights in a line and your available attacks depends on where you are at in the line. I find myself thinking about optimal party lineups well until the end of the game, so well done there.\n\nDungeon Crawling\n\nVery uninspired. You move around in rooms and encounter monsters. You can find curios around which spices things up at the begining until you figure how they work. Traps basically just does damage to you.\n\nRecommendation\n\nOnly get if you want to support to support the developers in making this game. I see a lot of potential for this game, but at the moment, the game is just not all there.","March 8, 2015","false","90.8"," 91 of 146 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","91","146","5","3"

While the latter two remain intact, it's the former that has suffered greatly. The game's recent patching has made it boring and frustrating to play. Enemies have always been unfairly strong, and have always had more and better actions than you, it was how you strategized around this and managed your resources that helped you overcome this. However, each patch has ruined this rewarding of smart thinking more and more. The developers are far too dead set on punishing players for finding loopholes or gimmicks, and the game has become no fun. Unless you run with an online guide with the optimal party and make sure everything is perfect. You will lose, and even if you do all that, the odds are you will still lose. I cannot put into words how frustrating it is to have a boss heal back 20 health in a turn, hit your party for 40 damage, then heal for another 15, then one of your members goes, and he instantly repeats his 3 turn process. It's a joke to call this game "Strategy" anymore. It's luck, it's a pure slot machine that I honestly don't want any part of anymore. The new class was interesting and I played around with him, enjoying the man beast concept. But then I was sucked back out of the game when ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG decided that he would be crit, given a disease and 4, count em, 4 different disorders from 3 consecutive attacks. The game is dumb, it doesn't even make any sense. Why does the trader provide less goods for shorter trips? Wouldn't a trader sell as much as he could to make more money? Why can't you stall a fight to heal? It already doesn't make sense you can't heal out of combat, or camp more than the allotted times. The player punishing is just dumb and incessant, and I know it won't stop so I'll be dropping this game. What was once and fun and interesting game to play when I had nothing else to do has become a boring chore that annoys me and sets me back hours regardless of how well I know the game and it's systems. Don't Buy It. Do yourself a favor, try Xcom, it has similiar BS Rng but it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ you nearly as hard. Also, the developers of that game don't punish players for finding strategies that work.","December 15, 2015","false","40.8"," 232 of 392 people (59%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","59","232","392","13","0"

A tragedy in many parts.\nDarkest Dungeon was very nearly one of the big wins from Kickstarter alongside Divinity Original Sin, and Wasteland 2 (though opinions do remain a bit divided on that one from time to time). How best to describe it? It's basically the grown up version of Warhammer Quest, except it's the grown up version *done right*. This is probably as close as you'll likely get to a pen and paper roleplaying experience on your computer without actually rolling the dice yourself.\n\nThe game follows two distinct beats, the first takes place in your hamlet, known simply as the estate - insert the name of your save file between 'the' and 'estate', this leads to all kinds of possible creative humour if you stop to consider the implications, for people over here in Britain, the obvious choices such as "The Darkest Leeds Council estate" are going to be too easy to pass up - the estate serves as your hub to manage your roster of adventurers, and it will be a roster, a sizable bunch of misfits drawn from a wide class pool, easily as diverse as you could possibly wish for, and all of them have a slightly grim twist upon their usual fantasy tropes upon which they are based.\n\nA grim tale with a bloody end, for everyone involved...\nFor example, in normal roleplay games, one would ordinarily expect the adventuring party to be made up of the holy trinity, that is to say - tanking, damage and healing. Those tenets are more or less followed here within reason, two of the classes offer up healing options in the guise of the Vestal, a priestess who is decked out in more metal than robocop, and the occultist, who can mend with dark powers whilst raining down curses upon his foes. Tanks include a crusader, possibly the only unambiguously "good" moral choice in the bunch, and even he can be easily brought down from grace if you send him to the brothel (yes, there's a brothel, and yes, you can get people -banned- from it for "deviant tastes"), and a leper, a hulking brute of a tank who wears a mask reminiscent of the guy from V for Vendetta.\n\nAll of the classes have their own unique twist on the usual trope, and their own backstory, a reason for visiting this utterly forsaken place, and as a result you'll likely get attatched to your favourite classes and heroes, all of whom you can name and provide trinkets to adjust their stats a touch here and there. Gear can be upgraded, naturally (though as of the current build, there doesn't seem to be a visual reflection of upgrades, which is a bit saddening, though the art style more than makes up for it), and additional skills can be bought and then shuffled around from the guild hall. Each character gets seven skills, but you can only take four into battle, and some skills are usable only from specific places and only UPON specific targets in the opponents position order, so choose carefully and ensure you have a good spread.\n\nVenturing down into the depths...\nOnce you've settled upon your choice of party, skills and core kit, you then move to the provisioning stage, where you select the mission you wish to take on, you then buy up any consumables you wish to take with you for the mission ahead and then deploy, and the game proper begins. You move about between rooms on a map, following "corridors" made up of little mapsquares that can contain encounters, loot and other interesting things, the rooms too can contain multiple items and enemy groups, and over time, fighting can build up stress in the group, and as wounds pile up and the group gets taxed, so too does their minds.\n\nThat's when the stress mechanic begins to take it's toll, eventually as the minds of the adventurers begin to fracture, you'll find they get more... talkative, and less co-operative. Sometimes they'll act on their own, sometimes they'll pass their turn, sometimes they'll refuse healing. It adds a random factor into proceedings that can make the difference between life and death, and combined with the death's door mechanic, can create some genuinely tense and hair raising fights.\n\nIn this game, death is permanent, and boy will you go through adventurers, even getting one to level -3- is considered a feat in itself, most will die before they even see level 2 or even level 1, and the graveyard will likely be full to bursting within a few months. This is not a game to play if you are expecting to develop long lasting relationships with a lot of heroes, you may get to preserve a select few over time, but most will be as moths to the flame. Thankfully the cart comes weekly, loaded with fresh meat for the grinder, and recruitment is free, so that's nice!\n\nThe glory of good design and sound...\nThe art style is -glorious-, and the sound and overall design back this up, creating a genuine Tabletop RPG feel that perhaps could only be provided for by a computer, though if there ever was a proper pen and paper version of this game created, I could imagine as a first edition, it'd sell amazingly well. It has all the ingredients for a fantastic atmosphere, and a great evening in, much like a great night with Dungeons and Dragons. The cherry on the cake is the narrator, who lends a thick, grim air to proceedings, and even when things go well, seems to live to take what little hope you have, and smother it in a layer of soot and grime.\n\nDid I say this game is grim and contained adult themes? Oh it does. Much flagellation and deviancy await, along with unspeakable horrors that will cause many an adventurer's mind to turn in on itself.\n\nThere is a but...\n\nIt very, very nearly got the "Essential" badge, but then I got to the end...\nThe endgame however, pulls the most mighty of penile moves. A hardcoded debuff called "Never again" applies a ban to heroes that enter the Darkest Dungeon, preventing them from returning. This forcibly extends the playtime of the game by forcing you to grind out a minimum of four complete teams, depending on how your parties have evolved, this may take you significantly longer than you expect.\n\nThere's very little reason for this other than to pad out the game and to prevent you from blasting the Dungeon with your "A-team", but nonetheless, here we are. A lot of needless grind put into the game simply to stop you from finishing the game when the time is right.\n\nThis turns the game from being fun, to being frustrating. All the work you do up to the Darkest Dungeon gets thrown in your face and you wind up staring down the barrels of long trudge after long trudge. A ceaseless grind that simply exists to make you stick your face in the dirt.\n\nI'm sorry, but that's no longer "fun". As it stands, it's not fixable either by users. I looked.\n\nFor this very reason, this game loses it's positive Early Access rating from me, and gains a negative rating, with a final verdict that's much less positive in it's standing.\n\nTo be clear - "Never Again" is the core problem - It's hardcoded - It cannot be modded out, it bans characters from the Darkest Dungeon, meaning you CANNOT re-use them in the Darkest Dungeon again, period. If they complete a Darkest Dungeon map, they become unusable, if they fail, they die. Either way, they're scrapped. That's the issue at hand here. Make sure you are entirely informed of this issue before commenting.\n\nVerdict : Wishlist, and pick up on sale, worth considering if you're a fan of -hard- RPG games.\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

The atmosphere of Darkest Dungeon is simply amazing.\n+The characters the player can recruit are all different and have fun quips and personalities.\n+Addictive dungeon crawling that will make you go for "just one more quest."\n+The UI is elegant and superbly done.\n+The devs have added options to remove/toggle corpses, nerf enemy crits and more small tweaks.\n+Certain heroes now bring items with them when embarking, for example the crusader will bring holy water.\n\nThe bad:\n-The difficulty isn't a curve, but a wall, a wall that has been known to be hit even in the tutorial. The game wants to be hard and that's a fine selling point. However, this is not elegant design like Dark Souls, but rather by arbitrarily stacking the odds against you.\n\n-You have to juggle gold, experience points and resources for buildings in order to progress, which is fine in theory, but gold will quickly become the least of your worries as you grind away at resources and while doing that you have to avoid overleveling heroes as this makes it impossible for them to participate in missions they will then deem to easy, yes you read that right, your heroes will actually go against your orders.\n\n-With a huge variety in heroes imbalance is sure to arise, but the issue is how obvious it is. For example, the plague doctor has been one of the weakest hero types throughout this entire Early Access, and they still are because they simply can't match the healing of the Vestal or the damage of the Arbalist.\n\n-Most trinkets are useless. Almost all of them come with one or two bonuses, but also one or two negatives. A select few artifacts only have bonuses, but they usually aren't too great and they are hard to find.\n\n-The quirk system is currently stacked against the player, just like everything else. Negative quirks can fester and become extremely expensive to get rid off. Positive quirks don't have this option, so sometimes after leveling you'll lose valuable quirks because your hero leveled up. Furthermore, diseases are now their own seperate thing, but they don't disappear over time and have to be removed as well, once again, it's just tedium for tedium's sake, because now you have to spend even longer on grinding them away too.\n\n-Red Hook has so far with every update and without fail nerfed heroes and strategies into oblivion, which is fine, afterall the game should be balanced. However, they have crossed the line where it has now become mandatory to use a walkthrough on how to min-max. Gone are the days where 4 jesters could enter a dungeon and while they wouldn't be a great team they could pull through.\n\n-After nearly 50 hours it has become clear to me that one of the biggest issues is the pacing. Upgrading your town takes way too many resources and you never gain the ability to hire heroes higher than level 0. You never truly lose, you're just doing the same thing over and over, always making the same heroes and dismissing them after they become too expensive to make viable.\n\nBottom line:\nDarkest Dungeon has so much potential and back when I first bought it I was absolutely hooked by the atmosphere and surface gameply, but once you get deeper you realize just how poor the execution truly is. One misstep feels like it can ruin your entire game; forcing you to start over.\n\nThe game still has immense potential, but the goal of making a hard game has grown and taken over the core design and it's killing the experience. I vehemently hope that I can change this to a recommendation once the next promised update hits.","January 2","false","50.4"," 172 of 288 people (60%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","60","172","288","11","6"

There's just one thing this game is lacking...the very essence of gaming that all rpgers  especially cherish--SOME TYPE OF GOD DAMN REWARD SYSTEM FOR SPENDING HOURS AND HOURS PLAYING THE GAME!!!\n\nThis game has amazing potential, but the "reward" for playing and progressing through the game are almost non-existent. All of the equipable items are almost worthless. Even the legendary items are pretty much worthless! I mean, how do you create a game where the most powerful items have so many drawbacks for equiping them that you might as well just dungeon crawl NAKED.

RNG based combat is fine, RNG-based combat where a single enemy ability can cripple you in one turn for the rest of the dungeon, is not fine. Combat is no longer about choosing the right thing to hit first, it's praying the enemy party doesn't use a stress attack and crit first, which of course, is completely RNG-based. Devs believe that unfair advantages for the monsters is the same as making the game challenging, when all they are doing is putting off people who actually enjoyed the game. Unlike what many people who don't understand how game difficulty works, you cannot "git gud" at a game where everything is completely reliant on luck. I've been following Darkest Dungeon since it first went into Early Access, and with every update my faith in the devs in making a fun, yet challenging game is eroded.

Now u can almost only get negative stats on your heroes. Was fun before, cant recommend it any longer, havent played it after the Devs ruined the game.\n\nDetails:\n\nFirst it was a real fun game, where you had to grind your way through with stressed out, ill and kleptomanic heroes. Even the the items you got always had a negative impact as well. So it really took time to somehow protect your most beloved hereos through the dungeons and get family heirlooms now and then to finally upgrade your buildings.\n\nSlowly but steadily you would get one or two heroes to the next level without them having 10 different negative effects at once, making them unplayable. Then you finally upgraded the armory and you would spend hours to get enough money to get your top group of heroes new weapons.\n\nCombine this with completely different hero classes that all have their unique purposes and u had a hell of a fun game. At least for me as a RPG fan by heart.\n\nNow, what changed: First, they limited the positive quirks each and every hero can have to 5, which means, that from my best heroes 70% of their positive stats just vanished. It really takes time to build a strong hero in the game and the quirks are the only way to improve them once they got a top weapon and armor. So now it just doesn't make fun anymore playing your best heroes, because you will hit the top ceiling and that's it.\n\nMoreover they didn't limit the negative quirks. While u can't make your heroes better, they will become worse and worse if you don't pay hefty gold for it.\n\nAnd finally they installed a corpse system which makes absolutely zero sense at all. A 8 HP monster  leaves a 15hp corpse behind (WTF?!) which just blocks your way from attacking the other monsters (which still can attack you) and just prolongs fights for no reason.\n\nGiven the fact that you can't boost your hereos anymore and regarding the dragging fights with the corpses I can't recommend the game anymore.\n\n\nEdit: The negative quirks are limited to 5 now. Still, no more fun till the remove the limit of the positive ones again.","August 13, 2015","false","74.8"," 554 of 960 people (58%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","58","554","960","25","21"

The game is stunning not only visually but also in terms of atmosphere and audio design.  Production values are fantastic across the board.\n\nThe game play is solid, tactical, and unrelentingly difficult.  While a heavy dose of the game revolves around RNG, it never feels like the RNG is straight-up screwing you in quite the same way that XCOM does.  Even the most horrific of situations can often be salvaged with a lot of thought and a little luck.\n\nThis is not a game for the weak of heart.  The challenge level is high and the possibility of winding up in a state where you are basically doomed to failure is very real.  Forethought and planning are required in order to keep the dungeon-ball rolling safely.\n\nIf you have a taste for rogue-likes, an interest in the unique, and the idea of a 2D crossbreed of Dark Souls and XCOM sounds magical to you, then you may have just found your game.\n\nMay your torches be ever bright.

I recommend you wait till it's final release before purchasing!\n\nFull Review: First of all I would like to say that I helped back this game. I absolutely loved the concept and was on board the moment I saw the combat and art style. The soundtrack is done wonderfully by Stuart Chatwood of (Prince of Persia series) fame. The art design is foreboding and dark as it should be and the small touches of dialogue from the Nameless Estate Owner's deep voice evokes fear and tension in every battle and even in respite. This game has everything going for it....until you start playing more than two hours of the game.\n\nThe start of the game is difficult and the first dungeon teaches you a very powerful lesson. "In this dark abyss, only thorough forethought and careful execution will you allow yourself to survive". It's a shame then that the game has yet to fully take it's own advice. This game wants to be Dark Souls or FTL or the Binding of Issac so bad and I do too but here's the thing about those games. They may be incredibly difficult, but they are also phenomenally well designed and balanced which is why even in death you want to try again to do better, to play smarter. I can't tell you the amount of times I've spent playing FTL over and over again. Just one more turn, one more room then I'll go to bed. This isn't one of those games; not yet at least.\n\nLets start with the positives, the combat. The combat is fluid and deep and each battle keeps you on edge and each victory feels great. It's such a satisfactory feeling to kill two enemies at once and have the narrator praise your strike when you were at the brink and you turned the tide of battle. It is equally heartbreaking then when an enemy kills an ally you've grown accustomed to, and like your characters your resolve breaks at the sight. That's whats great about this game what's not great is when you attack five times miss five times and the enemy kills you in one hit despite massive upgrades. For all this game does right the balancing issues comeback and take it all away. The first apprentice levels gets you accustomed to the combat but the moment you level up and move on to the next greater challenge the game slams you back HARD and destroys the flow it had been building. Yes the game is supposed to be hard I get it (comes with being a rougelike game, you know no mercy) but the sometimes sporattic RNG isn't fine tuned enough to warent an honest death. The game advices you "sometimes its better to run from a fight", I agree. However when you abandon a quest your allies never receive experience for their effort so not only do you lose money for the supplies that you can't take back you are stuck with stress and nothing to show for it. Wanna an easier level to get back on your feet after a difficult dungeon? Too bad your too strong to go back and too weak to go forward.  They want you to grind for experience and get gold and get stronger to get more skills to be prepared for the next battle. But they punish you for playing it smart and retreating or if you want to do small tasks to make back the money. The game forces your stronger companions to fight more difficult battles alienating them from the rest of your party members. So if you want to get your strongest party to fight the upcoming boss too bad that guy didn't level with the rest of them breaking up the synergy.\n\nSpeaking of party members each class is unique, you have the Crusader, the Vessel, the Bounty hunter, the Occultist, etc.. The problem is that there are classes that are clearly better than others. Why would I bring a Grave robber when I have a Highwayman? She can randomly get an item when resting, whoopee! The Highwayman has a high dodge chance and can hit three enemies for higher damage, guess which one I'm taking? Each party member gets a good quirk and bad quirk. Some make the character more unique others are diseases that need to be cured. You can get rid of the bad ones for a price but only one. Problem is between all the upgrades, the stress relievers, and the upgrades of skills there is not enough money to do what you need to survive. You can't just take a week off play it smart and weigh your options. Your forced to keep going back in. You never can do what you want efficiently and you ask yourself why you couldn't do things differently.  Why couldn't you have an upgrade where you could take away two bad quirks for a slightly increased price instead wasting an adventurer? Why can't I carry more gold like maybe 2000 per slot instead of 1500 or make this less expensive? Why can't I customize the color of an adventurers look? I know I could lose an adventurer but by the fifth bounty hunter I stopped caring about their names or quirks.\n\nMost of the problems probably will be fixed by the time the game is finally released. Which is good but it needed to be said now. This game is still being fixed and balanced. That's why I wrote this review because I want this game to be great it clearly has the potential. I want it to be heralded as the indie Dark Souls or Resident Evil (1-4)  but it doesn't just get it handed to it because it has my money. It has to work at it like everyone else. I believe in Red Hook. It's a great team who clearly want to make a great game and I believe though that by the time it is finished I will be singing it's praises on release day. But for now I will be backing away into the dark night waiting for its foreseeable release.","February 3, 2015","false","11.2"," 404 of 698 people (58%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","58","404","698","37","14"

Lovercraft, Roguelikes, and difficult RPGs, I might be just a little bit biased when it comes to this title, but if you are a fan of any of those, (Or maybe even if you aren't) Darkest Dungeon might be worth a look.\n\nPros:\n+Good sound/art design\n+Difficult (With the option to toggle the more unforgiving features)\n+Good balance between permadeath and progress; losing characters is extremely painful, but expected\n\nCons:\n-Extremely unforgiving (Options exist to toggle some of these. Looking at you, Heart Attacks)\n-Gameplay is somewhat repetetive (But, that's a problem with the genre)\n-Gameplay flow forces you to have multiple parties, can't focus on just your favorite\n\nWith the overview out of the way, let's a get more indepth.\n\nGraphics/sound: 8/10\nSurprisingly enough, this game's art style and sound direction does a lot for it. The sense of gloom as your torch fizzles, and finally snuffs out, with an accoimpanied change in music drives home the tension and risk. The periodical quips from the narrator give the game a feel akin to a novel or short story, further deepening the illusion of playing a Cosmic Horror Story. It all blends together for a unique experience, fully immersed in gothic, Lovecraftian anxiety and despair.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nIf you're wondering why the gameplay is recieving a low score, it's not because it's not a fun game. On the contrary, battles are always tense, the difficulty is spot on, every run just beyond your characters level of ability, meaning greed or complacency can always cost you dearly. Battle system is smootyh and refined, and the mechanics reinforce the tension that is the core of the gameplay experience. My main complaint is the quirk/stress system. On one hand, it is a core mechanic that sets this game apart. After each dungeon run, your characters have a chance to develop  a positive trait, negative trait, or disease, which alters their stats, resistances, or what facilities they can use in town to lower their stress.\nOn the other hand, characters must sit out a battle to have their stress lowered, remove a quirk, or cure a disease, (There are a few exc eptions, but this is the genberal rule) resulting in a gameplay cycle of train team A, lower team A's stress, cure team A's diseases, train team A again. It makes sense mechanically, given the constant, expected flow of new members in your roster, but results in it taking 3 times as long to ready a tream for a boss fight. (And you had best be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ready because you WILL wipe if you aren't extremely well prepared.)\n\nTone/playability/immersion: 10/10\nAll things considered, the game has a lot going for it. It's difficult, but fair, it controls well, it has a strong tone and theme throughout, with the gameplay and mechanics reinforcing said themes. It's not just an RPG where you explore a mansion that is the sight of an Eldritch portal, it has the exact same feel as reading, say, The Dunwhich Horror. And wether you're looking for a game that will draw you in like many games can't, or simply a game that will test your tactical mettle against ever-increasingly difficult foes, Darkest Dungeon hits all the right notes, offering something truly interesting and memorable amidst a growing pool of games that draw on Lovecraft lore but miss the "feel" of his works entirely.","September 10, 2015","true","36.7"," 74 of 118 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","74","118","4","2"

I just want to express my conclusions on the game after beating it.\nIt's wonderful, really, especially if you love Lovecraft like I do. The overall aesthetic, the sound design, the narrative, everything looks great and polished. Combat feels very satisfying and has you literally scream in joy and terror in front of the screen. It's awesome. There's a ton of content too, it took me more than 70 hours to beat the game (it's also very possible to do it in a much shorter time, of course).\nBut this can be quite a stressful experience aswell, not just for your heroes but for you, the player. While I found most of the campaign to be very enjoyable, the endgame really killed most of my enthusiasm and almost got me to the point of giving up playing to just watch the ending on YouTube. This is because the game gets very grindy during the final quests: the Darkest Dungeon is a pretty rough place, and it will probably kill many of your heroes. And unless you send legendary heroes, your party will be dead long before it can explore the dungeon enough to give a clear notion of how the various mobs and bosses fight. And remember that there can be no retreat from that place without at least one dead hero.\nThe grinding aspect kicks in when you realize that you don't have the legendary heroes you need for a particular quest and that you have to train new ones up to level six in order to get a single chance to succeed. Even if you win a Darkest Dungeon quest, the survivors will permanently refuse to embark on the following ones, thus becoming useless.\nYet the game does actually provide you with some hints so that you can immediately guess which heroes you should bring in a particular quest in the Dungeon. (let's imagine that you are tasked with killing a boss, and that maybe the name of said boss can help you plan your party composition before you start the mission...)\nBut since I was too dumb to notice such hints, I finally decided to use a guide to beat the last missions of the game. I guess I'm just not that good with this kind of games, I can't come up with particularly good strategies in terms of party composition, so that my chances of victory often depend on RNG and luck. Plus, this is not Dark Souls or Super Meat Boy, you WILL be punished even though you don't deserve it. Many have criticized the importance of RNG in Darkest Dungeon, but it's a necessary element in a game that wants you to feel stressed whenever your heroes do.\nThat said, I did beat the game with default difficulty options: you can toggle off some mechanics in order to make your experience less frustrating if you feel you can't stand the overall difficulty of the game. You'll probably be labelled a "casual" from hardcore players and you won't be given a particular achievement when you beat the game, but who cares. Your heroes will go crazy during the adventure, make sure you don't. The fact that you are given an option to customize the overall difficulty of the experience is the main reason why I would recommend Darkest Dungeon to anyone, even those who are not familiar with the genre. It's probably still going to hit you hard even in "casual mode" but, as the game tells you, there can be no victory without madness.\n\nEDIT (12 March 2016): the Antiquarian Update solved most of the issues I had with the endgame. So most of what I said above about grinding should no longer be of concern.

But I'll do my best review it based on my own thoughts, rather than the opinions I have read elsewhere online. But I will delve into those later.\n\nI'm not the smartest guy. I'll be up front about that. I rarely go into games and know exactly what things that can be exploited, what must be done to make this or that easy, find loopholes or redundencies. I don't have the patience to go through each and every stat effect and percentage and chart it all out. Its just not something I have interest in or time to do. With this in mind, you can probably tell that I don't actually look into the RNG all that much.\n\nCritical hits are critical hits. Misses are misses. I never noticed if one side had an advantage over the other. I never noticed the effects that torches had on the battlefield cuz I always had one lit. I never noticed if one side got more buffs or had resistances or any of that. I just played the game how I thought it should be played.\n\nHere is where my biggest issue with the entirety of the game comes into play: the inability to play how you want.\n\nNow, I get it. Darkest Dungeon is meant to be difficult. its meant to put you into a corner, but its boot to your jaw and see how you can escape it. Here's a few things I don't like, however, about said difficulty - with personal examples from the game:\n\n-battle mechanics, on a defensive side. What do I mean by this? Well, once I was playing through a dungeon. I had a tough time with a wave, and wanted to go on the defensive for a bit, get some health back real quick before I proceeded to the next battle. So I kept an enemy in stunlock/debuff while I used my healer to get my fighters back into a better spot. With this one enemy left completely weak and vulnerable, it seemed like a viable strategy in order to get my footing back and continue strong. But NOPE. Literally two turns after trying this strategy, two enemies randomly come out of the woodwork. Because this game has to be SO HARD that it just throws more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at you.\n\nWhat this said to me was this: no, player, you do not play how you want to play. You cannot use the strategies YOU want to use. You play by OUR rules. You go fast, and kill fast, and if your players die in the process, well TOO BAD.\n\nSome players may see this as just another part of the challenge, but I see this as a fundamental flaw: you are not allowed to play this game how you see fit. You are not allowed to go on the defensive, take advantage of a situation and play to your strenghts. You can ONLY play how the devs WANT you to play. And that, to me, isn't fun. It is frustrating. Its tedious. And it lead to me shutting off the game and not playing it ever again.\n\n-escaping battle. This is a shorter one, but still a grievance with the game I personally have. So, when you escape battle, you are given a consequence of stress. I saw this as a fair trade. If things are going badly, you have the choice to take the stress in order to fight another day.\n\nThis brilliant idea was ruined by the timeworn BS cliche of: not being able to escape. So not only do I have to accept the consequence of a massive stress boost when I actually manage to get out of battle, I have to risk my party members in an entire turn that could possibly get any of them killed if the escape attempt fails. That. Is not. Ok. Take one punishment, don't put them all in one basket. And don't give me the "git gud" crap everyone else does - we all enter bad situations in this game that we need to escape once in a while. RNG makes it so. Don't corner the player by making them worry if they'll escape or not, and if you want to keep that, fine, but get rid of the added stress issue then. Pick one poison and stick to it.\n\n-the stress meter. Now, I have to say, this was actually one of the reasons I was fascinated with this game at first. It seemed like such a neat mechanic that could actually end up with GOOD results, and not bad.\n\nOut of the countless times my characters reached full stress, only twice has something heroic happened. This should be a 50/50 chance, and not a 10/90, imo. You're already threatening death with the stress waves (which apparently wasn't in the original EA version), why make it even more challenging by not giving the player a fair shot at feeling amazing? Because you're too busy making it feel frustratingly difficult? That's why? Eh.\n\nNow with all that said, you'd think I HATE this game. I'm just another one of those jerks on the internet saying its the worst thing ever. But here's the thing: I don't. With all that said, I still love so much about the game:\n\n-The art style. So refreshingly simple, yet bold and interesting.\n\n-The music. Tense, adds to the atmosphere, and well composed.\n\n-The designs. Goes hand in hand with art style, in a way, but every class looks very unique and stands out in their own way.\n\n-the voice acting. Top ♥♥♥♥ing notch, hard not to love. Complex dialogue makes this game feel intelligent (even if the narrator isn't saying anything most of the time other than "this ♥♥♥♥ sucks sometimes yo").\n\n-fascinating game mechanics, like stress and perks/negatives. While some people abbhore some of these things, I am impressed with how many different things your characters can get, both positive and negative.\n\nThere are things to LOVE about this game. There are things to HATE about this game. I am left torn down the middle. I want to like this game. I want to get swept up inside of it, lose myself for hours on end from dungeon to dungeon but...every time a risky dungeon is presented, I don't want to take it because I fear I have to start from scratch from a different warrior. The fact that people think that the death of your character is a fair punishment just isn't true. All those hours and money into these particular characters you want to crusade through dungeons with are put out within minutes due to bad RNG, bad situations, or just bad planning or poor decision making.\n\nAnd even if it WAS all my fault, even if it WAS misdirection or poor planning or player error or...whatever, even with all that in mind and the fact that my character(s) died, wasting hours of my life because of simple mistakes, is that ok? Does it make it a fun challenge? Or a slog?\n\nThe answer is that there is no answer. This game is dependent on what you like as a gamer, and as a person, really. You're not a bad person for liking this game. And you're not bad for disliking it. I see the points of people on both sides. And I think everyone should just calm the ♥♥♥♥ down and learn to deal with other people's opinions on the internet (although that probably won't ever happen, even though it should).\n\nAs for me...this game is interesting. Its stressful. Its tactful. Its challenging. But, in spite of things, it just isn't fun to me. A lot of times it felt like a chore. To the point where I no longer wanted to play.

However, not long ago they implimented a new patch that seems to effect a great deal of game balance (in the monster's favour). The game, which was already incredibly challenging and unforgiving, became nearly impossibly challenging. My team is surprised more often (even in bright torchlight), critted (what seems like constantly), already debilitative mental conditions have been separated into mental and physical ailments (and then allow those to compound and get harder to remove), and even the damage of the monsters seems to have increased. Some characters (like the occultist) have had their debuffs nerfed and have become an almost useless class compared to others now.\n\nWhat used to be a game that made you strategize your supplies and fight a war of attrition now kills off your (well prepared and equipped) characters before you're even through a second room sometimes. Bosses aren't the only major threat now, a group of mini-bosses seems to be able to wipe you out at any time. It's now nearly impossible to keep a skilled team, and thus you're frequently forced to train up low level characters to replace the ones you've lost. Then, only to lose them again without being able to explore the deeper levels. The difficulty curve ramps up way too much, way too fast.\n\nAlso, it's hard to raise character levels because you only seem to get advancement experience if you complete a dungeon (which is often VERY difficult now), so even if you complete 90% of the dungeon and are forced to abandon it because most of your characters have been wiped out, the remaining characters recieve ... nothing, no experience at all. You only get more trinkets and money (and lots of it, but it doesn't really help you out much).\n\nThey've also added this strange corpse mechanic, which seems kind of interesting, but doesn't really function logically. Sometimes you have to "kill" the corpses of the enemy that you've already killed just to get at the back row of enemies, yet your own characters never leave corpses, and most enemies can hit all ranks of your characters anyway.\n\nAll that said, I have hope that this patch will be modified to make the game playable again. It was honestly one of my favourite games that I've ever played before, but I'm going to bench it for now in the hopes that it will become a more balanced game in the updates (and release) still to come.\n\nFingers crossed!!!","July 29, 2015","false","45.0"," 131 of 220 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","131","220","7","2"

This might in part be my fault since I got involved during this stage- most people get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when Facebook changes it's layout. You can only imagine how rustled I'd get when I'd get on and find the gameplay mechanics of DD would change. But I can accept those twists and turns as part of the development process.\n\nWith that said... And believe me, I've dumped 100+ hours into this game so I say this with a heavy heart, I'm pretty dissapointed with where they took this during that time of development.\n\nDarkest Dungeon doesn't have any obvious one glaring flaw, but small things add up and it's the small things the devs take that do the most damage. Now obviously this is supposed to be a harsh and adverse game- the whole point is to be difficult and unforgiving, after all. Right?\n\nWell, yes, you would be right. The game itself proclaims that is about "Making the most of a bad situation", how there will be deaths, there will be failure, and so on. It warns you right out of the starting gate. Hell, that's part of the reason I got into this game. I liked the idea of a dungeon crawler with long lasting wear and tear on adventuring. Your heroes getting quirks (for better and for worse), diseases, weird obsessions, that's all pretty damn cool and it helps make the game what it is.\n\nBut the problems come from the small things that add up. I don't think DD's problems come from any of it's core ideas, but the ways they're implemented. You want the game to be difficult, unforgiving even, but you still want it to be fun, challenging, and most importantly, -rewarding-\n\nPROS:\n- The art is fantastic. Absolutely terrific and it never gets tiring to look at.\n- The soundtrack is great. I'm not even sure how to label it, but imagine a mix of horror, grunge and epic orchestra.\n- The game's narrator, played by Wayne June (who has done countless audiobook readings of H.P Lovecraft's works) is perfect in every way for the role and just oozes a brooding edge.\n- The core gameplay is simple, intuitive and the team manages to build a lot of complexity and synergy out of the turn based combat.\n\nCONS:\n1) The game has gotten progressively more bent on grinding. There are 5 areas in the game. Each area has two bosses. You must fight each of those bosses three times. Each of these bosses is at a different level ranking. Higher level heroes cannot play lower level dungeons. If you do not plan out managing three or 4 teams of different ranking hereos far in advance of this, you are going to tack on days of extra gameplay just trying to cultivate competent teams to fight bosses you've already battled several times. This doesn't even take possible Total Party Kills into account. It also doesn't take into account the time you need to kill waiting for heroes to recover from stress, disease, crippling quirks or just straight up wandering off.\n\nThis isn't difficult, challenging, or rewarding. It is tedious. It can be infuriating. But not as infuriating as...\n\n2) Not getting any sort of reward or compensation for slugging through said grind. I'm not asking for a pat on the head and a slice of birthday cake pushed into my mouth for not quitting 30 seconds into the game. However, most games, especially the grindy ones, usually give you something in return for putting all that time in.\n\nYour level 6 'Legendary' heroes have fought their way up the blood soaked ladder, having disposed of countless monstrosities and grappled with their personal demons time and time again. They're scarred, they're battered, they're hard boiled sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es that live to claw the eyes out of mutant fish monsters. You've given them the best armor, the best trinkets, and pair them up in groups where they synergize the best.\n\nThey drop like flies in the Darkest Dungeon area. There's no weight, no reward for dragging your guys through the mud until they're legendary. They're just as likely to spazz out and panic as they were at level 0, they can barely cut through High Protection level enemies, and the same cultists jerks you've been slapping around since Week 1 can now give them heart attacks in 4 turns if you don't take them out immediately because now they get arbitrarily huge stat numbers for the final dungeon.\n\nSpeaking of arbitrary numbers....\n\n3) The hardest parts of the game are mechanics outside of the combat and exploration that the devs use to punish the player.\n\nA game like this ought to punish you for making stupid mistakes. A game like this should throw lasting repurcussions at you for failure. Games like XCOM do this really well because said repurcussions feel like natural cause and effect for the situation.  DD does not do this, and it feels more malicious than anything. It doesn't tell you the rules it wants you to play by, and when you step out of line it'll take your hand off for it. ESPECIALLY if it catches you trying to heal your party up when only a single enemy is left. It used to be content just to make your party get stressed, but now it throws a new mob of enemies at you.\n\n\nAnd that's really the big problem. With a game as challenging as this, the struggle alone should be enough, but the game will actively punish you for struggling.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese are the problems with Darkest Dungeon. Corpses and heart attacks are annoying when the game first surprised you with them during Early Access, but with adjustment they fit right in and mesh with the tone, the difficulty and open up new lanes of strategy. Those aren't the problems, those are challenges.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is not a bad game- on the contrary I think there's an excellent game in here, but it's buried under the weight of a lot of busywork and excessive punishment it doles out at you for not doing what it wants (but doesn't tell you to).  It takes and it takes, but it never gives back.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a game of diminishing returns. I'm not saying you should avoid it, but heed my warning: You'll love Darkest Dungeon, but no matter how much time and work you give to it, it won't love you back.\n\nKinda like an ex, really.","July 26, 2015","false","108.4"," 111 of 186 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","111","186","4","1"

Aside from all this I am compelled to come back for more, to feel the utmost joy of scoring a critical hit, the relief of surviving the horrors being thrown at me and the unforgettable feeling of triumph. This is a thoroughly fun game and I would suggest any person who wants their metal tested to play it.

Then, life happened, and I set the game down for a while.\n\nThis past weekend I was up for some Graveyard shifts and decided to pick up the game again. Excited, I opted to start a game from scratch and relive the whole experiance. ...But, I couldn't even get an inital team off the ground.

Yes, you would lose someone to stress or death occasionally, but that was to be expected.\n\nThis time, however, was something else. I tried the first 4-person dungeon 5 different times: I could NOT make it through. I would be slammed again and again by crits, only to have my characters miss for rounds at a time.

I am disappointed to say the least.\n\nSo after beating the game I stand by my points since early access. The game just isn't rewarding to play with how much grind and garbage you gotta slog through to reach the end and then it hardly feels like you are overcoming a great evil so much as it feels like you just have to exploit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to pass. I don't feel like I was truly challenged, just constantly had someone trying to cheat me. I genuinely feel like all the positive ratings for the game are a result of the 'git gud' crowd who themselves probably suck. A challenge to overcome is what I live for. Darkest dungeon was less a challenge and more a gamble.\n\nHonestly I was hoping the ending dungeons and ending itself would be rewarding, but instead I feel pretty empty. I guess that's the way you feel when you are so mad at a game you are just trying to find something good in it and you just don't.\n\nDarkest dungeon is playing a poker game and going all in. You play your hand, clench your teeth and/or buttcheeks, and then you win and get a ♥♥♥♥ load of money. After getting home you realize that you spent a crap load of money on cheetos and soda and also you need to spend some money on releiving stress from the ordeal (for some reason) and end up with just enough money in the positives to buy a soda and enough money left over to do it all again. Not very satisfying.\n\nAs of July 15th I've pretty much given up on the game. There's no point in trying to help anymore. I don't really care that all my saves were deleted. I don't really care that they nerfed the crap outta camping buffs. I don't care heavily that crusader protection is useless. I'm not crying after they ruined any reason to play in the dark. I don't fully care that enemies hit extra hard and do extra stress. I don't really find it awful that being marked is considered a means of protection. I'm not upset that my highwayman was killed in the tutorial. I'm not offended that when the game crashes some buffs/debuffs are gone from characters. It doesn't bother me that you can just Alt + f4 when one of your guys gets deathblowed to avoid it. I'm not sad that the game gets kinda monotonous after a bit and I can let the fact they ignore teaching boss mechanics slide.\n\nBut the fact you can lose a party member from 100% to 0% just by encountering spiders in the first mission and it's been this way since I started playing? No. Screw this game.\n\n\n\nIn the end, what really matters is your own opinion. The thing is that in my opinion I was not satisfied with the end results of the game.","July 15, 2015","false","241.2"," 82 of 136 people (60%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","60","82","136","15","0"

All of this contributes to a promise of something deep, dark, and deliciously engrossing.\n\nThe savvy player will go in expecting a challenge. After all, the game stands at a crossroads of several historically demanding genres: RPG, survival, roguelike. These genres are loved for many reasons, but paramount in my book is that they offer a deep, precisely crafted challenge. This is where Darkest Dungeon fails, utterly.\n\nThe game offers nothing more than an illusion of depth. Class variety, skill selection, inventory management, character-building, team-building... I could go on. DD has it all. But never before has such a plethora of choices been so meaningless.\n\nSink as many hours as you like. There are no real lessons to be learned, no real experience to gain. You will enter the dungeon as a trembling, stupid peon, and come away very much the same. Ultimately, there is only one way to play this game: grind, and grind some more.\n\nSadly, one of the major selling points of DD, its character "stress" system, is the very centerpiece of this problem. Stress is unavoidable and inherently boring. Curing it is slow, expensive, and braindead: roll new characters and slog through low-level dungeons to earn money. Rinse, repeat.\n\nThis pattern replays itself through just about every facet of DD. There are no revelations or breakthroughs; just slow, monotonic progress and the looming shadow of boredom. Increasingly, the game's once-charming aesthetic becomes a reminder of what awaits: joylessness.\n\nDD's early access status provides a glimmer of hope. There is still time for the developers to overhaul the game's mechanics and rescue an otherwise promising title. Give us something more to look forward to than a chronic nosedive.","March 1, 2015","false","7.9"," 116 of 197 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","116","197","6","3"

Well, this is a prime example. Darkest Dungeon is a side-scrolling turn-based dungeon-crawling RPG where you take a small team of 4 into increasingly difficult dungeons trying to save your Family's Estate. You'll face both physical challenges involving zombies, hellbeasts and bandits yet you'll also have to conquer mental challenges such as fear, insanity and death from stress. This game puts a huge emphasis on the terrifying nature of exploring the dungeons, where games like Diablo show your adventurer as a fearless battletank, the characters you get in Darkest Dungeon are individuals who will eventually become broken by traits like masochism or other mental illnesses. Don't worry though, there are ways to allow your characters to rest, whether it be the brothel, drowning sorrows in the tavern or repenting in the church... after all, everything can be forgotten for a price. It should also be mentioned that players can level up, gain skills and become incredibly powerful but like other Rogue-likes, death is permanent and focusing too much on one hero can lead to the death of all the others.\n\nGameplay aside, you've also got an epic gothic/comic artstyle that really brings this game to life and further immerses you in the world. I can't help but think back to the dark and dank of the original Diablos while playing this game.\nAlso, the narrator in this game is disturbingly amazing. Seriously, pay that guy more to do more lines because he undoubtedly deserves it and more. It's like if the Bastion narrator lost his mind and merged with a demon or something. Freaking epic.\n\nIn summary, this game is great. One of the better indie games of the year and I'm glad to see it has finally released. One final word of advice, don't be afraid of restarting a few times. You'll probably need to.\n\nEarly Access Review\nDark, dank, a badass narrator, epic soundtrack and the keys to my heart. Losing heroes has never proven so gloriously fun. Where in X-COM the game would showcase the achievements and build a connection with you and your soldiers, Darkest Dungeon seeks to make you cautious of forming that connection. After all, insanity is just around the corner for those who delve into the dungeons without a light. If you haven't played this game, you owe it to yourself to. Absolutely phenomenal.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6x55jSOPw0","June 20, 2015","true","9.4"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","72","26","36","9","0"

I played it when it was a casual dungeon crawler with innovative mechanics and cool art. I took a break to let early access take care of content addition and expansion, reading patch notes about new classes and anticipating making a new run at it with tons of new toys to play with.\n\nThe mechanics and art remain, but the casual dungeon-crawler has turned into a turgid min-max fest that is much too harsh on all but the most dedicated stat junkies. Corpses completely change party-building mechanics and lengthen fights to an annoying degree. Heart attacks are BS. The game feels much harder than it should be.\n\nI feel like the game doesn't even want you to play it and is dedicated to punishing you if you do. It's difficult for me to recommend this game and I'm sad about that. It used to be a fun romp, now it's a slow, plodding stumble through a too-harsh environment.\n\nMaybe the devs will clue in and create difficulty levels to appease the whining min-maxers while allowing the rest of gamers to still have a fun experience.

Once you figure out some basic mechanics and which upgrades take priority, ( I almost restarted after a few unwise purchases), it becomes a lot easier and rather fun managing your party of merceneries.\n\nBasic Tips.. Get your roster up rather quickly.. then develop a couple builds that work for you. While one team is being cured of stress or diseases, let the other one go in to battle. You will have people die. Take rookies and mix them with more experienced fighters so you dont get wiped out as bad. Experiment with your builds.. theres not too many bad characters they all can bring things to the table and some work better with other characters. My favorite build has to be two Hellions up front- two Vestals in back- or a Occultist and a Vestal in back. Out of my roster of 22, I have 8 or 9 Vestals ready to rock. When you upgrade your Vestal make sure she has the Judgment attack. It comes in handy when she is not healing your party. But dont worry about her mace bash. You dont want your Vestals up front and thats the only time she can use the Mace. Another interesting one is two highwaymen up front and letting them take turns with their point blank shot for serious damage. Also the grapeshot blast is a good one to have in their abilities especially early on. The Crusaders seem rare to find on the fresh meat wagon but they are also good to have. The Leper once powered up can replace a Crusader in my opinion. Just whatever works for you.\n\nAdvancing in game.. Try to get characters to level 3 and then leave them alone until you get enough of level 3s to take on the medium missions. Save level 3 bosses for level 4 fighters as they are still considered level 3 mission eligible. Makes a lot easier trust me.\n\nI just think this is a wonderful and deep game that has tons of potential for future installments or DLC depending on how they want to advance this franchise. They could keep adding new areas and bosses, have daily missions, random loot placements to hunt for and all kinds of endless possibilities..  I am excited for the game but almost more excited for what it can be in the future.\n\nWould "Give Them No Quarter!"  again  10/10","June 16, 2015","true","134.3"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","33","49","3","1"

I played this at my sister's for a solid two weeks and thought it was an awesome game. But since the update they did in mid-July, the game is just horrible. Alas that I cannot return it and now am stuck with it. Since I *thought* I was buying a different game than what I got, I really should be able to return it. . .\n\nThe NEW version of the game is so ridiculous that not only do you have to kill the monsters, but then you have to kill their CORPSES. Seriously? In what universe does a person have to kill a corpse? So while you're clearing the damn corpses, the monsters continue to hit you for oh, 30-50 stress points (no joking, you can actually get that much stress from a single hit).\n\nI loved in the original game that my toons died, and not infrequently. Now they die all the time, of course, but what's annoying is that there is no adjustment to be made to prevent it even slightly. It doesn't matter what your torch is anymore. Low torch does not up crits at all (I went through an entire dungeon with about 2 crits at low torch), you get surprised at high torch >50% of the time, etc. The strategy of the game was replaced with luck.\n\nSO glad I wasted $20 on this because the developers decided to destroy a perfectly good game.

But given what this game has become, I cannot do so in good conscience.\n\nWhen I first bought this game back when it was in early access, it was something really interesting. An incredible aesthetic matched by a gameplay that married the best aspects of RPGs and Dungeon Crawlers, with its own twists and turns that made for a wholly engrossing experience. It wasn't perfect, but it was challenging, enjoyable, and most importantly of all, rewarding.\n\nAll the way through the development process, I'd periodically start up a new run to see what sort of changes had been made, and for the most part I wasn't disappointed. The difficult of the game got ramped up, but so too did the classes themselves. The fights were both terrifying and exhilarating, and taking down a boss felt like a triumphant moment. The new classes were interesting, and the quirks system made them feel like more than just a grouping of mechanics.\n\nI didn't mind the introduction of heart attacks and corpses, as they forced me to keep a closer eye on my stress levels and put more thought into my party lineups.\n\nAs Darkest Dungeon reached its final stage, the very same elements that made it so fun and enjoyable for me have become twisted into something that has turned the game into the exact opposite. Reaching Resolve level 5 and 6 used to be an accomplishment, a marker that these characters/heroes had faced overwhelming odds and achieved a greater state of being. You would face off against some truly powerful and terrifying enemies, but your characters were on par with that power and could exchange blow for blow. There was a balance, and even when the tide of battle turned against you there was still a chance that you could pull off a victory from the jaws of defeat.\n\nNow, the odds are stacked overwhelmingly against you. Don't even think about going into a higher level dungeon with even one of your characters not fully upgraded, as they will die. At first, I thought the sudden skyrocketing of my casualty rates were the result of me making a tactical error, but when I looked at play throughs online I found that people who were more or less equally skilled as I was were suffering from similar casualty rates, for similar reasons. I don't mind losing someone because of an error that I made, but losing it because the RNG decided 'they gonna die now' is strikes me as something that is blatantly unfair. Especially when in order to bring them up to the point where they can survive the upper level dungeons requires hours of joyless grinding for resolve and gold, and the fruits of those labors don't seem to have an impact on their overall survivability.\n\nIn general, Darkest Dungeon does an extremely poor job of explaining the way different features work, or what to expect when going into a new location or facing off against a new type of boss. Which i don't necessarily mind per-say, but when the cost of failure are so high that they will undermine hours of work, then that becomes a problem.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the final dungeon. There are so many design decisions (like rendering your characters illegible for future expeditions, to name one) that are some high grade cow manure, and exemplarly of just how un-fun the game has become.\n\nI guess I'm more disappointed than anything else. There are so many aspects of this game that I love, and that I'm sure other players who are thinking about buying this game will love too. The aesthetic of this game is absolutely phenomenal, the writing is superb, the gameplay is innovative, and there are some genuinely great features. But somewhere along the line, the game has become less about facing off against the eldritch horrors and pulling victory from the jaws of defeat, and more about not losing horribly. It has gone from ‘tough, but fair’ to ‘grueling and frustrating’.\n\nEdit:\nFor those of you who are interested, I effectively did three runs of the game. The first I started back in March which went on for roughly 30 hours, in which time I'd completed all the available content. I did a second, much shorter one in mid July that lasted about 20 hours in which I only got about half way through bosses. I started a third one, intended to be my final run of the game, in late October, which took me 45 hours to reach about three-quarters of the way to the end game.\n\nThis should help show just how much of a grind this game has become","January 23","false","95.9"," 269 of 475 people (57%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","57","269","475","20","26"

But then come the lvl 5 champion ones... and with them comes utter disaster as monsters start to show up with abominable amounts of PROT(while we still have only TWO heroes who can counter this), SPD and additional effects to their attacks.

The amount of various relics required, especially Deeds, is atrocious. The amount of gold necessary for upgrades and the quality of upgrades themselves is DISGUSTING.\n- The game actually ENCOURAGES you to sacrifice your first best group of heroes, as they will accumulate EXP faster than gear and at some point will not be able to handle the dungeons appropriate for them.","January 23","false","101.7"," 195 of 342 people (57%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","57","195","342","15","8"

I have just begun to plumb the depths of the veteran maps, but I can't find the motivation to do much more now than play a run or two in between work. The game greatly lacks variety--in monsters, dungeons, and bosses. Both monsters and bosses are generally just reskinned, so after the initial "shock" of facing a deadly new one, most of them become trivial and even gimmicky.

I've started 5 games; the first two I read all the text, followed all the advice, read the details of all of my characters' moves, etc. Now I feel like I'm just ramming my head against a wall.\n\nThere is a difference between a difficult game - one which requires skill, strategy, coordination, forethought, or some combination of the above - and a random game where the odds are stacked against you. Darkest Dungeon has high potential to be in that first category - the combat system is unique, the skills are varied, the variety and heavy influx of characters means you get a unique combination of talents at multiple points in the game - but ultimately it falls into the second, at least for now.\n\nYou are put in a randomly generated map, with randomly generated treasures, traps, and encounters along the way.

The encounters feature a random (and worse, frequent) slew of critical hits, misses, and dodges (Each of those concepts are fine it they occur EITHER very rarely or very frequently, or if there's a way to control them well enough that they aren't so rbitrary... but in Darkest Dungeon they seem to occur just often enough to be a not-completely-unexpected but not-remotely-reliable nuisance).\n\nIt's impossible to amass any resource in the game; typically you can invest time to SOME end in a modern roguelike, but in Darkest Dungeon all of your characters seem to be designed to consume all of your money, go mad, and die in short order, certainly well before they have the chance to be useful. The death of characters isn't issue; the number of resources they cost you while they die is. An adventurer will not earn you enough money to sustain itself, let alone to sustain its successor.\n\nYou can upgrade buildings in town which in turn sell benefits to your characters to help deal with this issue, but then the process becomes hiring lvl 0 adventurers, throwing them at quests until you pass (the chances of which are very slim if you don't at least invest some gold in them), expecting to fail but hoping to just scrape a few upgrade items out of the quest so you can upgrade your building so that you have a slightly higher chnce next time.\n\nNothing in this game feels rewarding, and in fact, the degree of arbitrary madnesses (which will can do anything from eat your character's turn to raise the stress of other characters so that they're more likely to go crazy) seems to be intentionally designed to give this impression.\n\nI see so much potential for this game, so I'll probably keep playing it in hopes of updates in the future... because as has been mentioned, the artwork, soundtrack, narrator, overal polish, theme, and mechanics of the game seem a solid foundation for something amazing.. but in its current incarnation, I can't recommend it.","October 9, 2015","false","18.2"," 39 of 61 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","39","61","2","0"

It has the ingredients to become something great, but it still needs something more. Although, keeping the fact that this game is still in early access in mind, I am sure that it can still become something great.\n\nThe game's very fun and leaving a challenging quest with all of your characters still in one piece is a great feeling, but after a while, the rinse and repeat gameplay style just becomes a bit stale. You go into one dungeon, your characters come out all stressed out, thus requiring you to allow them to rest. You then take a bunch of low leveled characters, take them out on a short quest, come back and repeat.\n\nI will without a doubt definitely play this game avidly, but I would not really recommend it to players that dislike grindy and repetitive games.\n\nEven if some of these negative reviews do take the game off your wishlist, I would definitely recommend you follow this game and it's updates.

I will continue playing because I believe it will be better at some point. This was not an impulse buy for me. I read through the forums and looked at videos before buying. I waited for a sale to make it easier for me to see value in the purchase. It has nice graphics and interesting mechanics. It has an RPG elements to add some depth to the basic rogue structure. There's a base building mechanic simialr to X-com, which is something I usually like. There's resource management which should lead to interesting decisions. All these things appealed to me and made me decide to buy it.\n\nI expected to be greeted by difficult challenges that required me to closely monitor my resources and make difficult choices about my characters and their fates.\n\nUltimately, I'm just faced with a mindless grind over and over.\n\nMy current state of gaming after 14 hours is:\nManage my main party\nRecruit 4 characters from stagecoach\nPress embark button\nPick a short adventure\nPut the 4 characters in their slots\nPress provision button\nBuy 6 torches\nStart adventure\nAdventure until one characters stress gets close to or over 100\nAbandon quest\nClick through a bunch of buttons to get back to the base (Not sure what they say as I click through them as fast as possible)\nRight click each character and press fire button\nManage my main party\nGo to stagecoach .....And the worst part is there are no shortcuts. You can't fire everyone at the end of an adventure. You can't recruit four characters from the adventure screen. It's like they're trying to convince me that these choices have meaning. They don't and they just add clicks until I get to the ones that do have meaning.\n\nThat meaning shows up every third week or so.\n\nEvery few weeks, you'll take your main party on an adventure and you'll try and push them to the end so they gain gain resolve to level up. You'll even equip them with shovels and food like a real party would want. If all goes well, they'll finish an adventure and you'll get some cool things.\n\nOf course the party will also be a stressed out wreck and require several weeks of rest to recover enough to go on another adventure. This of course is ok, since you'll need several weeks to gather enough resources to pay for their stress recovery and any upgrades you may want to put on them.\n\nThis of course means you'll spend several more adventures going through the earlier cycle with a bunch of characters who's names you don't even bother to read. You'll even gloat a bit when the starvation screen comes up as that means you've had a better than average run and should get some decent money out of the adventure. The fact that you're technically starving four people to death in order to make your return on investment worthwhile should never be brought up.\n\nIs any of this difficult? Does it make the game challenging?\n\nNot really.\n\nThe monsters so far have posed little or no threat. Even if a character gets to zero health, it's unlikely you'll lose them. You can probably give them a health on the next combat round and they'll usually hang in there long enough for you to finish any really tough battles.\n\nThe base poses no difficulty once I figured out the grinding part. And since it's clear that in the long term I'll get enough resources to build up to maximum, there's no interesting choices to be made there.\n\nWhat is difficult is stress, and only because the game doesn't give you the resources to deal with it if you keep pushing on. It won't matter most of the time because the throw away characters can get as stressed as they want as long as they don't all die before you abandon the adventure.\n\nFor your main party, stress is the real enemy. I would go as far as to say your only enemy. From the start of your adventure, you'll be wondering if they'll get to the end before they stress out. There is little chance the monsters will kill your characters, but once one of your characters goes over 100 stress the threat of heart attacks becomes a real and pressing problem. At that point, you're playing with fire while showering in gasoline. The characters will start talking and the stress levels will skyrocket. Then another character will go over 100 and they won't shut up and three turns later someone will fall over dead from a heart attack. Once one goes, it's belly up for all of them and you get to start over. Since you'll quickly learn this lesson, you're unlikely to ever face this problem more than once. At that point, stress then just becomes an annoyance instead of a difficulty. It will quickly come to represent extra weeks of tedious trips through the cycle of collecting resources.\n\nWhat about the times where it really does go bad for your main party? It has happened once to me because I didn't want to go through a medium adventure a second time for two rooms. I pushed on even though I knew heart attacks were close.\n\nI started raging against the fates and designers right?\n\nNo. Remember, you only play with these characters once every 3 weeks. You're not really attached to them. The entire party went belly up and the most I could manage was a tired sigh as I thought about the button presses of tedium while I started a new party to replace .... hmm .... what were their names???\n\nAnd in case you think I'm exaggerating this point, I give you the following example of my total ambivalence for these characters. One time, I fired one of my main party members by mistake. I had forgotten their name and their stress was high. It was only when I started the next adventure with my main party that I realized what I had done.\n\nIn all the rogue games that I thought were good, I could remember the names of my characters. I cared what happened to them. I would go so far as to say that's the heart of a good rogue game. Make the player care about what's happening, and then put them in an impossible situation. Most of the times things will go badly and the player will hate the game and the developer.\n\nSometimes though, a miracle will happen. You'll get that perfect set of circumstances to overcome the impossible. And that character will be your hero. The game and developers will be brilliant. That story will be told to everyone who will listen. Of course the character will then be killed by a lowly slime moments later, but the memory of them overcoming the impossible will live on and make you believe you can win. You will honor that character by starting again. You will swear to defeat that game because of all the fallen heroes who did the impossible to get one more level further than you had ever seen before.\n\nI wish that was happening in Darkest Dungeon. Unfortunately, the designers have forgotten to make me care.","October 10, 2015","false","25.5"," 51 of 83 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","51","83","4","1"

Its strengths lie in the beautiful atmosphere, (mostly) rewarding leveling system, and unforgiving RNG that makes all fights feel important as at any time you could lose a character you’ve invested several hours into. Fans of challenging, turn based rouge likes should be right at home and not hesitate to play.\n\nPrice Point:\nThis was my biggest deterrent to buying the early access. I believe $20 is a little pricey for an unfinished game and wasn’t sure how much gameplay I’d be getting. However I was able to get at least 40 very fun hours out of that $20. Many games charge a lot more for a lot less and as I write this review I feel my money was well spent.\n\nRNG:\nRNG makes darkest dungeon the challenge it is. Unfortunately many players are claiming they had terrible luck, making the game nearly unplayable. It is possible to miss nearly every attack as some say, it’s just incredibly unlikely. For me, RNG was just punishing enough to make encounters challenging, and only a hand full of times did I feel cheated. It really made my heart pump going on a boss mission with level 5 characters, knowing I could permanently lose characters I’d invested 4-5 hours into if I had a handful of bad rolls. Similarly, its incredible seeing a bounty hunter crit a boss for nearly 80 damage because he hit a 20% crit chance. Character death is permanent and unforgiving. It’s not impossible to beat the game without dying, but it is unlikely. It’s terribly frustrating to see a player get crit’d twice, putting them on death’s door where they can die to another enemies attack or to bleed or blight. But in my experience these cases happened very infrequently and could be avoided by fleeing from battle. Once I figured out the game, maybe around the 10-15 hour mark, I stopped losing characters. For me, the RNG was what made each mission immersive as players are at fortune’s mercy, for others it is a terribly frustrating mechanic.\n\nCharacter and Skill Balance:\nHaving leveled each character to rank 6, I’ve found some characters and skills aren’t as strong as others, this could just be my play style though. Damage is king. The player could spend a turn using the plague doctors 15% damage boost, but on a character that does 10-16 base damage, 15% is only 1 to 2 more damage points which aren’t guaranteed because the buff’d player could still miss. It seems far more sensible to have the plague doctor attack as any damage he does is likely to be more than 2, maybe even getting the kill and saving the player damage next turn as the dead enemy wont attack. Its similar with the jester. The jester’s attacks are weaker but seem to have a higher crit chance and cause bleed damage. But again, I’d rather have a stronger character guaranteed to do more base damage each turn like the bounty hunter. I would not have played the jester or the plague doctor in late game if not to raise them to rank 6. Because they are both weaker characters, but particularly because in late game enemies crit for so much and its very possible for the jester to be on death’s door after one crit from a hard hitting enemy. All other characters I found usable, fun, and different. However, I still only use their damaging or healing skills. Again, I could buff the highway man’s accuracy to maybe hit next turn, or I could just try to do damage both turns. The one exception I found was the occultist. His debuff’s are extremely valuable for boss fights. However, most boost skills are largely too weak to be used and should be buffed.\n\nGame Progression:\nEarly game is challenging. Players new to the game mechanics and the RNG could get frustrated easily. Again, this is dependent on the player. I loved the early game, but players should realize this is likely the most difficult part. It’s a perfectly viable strategy early on to send in suicide teams with no provisions assuming they will not complete the mission and end with high stress. However, all the gold they gather will be kept by the player and they can be dismissed from the roster to make room for a new suicide squad. By mid game the player will have upgraded the town enough and found a handful of useful trinkets that the player will feel vastly overpowered compared to the early game. You’ll be overpowered compared to early game, but still be challenged. I had the most fun at this mid game stage. I felt I had built up my players and strategies and was being rewarded for playing the game well. Late game, which I understand was recently buff’d, felt a little cheap to me. It seems enemies are given too much dodge, health, and damage. The late game felt like early game, just with bigger numbers. Enemies have such high dodge, that a crusader’s level 5 smite seemed to hit for almost the same percent chance and do the same proportional amount of damage as it did in early game. I felt this way about all characters. Its fun when games let you feel more powerful as you play on. Darkest Dungeon does so beautifully from early to mid game. You feel rewarded for leveling your players, upgrading the town, and implementing good strategies and teams. Players are robbed of this in late game as the enemies get such high stats that it feels cheap and that the player has regressed back to early game. As if the player never leveled up or got much better at the game.\n\nSuggestions to improve the game:\n\n1) Tweak the late game to keep the player feeling overpowered, yet challenged. Either nerf the late round enemies, or have another round of powerful upgrades for players that are unlocked at rank 5 or 6. By rank 4, all skills, weapons, and armor can be maxed. Implement one more round of upgrades that come with rank 5 to offset the difficultly of late game enemies.\n\n2) Fix inconsistent stats. What does speed do? One would assume it dictates turn order. Sometimes it does sometimes it doesn’t. I’ve had characters with speed 8 go before characters with speed 10, strangely it seemed to only happen when my party surprised the enemy. Both characters were using speed boosting trinkets. This is confusing. If speed doesn’t dictate turn order then there should really be a tool tip when the player mouses over the speed stat explaining what it does. If it does dictate turn order then it should work as expected and the higher number goes before the lower.\n\n3) Not sure if it is intentional, but when moving from one room to the next in a dungeon and approaching the door for the next room. If the player mashes “w”, they can get into the last room without losing some torch light. For example, If the player starts moving from one room to the next, with no interactables in the hallway, but doesn’t mash “w”, they will enter the next room with less than 75 light. However, if the player does mash “w” as they approach the last room, they will enter that room with 76 light. This saves more torches than you’d think in lengthy dungeons.\n\n4) Make passive attacks stronger. Damage is too important. Why would someone use a turn to boost a characters attack by 2, rather than attacking to cause more than 2 damage? Maybe 15% damage to the entire party would be worth it. To only one player, it is not.\n\n5) Useless trinkets. Some trinkets have useless combinations. Like 15% blight chance to jester, when the jester doesn’t have any attacks that can cause blight. Also, by late game there were only 3 or 4 trinkets I used. The lepers mask which gave huge boosts to health, and speed for the leper class. The tough ring which gave 20% health and 8% protection, a book that game 15% damage and 2 speed, and a right that gave 15% damage and 8% protection if light was above 75. All other trinkets were garbage. Maybe have a way to sell trinkets to get a little more money.\n\nMore suggestions in the comments below...","February 18, 2015","true","57.8"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","2"

Overall, the game has a lot of fun elements to it, but the fun parts are dwarfed by the stress and frustration that it creates due to poor design choices, mostly those that were added post-alpha. Pre-alpha the game was a lot of fun, often pitting the player into darkness but giving them eventual hope and opportunities to climb out of it. Post-alpha the player is pushed into a well with no rope to climb back up. The game is built to be challenging, but what Darkest Dungeon delivers is an iron maiden of epic proportions: the more you play, the more you bleed out what little energy you have left to come back and get slapped in the face by the massive amounts of RNG you have to rely on.\n\nDarkest Dungeon pits players against a perpetually stacked deck, which only gets worse the longer you play. The game is built to put the PCs into a dying state quickly and often, which is compounded upon by the heart attack mechanic. Introduced sometime after alpha, and a longstanding point of contention, heart attacks cause a PC to instantly enter a dying state, regardless of health, or die permanently if they are already dying. Because of this, often times the game ends up chaining multiple events together that can easily wipe a party, regardless of how well you are doing.\n\nSanity loss for PCs leads to afflictions, which basically makes the given PC suicidal for the rest of the dungeon. More often than not an afflicted PC will skip their turn, refuse healing, shift the party order around, or somehow injure or debuff themselves. It would be one thing if an affliction only caused one of these things, or even if there was a limit as to how often they could happen, but instead they often happen in succession, which causes other party members to lose sanity and gain an affliction, and the cycle repeats. This quickly leads to an entire party wiped because 75% of your turns are either skipped or used to re-arrange heroes because they can't do anything else (not even defend). This is, in short, not fun whatsoever.\n\nAside from the in-dungeon frustrations, the game also has a level restriction on those that can enter the dungeon, with PCs claiming that they "wouldn't learn anything from the experience", or some other ridiculous reasoning. This is actually probably my biggest gripe, even moreso than heart attacks. This level restriction makes it extremely frustrating to try and level up other heroes to replace the ones that die or are otherwise unable to function for the dungeon. Unfortunately, it appears that the lowest level dungeons are also the least well balanced, so the player is forced to trudge through them again and again, re-living the nightmares they thought they had previously overcome.\n\nOverall, I do like Darkest Dungeon, when the dice are in my favor. When they aren't (which is ~75% of the time, it seems), the game is just an unending stream of frustration. The thrill, charm, and balance this game had with heroes constantly teetering on the brink of death in pre-alpha has given way to the hopelessness and malaise introduced with the post-launch changes, and given that I play games to relieve stress and have fun, this is the opposite of the desired result. As such I cannot recommend that others willingly subject themselves to it, however if you do make sure you keep the lights on and bring a lot of torches.","May 15","false","25.1"," 193 of 341 people (57%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","57","193","341","11","0"

The stress levels of your heroes will not be able to recover within a reasonable amount of time, the healing techniques are sparse and can be randomly refused by your heroes. The roguelike gameplay means that you may spend a half hour sprawling through a dungeon getting lower on supplies until you happen upon the objective by luck.\n\nThis game may be fun for some, but the tragedy is that most of the problems with this game are because of incompetent design.

XCOM or D&D style of combat and squad building, although with a 2D side scrolling view.  That includes random number based combat that can be frustrating to some, but personally I love.  There are ways to tilt the odds in your favor with good party/character building and strategy, especially once you level up your characters a bit.   As you explore and clear dungeons you get loot with which to upgrade your characters.  You can also buy upgrades to buildings back home which allow more character upgrades.  An added element is stress your adventurers receive from facing the horrors they are fighting.  Too much stress can lead to bad, and occasionally good, traits being given to them that have to be dealt with by sending them for various forms of “treatment.”\n\nPositive:\n+Voice Acting:  Narrator is excellent in adding to the atmosphere of the game.  First “Hand of Fate” and now this game.  Looks like indie games are finally getting serious about getting good voice acting in their games.  Voice acting never a must for me, but when done well, it can definitely help.\n+Graphics:  While somewhat simple mechanically, stylistically the graphics are extremely well done.  Has a rare and interesting look.\n+Gameplay:  Simple yet addictive turn based combat and character building.

Ideally I'd give it a neutral recommendation, but since I can't it's going to be not recommended. Why?\n\n- The game evolved very little since ea started. They added more stuff (heroes, enemies), sure, but they didn't really add more depth or refine the game mechanics in any meaningful way.\n\n- The grind. And this is coming from someone who can take a lot of grind in games. This is the worst kind of grind, the grind without any meaningful progress in sight. Most of the game you'll be doing the same medium length missions over and over again to grind gold, deeds and XP, in fact you HAVE TO beat every mission a number of times before a boss fight unlocks. Then each boss has to be killed 3 times (after you fill the GRIND BAR 3 times, obviously). Much like your heroes, the bosses don't get any new skills, they just get stat buffs. Then you beat the final dungeon. That's it. If you cut all the fat the game could be beaten in 20-30 missions, without repeating the same scouting quest 20 times and spending 526 deeds to improve the bar in your village. In fact it would've been better that way.\n\n- Incredibly shallow game mechanics. Stress? It was promised to be a core mechanics of the game and it's just another healthbar with random effects at break points. Afflictions? Way too easy to remove. Hero skills? Just bigger numbers from start to finish. Equipment? Again bigger numbers, zero variety. Trinkets? Take the ones that improve the stat you want, sell the rest. Exploration? Doesn't exist. Combat tactics? Shoot the eldritch horror until it dies.\n\n- Difficulty. The game seems very difficult at first, but it's an illusion, once you learn to game the system and proper party composition it gets trivial. You'll still lose a hero or be forced to abandon a mission every now and then (the game is RNG heavy), but because the game has no fail-state (!) you're only limited by how much grind you can take.\n\n- Now that's it out of ea, I can say that some things seem like placeholders. The hunger mechanic is a joke. Dungeons are mapped from the start (!). Torchlight system is just tedium. Many skills and trinket are complete garbage and essentially serve as a newbie trap. Corpses don't add to the difficulty or tactics, they just prolong fights and look stupid. I could go on, but these are nitpicks that wouldn't matter if the core gameplay had more depth to it.\n\nWhat's good about it? The atmosphere, graphics and narration are excellent. Gameplay... not so much. It's not completely terrible, but they underdelivered, concentrating on meaningless fluff like corpses, heart attacks and fight prolonging penalties instead of adding some choice and depth to gameplay. It's a 5/10 game, if you get it for $10 or less, you might have fun for your money, but that's all it is. A shame, really.\n","January 24","false","66.8"," 268 of 479 people (56%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","56","268","479","13","49"

I'd like to know how many people this includes, because it, again, feels much like a visit to the casino: a handful of people win. Everyone else loses.\n\nI've reached a point where I'm not sure the game takes much skill, but rather getting on your knees, praying, and then realizing it does nothing.\n\nI still like the game. I like the corpses, even--it was frustrating working a monster to the front only for ranged characters to have nothing to do. It can be good. At the moment, however, it's kinda not. And that's my review as it stands. Lots of design decisions that could be good, but just aren't really.\n\nAlso: while I understand most of the new classes, when first introduced, were OP, the houndmaster strikes me as the absolute worst. I could be missing something, but a group, 1 bleed attack is just worthless. Yes, he can lower protection--another questionable  recently impelentated mechanic--but on the whole he feels like a waste of a slot, and only helps to drag battles on longer. And, given that time and chance are your two biggest obstacles every step of the way, you're better off bringing along someone stronger, who can take enemies out faster.\n\nSo much for keeping it short. But, if you're interested in the game, ask yourself: how salty do I get? If you get very salty at games, move along. It's not worth the frustration. And that's my real complaint. The developers need to find a balance between their vision and something that's actually fun to play. Unless you like losing money at the casino, find something cheaper, and more rewarding. Something that you feel like you've earned through skill, perhaps, and not just dumb luck.\n\nBut also know that while I'm not recommending the game, I kinda am. This game could be amazing. Maybe it even was, at one point. Hopefully it will at least be somewhat fun again.","August 16, 2015","false","86.3"," 84 of 144 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","84","144","6","4"

Killing the ♥♥♥♥ out of monsters.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThis is a turn based up to 4 person party dungeon crawler rogue-like. I know how much you love labeling genres. This game is not easy. It will punish you for making bad decisions, going in with little resources as well as not making a balanced party.\n\nAs the ruler or I guess maybe Mayor of this town-- no, ambivalent spectator you are given charge of recruiting willing quest takers to lead into the dungeons. You have the ability to upgrade buildings in the town which more or less are the permanent upgrades and what makes this game a rogue-'like' as the characters in your roster suffer from perma-death.\n\nThere is quite a few class types. Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Not only in their ability set but in their personality. Before I delve deeper into this subject, stress management is a very real thing in this game. Simply walking around in the dungeons will stress the characters out. As stress builds to a maximum, that specific character goes through a resolve check which will have 1 of 2 effects. One is that their mind will break, giving them afflictions of being masochistic or paranoid among other things which depending on the severity may have you lose complete control of them. Additionally, almost every time when someones mind breaks the rest of the party becomes all to aware and will likely have a cascading affect on everyone else. However there is a bright side, sometimes when a character goes through a resolve check they get a positive character trait so that they become more courageous or vigorous and boy that feels really good. After every attack that character encourages the others and they receive a small decrease in overall stress level.\n\nOnce back in town, you are given a few options to treat the stress of questing. Either some proper drinking, gambling or a visit to the brothel or more zealous options for the more religiously inclined including flagellation. And going back to each character having a specific personality some will only have one way to relieve stress and being that there are only so many slots to place characters for specific activities this can become an issue. So plan wisely. Additionally, the stress relief does not always go so well. I have had multiple occasions where a character would cost me additional money because they got too drunk and bought every one a round or had some crisis of conscience during meditation and went missing for weeks. Additionally, there are also blacksmiths for equipment upgrades as well as a Sanitarium for the treatment of diseases and maybe some not so nice ways of getting rid of personality quirks that may not be.. beneficial.\n\nThe game also has a an extremely addictive quality in the gameplay loop in that it goes like this; return back to town, put folks into stress relief situations, take B team and start another quest, rinse and repeat.\n\nThe game is mostly controlled almost entirely with just a  mouse. You can use A and D to move left and right down hallways should you choose to but as the game is mostly menu navigation, I preferred just using the mouse. Its also a dead ringer for a tablet port.\n\nNow I'm just going to gush\nThe art design is possibly one of my favorites I've seen in a long time. It's obviously a completely different game and style really but its on the level of how I felt the about Ori and the Blind Forest. Each character sprite is really cool looking and ever so slightly varied. There is also a narrator that encourages you and sort of lends this 'gameshow' quality to everything. He seems to carry himself in a relatively sort of sadistic way. It reminded me of Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He says some truly awesome things and the voice is great. While I was rummaging through a loot sack “Secrets loom in the most tenebrous reaches of this place.”\n\nTHE GIST\nEasily one of my favorites games I've touched thus far in 2016.\n\nADDENDUM\nAfter being slightly perplexed at the way voting was going I decided to take a gander at the other reviews for this game to discover just what made this game so polarizing. It seems a lot of people have developed a rather large disdain for 'grind-y' things. Yet I do not see this treatment to liberating outposts in far cry or reaching the paragon levels in Diablo 3. Likely due to the fact that those characters can't be wiped by a bad decision or ill preparation. (unless you consider hardcore mode in D3)\n\nEither way, a game being grind-y is not indicative of poor quality. It is a design decision. Just because it is a long road of learning mechanics and being properly prepared as well as learning when to cut your losses to reach the final end game does not invalidate the rest. If you only played 10 hours, never killed a boss or even completed a medium length quest and had 3 or more full party wipes I would STILL recommend the experience. I don't like the way people are changing needing to be coddled, that they must be allowed to see the credits roll and this is the developers job to do so. Darkest Dungeon is a difficult game if that's not your cup of tea go play Child of Light.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a phenomenal experience. Even if you do wipe you still have upgraded buildings in town and the knowledge of what makes a balanced team as in bleed effect abilities probably aren't a great idea in the Ruins because Skeletons don't have blood. Or a tactic I tried myself, dwindle a fight down to one weak enemy and stop attacking while using your abilities heath and stress included to try to get back into fighting shape. I myself have lost 2 level 2 fighters that were nearing 3 as well as 2 others half way through 1 because I got greedy on a short quest after completing it. I continued to explore the next 2 rooms. Full party wipe. I went back to the drawing board. Made sure my new recruits had complimentary abilities, upgraded those abilities afforded to me by the guild and pressed on.\n\n“Confidence, SURGES as the enemy crumbles.

It started out as a rogue-like with heavy Lovecraftian influences. Great artwork, soundtrack, and very cool and novel concepts such as "stress", "light levels", and encouraging team work. Sometimes you had to sacrifice a beloved character in order for the rest of the team to finish and level up. No problem there, it actually gave the game personality and added depth to the story. All of these great things are still in the game, but...\n\nThe game went really off-balance in the July 15 Build Update. Enemies get major boosts in crit damage and frequency, so most of your turns you will be healing. I get the idea behind having a corpse in the way after defeating an enemy, but when 2-3 hits to get rid of it, it gets annoying. Also, I like the fact that you can now die from stress. But, in a dungeon, stress builds up WAY faster than you can get rid of it. And you can only do so in:\na) Battle- Some characters can heal stress. During battle is when stress builds up the most, and the amount of stress healed is mostly insignificant.\nb) Camps- A lot of stress can be relieved here, but you can camp only so many times, and it can feel like a waste of resources if your HP are still high with a long road ahead of you.\nSo good luck with not dying of a heart attack during long dungeons. Please, add a stress relieving item if you are going to have stress be such a major issue.\n\nI know this is still Early Access, but hopefully developers pay more attention to negative reviews and actually do something about these issues. Avoid raging at your monitor and come back when these things are fixed.","August 15, 2015","false","30.1"," 64 of 109 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","64","109","5","0"

The systems are basically finished, with the team mostly just fine tuning now. The art is fantastic and imaginative, both with characters and environments, There is plenty to do. The game is only really missing the final two areas and and a handful of character classes, which should be arriving shortly.\n\nDD is a hard game. but it has an interesting fallback: heroes are free. You can recruit them endlessly, so it is nearly impossible to actually fail. Which is good because nasty things lurk in the depths. If you have read H.P. Lovecrafts works (and you should), then this will seem very familiar in a good way! Much like Lovecraft's protagonists, your heroes will mostly end their stories by going insane and dying.\n\nThis is one of the most interesting facets of the game: stress. In DD, your heroes are vulnerable and scared. They don't enjoy being assaulted by pig-men with bone clubs. Walking skeletons frighten them. Starvation is sad. Basically, they act a lot like real people, and its great!\n\nThe quirk system is similar. Your heroes acquire charactersitics as they plumb the depths, most of them weird. Your crusader may have been a holy hero once, but 10 weeks at the estate and he has become a nymphomaniac with syphillis and an obsession with corpses! Necrophilia, anyone? :P\n\nGetting good at the game will likely take awhile. There are a lot of classes, and each one has numerous skills they can use in battle and while camping. Learning how to managae your money, provision your party for journies, and what buildings to upgrade first can also be confusing. It is all very do-able, it mostly just takes time because it is different. You will get used to it if you give it a chance.\n\nBasically, DD takes a sort of George R.R. Martin view of adventuring. There are a lot of details that you do not encounter in, say, a Final Fantasy game. Heroes actually need food, for example. Torches don't last forever. Characters don't take crushing blows from a cleaver without reaction (sometimes they start screamng in unknown languages and then murder your hapless doctor...). It's a muddy, bloody good time. And larks for all ;)\n\nLast Words: Experimental game-design done right, with some fantastic art direction and ideas, that results in a RPG masterpiece. Keep up the fantastic work Red Hook Games!!\n\nEdit #1 (July 29, 2015)\nSo, I wanted to revisit this review after spending some time with the new updates. The game is progressing nicely, with some new bosses and various quality of life fixes. Definitely a lot of hard work being put into the game, and it looks like it is shaping up to be one of the best RPGs around. The developers have been very responsive and have accomodated the forum requests and suggestions of fans like myself to a suprising degree. Still a highly recommended game!\n\nEdit #2 (September 29, 2015)\nThe Cove update was just released, and the game seems to just be getting better and better! If you have been keeping tabs on the game, you know that there was a wave of backlash over the last while concerning certain gameplay changes. I hopw that the discerning gamers out there will try to look past these and try the game anyway. Most of the criticism is unjustified and mainly related to the nerfing of certain strategies (cheese strategies that were near game-breaking, by the way). Perfectly justified choice on the part of the developer, in my opinion. I will retrun to the game sometime after full release day and give my final impressions.\n\nEdit #3 (After Final Release)\nWell, the game is finally out. It's still good. It's not perfect and arguably did not live up to all of its promise, but is definitely worth the money. It is very hard, and can cause some frustration, so it is unsurprising that DD ended up being pretty divisive. If you enjoy rogue-likes, dungeon crawlers, or just plain hard games, then you've come to the right place!\nBut seriously, there's this weird smear campaign going on, led by people who apparently 1) take this game way too seriously and 2) are prone to some very weird conspiracy theories about "shills" and stuff. Ignore that. It's just a normal game.","March 29, 2015","true","39.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","16","21","2","0"

The fact that you can quit a dungeon at any time, and return to the exact place, means that I can get my 15-minute fix without fear of losing progress.  It is a brilliant feature.\n\nBeyond that, the art, audio, and gameplay are some of the best I've encountered in my 25 years of gaming.\n\nIf I were to offer some constructive criticism, I'd suggest including the following:\n- the ability to lock/remove positive quirks, as they're currently randomly replaced; this can limit one's opportunity to hone specific characters for specific areas.\n- the ability to sell trinkets, and for more varied ones to be offered in the shop; currently there aren't that many different ones on offer.\n- an option to swap weapons to gamble or min-max abilities.  For example, swapping a Crusader's sword for a warhammer might boost his attack but limit his accuracy.

Here me out. I am no meek gamer in the strategy world. I have completed Shogun 2 on Legendary and Xcom on Impossible Iron-man. I can take the beatings if the game world and mechanics make sense, and I get a feeling that I am contributing to my goal.\n\nIn Darkest Dungeon there is one difficulty. I suppose the designers have tried to incorporate what is known as cognitive flow in game theory [1], by allowing your to choose the level of dungeon you enter with your party. You can roughly match your party to a suitable dungeon in level-wise as well as tactics wise (if you go ruins, don’t take bleed damage, for one example).\n\nThen it becomes apparent that the designers have know idea what they are doing and then BREAK the cognitive flow by not allowing you to 'game the game'. You can't take a level 3 character into a level 1 dungeon. You can't use your battle skills outside of battle, but then you can't take an extra 2-3 rounds to heal wounds and stress because the game will punish you with more stress for bothering to try. Entering a level 5 dungeon is less like a move from 3 to 5, and more like a move from 3 to 10 if you know what I mean.\n\nBeyond the obvious imbalance in the game, the game will then double and triple punish you with it's inane random dice that I wonder why both with in the first place? Ironically the stress attacks in the game cause real stress to the player, because they are so frequent and critically boosted that it causes no-end to frustrations. Where is the fun lads?\n\nThe carry space is far too small for the amount of item types in the game, forcing more contrived choices with the only goal of annoying me further. There is not enough gold earned in the game. There are too many heirloom items in the game (used to unlock and build up your town).\n\nI am left to assume that the refusal to balance the game properly and provide either adequate difficulty modes or a proper working cognitive game flow, is a sign of artificially inflating the playtime of the title. Taken into account the annoying slow pop-ups that lock the control on the party, the tedious animation loops, and the drawn out combat; all of which compound to my suspicions.\n\nI hope with their financial success, they make another game and address these issues forthwith, but for me I didn't like this game despite really trying and pouring 50 hours into it. This is the counter point to looking for 'long games' to use as an example of 'good games'. This is the same problem with games like Counter Strike GO; were I clocked up 200 hours before a realisation of 'WTF am I doing'; I didn't actually enjoy nearly all of my time in those worlds. To me, they will be be forgotten and never explored again.\n\nWhat both these titles have in common is the overuse of catchy gimmicks in game-play and exploit this fully with shallow quest/rewards. The length of the game is not equal to the quality of my enjoyment. In both these games I was annoyed, frustrated, bored and wishing I would just find a better game to play.\n\n[1] http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/166972/cognitive_flow_the_psychology_of_.php\n","April 16","false","58.6"," 84 of 146 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","84","146","6","3"

During the rest you get jumped by a group of monsters you killed off by the dozents before. But this group is the "cheating" one, almost all of their hits are criticals and they dodge most of your attacks. Before you can even take your first action, one of your group gets critted by the first mob, the second mob does an AoE and kills him off. It´s your turn but your stun doesnt stick (despite the +40% stun chance trinket) and your second attack gets dodged. Enemy turn, critical, next AoE and another one of the group is dead. You try to retreat on your next turn, of course you dont get away, next guy is down to zero hitpoints, then dies in the next round. Your last guy gets lucky and away in the next round.\n\nFirst time I thought: "Oh well, bad luck. I´ll just try again." So I start again to prepare that group, this time with a different mix of heroes...and now after the fourth of fifth time I can tell when that one fight comes and retreat just before I get wiped again. I wonder if that tactic is intended by the devs, but I guess not. It´s a build in mechanic to f*** you over as soon as you have a bit more cash, some high level characters or what god knows.\n\nAnyway, it feels like work and not like a game. It kept me busy, sure, but there are much better games out there that wont frustrate you and instead relax you and give you a good experience and not that kind of deep down angry feeling you get when you are getting cheated over and over.\n\n","October 12, 2015","false","99.0"," 91 of 159 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","91","159","6","5"

The shortest way to put it is the game is far too unforgiving, to the point that it will punish you even after a good performance. I will begin with the negatives and wrap up with the positives at the end, seeing as how I prefer to get the bad out before the good.\n\nGames like X-COM allow you to comfortably mitigate the randomness with proper strategy, skill, and caution. This game has many of the same elements: you need to know when to cut your losses on a mission or quest, you need to have good squad composition and know how to effectively use each class, you need to plan your missions and battles, and you need to use upgrades, abilities, and items to their fullest extent. The seeds are planted here for an excellent game.\n\nWhat lacks, however, is fairness and logic. When my entire squad misses their attacks or puts out a pittance, while the enemy continues to pummel me with a wealthy stream of critical hits several rounds and battles in a row - sometimes for an entire dungeon crawl - the game just becomes hard for the sake of it. It's also really ridiculous how an enemy critical hit will cause huge stress in the 10 and 20's for the entire team, while critical hits by my party reduces stress by maybe 5 if I'm lucky, and I'll be even luckier if it affects 2 or more party members. It all occurs too often.\n\nThen, in this game, the abilities your party uses are affected by positioning, and it's very common for sudden effects at the beginning of a battle to jumble where everyone is, and it's not entirely clear how this is factored. Not even initiatives are clear to me, with turn order going all over the place (although I may not be looking at the right places). Considering that it seems to always be random, and in favor of the AI, it ends up punishing players who do plan ahead with party positioning and composition. Even when your characters find maps or do (again, completely random) scouting and you know where the enemies are, they can still ambush you and throw your party into disarray despite their preparedness. Certain enemies have skills that do this and you can plan depending on where you are deploying, since enemy types differ by location, but the randomness is unfair.\n\nSure, there are the few dungeons or battles that went in my favor. I managed to surprise the enemy (how this works I do not know), pummel them all, and then walk away unscathed or with almost no damage. In fact, I've managed to have a few dungeons go like this, even if they're not as common as my party leaving the depths of my family's ruins with under 20% health and going insane from stress. You'd think that such a positive mission would be rewarded? Wrong. When your characters level up, they get completely random Quirks that are overwhelmingly negative and require a great deal of time and money to reverse.\n\nSo, even if the mission goes incredibly well, your adventurers suffering minimal to no stress or damage at the end, and you walked away with an immense amount of loot, the game does not reward your prudence and strategy. Instead, in most instances, it will still punish you. There is no logic. I had one of my adventurers with minimal damage and almost no stress at the end of a mission receive both the "On Guard" and "Off Guard" Quirks upon leveling up. This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.\n\nIt is also possible for adventurers to gain both positive and negative Quirks by interacting with different objects while exploring, such as book cases, urns, and corpses. You will almost always get a heaping helping of negative ones, some of which can render your adventurer completely useless for in-game weeks as you dump thousands of gold into Sanitorium visits, which are used to remove negative Quirks. This renders the huge number of objects on missions utterly pointless as the risk of toying with them is far too high. This means that a great deal of what the developers have put in is, in fact, completely useless. The slim possibility that you will receive a positive trait that almost always offers little benefit stands in stark, bold-faced, italicized, and underlined contrast to the oft-crippling effects of negative Quirks.\n\nThen there is the confusing and counter-intuitive Provisions system. At the beginning of every mission, you must purchase food, torches, and any other items you think that you may need for the mission, such as bandages, healing herbs, skeleton keys (for locked chests), and shovels (for debris, which otherwise cost Health and Stress to remove). These items, however, are useless after the mission. There are permanent items in the form of charms and trinkets you can keep in a party inventory at home base (almost none of which you will use because the drawbacks of these trinkets render their buffs useless), but apparently your characters just throw away torches, potions, shovels, and other items that could last for months after leaving the dungeons. I could totally understand food being useless between the weeks, but it's really frustrating to buy items only to find they're useless in one particular crawl, and then to eschew them the next only to see that you need the items you did not buy in abundance.\n\nThere are still some real positives about the game. The issues I have mentioned are things that can be fixed with tweaking and do not require the developers to throw out huge chunks of what they've already made in order to rebuild. As it currently stands, the developers have an admirable piece of work. The art is very crisp and appealing, making the game just nice to look at. The upgrading system is not ovely punishing and even having to grind low-level dungeons for the items you need for upgrades is not terrible as it gives you the chance to level up newly-recruited adventurers and learn how they best function together (aforementioned issues notwithstanding).\n\nEven money seems to be balanced enough at the moment. The music is well produced and the game runs perfectly, at least on my rig, and it does not seem to be particularly demanding - which thus makes it an appealing game for people who have economy rigs. Animations are smooth and the narrator is interesting (although that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ can be really patronizing when you're losing, not to mention repetitive), offering commentary and even some bits of lore throughout your travels. There are a plethora of classes and skills which keep things interesting and give you a lot to play with as the in-game weeks press on and you continue to delve into the corrupted ruins your ancestor so feverishly pursued.\n\nWhat I love most about the Narrator's is his commentary about the player themselves: how far are you willing to go to redeem your fictitious family's honor, and do you really care about it versus the divers shinies you uncover in your wake? Admitting my own hubris, I have had an entire party wipe because I delved into the ruins for more goodies even after completing the quest goals.\n\nMy advice to the developers would be to make the game more fair and balanced. If you're going to make it punishing, make it punishing for a reason. There are far too many aspects of the game which are decided by pure chance, and this is both frustrating and insulting. It is frustrating to find yourself often punished even if you have a successful mission or make the strategically correct decisions, and it's insulting that the developers added in clear artificial difficulty at every chance, instead of fine tuning their game.\n\nIt deserves to be stressed yet again that I see a great deal of potential in this game and its developers. I like having some randomness to my games, or else they become easy and predictable once you figure out how it works. What Darkest Dungeon does, however, it is takes the randomness way too far. Should the developers make satisfactory changes, I will update my review in kind, and change my recommendation as such.","June 21, 2015","false","19.7"," 134 of 239 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","134","239","10","26"

That said, there's a lot of elements that are really just frustrating to deal with. The stress system, while sometimes fun (It feels pretty awesome when you hit 100 stress and your character gets a heroic bonus instead of crumbling under the stress like the majority of characters do) is more annoying than anything. When maximum stress hits the character has a heart attack, dropping their health to zero and debuffing them for the remainder of the dungeon, which can be a group killing experience. To avoid this you're expected to "treat" the character's stress by leaving them in the local bar or church while you go on your next adventure. This leads to a lot of characters leveling up at different rates. This wouldn't be too bad, but there's invisible barriers between characters of certain levels. For instance, level 3 characters can't embark with level 2 characters. This causes problems where the only characters available on your roster are two level 3s, and two level 2s, because everyone else is healing from stress or illness. Except you can't embark with that group, because theyre separate level groups. So what do you do? Well, you can either take a highly stressed character out of the bar or church because you need some lower leveled guys to adventure with to get some people up to level 3. I realize its supposed to be a matter of how to manage the team, but it's more frustrating than anything. A high stressed character IS going to have a heart attack during the dungeon and ruin the run, and dismissing them to hire a new recruit is just really annoying.\n\nThen there's the spontaneous difficulty spikes. For instance one dungeon, suggested for level 1 characters, asks you to kill a specific character, a "boss". The "boss" character all of a sudden is able to knock two characters down to 1 health in one attack, and gets multiple attack turns in one round. Meanwhile all before this I had been playing level 1 dungeons, others with boss characters that were nowhere near this difficulty. It's just ridiculous, because there's no reason or expectation of such power in a level 1 dungeon.\n\nThere's also the low drop rates of gold, which you need to spend more and more of on supplies just to survive the dungeon, but then also need to use to upgrade characters and heal their stress and ailments. There's barely enough money to go around, which makes advancing characters a pain in the ♥♥♥, especially when they'll just die to an encounter with an enemy like I mentioned in the last paragraph.\n\nOverall, I find the game frustrating, but there are redeeming aspects, like having a solid team making dungeons a challenging, but rewarding experience (but like I mentioned with the level-tier separations that can get messed up really quickly) I'd recommend it to people that like repeating tedious elements, because you will be losing characters, and re-running the same dungeons to level up new characters again. I've read that the game is more of a team-management game than a dungeon crawler, which kind of rings true. The important part of the game seems to be more in how you handle healing characters and the meager funds you get. If you're into that aspect, and dont care that much about whether your characters survive in the long run then you might like the game. I feel the game is misrepresented as a dungeon crawler RPG, and thats only a part of the game, which is more often frustrating than enjoyable. If all you want is to dungeon crawl, a different game might be more up your ally. If you want to manage your team of weaklings, and can accept that most of them are going to die then you might like the game.\n\nGenerally, I don't recommend the game, because I don't think it appeals to a wide audience and most people are going to go into it expecting an experience much different than what it actually is, but if you fall within a specific niche of gamers that prefer team-management games and grim-dark fantasy you might be one of the people that really like Darkest dungeon.","April 15","false","13.7"," 52 of 88 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","52","88","2","0"

This is the game for you if you're a supernaturally lucky person. Otherwise, can't recommend.\n\nThe good: The writing is excellent. The graphics do a very good job of getting the overall mood across and are creepy without getting overboard. The character classes are quite interesting. The music and sound effects are also pretty cool, and I love the overall idea of this game. However...\n\nThe bad: Success or failure is mostly random. This makes the game difficult, as advertised, but it is an extremely frustrating sort of difficulty. The game may give you a mission with eight combat rooms and corridors full of further combats and traps, or it may generate a mission with tons of loot and maybe a single fight. In combat, one crit from your enemy - or even an enemy using a particular attack, chosen at random - will often lead to a situation going rapidly out of control. If your party ever gets surprised (random chance), you may as well pack in then and there. You'll frequently have to skip a full turn to get everyone into a position where they can actually do something, and by that time your party will have a crippling amount of damage inflicted on it. It is generally not possible to salvage a bad situation. Some afflictions are utterly crippling, some stressed-out characters will skip their turns, whether a character who is "at Death's Door" will live is up to chance and so forth. Abandoning a mission (if you can roll a success on your flee-from-combat attempt!) will leave you with a group of stressed-out characters and not enough money to outfit a worthwhile expedition, so you'll have to go back to grinding the Ruins for a while so you can get another shot at the success roulette. Most combat skills also have random effects (apart from miss chance and dodge chance); the Occultist's heal skill, for instance, can do anything from "heal 10" to "inflict 3". This is not good gameplay. This is a slot machine.","June 2, 2015","false","129.5"," 120 of 214 people (56%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","56","120","214","14","3"

The dungeons are hard but also rewarding and interesting, your characters grow or die, develop their individual traits and get on your nerves with their quirks (in a good way).\n\nThe fun ends once your characters level up to the higher quest tiers. There are level 1, 3, 5 and with the Darkest Dungeon presumably level 6 quests. Once your characters reach the respective level, they refuse to go on lower level quests, which generally would be fine. The problem is that the difficulty scaling from one tier to the other is insane and level ups themselves don't do anything for the characters. You will therefore be massively "underleveled", if you haven't been extremely successfull in upgrading your guild and your smithy and getting loads of money to then actually upgrade your heroes. You can then either send your best guys on runs they're not prepared for and either see them die or spend most of the money you get on their recovery OR you grind ridiculously small rewards with new arrivals.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about the RNG but I honestly didn't have any issues with that. Yes, sometimes it can feel unfair and your party gets ♥♥♥♥ed because of a series of terrible rolls, but other times you'll see them destroy a boss with him barely being able to get a hit in, so... yeah, that's RNG for you.\n\nWhat really ruins this game for me is its insane difficulty scaling and artificially stretched length. I have started a couple of runs and have never gotten past the level 3 quests. To be fair, I can be pretty bad at video games but it seems like a lot of people are having similar experiences, so I don't think it's just entirely that.\n\nThe game still has a lot of good elements and I can't say I completely advice people not to buy it. It's just that actually finishing it is an enormous pain in the ♥♥♥ and I'd reckon most people won't actually see the end if they're not extremely determined and have a very high tolerance for frustration.\n\nMakes for great streams though.","February 8","false","44.6"," 55 of 94 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","55","94","4","0"

I bought it following a recommendation from a friend. I've barely touched any of the other games I bought during the steam sale. I ended up playing about 24 hours in the first week. I think it's the challenge. The fact that knowing that at any moment, everything could just go to ♥♥♥♥.\n\n- "Bugs, huh? I gotta fight bugs?

(also registered trademark) It may require some patience to endure the painful "learning experiences" of the game (although from what little I've seen of the most recent update, it looks like they're working to make the game less mysterious), but I never really considered the momentary confusion or unpleasant sudden realizations to ever outweigh the fun of playing. Honestly I rather enjoyed discovering the mechanics for myself.\n\nAll in all, the game is very challenging, highly addictive, pleasing to the eye and the sanity mechanics add an extra dynamic both in terms of game mechanic and in developing an emotional attachment to your cannon fodder (I mean...when you're one Obdurous Advancement away from a party wipe and your sexy booty ♥♥♥♥♥ hellion becomes Heroic and lets loose a raucous war cry as she cleaves a shamblers head off with one well placed justice crit it's kinda hard NOT to buy her a drink afterwards and offer to bear her children, yano?)\n\nHighly Recommended/10\nPlay your way to madness.","July 17, 2015","true","33.5"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","29","46","5","1"

On the positive side, the gameplay is good and engaging. It's fun to build parties with various synergies and see how they tackle the challenges this game throws at you. The artstyle is fantastic as well, and all the classes feel varied enough to remain interesting. So what are the real problems with this game? Bottom line, it comes down to one thing:\n\nYou probably won't finish it.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is many things, fun yes, challenging and even unfair at times, but what it is more than anything else? It is repetitive.\n\nProgression happens very, very slowly in the game, as your heroes gradually rank up if they do not manage to succumb to the horrors and RNG of the dungeons. Things also get progressively more expensive. One of the main challenges in this game is maintaining expenses. Everything is expensive, and the amount of money you get from dungeons, even in dark runs, isn't sufficient to cover your costs. You have to make sacrifices, and its very difficult to get and remain ahead. Accidents happen, and runs will go poorly. You must pay for stress treatment and disease treatment, and upgrades are expensive and must be purchased. I honestly feel like in some respects, the game is a budgeting simulator. I don't think that is particularly fun.\n\nThe other major issue is that to lengthen the game, you must fight nearly every boss 3 times, each on a different difficulty. They don't actually change in any aspects other than their stats, so this feels like a grind and a way to pad the game out to be much longer than it actually needed to be. They would be better off removing variations of the bosses, and shortening the game up. I'm nearly 30 hours in at the time of this review, and still have to kill many bosses, nearly all of which are simply beefed up versions of bosses I've beaten before. Repetition is not fun for a player. Nobody likes doing the same thing multiple times if nothing is going to change. I don't mind the difficulty, but the grind and repetition is excessive, and will be too much for most people to actually hunker down and finish the game.\n\nSo all in all, I'm conflicted. This game's core systems are fun, but it's mired down by an overwhelming grind and expense management. Simply due to the fact that most people won't have the stomach to fight through the whole thing, I can't honestly reccommend it on good conscience. It is a fun game, and I would recommend buying it IF and ONLY IF you are aware before hand that you will likely lose heart, and this will be a game you never finish. Not because of difficulty, but because you just got tired of doing the same thing over and over when it simply wasn't necessary to do so.","May 29","false","56.8"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","29","46","0","5"

Allow me to explain: Your characters level when you take them into the dungeon, but around level 4 your higher level characters will refuse to go to the lower level dungeons to help escort and level your lower-level characters. It's more or less suicide/disaster when you bring your lower level characters to higher level dungeons. This took me several hours to discover, otherwise I would have continued escorting all my low-level characters up to a decent level. It requires careful planning to make sure the exp gets spread out so no one char gets too high and becomes unusable until the rest of your team catches up(or fails to catch up because an A-lister can't go in your dungeons anymore). The problem occurs when some of your A-team chars die or are out of commision for awhile and your B-team can't compete in the current dungeons. Painstakingly raising rookies to even B-team status will literally take hours, assuming all goes well.\n\nIt gets to a point where instead of "oh crap, a char died, I'll just start over my 2-8 hour game" you go "oh crap, a char died, I can either trash my 8-12 hour game, or try to get back into it by investing 3 hours into a rookie and try to salvage all the time I put in". It becomes quite tedious.\n\nALLLLLL this could be alleviated if you could buy higher level characters(for a higher price, or not even characters that rival your high level chars, maybe just level 2 so you don't need to spend 2-3 hours grinding a few levels for your rookies).\n\nAll in all, I think this game needs work.

In a gaming universe now littered with embarrassingly amateurish "shovelware,"  insipid "AAA" titles that usually amount to little more than more of the same with minor tweaks (but with eye-bleeding super-realistic graphics that require mega-GPUs to get 25 fps - another sad trend as of late), and just plain scams where devs promise one thing, deliver another, and disappear into the ether with your cash, a game like Darkest Dungeon (DD) gives me hope that my once favorite hobby has some life in it yet.\n\nWhat is amazing is that DD treads a well-worn road.  At its heart, DD is just another "roguelike" dungeon crawler.  But what elevates DD to its own lofty pedestal is a simple question: would professional dungeon crawlers develop PTSD?  At first, you laugh at the idea.  But then you stop and think about it.  Given how your typical fantasy dungeon crawl not only involves the type of brutal combat that any modern soldier would understand, but also a host of horrors - such as demons, giant spiders, and other abominations- on top of THAT, the answer would seem to be: oh heck yeah.  I guess they really would!\n\nThat is the heart of Darkest Dungeon.\n\nDarkest Dungeon puts the player not just in charge of clearing dungeons, but also of managing the mental health of their assailed heroes.  In DD, the player must send teams of four adventurers (whom come from a nicely varied assortment of classes) to clear dungeons from around half a dozen thematic designs (ruins, warrens, etc.).  This part of the game is great fun.  Resembling a side-scroller, your adventurers, whom are brought to life with some wonderfully hand drawn artistry reminiscient of a Brothers Grimm fairytale, clear out a series of rooms and passages (randomly generated and populated with monsters, traps and loot, of course) in a dungeon of various sizes, some  so big that your team will need to camp inside a few times.  Such moments are a lot of fun as it involves its own unique gameplay of recuperation and campsite chatter.  Battle is handled in a wonderful turn-based fashion (love it; so glad to see devs getting away from click-fest RTS games) with both sides using their weapons and skills to strike each other down, something wonderfully enhanced by a narrator who comments on the action with a voice right out of, yes!,  a Grimm's fairytale.  But here is the important kicker: as your adventurers explore and battle their way through a dungeon, the game tracks stress points individually.  So, for example, if your man-at-arms suffers a critical hit at the hand of a foe, his stress level will go up, as might the stress of the other party members.  On the other hand, if he deals a devastating riposte, his stress might go down, and so on.  If stress accumulates to a certain degree, the adventurer might have a mental break.  It is here that the game begins to resemble Crusader Kings 2 in that each adventurer can accumulate a mix of up to a dozen vices and virtues that will affect their performance.  So, that man-at-arms who was almost killed might become a coward when he has his mental break, something that might debuff his stats or make him miss a turn.  Or, maybe he overcomes his fear and gets a virtue instead: he becomes heroic and urges his party to fight harder, reducing stress for all and buffing combat stats.  See how it works?  It is quite fun and adds a wonderful novelty to the game!  But be warned: if your adventurer becomes too stressed, he can actually die of a heartattack!\n\nSpeaking of heartattacks, that is what might happen to the gamer when he loses one of his star adventurers to permadeath.  Yeah, this game has that.  Personally, I love permadeath because nothing ruins a tale of adventuring heroism when the player can just "save and restore."  Face it: S&R is just immortality by another name.  How can there be true heroism if the hero is never truly at risk?  But that is just my two cents.  Be that as it may, this game has permadeath, so be prepared to lose some of your best players to the evil machninations of the "random number generator" that governs many aspects of this game.  If you hate such mechanics, than this game is not for you.\n\nWhat happens when your adventurers leave a dungeon, assuming they survive?  Here, the game takes on an XCOM-like factor where base management comes into play.  In between dungeon crawls, the player can send his adventurers out with bags of gold to help them blow off steam in six different ways, from getting drunk, to praying at the abbey.  Of course, this takes these adventurers out of the game for at least a week - I say "at least a week" becayse random events occasionally trigger where, say, your knight gets drunk and wanders the town for two weeks in a state of inebriation!  LOL!  That actually happened to one of my adventurers.  Not only did he go AWOL for an extra week, be he lost the magic trinket I gave him!  Hence, the player needs to have a deep bench of adventurers to keep the gaming moving along, something that is not initially difficult as the local stage coach brings in a steady supply of new victi...er, adventurers.\n\nIn addition to managing the stress of your bench, you can also train new skills, upgrade armor and weapons, upgrade facilities, treat the mental and physical ailments your adventurers acquire in the darkest dungeons, and select the next adventure and get kitted out for it.\n\nAnd that is pretty much the basics of the game in a nutshell.  Again, with the exception of the stress factor, nothing revolutionary.  But RedHook, with feedback from the community (this is EA done right!), applied so much thoughtfulness, attention to detail, and ol' fashioned love to their project that what has emerged out the other end may well be Game of the Year material for the PC.  Frankly, it has been a very long time since I have so thoroughly enjoyed a game.   With the devs already promising a new class of adventurer as well as "town events" in the near future gratis - the town does need some enlivening as it feels a little static and dull at times, so I am glad to hear this - I think the Darkest Dungeon has a VERY bright future ahead of it.  It certainly has already rocketed to the top of my favorite games list!","January 22","true","22.6"," 71 of 124 people (57%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","57","71","124","9","0"

It's not that the game is too hard, I can deal with hard. It's that the game is unfairly hard. As in, it punishes you at total random with things you had no way to avioid it. Sure RNG helps keep things freash for a short time, but this is a massive overdose of it.\n\nIt's just not fun anymore, the reward you get from finsihing a quest hardly ever makes up for the ever rising cost of healing your party's stress and verious illnesses. You don't ever get the feeling of progression. A constant state two steps forward and three steps back looms over you through the entierty of the play session.\n\nThe game simply lacks consistancy, it's very hard to learn when you can't tell if the effect was the game giving you yet another middle finger, or it was becuase you did somthing wrong, making this profoundly diffucult for new players to start with the laerning curve.  was an 8/10 to start but with the most recent updates, its bumped down to a 4/10 would not buy.","August 18, 2015","false","7.3"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","32","52","6","0"

The only way to heal is in-combat as each food heals only one HP. Having to grind 5 mins in a combat by chain-stunning an enemy is not the way to go. Also, there are not enough stun and heal skills to reliably pull this off early-game.\n\nItems are way too expensive. The item pouch is too small, given the plethora of mechanics in this game (torch level, stress, bleed, blight, HP, artifact cleansing, path clearing, etc). Even after ending a dungeon, players should be able to keep the items for the next quest.\n\nThe combat mechanics are too RNG-based, rather than skill-based. Opponents seem to dodge a significantly larger amount than the player.\n\nKeep in mind that the villains' attacks also out-hit the players in HP and stress, which makes it tough as you will need to heal for two categories at a large cost.\n","August 12, 2015","false","7.3"," 33 of 54 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","33","54","4","0"

The depth and difficulty are superficial and short-lived. $20 PC game now, or $5 (or less) on mobile platform.\n\nThe concept is brilliant and unique, the art and design are inspired. However, everything about the game seems to indicate that its primary purpose is to test out how well it can be ported into mobile formats.\n\nEdit:\nOn its Kickstarter page, the game was advertised as "Darkest Dungeon is a challenging gothic roguelike RPG about the psychological stresses of adventuring."\n\nAs a backer i am still disappointed by several parts of this description.\n\nThe game is not challenging. (the game feels and plays more like a slot machine or a game of poker, you have very little input, and what little challenge is there is only exists on the surface. the challenge is easily overcome in a few hours. certain additions have been made to provide more challenge, but they only increased the tedium of the game. making the game require more grinding, and drawing out every battle is not a substitute for depth or difficulty)\n\nThe game is not a rougelike in any way. (your heroes suffer from permadeath, if you let it go that far, but you as a player suffer NO consequences as a result of letting individual heroes or even whole teams get wiped out. Heroes are a free resource that you can keep obtaining and accumulating)\n\nThe game is not an RPG. (the game is more like a hero management simulator, you can make improvements to your hero's skills and items, as well as determining the party composition and their position within the group. There is no story nor any role-playing element to the game.)\n\nThe game has no adventuring. (everything about the game can be seen within a few hours. in each location there are only 5, give or take a few depending on the location, different variations of fights to be had before seeing a boss or fully exploring the dungeon. The misssions themselves have very little variety,and any sort of risk/reward for pressing further into a location is almost non existant.)\n\nThe game we are being sold certainly doesnt feel like it belongs on PC, nor is it the game that was originally pitched or is currently being advertised.","August 6, 2015","false","7.9"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","34","56","3","8"

First of all let me say that I loved this game, it's seriously a lot of fun. It has a lot of customization, many different hero classes to play as and many different moves for each of your party members. The atmosphere and artstyle are also fantastic with a dark comic book feel that really immerses you while you play. The dialouge is also fantastic! The person doing the voice acting does a really nice job. Now, for the negatives, after a while playing this game I was having a blast and I was really enjoying it. I had gotten up to level 3 people and I was having a blast. But I started realizing that I had very little impact on how my people die. RNG dictates COMPLETELY how any run goes, not your skill. For example I got into a fight after I was done camping (no, not an ambush in the next room over) and all of my people were either at or damn near max HP and very low stress. Upon entering the room I went about the fight as I had for 5 hours prior, nothing seemed different during turn one. However then my plauge doctor got hit with a 37 HP critical attack and had bleed inflicted, and then died when his turn came. I can deal with that, one unlucky death, oh well. However then on the next turn the same enemy attack 2 of my men with one move and guess what! Another crit! Except this time it was a double critical attack that dealt nearly 20 damage to both my party members, putting them at high stress and low HP. Then immediately after my party was blanket fired and guess what, ANOTHER CRIT 5-6 damage dealt to every one of my party members and even more stress. At this point 2 of my guys were on deaths door and were broken with stress. I promptly left the dungeon and got a quest failed. I'm not writing this review to cry about one incident, throughout my playtime I found that in combat my choices didn't dictate who survived and how well I did, but rather it was ALL based on RNG. Why continue to play a game where ultimately you don't have any control on what plays out, as one string of ridiculous crits can wipe out your entire party? I don't know what the devs can do to patch this, because RNG is based around every event in the dugeon so there's not much they could do to remove it.\n\nPROS\n-Awesome art style\n-Excellent dialouge\n-Diverse selection of characters and skills\n-Cool town mechanics\n-Addictive\n\nCONS\n-The game crashes every now and then\n-Some UI quirks\n-RNG based everything makes the game feel more like a slot machine than a rougelike","February 8, 2015","false","22.4"," 123 of 222 people (55%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","55","123","222","12","14"

Yes, the game is a challenge, the game is tactic based and yes the game has a big replay value until a certain point. While you might feel you mastered the dynamics, the trinkets/spells/camping setup, the RNG and unbalanced minions will eventually beat you after you start doing the champion challenges. You might feel that everything is doing fine after you realize that the minions stats do not really scale with your heroes stats meaning that the higher level you get, the lower damage you deal due to the fact that every minion now has ridiculou dodge/prot/crit ratings which makes the no longer a challenge but a dice roll. The size 2 minions can one shot you with non crit atacks (treebranch smackdown from the troll hits for 30+ non crit, 55+ crit), the bleed/blight now deals an insane amount of damage per turn while the game absolutely ignores your resists. I have for example 90%+ on both bleed and blight but I would still only resists those kind of atacks about 2/10 times. As for today I lost 4  lvl 6 characters in only an hour gameplay (dont have to mention how long it takes to pimp out your heroes) because I just wouldnt beat the dice rolls (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ instagibs, bleed/blight dealing 12 per tick..) which makes it utterly frustrating experience. There is just still so much work to be done on this game and if you dont want to rage destroy your rig I suggest you play something where only your decisions and skills have the impact on the game. This game so far is fairly both luck based and improperly mechanized while being pretty unrewarding at the same time.\n\nI am pretty sure that once proper changes are made this game will kick asses but as for now that is not the case.

I had just started feeling good about my chances with this game. I had learned the main mechanics, put together a party I was confident in, and was on the way to beating my most difficult quest to date.\n\nThen, something unexpected happened. The boss, exploiting a mechanic I had not seen yet, decimited the health of all my heros in one round.\n\nOne. Round.\n\nIn an instant my entire situation had flipped. From full health to everyone suddenly knocking at deaths door. From feeling optomisticly confident, to feeling like I had no chance in hell. One, round.\n\nThe next few rounds I tried diligently to staunch the bleeding that had occured to no avail, my whole party wiped, as I could never recover. And not only did I lose the time and money invested in grooming those heros, I lost the few pieces of legendary gear I had that had enabled most of my smooth progress. It was a beyond devestating defeat.\n\nThis is normally the point of a game where I reload, start from scratch, or begin a new save to correct refine my tactics and correct my failure. The magic of this game is the fact that the way it is designed, reloading and restarting is completely un-necessary. You gain exctly nothing from starting over a new campaign, which I think is a brilliant design point to make. And since there is no way to reload, you have to learn how to accept defeat and move on.\n\nBrilliant.\n\nThere's only one problem. That wouldn't be my first wipe.\n\nThe next day, I got back on the proverbial horse and started again. I groomed fresh troops to go back to the same mission and eventually avenge my original fallen party. It took a few days, but I did it. The confidence was back, the swagger regained.\n\nAnd unfortunately, sadly, pathetically, the same unavoidable cycle repetead itself 2 more times, each failure successively more demoralizing than the one before it. 3 total times, my party wiped from some previously unforseen mechanic activating that totally flipped the tables no matter how well provisoned and prepared I might have been. The very last wipe I slammed my desk and haven't opened the game since.\n\nHerein lies the question.\n\nUltimately, is the game at times gorgeous, wonder-inducing, challenging, and terror-invoking?\n\nYes. Without question, yes.\n\nAnd at other times, is the game gimmicky, niche, and disengenuous in the sense that, it may lead to believe that you are prepared for what lies ahead, but unless you sink hours into trial in error wipes or research fights in advance, you will ultimately have the tables turned upside-down on you no matter what, because the developers specifically want you to fail in such a devestating way? In other words, are you okay with walking into a trap that you have no way to counter without some research and some good rng? Some people may not like the feeling of being setup, as I certainly did not. In fact, I haven't re-opened the game since that last wipe. And while I might one day muster up the pride to go back, I could also very well choose not to and maybe live a life better off for it.\n\nOnly time can tell.\n\nFor now, though it is a great game, I'm advising no as a reccomendation simply because I've had it, after 27hrs. Maybe I'll go back one day and get to 100, and then in terms of value I will change the review to yes. Maybe other reviewers got their moneys worth already despite all I've said and will put yes.\n\nFor me, and my rng karma though, the answer for now is no.","January 27","false","28.9"," 64 of 113 people (57%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","57","64","113","8","3"

A lot of the percieved difficulty I see others describe seems to be a combination of not understanding the game (or taking the time to learn it) and not being willing to use a variety of strategies and approaches.\n\nThe art is great. The characters are fun and interesting.\n\nBut its the tactical depth that really gives the game super high ratings from me. Yes its hard and sometimes the RNG will seem unfair (the nature of RNG). But thats a whole intentional element of the strategic depth of the game. The disclaimer at the start of the games tells you that DD is about making the best of a bad situation.\n\nYou will be on dungeon runs that are going great and quickly start going horribly wrong. You are forced on the fly to make strategic adaptations to survive and continue or risk/reward analysis about fleeing the combat or abandoning the dungeon run entirely. I love that. I want to be challenged. I want to sometimes be put it what some describe as "unfair situations" despite my best planning and preparation. Thats an opportunity strategically delicious decision making. Few games do this.\n\nIf you are into X-Com played on Ironman mode you will probably like this game as there is no save scumming allowed. X-com is by for the game whose RNG and its effect on your tactical decision making most closely mirrors DD of games I have played. I am like 80 hours or so in and am still learning different ways to combo the heros, their abilities, and the lineup.\n\nFor the first 20 hours or so I didnt even realize this game was in beta. Sure I have run into at least one odd bug but its remarkably polished for a beta, I am excited to see Redhooks take on endgame content once they release that with the actual release of the game.\n\nHonestly while the game is on the challenging side, its not nearly as hard as some reviewers make it out to be. If you are willing to change/evaluate your tactics, run from fights/abandon quests when things go terribly RNG wrong, and use the info on forums and the wiki to make better tactical decisions in group composition for the dungeon you are tackling and curios you activate you are probably the type of gamer who will really enjoy this game.\n\nAlso, it captures the Call of Cthulhu feel very well, especially with all the insanity stuff and real risk of death of your heros.\n\nThis is a true gem. Best game I have tried in quite some time.","October 28, 2015","true","176.4"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","42","72","0","8"

Now, I've not gotten very far into the game, as it just constantly makes me frustrated and unhappy, But from what I've seen of it, it's a pretty neat setting and I just wish that I could enjoy it more.\n\n-The art style is pretty fantastic, I love the art style and look of the game.\n\n-There are quite a variety of heroe types to choose from and there seems to be a great deal of customizability to the game.\n\nNow what I don't like.\n-Stress is incredibly difficult to manage. Stress causes all kinds of negative stuff to your heroes, some times devestating stuff, it's expensive to get rid of and is accumulated all of the damn time. The more stress your heroes have, the more bat-♥♥♥♥ insane they get and the more stat penalties they incur. Stat penalties are also expensive to get rid of.\n\n-The torch system in this game is also very difficult to manage. You have to buy torches at the beginning of an expedition and you have to use them to recharge your light as you make your way through the dungeon. My issue with them is that the lower your light gets the more stress your heroes suffer from and the more difficult the monsters become, and torches do not last long at all, I often times will have to use up two of them just to get between rooms.\n\n-My biggest complaint and the primary reason I keep quitting out of frustration, is how you constantly have to micromanage your expenses. You get gold from completing expeditions and you must spend that gold on upgrading the abilities and gear for your heroes, providing leasure activities for your heroes so they don't go bat-♥♥♥♥ insane and on consumable items used during expeditions.\n\nNot that big of a deal, the problem for me is specifically in reguard to the consumable items, you have to do some major guess work(or clever statistical calculation) in order to make sure you have enough to keep your party from dying horribly or going insane. Now, I am not a statistician so I cannot do the clever statistical calculating to make sure I have enough to stay alive and even if I could, there's a very serious randomness to the entire game. Even if you math out the most efficient use of your gold to gear to abilities to leasure to items, you still will probably get screwed over during the expedition. Perhaps you didn't pack enough food to feed your heroes(yes you have to feed your heroes at least a couple times, if not more, during an expedition) and the RNG didn't provide you with food as treasure, or perhaps you didn't pack enough torches so you run out of torches and your heroes either go totally bonkers or die horribly in battle. Maybe you couldn't afford enough bandages and that damn pig creature just kept making your heroes bleed and they died of blood loss. Maybe you couldn't afford enough antivenom to heal the poison(or blight as it's called) that the mushroom mutants constantly cause. There is no item to heal the huge stress that the undead inflict to your heroes, the only time you can do that is when you spend gold and keep the hero out of the following expedition(and you must attempt an expedition every single day(or week as they call it), you can't skip weeks!).\n\nEvery time I play I feel like I'm beating my head endlessly against a wall. It is very stressful to have to guess so much about what to expect or plan for in a given dungeon because more often than not, the random number generator will completely screw you over. In fact, everything about this game seems to be random, everything from what heroes you get to pick from after the introduction to how much and of what types of loot you aquire in a dungeon. Everything from what happens to your heroes during combat to what groups of enemies you run into. Even the effects of stress on your heroes is random. Sometimes you just get an amusing phobia, other times your hero gets a debilitating debuff that will have a real, sometimes crippling effect in game.\n\nI understand that the developers wanted to create a challenging game, I understand that they wanted to create a game that elicits a sense of crushing hopelessness. They very much succeeded, perhaps they succeeded a too well. The randomness coupled with the micromanagment this game expects just overwhelms and frustrates me to the point where I simply don't enjoy myself and enjoyment is the whole reason one plays a video game.\n\nI'd play the hell out of this game if they just allowed us to customize the difficulty, but the only way to make the game less difficult is through a mod that alters the game files and that mod doesn't really do much to lessen the cruelty built into this game.","February 8","false","12.2"," 35 of 59 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","35","59","3","0"

Now after playing the game some more I can safely recommend it.\n\nAlthough it is roguelike it plays as a side scrolling dungeon crawler with parties of four. You are situated in a village allowing for weapon and skill upgrades as well as the recruiting of new adventurers (expect some to die along the way). There are quite varied classes, although maybe another tyoe of party healer is required, as there are only two classes that do this role effectively. As you complete each dungeon you get heirlooms, these can then be used to upgrade your village amenites. You can choose out of a few areas at once with bosses along the way to fight, meaning you won't get stuck in just one area with the smae baddies for ages. The combat can be challenging but not impossible (as far as I know, I am still near the start).\n\nWhat makes this game stand out is the stress effect on your characters as you explore each dungeon. Some are positive but most are negative. For instance they might become abusive to other adventurers increasing their stress or paranoid and avoid being healed etc. To help with this you use the tavern or the abbey to calm them down. Meaning you will constantly be rotating your party for each mission. There are also disease effects to account for and sometimes personal preference like being god fearing etc.\n\nThe art style itself is fairly unique and very atmospheric and the voice acting of the plot driver is fantastic.\n\nIt is a fun game that pushes the boundaries of the genre and can be played in short doses with persistent progression to your village and characters, if they survive that is...","February 2","true","8.0"," 91 of 164 people (55%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","55","91","164","16","7"

That horrible realisation came to me when I had yet another one of my characters die because the game's mechanics are so utterly arbitrary, convoluted and befuddling that I can have my most skilled warriors miss attacks time after time and there is literally no way to anticipate or counter the sheer randomness of the game's rules. Accomplishments in this game are treated as insults, I have never seen another game be so utterly meanspirited when it comes to making progress; high level characters suddenly refuse to go on missions and become so "stressed" that they actually become a liability, wasting time and money trying to heal them. I lost two of my best characters killing a boss and when the mission was completed I got almost no reward, no new areas, no special equipment, buffs or any sign of progress. The game just went "♥♥♥♥ you for killing our boss. Now do it again. And again. And again." Combat in this game only gives the vague illusion of strategy; so much of the game is based on chance, which would be fine but the parts that are based on skill are almost impossible to work out and are governed by random factors which basically make it poinltess to even try. To top it off the enemies are just overpowered to the point of idiocy; the very few rules that actually govern combat just don't apply to your opponents, character positioning, buffs and targetting just get left by the wayside while they continue to rain hell on your characters with no indication that you're going part way to killling them. Meanwhile your characters get subjected to all sorts of pointless and petty rules and factors which just limit the entire game experience completely. The turn timer is a particular favourite; I once had two enemeis have four turns one after the other before my characters had even had their first go and there is literally nothing that can be done about it, apparently speed is a governing factor but its nigh on impossible to find your character's speed nor is it possible to actually understand what is considered good speed or find out how it compares to the speed of your enemies.\n\nThe thing is I like a challenging game and turn based combat is good fun but this game makes challenge and combat frustrating and utterly boring. Xcom is one of my favourite games but in that game you can understand the limitations and rules governing the game, similarly with darksouls the game is unbelievably hard but you can work strategy into your game and when you make progress you actually make progress, the game rewards you in ways Darkest Dungeon just refuses to. I will say that this is one of the most beautifully designed and atmospheric games I've ever played, for several hours the game can fully immerse you in its world delightfully and then you just find yourself fighting stupidly frustrating and drawn out battles and while initially the sense of triumph after completing a level will keep you going for a while there comes a point where it just stops being fun.\n\nI know that responses to this post are going to be the same standard of "lol git gud" or "you just need to keep going" but at this point I have to ask...why? Why should I keep going with a game where combat is so ridiculous and frustrating and there is just no real reward. Every mission is just the same basic nightmarish grind and when they're completed the game gives you nothing new except more grind. No new characters get unlocked (characters appear randomly and don't really bring anything new) and after the first handful of missions you'll have unlocked all the buildings and after that progress becomes meaningless. There's no benefit to completing missions apart from "do it more" and after a while even the analysis of the stress mechanic becomes boring, when the only interesting part of the game is "what random negative effect has my character received now" then I just can't see the point of the game. With combat this frustrating and such little reward even the great atmosphere starts to pall, not lest because the game kinda stops world building and just drops you into the same basic locations with the same basic enemies with no real sense of anything changing. I will say that this game is great to play with friends, not least because you can get someone else to do the grinding while you do something else for a bit\n\ntl;dr this game is like great foreplay that results in terrible sex...and instead of getting to ♥♥♥ at the end you're told you have to have even more terrible sex again and again with only the vaguest hint of a payoff at the end, except at the end you're told you need to keep doing it over and over again. After a while you just want to stop and walk away, although if you can get more people involved it can improve somewhat. I do want to say that this is by no means a bad game, its just not fun in the end.","July 24, 2015","false","23.5"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","29","48","4","0"

The gorgeous hand-drawn aesthetic and comically overwrought prose of the story really stand out as unique. Big, smart-sounding words will be misused (swarthy means dark-skinned, you guys), the low-low-low gamma will make you squint at your screen, and the 'heroes' will dodder around on-screen like children playing dress-up. The hamfistedness really works out favorably overall, though you may tire of the rasping narrator after the 50th time he tells you about the “dancing steps of war”.\nThe heroes themselves are diverse and unique, and the sheer number of classes (10 and counting), skills, and personality quirks mean that no two are ever quite alike. Your nymphomaniac  Plague Doctor will save you cash by being… efficient at the brothel, but his Fear of Beasts will make him pretty damned worthless in the Weald (where he probably acquired the Fear in the first place after contracting rabies from a dog). Luckily, you can forcibly remove his phobia (for a steep fee) at the Sanitarium, where you can also cure the rabies.\n\nIn addition, there is also a really great gameplay mechanic called ‘Stress’. As they’re subjected to more and more horrors in the dungeons, each heroes’ stress level increases until a critical point at which they crumble, becoming an abusive, cowardly, selfish, or (extremely rarely) more heroic version of themselves. In between dungeon runs, the heroes can spend a week or two blowing off steam at the Tavern or Church (though I’m still not sure how self-flagellation can possibly be as effective as a visit to the brothel).  Thus, even though you can only use 4 heroes at any given time, you’ll want a sizable roster to rotate them in and out of your lineup. This also forces you to use vastly different combinations; sometimes you’re  just stuck with three healers and a mage with the red plague on a given week and you have to make a dungeon run anyway.\n\nAll of this sounds great, doesn’t it? Why am I giving this a thumbs down? Unfortunately, the gameplay is entirely dominated by compounding randomness. The damage ranges are wide as a barn, critical hit and dodge percentages are huge; even aoe’s can be completely dodged or be complete critical hits. Blight, bleeding, and disease resistances similarly operate on an all-or-nothing percentage basis. The net result is that your careful strategic choices, character development plans, and painstaking expenditures have very little bearing on success or failure. Your awesome high-hp crusader could be killed from full health by the very first group of enemies you encounter on a dungeon run before you even get a turn. This is true of *any* group of enemies you encounter, whether the first or the 20th, whether you’ve been dominating all of them or not, whether you’ve made wise choices or simply clicked on whatever skill seemed cool at the time. I don’t mind punishing difficulty when it can be circumvented by skill and strategy (e.g., Dark Souls; XCOM), but neither of those traits need apply here.\n\nBecause of this, it feels less like a game and more like a spectator sport. You’re on a rollercoaster, watching various heroes die. There isn’t any significant progression in strength, and micromanaging the various traits becomes a chore because really, what does it all matter? The repetitive runs through the dark dungeons yield nothing permanent or tangible. Worse, there is never any doubt that you’ll prevail eventually; throw enough heroes at it and eventually the dungeon will divulge its secrets through sheer numerical luck. The feelings of difficulty and danger *aren’t even real*.  Perhaps this will change through development, but I doubt it. The game designers seem to have embraced randomness as difficulty instead of more complex gameplay mechanics. But, that’s life – sometimes your lead programmer is fearless but flatulent, your head designer has photomania and misanthropy, while your story writer is lazy-eyed, a clutch hitter, and a known cheat. If only they could have assembled the perfect team… but life just doesn’t work that way. Maybe video games should, though.","July 28, 2015","false","23.5"," 37 of 63 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","37","63","5","0"

Now, when starting the game it is just very random.  You absolutely have to have several full groups that can all hit the same level dungeons since they go mad so very easily they will never be able to run more than one mission in a row.  But how many characters you have and their classes are luck of the draw.  Wrong hand?  You lost.  Oh, but it will take you hours before we let you know that you lost already.  The game feels balanced against a best-case-scenario player, it has been made hard enough for the guy who has memorized every system and is willing to grind, grind, grind until the dice roll in their favor and they get a run of easy missions long enough to build up their troops.\n\nI am not that guy.  So, for now I am going from thumbs up to thumbs down.  Hope some work goes into making the game harder to actually PLAY rather than hard to get lucky at.","September 8, 2015","false","63.5"," 38 of 65 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","38","65","3","0"

As it stands today - If the nature of the horrid gameplay isn't clear, I'll try to explain: Roll a 6-sided dice.  If you get a 1, some character you have will horribly and inexplicably die in one turn before you can act due to monster crits or stress bombs. If you get a 2, some random and unavoidable effect in battle or in the environment will basically force you out of play into a town with fewer resources and more afflictions.  3-5 you may be able to progress a room, maybe a few!, before again being the victim of traps, environment blockage, or randomly scaled mobs that have one of the paper-rock-scissors skill that ruin your party no matter what.  A 6, followed by another 6 and you may beat a quest allowing you to recover maybe 25% of the damage and cost it took you to get there.  And all this while having slow, interrupted, low-interaction gameplay watching animations on how screwed your characters are.\n\nI get challenge.  I like challenge.  But if all I wanted out of an experience was to be punished with no skill dependency or possibility of success, I'd just study more tax law.  I get the dark nature of the game and trying to create the horror and detachment from your characters by unavoidably killing and maiming them along the way.  But this game has created 2 conflicting goals that make it a failure - on one side, trying to encourage role playing, progression, and advancement for a player, and on the other side destroying that progression by beating the player into submission by making resource acquisition and advancement so temporary and volatile both positively and negatively that you might as well just be fighting a low-variability random number generator.  The way the game stands today, just throw a fresh party into the grinder every week in the hopes you'll get a lucky loot drop early on before they die horribly and randomly.  There are ways to mask, and even make fun, the second aspect that this game has not grasped yet or evidently ruined from past versions.\n\nBuyer's remorse at this point.","August 7, 2015","false","8.5"," 39 of 67 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","39","67","4","0"

But, as far as execution goes, this otherwise great game is broken.\n\nFirst off, the difficulty is a huge problem - and this is coming from a guy whose favorite games are Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, and Xcom. The difference between those games and Darkest Dungeon is that, while those games are punishing, they are also fair. There is nothing fair about Darkest Dungeon. There is nothing fair about fighting a roomful of standard enemies and to inexplicably miss every attack while they hit you with four consecutive criticals. This happens all the time, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. Bring your max-leveled team with fully upgraded skills, equipment, and trinkets, and you will still be decimated by random dice rolls. I wonder how random it truly is, though, since the odds of such catostrophically bad series of rolls are pretty astronomical, yet seem to happen pretty frequently.\n\nThe other problem related to the difficulty is the stress, quirks, and disease mechanics. Every mission your heroes undertake give them a certain amount of stress, negative personality traits, and diseases that severely effect their performance. It is, like everything in Darkest Dungeon, random. So, if it costs 4,000 gold to provision for a mission, the mission rewards you 7,000 gold, but you must spend 4,000 gold to cure the stress, diseases, and negative quirks your heroes picked up over the mission, you're left with a net loss of 1,000 gold and unable to provision for the next mission. Your only choices are to quit the game, or send a team into the next mission with no supplies (guaranteed death). Even if you play perfectly, eventually you will get some bad rolls of the dice and see total financial ruin.\n\nThis is mitigated somewhat by the ability to sell trinkets collected during the mission... which is where the bugs come in. For some reason, I am suddenly unable to access the trinket menu, so not only can I not access this crucial financial resource, but I cannot give my characters vital equipment. I haven't recieved word from Red Hook's tech support about this yet, but the game is already hard enough without bugs and glitches making it impossible to manage your characters' inventories.\n\nOh and I feel I should mention the new corpse mechanic. It's awful. It's a transparent and artificial attempt at further increasing the difficulty. Basically, when you kill an enemy, it's corpse stays on the battlefield and blocks your ability to hit enemies behind it. Because it makes total sense that my team of heroes who leap around smiting foes with magic swords can't just step over the body of a dead maggot to attack their enemies. Nope, it makes much more sense that you'd have to spend a round fully dismembering a corpse before you can attack the enemy standing two feet behind it.\n\nWhat a disappointment. Red Hook has the makings of a truly great game, but the random catastrophic events, the bugs, and the unfair difficulty make it practically unplayable.","November 8, 2015","false","186.1"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","34","58","3","1"

To push an adventure gone bad just a little bit farther, to get through just one more room and somehow eek out that victory after losing your healer in the 3rd fight feels so satisfying.\n\nThis game will challenge you.

Then the Devs just listen* to the most hardcore of the hardcore players on the forums who complained that the game was "too easy" - whether it was true or not, I don't know.\n\nAll I know now is that the game is RNG heavy and too difficult and frustrating to waste my time on anymore.\n\nIt's a shame really.\n\n\n\n* - obviously my opinion here, I have no special insight on who the Devs listen to, if they listen to anyone at all.  My experience in following this game, was to see a very few people here complain about the game being too easy - and the next thing I know the Devs are adding things like corpses that are essentially cover for the other enemies - and for the longest time, you could miss those corpses.  Thanfully they changed that.\n\nIt used to be that even if your stress got maxed out - you could possibly press on if you were near the end of the dungeon -  then they added heart attacks into the game, so if that goblet splash keeps hitting you for 20 to 30 stress damage, while my Jester heals for 1 to 2 stress damage...  pressing on is just not an option if you value your characters.\n\nThen they added permanent negative traits which cost a large fortune for a chance to remove them...\n\nI really feel like the game has amazing potential, a wonderful atmosphere, beautifully dark art, and clever writing.  Lately reading the patch notes reads like a list of forthcoming nut punching and I just don't like getting punched in the nuts anymore.","November 21, 2015","false","30.8"," 77 of 139 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","77","139","9","3"

There's a mechanic that has been added to hero stress since I played last, which feels like a massive kick in the teeth at this point. Now not only do characters max out their stress bar and develop what is usually a mental illness or other negative character trait that requires time and money to cure, but the maxed out bar can now fill up a second time and give the character a heart attack if it fills the bar again. And now there are corpses left to keep enemy positions the same, whereas before they would move up when allies died. You have to go through their hit points again (if you want to waste your already precious time) to get rid of them. I'm sorry, but... whuh?\n\nSo... now the game is pretty much unplayable. It was already frustrating when it took a lot of time to mash groups of garbage heroes through dungeons and chuck them after, waiting until there was enough money to take my good groups into dungeons so they could finally get some xp (which is literally THE strategy for getting anywhere in this game)... now it's just gratuitous punishment and a complete waste of time.

The system offers gamers the chance to play and submit feedback on the games development. Despite the unfinished quality, Darkest Dungeon is quickly becoming one of the greatest phenomena of the early access system and became the most prominent February sales on the platform, winning the top sold on Steam for weeks on end.\n\nRead the full review here: http://www.designbombs.co.uk/darkest-dungeon-early-access-review/","June 25, 2015","true","6.1"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","35","60","2","0"

Buy if one sale.\n\nLong version:  Darkest dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler.  You recruit heros and try to level them up (with varying degrees of sucess) in the various dungeons.  Completing a quest/foray will give your guys some loot.  All pretty standard stuff.\n\nLike pretty much all RPG's, you will spend a lot of time grinding through dungeons, trying to level up characters.  In this game, it feels much more like a meat grinder.  Your characters WILL die, and the time and money you invested in each one will be lost.  Sometimes you wont have a choice but to send a team of expendables down on a suicide mission to gather that little bit of loot for your prime rib characters.\n\nMost of the game's fun is here, managing a roster, choosing upgrades, saving gold to build an effective budget team to tackle bosses.  It's essentially football manager, Rogue Cathulu style.\n\nThere is a definite muffin top to the game.  Once you get your guys get strong enough to do high level missions, collect the right trinkets, and upgraded all the buildings, you can really start crushing the game and building a fortune.  You start getting fat (stacks).  Personally I enjoy this.  What's the point of grinding it out if the rewards don’t help?  In all fairness though some of your currency does become useless, (all non-gold currency is pretty much worthless when you've upgraded all buildings)\n\nUnfortunately the pendulum of updates has swung to the side of (personally) too hard/not fun.  That comfortable muffin top has just shrunk a whole bunch, and a lot of people are butt hurt over the whole thing.  That being said, the DD developers have been very receptive (on the whole) to the community, and I for one have faith they will fix it eventually.  Right now I'm just waiting around for the tide to turn so I can get my Level 6's off the bench again and into the game.\n\nIf certain things get fixed or added, i would change to a buy at full price.  As it is though, pick up this game at 50% off.  It's worth the price at $10. $20 seems a bit much unless you are a REALLY big fan of Dungeon Crawling RPG's.\n\nSome big pros:\n-Stylistic game, cool looking characters, dungeons, etc.\n-some diversity between characters.\n-receptive Devs who appear to genuinely care what the community say/think.  (they haven't grown large ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of their forheads yet at least)\n-interesting story line,\n-narrator’s voice is chocolate fun times.\n\nSome big Cons:\n-Recent updates put a damper on things. (corpses suck. protection is the devil, new trinks are useless)\n-Major content still missing. (currently 2 dungeons of the 5 total not here including the actual Darkest dungeon)\n-Some lack of characters/enemies.  Characters of the same class are exactly the same.  (i expect enemies at least to be added slowly over time to an acceptable number)\n\nThings I want added:\n-Customizable towns.  (gives me something to do with my hard earned seals, crests, etc.)\n-Heros that feel more like individuals rather than being defined so much by their class.  (I'm not lying, class IS hero, there is no difference between 2 same level, same class characters)\n-Some reversion of recent Corpse, Trink, Prot upgrades.\n-Obviously those 2 new zones.\n-More enemies, more champs, etc.\n-More narrator voice, because it's awesome.\n-Buff that PD! (just make her stun 4 instead of 2, same with plague grenade, and/or a 1 person crit buff.)\n-also different gendered characters?","August 18, 2015","true","141.7"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","35","60","0","2"

Problem is the RNG/difficulty gives absolutely no way of counter playing. Literally, if you get a bad RNG in a dungeon prepare to start over and throw 15+ hours down the drain. It wouldn't be so bad if there was some form of progression, but once your top team dies you are set so far behind in gold and supplies you will really never recover.\n\nUsing crushing RNG as fulcrum for "difficulty" just feels like a cope out from the devs. Enemies and bosses have SOME unique mechanics, but very little encourage any kind of thoughtful counterplay. As I said earlier, if you get ambushed (RNG), and all the ambush party's abilities crit/hit(RNG again), you pretty much lose by no fault of your own.\n\nAgain, the art style and set up is amazing.

Though the development team is ambitious they do not always think through what they do. The prime example I have currently is an issue with 'heart attacks'. When your stress level reaches 200% your unit instantly dies (Without chance of save) from a heart attack. The problem is this, in the same turn, causes every other unit to face a significant raise in stress, so if you have a 200%, 180%, 160%, and 140% your entire squad will instantly die, more than likley, here is why:\n\nNote: the average boost when a unit dies (From my observation is roughly 20pts)\n[Unit reaches 200%]\nUnit #1 dies, Unit #2 raises from 180 to 200, unit #3 raises from 160 to 180, unit 4 raises from 140 to 160.\n[Unit reaches 200%]\nUnit #2 dies, unit #3 raises from 180 to 200, unit #4 raises from 160 to 180\n[Unit reaches 200%]\nUnit #3 dies, unit #4 raises from 180 to 200\n[Unit #4 dies]\n\nThe reason this is a critical flaw is it kills end game potentials. You hold a high potential to see 30-50% stress raises from single attacks at level 4-6 character's fights. With no adequate way to mitigate or avoid this from occuring you will see characters youve spent training instantly die to an unavoidable enemy called 'stress'. Though the basic mechanics are great, and the game starts very, very strong, I cannot say that it ends so.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that provides 8-12 hours of great fun, then this is certainly your game. If you're looking to complete a game and reach its end state with enjoyment, then it is not.","August 2, 2015","false","154.2"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","29","49","5","0"

However I just don't really give a single ♥♥♥♥ right now.\n\nYes, yes Darkest Dungeon is a hard game. You can expect RNG to ruin a run, that your heroes are expendable, and that you know all of this to be true right when you buy the game. This does not change the fact that when all your hours of progess results in a monumental loss that makes your entire campaign trashed thats when I draw the line. Let me explain the absolute trainwreck that was my latest campaign.\n\nSee this was actually my second campaign after my short introductory one that I fully conceded failed on my behalf. So I set off on the next one and I'm doing fantastic, it's going great. However a simingly mundane roadblock comes right out of nowhere putting my entire strategy in jepordy. Party members LV3 or above can't enter any dungeons below their level, even against bosses. *WHAT*?! So since the game doesn't tell me this absolutely massive detail my entire strategy is in upheaval. Well, I say to myself thats really big, but I can push past this. I've got plenty of time to build my forces, getting high LV 2s (but not too high) for bosses and a LV 3 team for veteran runs.\n\nWhile doing this I ran into an astonishingly bad development choice surronding ambush mechanics on medium/ long dungeons. When camping you have the option to eat, heal, and stress heal which is a life saver. The kicker is that you have a chance of being ambushed after camping where the game arbitrary takes away all your torch light, even though camping firewood gives you 100 light while surprsing nearly every party member. For those uninitiated when you have low torch light enemies do faaaaaar more damage, you gain stress at a much higher rate, and when you are surprised enemies get a whole free turn to attack. So after camping and getting everyone to full HP on two seperate occasions I lost a total of 1-2 party memebers to low level mobs since they all decide to gang bang the healer or what have you. Oh and don't even think about using a torch because when ambushed you can't use torches, DUH, obviously!\n\nBut despite all that I had done it, 6-9 party members all at LV 3 a complete truimph. Persevering despite the horrific odds that's what Darkest Dungeon is all about!\n\nOh I just failed both of my 2 raids to LV 3 dungeons along with my priceless trinckets... Well, it would have been nice if I could've leveled them up before entering the meat grinder, but ehehe that's not how this game wants you to play. In my latest failure ending just about 30 minutes ago I suffered 3 crits in a row, rabies, 2 occultist heals resulting in 0 HP with characters on death's door, and 3 misses since the veteran enemies have higher dodge + HP, accumulating in a complete wipe.\n\nYou know I was ready to give this a complete and undivided recommendation. I loved it even while I hated it, and with so many games holding your hand to an obessesive degree Darkest Dungeon was truly refreshing. Plus its a game that handles its Lovecraftian atmosphere and world perfectly with gameplay reflecting that. However there is just so many times you can handle what feels like the game blatently cheating you over on factors you have no control over. So while this review might be unrecommended there is certainly a ton of value to be had, just be warry of the Darkest RNG.","January 5","false","36.8"," 44 of 78 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","44","78","6","2"

A game of managing your risk and working hard with your team of Heroes against a terrible evil.\n\nThen we players made the big mistake in Red Hook's eyes. We learned how to do exactly what they "expected" of us, and began posting guides so we could help new players beat the game too.\n\nRed Hook proceeded to jump up the Random Number Generator of the game until, honestly, your efforts mean nothing. No amount of preparations has any observable effect anymore, and they've stooped to micromanaging player strategies in the name of their "vision". Namely, that everything is on a dice roll and preparations against the terrors below is a farce.\n\nI was fooled by their responsiveness. But responsiveness in the forums also means ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS. It took outside media attention and serious damage to their sales to make key and very controversial changes to their game optional, and Red Hook is becoming increasingly...dismissive of their players.\n\nHardcore gamers will hate the utterly arbitrary RNG that is designed, DESIGNED to deny any efforts on your part for success. Everyone else will hate the inability to actually win anything.\n\nDon't be fooled by the "easy" low level dungeons. Red Hook knows what its done, so they made sure the first 2 hours of gameplay seemed quite reasonable and easy so you couldn't refund it when you got to the harder dungeons.\n\nDon't let them lie to you. Don't buy this game. Looks, music, ideas aside, it's not fun. At all.\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is this game's greatest crime. Doesn't matter how pretty something is, if a game isn't fun there's no point to it.","December 9, 2015","false","173.0"," 83 of 152 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","83","152","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DamarusRex/recommended/262060/","DamarusRex","DamarusRex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DamarusRex/","57 products in account","I follow the game since it's been spotlighted even before arriving in steam EA. I finally got it last year, I don't know when exactly but I play at least since april. Thing is, I don't play often. Actually out of my total 75h of playing, I easely played 50h before summer.\nI don't want to start my review as is, but here it is : I liked the game "before". Back in april/may, I could only talk about DD to my friends, because it was a big deal for me. Telling truth I got the game because I'm a turn-based rpg fan. But all the squirks, dialogs, lore, classes specs, village upgrades, and even the rng (back then) was all I loved about the title. The identity was there anyway.\nBack then, DD was fairly controlable, with some bad luck at times. Sometimes some very bad luck i must say. But it was part of the game! And it felt fun! I could talk about how my lvl3 vestal died starving in middle of a corridor cuz I ain't no food anymore! About my alchoholic highwayman havng not much acc and failing 90% of his shot, my knight afraid of the dark, etc. I made myself kind of a picture of those characters in a dark humorous way, and it was great!\nSo many stories to share. And yet, I could, sometime, manage dungeon till the end, losing 1 or 2 dudes in the process. I felt the game was like kind of a fair trade and it was addictive somehow. My main goal was to lvl max my favorite characters. It was hard enough to me.\n\nBut today the game is about how to lose an entire team after 1 or 2 fights, thanks to the mad RNG, the stats nerf, the stress augmentation and the enemies luck. I get the game is about how terrible a quest can turn for your characters, but there is a "can" in this sentence. It tells you then that it can aslo NOT be so bad. So not only the game is gone into "every single quest will be a pain in the @ss from now on" (not joking, my % of success went down and down for the very same quests since last spring), but it also gets the player rid of any control of what is happening. Your character should be alright with his lvl 6 stats and equipped items? Nooooo let's get him the worst possible scenario, because RNG is more important than the choices you made for your character. So characters have stats and skills, but in the end they are not relevant for you can't decently plan anything to happen "almost" as expected. Your most violent warrior can become a ♥♥♥♥♥ and your vestal can destroy suns for wtf reason.\nIt's not the problem that bad things happen, I loved the game for that. The problem is that it always happen, to the point you have nothing left to enjoy anymore! Even victory tastes like crap most of the time. The fun in DD is dead within 6 months.\n\nSo to make it simple : the game, to me, went from a :\n50% lucky stuff 50% bad stuff\nTo a\n10% lucky stuff 90% bad stuff happening (without logical reason, I repeat).\nYou can't count on characters specs, skills, stats, items and strategies these days, it's all up to randomness, even in the easiest dungeon. Everything can happen to you, but be sure it's gonna be bad no matter how you know the game.\nIt's not harder, it's more non-sense. It's less controlable. You lose for more reasons than before, you surrender more quickly and more often. You earn less things and need to farm madly to save what's left from your previous disasters. The game never rewards the player in the way I didn't smile since June while playing it! It's only about frustration and guilt. I only play here and then to see what's up and it's sad to said it is not the fun game I used to spend my life on.\n\nTL;DR : game went from enjoyable, memorable, fun and strategic to some lifeless russian roulette for the sake of difficulty poorly executed and understood. Needs a lot of balancing until it might justify it's price. DD was one of my favorite game experience ever, but it's one of the most disappointing now.","January 19","false","91.8"," 275 of 516 people (53%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","53","275","516","15","53"

No, it is hard because of RNG, like most roguelike games. In combat, there is nothing to tell you who is going first. Sure, you could look at every party member's speed rating and every enemy's speed rating, but wouldn't it be easier to tell the player so he can plan, and not rely on RNG?\n\nThe game has extreme difficulty spikes, often wiping your entire party out even when they enter a boss battle with full health / no stress because of.. reasons. Enemies get two or three turns per round, and can often wipe your whole party in the FIRST TURN. Losing characters is a part of roguelikes, but this game has far too many cheap deaths to make their deaths feel as though you did something wrong.\n\nThe hunger mechanic is broken. I just fed each of my party members to recover some health, WHY are they hungry, and why is the only option to starve?  Why can I not chose who starves, and instead feed the party members who I want?\n\nThe game prevents you from having any veterans, as those who get to the higher levels are often loaded with disproportionate amounts of negative quirks, making it so it would be more cost effective to toss them out than to heal their injuries. There is no out-of-combat healing system aside from food, and for some reason bandages don't heal your wounds?\n\nRanting aside, the game has a lot of potential and is already really fun. I don't recommend it because by it's nature it is the pure embodiment of blind RNG. When you finish a level, it does not feel rewarding because you feel as though you've gotten lucky. When you fail a level, or lose all your party members, it is often because you feel cheated by the game.\n\nAlso there are some critical glitches that absolutely destroy your save. Since the game autosaves after each action, if you are stuck in a loop where you can't get back to town / it crashes during certain stages of combat, you are forced to watch as hours of your time are thrown away. Pretty terrible, but it's early access and I guess they'll fix it.","February 10, 2015","false","9.2"," 180 of 336 people (54%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","54","180","336","21","13"

I wanted to be someone who enjoyed it despite all the critisms I read before buying it. The randomness isn't my problem, really- it's the game being able to completely ruin you without any input on your part. Too many times I've set out to a dungeon and the first battle someone is killed before I even have a chance to react. The gold system is frustrating, and some of the currency seems pointless because it needs the same amount of another currency always. Why can't you keep the items you don't use each week? That makes little to no sense to me. I love the hero classes, the art, the voices, the abilities, the items- but the game is just far too cruel in some ways. Watching a hero die before I even get to make any choices or actions is really frustrating, and ruins a whole game week- because 3 heroes is a massive handicap and you're doomed to retreat or die soon into the dungeon. Another thing that was frustrating is finally getting to camp, and then being attacked for it so you lose all the health, stress reduction, and other benefits of camping. A couple times I've ended up worse for camping. I really like what I see from the devs of this game, I've gone back and read a lot of the updates and such- so I'm sure they'll iron it out they seem very committed but honestly, at the moment, I don't recommend this game.","January 7","false","24.1"," 47 of 84 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","47","84","6","0"

I got it because I loved watching livestreams of it, and on my first day, neither of my starting characters made it to town, and my new party wiped on their third mission. After that, I didn't really play anymore, but I still paid attention to its development and still loved to watch the streams. But over time, I noticed that the game was getting worse and worse as it got longer. In the state where I first took interest, with just the Ruins, Warrens, and Weald, the amount of content and difficulty scale overall seemed ideal. The introduction of the Cove seemed to stretch things a little thin, but I was still willing to overlook that because as a work of art, this game is beyond outstanding. The art, the atmosphere, the voice work, the character and enemy design, it's all pretty close to perfect.\n\nAnd then... the Darkest Dungeon came out, with that more than quadrupling the amount of grind present in the game - starting with quadruple because of the dungeon's unique mechanic: having to be beaten four times with completely different parties, and actually being much worse because RNG at Darkest difficulty level is *horribly* stacked, virtually guaranteeing a huge number of failed runs and deaths for each actual success. And at that point, this game went from cruelly hard to virtually unplayable.\n\nOh, it wasn't all the Darkest Dungeon's fault. To some extent, it just seems that every new feature added to this game only serves to make it more punishing, the most notable example being the horrible disease system that doubles the number of debilitating penalties a hero can suffer from, but that was the final nail in the coffin. This used to be one of the games I was most proud to have in my library, even if I was too much of a chicken to play it much myself. But these days... you need to ask yourself, is it worth trying to play a game that requires dozens of hours playing through the same content over and over, getting continually screwed by the RNG in the process? This game isn't 'random' in the usual sense of the word - you don't get a streak of good rolls and win, because luck only carries so far before its benefits are removed or canceled out. We're not talking about beating a hard mission once, we're talking about farming them to truly gain ground. The only randomness here? Whether or not you'll make it through each grinding session without having your progress completely set back again.\n\nAs a work of art, this game deserves a spot in a museum, and to have classes of college students studying it and writing papers on it. As a game... it's not a game, it's just grim, soul-crushing, uphill toil. I suppose, considering its subject matter and intended effect on the player, that this is only fitting.","May 29","false","5.7"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","18","29","0","0"

As a reality ensues version of a dungeon crawler, it succeeds amazingly. Alot of minor things may not be explained at first, and some things that work you may not even try because of thinking about what you can do, because you think of it as a game and dont try something you would do irl (see using bandages as handwraps for investigating a kniferack).\n\nThe heros are varied and never seem to be just carbon copies of eachother, and the position based strategy like combat is fun and interesting. But be careful that the stress doesnt get to even you, rushing your judgement and making mistakes as a consequence of stress, again, that stress based mechanic is well implemented, an amazingly interesting theme, and adds alot to the gameplay. Though some might find the RNG a bit too powerful.\n\nThe game leaves an impression when you just look at it that it will be overcomplicated but really its not, its the same effect as FTL, a cursory glance at the variety of features gives an illusion of overcomplication. Certain moves work in certain positions, and you remember them reasonably well, and some are more suited for the front or back of your lineup due to being a tanking melee or a healer/ranged for instance. The stress makes you go insane at first and eventually a heart attack, but camping, jesters, critical hits, disarming traps and sometimes kills heal it, with a bit of skill its not that bad. They can get negative traits to debuff them that cost a bit of money to remove, and you take them to buildings to upgrade armor and moves and relieve stress. Even the trinkets I found to be relatively intuitive, upsides and downsides use them to buff or compensate, try not to leave to big a weakness, at the very least stuff like the blight stones and archers rings are easily understood.\n\nThe game doesnt ever tell you what you feel, despite what some may think, it tells you what they feel, and they can get stressed, go mad and have heart attacks. Stress can feel like more of a danger than the health, as its alot harder to cure. Death functions a bit differently, if someone loses all their health they go onto "Death's Door", where they theoretically could live forever, but every hit could strike them down, basically its a 67% chance that they dont die forever every time, and bleeding and blight count as hits every time they activate. Do you keep risking the fight? Do you abandon the mission to save them lest they die forever. I'm about to explain why you should care about just another Vestal or Crusader, but heres how camping works first, you get 12 "Time" Everyone has 3 camping skills at once, each requires time, they can grant buffs, stress heal, and heals, you use firewood granted on longer missions to camp, you can be ambushed while you camp every once in awhile with lower light, messing up your lineup, etc. Now, onto individuality.\n\nThe game is also very good about letting you have time to care even with minimal individual traits. Theres 7 different possible camping and combat moves which you can unlock and upgrade for customization. You can switch them from a few palette swaps, change their names. Upgrade weapons armor, equip trinkets. Despite being just another Vestal the positive and negative quirks grant a bit of functional not just aesthetic individuality. Sheer force of time lets you humanize and invest in them. You give a ♥♥♥♥ if they die. Though its not only possible but profitable to get a ton of new guys for free, throw them in a mission with barely any supplies, let them go insane and die, grab a ton of money and things like Busts, Crests, Portraits and Deeds (what you use to upgrade the town) and fire them neglecting to cure their diseases and psychological damage, as thats not free. You monster.\n\nOne thing I neglected to mention is the light, you use torches to keep the lights higher, as lights high, you have a higher chance of scouting around and knowing whats around you on the map ahead of time, suprising enemies, and everyone friend or foe gets less crits. But you get less treasure and cause less crits. Lower light gets more treasure, your less likely to scout and more likely to be suprised, and theres more treasure. By the way, Crits you deal stress heal, Crits that hurt you cause stress.\n\nFor some the darker tone reaches Narm Charm levels, personally I disagree, but its a subjective thing. The game switches between saying the world is ♥♥♥♥, or the world is ♥♥♥♥ but not beyond redeeming. Alot of your party isnt exactly noble. Bounty Hunters, Grave Robbers, Occultists, Crusaders, Highwaymen. Some only seek payment, they arent all in it for the heroism. People die and stay dead, the art styles appealing and gloomy, the whole stress mechanic and reality ensues theme isnt exactly idealistic.\n\nThe animations isnt that present, when you attack it switches their images, centers them in the middle of the screen enlarged, and tilts the camera. Some might call that simpler style a problem, but personally it could easily be considered a stylistic choice and they make it work VERY well. the art style is definitely pleasent to look at, and its definitely easy to run because of it. So *I* consider it a positive, but dont expect to many extravagent animations, but frankly making something like that a dealbreaker especially when the game isnt even ugly is a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid desicion.\n\nUltimately it has interesting mechanics, intergrates gameplay and story masterfully, has an interesting theme, tons of replayability, and its just really fun to play and really easy to get invested in. For those of you concerned about whether or not to get it yet cause its in early access, waiting till full release I can understand, wanting the whole experience all at once yknow, but if you dont care, its definitely interesting, well put together and fun, even in early access. Its worth buying as it is NOW, is what im saying. I recommend it.\n\nAlso the musics well done. As the light gets darker the music gets more intense or chaotic, you can hear more unnerving ambience in the background. The tracks strings can really capture the stress of your situation. It composition covering the seriousness of every encounter. The music of your Estate is soft and sad, but not hopeless. The lighter keys making you feel at least like you have a chance.","June 8, 2015","true","80.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

You barely make enough gold on a success to heal off the stress and unsustainable quirks from your last run, effectively breaking even.  A failure may cause you to lose several heroes you have invested many hours into.  I spent significant time learning the game's mechanics and increasing my chances, but it still just takes a few bad rolls of the RNG to burn it all down.  It's easy to party wipe in the final stages leading to a loss of 30+ hours, often out of your control due to the random factor.\n\nIt's inexcusable that Darkest Dungeon does not have an easier setting for players just starting to learn the mechanics.  Early mistakes will put you in the hole and often force you to abandon those heroes.\n\nEven though many parts of the game are phenomenal, like the art, music and combat system, I cannot recommend it due to the oppressive chance-based difficulty.

It fails to live up to its potential as an interesting roguelike, or RPG. The shallow gameplay simply doesn't provide the entertainment and replayability, that other, good games of these genres offer:\n\n- Dungeon-crawling and the tactical combat quickly become repetitive.\n- There is no real story, interactions, or meaningful choices. The "world" feels very static.\n- Leveling up and managing your characters is not fun.\n\n- Superb art style and audio.\n\nThe single good thing about this game is the excellent art and presentation. It captures the depressing, horror atmosphere, although some of the very illogical, random gameplay elements detract from this and make the atmosphere frustrating and tedious instead.\n\nThe psychological stress system, which was one of the most hyped aspects of the game also falls short: Stress is pretty much just a second HP bar, watching a character go insane is totally unfun, and all the quirks and traits they acquire are completely randomized. There is no psychology, no cause and effect, it's all randomness and grinding for gold, in order to regularly remove stress and quirks.\n\nI have finished the game, it takes about 50 hours from a fresh start, without guides.

I enjoyed the game a lot, at first. As the game went on longer, I saw my motivation fading, due to a real lack of reason for success. This may sound vague so far, and many reviews cover the points completely and eloquently. I will therefor use an analogy.\nDarkest Dungeon: Live Action Role Play Version\nStep 01: Find a six-sided die (dice)\nStep 02: Find a friend\nStep 03: Find a playing surface, such as a table\nStep 04: Roll the die on the playing surface\nStep 05: Since you are a "beginner" at this point in the game, rolling an even number is safe and you "progress." If the number is odd, however, your "friend" kicks you in the groin as hard as he or she can.\nStep 06: If you happened to roll an even number, you get a second roll. If you roll a two, you get a magical "cup." This "cup" can be worn for groin protection. The "cup" is also ringed with spikes on the exterior. These spikes are aimed at the inside of your legs. Now you can protect the groin, but the area around it will be painfully shredded in the process.\nStep 07: Regardless of which number is rolled, if at any time you vomit, you lose. If you lose, you have one day to recover and must return to Step 01 the next day.\nStep 08: If you rolled an even number, and disregarding the outcome of Step 06, you now move onto the "Intermediate" or "Veteran" difficulty. On this difficulty level, roll the die again. If you roll a 1 or 2, you are safe and can move onto the next difficulty level. If you roll a 3, 4, 5, or 6, your friend kicks you in the groin as hard as he or she can. Same rules apply to recovery.\nStep 09: If you rolled a 1 or 2, you are now on the highest difficulty level. This being said, you get to roll the die once more. If you roll anything other than a 6, your friend kicks you as hard as he or she can in your groin.\nStep 10: If you managed to roll a 6, congratulations. Your reward? You don't get kicked in the groin. If your roll resulted in groin kicking, go back to step 01 after one day of rest.\nStep 11: If at any time you don't enjoy this game, and decide to quit, do not purchase Darkest Dungeon.","May 28","false","203.9"," 34 of 60 people (57%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","57","34","60","25","2"

Let me start off by saying the devs are extremely responsive and constantly show up in the forums. Which is a huge plus, especially for an early access game. They listen to our feedback, and are quick to fix issues within the game. Just wanted throw a kudos to Red Hook. Y'all are awesome.\n\nOn to the game now. The game is extremely high risk/high reward. Your team is low, but you've got one room left and you'll finish the quest. Do you risk it and attempt to see if the room is clear/fight the battle, or do you haul it back to town with your team in-tact and the treasure you've collected so far? There are interactable objects that can also save your run, or set you back which adds a lot to do while crawling through the dungeons. The game is extremely difficult, but in the best possible way.\n\nStarting off you're going to die, a lot. Until you learn the mechanics, learn how to build a balanced team for each dungeon. Learn how the abilities work and function. You will die, but that's ok. In Darkest Dungeon every death is a new lesson. The variety of heroes we've been given is pretty vast so far including the Grave Robber, Vestal, Occultist, Crusader, Highwayman, Hellion, Jester, and Leper. All of them work differentlky and do their jobs well.\n\nA tag you won't see on this game that is a major part of it is, Puzzle. Every fight is a puzzle of sorts, especially boss fights. They all have weaknesses and different attacks/combinations that mess up the enemies momentum and attacks. Got a dude sniping you from the back? Use Eldritch Pull to yank him to the front and knock him out. Got a Plague Doctor? Use Flash Powder to stun the back line while you eat their beefy front line leaving them open.\n\nThere is so many to go through a dungeon and it's just an all-around fantastic game. The community is very helpful and we're all learning and helping each out. If you're into difficult, but rewarding games with a dark atmosphere, and Cthulhu/Eldritch creatures, then Darkest Dungeon is the game for you.","February 3, 2015","true","29.3"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

Although it is still early access, Darkest Dungeon is well into development, has plenty of content, and is more then worth the asking price of $20.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it is just as described:  A roguelike turn-based dungeon crawler rpg.  There is a good amount of depth and strategy involved, both in and out of battles.  Choosing how to spend your money and resources on upgrades and provisions, deciding which of your heroes to bring and which of their abilities to equip,  and choosing how to act during battles and other random events, etc...\n\nThe art style is absolutely gorgeous, in a gritty, atmospheric kind of way.  The art and music come together perfectly to set a dark undertone.\n\nOh, by the way, this game is hard.  You will always be struggling in one way or another while exploring a dungeon, and very rarely does a situation play out as planned, forcing you to change tactics and make decisions one turn at a time.  Although difficult and random (as expected from a roguelike) Darkest Dungeon never feels unfair.\n\nOverall this game is super dank and earns 8/10 bomb nuggets.  The final product will likely be a 9 or 10.","February 3, 2015","true","10.3"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

The atmosphere is quite dark :)  you can actually take care about your characters  mental health, or else they go completely crazy over time.\n\nThe game gets frequent updates and the devs added some features that made the game even harder. I was suprised by a minority of vocal players who write negative reviews just because they can't adapt to gameplay changes. As the devs said it's an early access game and the actual gameplay mechanics change with each update. The developers listen to feedback seriously, with a recent update they made some features optional to calm down some players.\n\nOverall i highly recommend it it's more than worth the price.","August 20, 2015","true","142.5"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","15","24","2","0"

This wouldn't have been an issue if there were a bit more variety in the encounters or with the possible situations the game puts you into.\n\nI'm eager to see what kind of updates this game will have in the future, and I may try this game again when more content is added to make the grinding phases less tedious.","February 8","false","13.6"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","26","45","0","0"
