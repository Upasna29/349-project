The whole game is presented in an Amiga amber color with a mostly command line interface and some point and clicking.  You are presented with missions by invading companies, extracting data, and breaking computer securities by use of proxies and other tools you.  With a pretty chill electronic music sound track to go with it, I had an overall good time with this game pretending to be a hacker.  I hope you like typing.

I like the concept of hacker games. The sense of online omnipotence has a huge appeal. HOWEVER, this game actively punishes exploration. A lot of the game is trial and error. If you do not do things in order, you will have to restart. Restart the level? No, the entire game. Your penalties from previous levels carry over to the next.\n\nIf you ever feel the need to check out things off the developers predetermined path, they slap you with in game monetary penalties. ex: You see that a website called dot-hackers.net. Seems cool, right, so you go to check it out. You are penalized for looking up the website. Yes, they penalize you for LOOKING UP WEBSITES! Then they penalize you for logging on, and then they penalize you for downloading files. The only way to take away your penalties is too pay in game money. They penalize you when you make money. Every. Single. Time. So if you get the game, go ahead and save yourself some headaches and use the money cheat (xmoney) to give yourself all the money you will ever need.\n\nThe good thing about the game is that it had somewhat of a vision, but if you want a hacking game that makes you feel powerful, go with UPLINK.","April 24, 2014","false","4.3"," 173 of 215 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","173","215","4","3"

Uplink is the GTA of hacking.\nHacker Evolution is a level-based story game. Hacker Evolution is like an NES Super Mario game.\n\n\nAt first, I was upset by the lack of being able to "hack the world". But as the story progressed, I realised that this game is suppose to be a puzzle hacking game. Not to mention an interesting story and interesting ending.\n\nHere's the run down of what to expect if you are thinking of getting this game:\n\n1. You are a expert hacker which was tasked by someone to find out what caused the blackout of major business (Example: The Stock Market)\n\n2. This game has a money system which is used to upgrade and reduce trace level.\n\n3. You have a passive trace percentage, which if you reach 100%, you get caught and you'd need to restart the level.\n\n4. When you successfully hack a server, decrpt, crack, or even login, a fixed amount of passive trace is added. (Except connect)\n\n5. When you start a hack, an active trace will start. If you fail to abort the hack or hack in time, you get a huge passive trace.\n\n6. You can upgrade your 1GB memory, 1GHz ram, 1mbps modem, and no firewall, into a decent computer.\n\n7. Firewall and Ram are usually the top priority.\n\n8. You become a Money Savant. You know when to upgrade and when to keep your money to reduce trace.\n\n9. Your money, trace, and score gets moved to the next level. What ever code/exploits you store in your computer mysteriously disappears, presumably deleted for no reason.\n\n10. You have to learn the basic commands. Because most of the game is mainly typing.\n\n11. The puzzles gets harder. Sometimes your next clue is cleverly hidden. In a wall of text.\n\n12. Like the previous point, sometimes you might find a server which has and .exploit which can be used to bypass the cracking and save you tons of trace and money. Oh, and sometimes a $10,000 lying around in there.\n\n13. "Scan atm-ba" + (TAB) = "Scan atm-bankof1234567890youaregoingtoberich.bank.com"\n\n14. Apparently our technology broke the equation of the universe. Internet speed is faster than light. Now we got a Time Traveling internet.\n\n\nIf you can look at this game as a story based, puzzle level game, instead of a free-roaming rogue hacker, I can recommand Hacker Evolution. If you are looking for a rogue hacking game, try Uplink. Or if you want a story-only hacking game, which has a blood-pumping action music, you can try Hacknet.\n\nI rate this game a solid 8/10 for it's curious story, good puzzles, and long term financial planning.\nThe music is okay.","October 7, 2015","true","11.9"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","60","68","0","1"

Put it this way I actually managed to fail the tutorial twice. This can avoided by really reading everything properly! It will also probably make sense to have a notepad alongside you so you can remember the difference between commands especially decrytpt and crack.\n\nThe game is also not very forgiving as one mistake further on into a level can mean you need to start over.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/70100/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","For me, Hacker Evolution turned out to be a rather frustrating experience. There is a trace meter that tracks your trace level and when it gets to 100, you lose. The biggest problem is that you get penalized for successful cracks and decryptions which means the trace level increases even when you are doing things the right way. And the only way to decrease your trace level is through money, but they are pretty stingy on making that readily available. Not to mention they dangle a bunch of system upgrades that aren't cheap which gives a false impression that there is a lot of cash to be obtained in the game. So if you spend money on these upgrades, you end up with no money left to decrease your trace level and ultimately get stuck because you can't reduce your trace level. The manual even states, "Important: Don't rush to upgrade your hardware as soon as you have money. Having the best hardware is not the main objective of the game. Carefully make your decision, and only upgrade your hardware when necessary. Money is not abundant in the game, and its main purpose is to reduce your trace time." That key piece of information is not found anywhere in the game; you have to read it from the manual. Now why they decided to design a game that revolves around money, yet not make it abundant is not clear to me.\n\nThey don't even grant you rewards for completing missions (a little money would be nice). Instead they give you a score (why?). But the real kicker is your trace level carries over from the previous mission, so if it was high and you don't have any money, you're ♥♥♥♥ed on the next mission. What this ultimately means is you must follow a very specific path on the early missions to be able to survive the later missions. So after I figured this out, the game quickly lost any open world feel of being able to solve missions in different ways. Plus you never really know if you didn't do something right until you are stuck on a later mission with no money.\n\nI did like the graphical interface, although the actual command execution was a bit oversimplified. It was fun for a few hours, but ultimately it was the lack of a proper reward system that really turned me away from progressing further with this game. If the simulated world of Hacker Evolution sounds interesting to you, go buy Uplink. It offers a much better gaming experience.","February 21, 2013","false","0.1"," 66 of 83 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","66","83","0","3"

The Hacker Evolution series is a serious treat for the geekiest gamers. What makes it unique and positively special is that it's essentially played by in-game console commands! There are no other games I can name that utilize this as a core game mechanic. In fact, I wish Watch_Dogs played less like Grand Theft Auto and more like this.\n\nMy only complaint is that there are a number of points within levels that feel like "Guide Dang It!" Either my brain is not up to snuff, or the levels barely give a clue (if at all) on how to complete the objectives (such as figuring out the names of all the servers for each level). Fortunately, it is ridiculously easy to add content and your own levels with provided mod tools. This gets even better, because the main game levels are treated the same way, meaning they can be opened up and used as an answer key or even changed to the players' liking.\n\nThe overall scope of the game is small and simple, but it definitely uses that scale to the best measures possible.

It's a misunderstood game, I wouldn't call it puzzle because that's misleading, but it is supposed to be a hacker simulator and nothing more than that.\nMy idea of a hacker simulator (before I decided to play any, that is) is something which can be periodically frustrating as you figure out (for yourself!) what to do next. It should require thinking skills, not just point and click with a hand-holding guide. A clear set of objectives and a list of commands so you know what to type and when, and when you finally do input the right code after trying time and time again, there should be a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.\n\nHacker Evolution does not let me down on my expectations of a hacker simulator, it is exactly what ti should be. It is unforgiving if you don't do things perfectly, but because the levels themselves would actually be quite SMALL if it weren't for all the try/fail/try/fail/try/succeed that goes into it, it is supposed to be difficult! So that you're not just breezing through it, because that would be completely unrealistic. I'm not saying that it is so amazing that it is like a hacker's version of say... Microsoft Flight Simulator where all the controls that would be in an actual aircraft are available to you. Because that would mean you would have to actually learn a programming language in order to play the game. It can't be 100% realistic because no one would play it, because the only people who could actually play it would be out hacking/ cracking real computers.\n\nIn saying that, it is an exciting game with a very simple, user friendly interface. The tutorial gives you enough information to learn the mere basics, it's not there to hold your hand and coddle you when you get frustrated and tell you that it loves you like in a lot of games. As far as I can see so far there's no ability to save your progress, you just have to start the level over from scratch, which isn't that big of a deal because you can generally remember what you need to do, and when you do things right in this game, it doesn't take very long to complete the levels.\n\nOverall I'm very glad I didn't listen to a lot of these reviews which almost made me not buy the game (which is currently $2.99 on bundlestars for the ENTIRE Hackers Evolution games!). My actual point is, if you can't be bothered thinking for yourself, or feel you will have to resort to walkthroughs, then avoid this game like the plague because you won't find it very fun, because the AIM and the FUN of the game is to actually think for yourself!\n\n8.5/10 - Gameplay; fun, simple to use once you get the jist of it. Helpful tutorial, but not too helpful so that it makes the game too easy.\n7/10 - Music; the techno music is a bit of a stereotype, but it works well in the game and intensifies at just the right points which adds some nice suspense.\n7/10 - Graphics; this game isn't about graphics, but they look fancier than what I imagine real hackers/ crackers work with.\nKind of like a CTU interface from 24.\n7.5/10 - Overall rating.","September 11, 2014","true","2.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

From the very beginning, as you start the tutorial, you realize that Hacker Evolution is all about the command-line interface. This has its pros and cons, but fortunately, it all comes together quite well. Scrolling up and down in order to read through information that has since gone off the small window can be a little problematic and sometimes confusing, as you will be fishing for short lines of detailed text in order to perform various text commands. The music is constantly of the techno genre, but it is overall enjoyable after you get used to it. Being that this is the developer's first (as far as I know) effort in the hacking simulation genre, it is much more polished, much more user friendly, less cumbersome, and with far less flaws than Uplink in every way. This still means that the game play will be slow at times, and you will need to appreciate this type of game in order to enjoy it. The missions are interesting, challenging, and with personality. You actually believe that you are part of the short story in meaningful ways, and after completing each goal, there is a feeling of accomplishment and significance. The story progression makes sense and manages to remain interesting, as each level provides new challenges. Also, if you do not have enough funds at the end of each level, in conjunction with a high trace count, you will need to start the game over from the beginning, which is a very serious problem, in my opinion. If you are not careful from the very beginning, the game simply tells you "your fault, start over". Which I suppose means that it is an attempt to go along with the simulation aspect of the experience. It is trying to be as realistic as possible. All missions are exceptionally designed, and it is clear that the developer took great care and attention to detail to prepare all of them, in conjunction with the storyline. It is also valuable to point out that even though the amount of commands is limited, all missions have a different feel to them, and must be approached from different angles in order to succeed. It is amazing how much excitement is offered in this game as everything on screen is mostly text based, with the exception of the background graphic and mission briefings. It is the most engrossing and captivating hacking simulation game I have ever played, despite the fact that it does not have many competitors.

But the problem I have is with the difficulty. Let me be clear, it's not that the game is hard, it's that it's punishing. One mistake at the very beginning of the game can force you to have to restart everything 5 levels down the line. And yes, that's ONE mistake. You basically need to figure out the absolute optimal series of actions to manage to progress. There's no room for guessing, there's no room for exploring the setting, there's no room for error. It'd be much better if you could explore the levels a bit, find out about the world, and really feel like a hacker.\n\nAs far as the rest of it goes, it's really well done. Realism while still being an engaging game, and I'd definitely recommend it based on everything else.

First off I'd like to start on the negative points of the game. What really annoyed me is that you take your progress along every level, the amount of money you have and your 'global trace%'. So basically because I did something stupid in the second level of the game i had to completely restart the game in the late stage because I simply lacked the recources needed because of an earlier failure. Also I have an IT (wireless) networking background and you can tell the makers of the game did some homework, but not all of it if you have an IT background like me some little strange things can annoy you. I also understand people lacking an IT background may find this game very difficult.\n\nIn the end I did enjoy the game though there are definitely more than enough positive points to cover up the negative ones. The interface itself is really simple you may say it makes the game lack a nice graphical view, but that's not what it's made for. The interface is really overviewable and helps you especially in the early stages to pick up the game as soon as possible. I like the idea of the game, it's not really a hacking simulator offcourse it reminded me more of (very) basic scripting, but as a puzzle game it's well thought out and designed. The game offers for me a right amount of content. This isn't a game that should be 200 hours long as it would only be frustrating if you don't do any screwups like me expect somewhere between 8 - 12 hours of gameplay, depending on how quickly you pick the game up. The (included) expansion pack offers another hour of gameplay. I also like the puzzles themselves, the solution isn't often easily given, but unlike some other puzzle games I didn't run into random puzzle where you're more based on guesswork than logical thinking. Sometimes it can be a bit rough to find the answer to your question, but all puzzles have a logical and explainable solution.\n\nSo the game definitely has it flaws, but for me the positive points outweigh the negative points.

However, you're asked to investigate on 4 different problems, that seemed tied. What will you discover?\n\nHacker Evolution is perhaps a writing simulator, as you need to type the command but you need your brains to avoid to be traced and to have a game over. Sometimes, you'll need to begin a new campaign because you can't do anything but try a different manner to avoid spending too much money you've "stolen" or to add to your trace level. That's perhaps the most frustrating thing in HE.\n\nYou're going to read files, find passwords, find exploit files that will make your life easier, crack, decrypt, use your brains to know how many hosts you need, upgrade your hardware (should I add a faster modem or a better firewall or more CPU Ram?).\n\nNow, the product is stable, there was a time where exosyphen messed up with keyboards (mainly AZERTY) but they're really listening to their customers.\n\nFor the graphics, they're simple: a map, a console, your config and messages. The original one is all orange but there is a second skin, much darker, that I largerly prefer and that I used.\n\nThe best point for this game is the soundtrack, very electro/dance but very fitting. I loved it. I really loved it.\n\nHacker Evolution came with Reinsertion Pack, since then replaced by a nice mod called Operation Electrosphere.\n\n\nWhile many will whine about how it's not realistic as hacking game, I'll say: I don't care about realism.

YOU!!! you WILL get in trouble if you try this stuff if you get your hands on software like this.

It will take a while for you to get used to the game and how it works but that's enough out of me. Go enjoy the game since it's on sale. Oh and if your asking if it's worth 10 bucks normally, yes.

While the game seemed like an intresting concept the actual game is rather lackluster. The entire game is played using a console and steps are performed by inputting commands through the console. This results in both repititous gameplay and difficulty, as you will be forced to remember many different inputs from the tutorial stage, without much help afterwards. The game is also difficult for newcomers, as your wanted level is transferred from mission to mission, including even the tutorial stage. If you mess up enough on one stage you will either have to redo the mission or carry your mistakes on to the next level. You are able to pay to decrease your wanted level, but there are other things, such as cpu upgrades that you will need to spend money on to even have a chance at completing a level.

Like Uplink, you hack computers across the globe, bouncing your connection across them to help stave off the ever-looming trace. Unlike Uplink, you're not just lazily clicking everything together. You control almost everything you do via a command prompt, which I feel makes all the difference. This does mean having to learn the commands, and the tutorial teaches you next to nothing compared to what you'll need to know. Don't fret, though - it's not all that tough to pick up. Gameplay is quite interesting, involving some puzzle-solving. Oftentimes important information such as server addresses and passwords are hidden on servers, in messages, in files... and aren't always obvious. Luckily, and also unlike Uplink, the game only acts when you enter a command. You're free to take your time between actions to figure things out and plan your next move, which makes this feel more like a tactical puzzle game than a simulation. And it works. The one complaint I have is that your money and trace level carry over between levels, meaning that an error early on may not become obvious until several levels down the line when you suddenly discover you don't have the money to keep your trace from boiling over. Of course, as long as you're checking every server for loose cash and not over-upgrading, you should be fine. If you want the command line Hollywood hacker experience, I can easily suggest Hacker Evolution.","December 16, 2012","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is more of a puzzle game with a hacker theme in my opinion, but is very good and will eat hours upon hours of your day. This game also gets positive marks for two main things that i do enjoy, one is that the game is all based around the command line interface which gives it that good old fashion feel, and the other is the ability to create your own story line and your own world in a sense.

Rather, it is essentially a text adventure/puzzle game wrapped in a hacker facade.  The game is divided in to 10 chapters where you will scan websites, decrypt keys, and crack passwords in order to complete level objectives.  Puzzling out how to complete your objectives without getting traced can be quite fulfilling.  However, you will find yourself frustrated by a number of things.  Firstly, the game's tutorial and help menus are mostly useless.  They don't enumerate all of the syntax at your command, and the descriptions that do exist are unhelpful.  Once you do figure out how to actually play the game, you may find that you have played yourself in to a corner and have to restart the whole game from scratch.

Meanwhile managing the balance in your bank account, which is used not only to upgrade your computers specs, but to reduce your current trace level. If your trace level reaches 100% or you are caught decrypting or cracking a server, you lose. You can find money by locating IPs for ATM Machines, also some servers occasionally have money in them to transfer.

But is the first instalment one I can recommend? Before we go into that, let's cover all the points.\n\nThe story seems a little bit convoluted but in simple terms, a lot of crazy stuff happened in the world and it's up to Brian Spencer to find out who did it by taking the back door in, hacking computers and following leads.\n\nThe graphics are decent and also rather fitting for a hacking type game. The controls are entered into the console and you type them out, just like a real hacker. You can even upgrade your hardware and the like, which becomes very important later on in the game. The music is catchy the first time you hear it but I'm not sure if it fits in with the aesthetic. It does sound cool though.\n\nHowever, the objectives are very vague and there is very little direction on what to do next (except in the tutorial level but that doesn't really count). It's erring very dangerously on that line of frustration. Some brief guidance would help a little but just like a real hacker, that guidance isn't given. Is this a good or a bad thing? That's a bit difficult to say.\n\nWhat about the difficulty curve? More like difficulty leap. After you finish the tutorial the difficulty skyrockets. You'll definitely need a pen and paper to take notes of all the commands as well as any other important details. Plus, any 'trace' you've acquired will be carried over to the next level so one has to watch that.\n\nDoes it feel like hacking? Yes, in quite a few aspects.\nDoes it give you that slightly badass feel while playing? In a sense.\nShould you definitely buy the game? Not at full price. £6.99 is a VERY steep asking price for a game like this. On sale, buy it if you want. But full price? No.\n\nAll in all, I can just about recommend this game. But it is a very fine line. If you like a big challenge and feeling like a hacker, then go for it. If you don't have the patience or can't handle frustration, steer well clear.","December 5, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not a fast-paced shooter, nor is it an arcade puzzler. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it requires you to think.\n\n+ Bonus - Steam Trading Cards were recently added\n- Drawback - No achievements (for those who like them)\n\nThe screen is quite static - basically the same throughout the game. The plot is interesting enough. While some people get lost very quickly, pressing F2 brings up the objectives for the missions. I actually find that the objectives are too clear many times - almost a walkthrough in and of themeselves. It reminded me a lot of the old text adventure games of the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nThe basic trick here will be trying to pick the right ports to hack, as to not waste your Global Trace % (in other words, your "life meter"). Two protips that will help most players early on:\n\n1. The tutorial has quite a bit of cash available in it. Don't complete it until you've transfered everything available.\n2. Upgrade your CPU and Firewall ASAP. You can do it in the 2nd mission if you got all the cash from the tutorial.\n\nYes, it can be a tiny bit frustrating at times, if you don't open your eyes up and look for clues. Overall, though, it accomplishes what it is trying to do - simulate a hacking experience.\n\n8/10 Gameplay\n7/10 Music\n","February 10, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is true, Uplink is a better game on all accounts. The whole experience was rather mundane. The objectives of this game are rather repetitive, and can become quite bland as the game progresses. The ending in this game is rather uneventful, leaving me with a feeling of 'Is that it?'.  The 'puzzles' only get somewhat interesting in the remaining two levels, which was a further let down.\nThe mechanics of the game are certainly over simplified, giving you the ability to past through the majority of the game with just tree commands: hack; crack; killtrace. So if you were looking for a more realistic, more dynamic game, you're best off not wasting your money on this game, and just sticking with Uplink.\nDespite getting the Exosyphen bundle for a mere $5, I felt as if it wasn't really worth it.

Though really, the biggest reason why this was delayed was because I actually took some extra time to play the game that came up on the I’m-a-die-die today, Hacker Evolution by exosyphen studios, a mostly console oriented hacking game.  Now, at first glance you would think a game like this would be a somewhat boring little text based adventure game, and really that is what this, a simple concept that at its core is no different than trying to fix a busted DOS prompt before your mother finds out you’ve been messing with the autoexec files again so you can play your games with the proper soundblaster IRQ settings and accidentally the whole drive system.  However to some of us, that throwback is half the fun.  Being able to sit down with nothing but text descriptions and a little blinking cursor you find you have to use your imagination to tell half the story, while the game does a very thorough job of guiding your imagination through a rather ingeneous story, and makes the CSI-level ‘hacking’ both enjoyable and engaging, if not addicting.  This is one of those games I would like the play the whole way through, I honestly think.\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept, surprisingly.

Like Uplink, you hack computers across the globe, bouncing your connection across them to help stave off the ever-looming trace. Unlike Uplink, you're not just lazily clicking everything together. You control almost everything you do via a command prompt, which I feel makes all the difference. This does mean having to learn the commands, and the tutorial teaches you next to nothing compared to what you'll need to know. Don't fret, though - it's not all that tough to pick up. Gameplay is quite interesting, involving some puzzle-solving. Oftentimes important information such as server addresses and passwords are hidden on servers, in messages, in files... and aren't always obvious. Luckily, and also unlike Uplink, the game only acts when you enter a command. You're free to take your time between actions to figure things out and plan your next move, which makes this feel more like a tactical puzzle game than a simulation. And it works. The one complaint I have is that your money and trace level carry over between levels, meaning that an error early on may not become obvious until several levels down the line when you suddenly discover you don't have the money to keep your trace from boiling over. Of course, as long as you're checking every server for loose cash and not over-upgrading, you should be fine. If you want the command line Hollywood hacker experience, I can easily suggest Hacker Evolution.","December 16, 2012","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A 'Hacker Detective Mystery', which blends both puzzle and sim genres into the gameplay. The gameplay is objective based, and involves hacking other systems looking through files, finding clues, downloading/uploading/deleting important files, and locating new IPs to hack to complete your objectives. Meanwhile managing the balance in your bank account, which is used not only to upgrade your computers specs, but to reduce your current trace level. If your trace level reaches 100% or you are caught decrypting or cracking a server, you lose. You can find money by locating IPs for ATM Machines, also some servers occasionally have money in them to transfer. While hacking in the game is simplified, it still does take time to learn the commands. There is a tutorial, also typing HELP will bring up a list of commands when needed.

For those who are confused about gameplay, then I can describe it this way: You use actual commands to discover information hidden on servers in order to reveal information on other servers.  You will type commands into the console like CRACK, SCAN, BOUNCE, DECRYPT, TRANSFER, UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD, and KILLTRACE in an attempt to not only steal information from companies about recent cyber attacks, but also steal exploits and viruses from hackers themselves in order to TRANSFER funds to your account from other companies or orginizations that you can use to upgrade various components of your computer such as your GPU and memory, which allow for faster decryption and cracking speed and more files to be stored on your computer.

Though really, the biggest reason why this was delayed was because I actually took some extra time to play the game that came up on the I’m-a-die-die today, Hacker Evolution by exosyphen studios, a mostly console oriented hacking game.  Now, at first glance you would think a game like this would be a somewhat boring little text based adventure game, and really that is what this, a simple concept that at its core is no different than trying to fix a busted DOS prompt before your mother finds out you’ve been messing with the autoexec files again so you can play your games with the proper soundblaster IRQ settings and accidentally the whole drive system.  However to some of us, that throwback is half the fun.  Being able to sit down with nothing but text descriptions and a little blinking cursor you find you have to use your imagination to tell half the story, while the game does a very thorough job of guiding your imagination through a rather ingeneous story, and makes the CSI-level ‘hacking’ both enjoyable and engaging, if not addicting.  This is one of those games I would like the play the whole way through, I honestly think.\n\nGame’s Fate: Kept, surprisingly.  This game is deceptively addictive.\nBuy/No Buy:  Honestly a good buy, even with as little as I’ve seen, it’s a unique concept I can sink my teeth into.\n","February 2","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They give you the option to run in windowed mode, but choosing this is broken and doesn't always put you in windowed mode. Likewise, trying to revert back to fullscreen doesn't work either.\n\nThe game is at a fixed resolution, which I found to be too large for my monitor. Thus, the game was completely unplayable.\n\nWould not recommend.","March 25","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The aim is to hack various servers to find files, information, money and to complete objectives by typing various lines of code.  I found it a little confusing at first but once I got into it a bit it was very interesting and fun game.  It is effectively a very unique spin on a puzzel game.  Deffinitly a good little game for the price.","April 7","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a fun game, but also a game you easily getting angry on, hard to understand for times, also the tutorial isnt well explaining for you. I still will say this is a fun game, but i dont really know if its thumb up or down, it stuck between them, so i giving it thumb up.","September 6, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my case, me and my friend tried this game out, we had already completed another Hacking-simulator-game and we have both experienced this before.\nSo in the first mission, the tutorial level, we broke the game by completing a step before it "was meant to be done". We had to restart.\nIn the second mission, after we've learned that the messege-screen that pops up with objectives, we did exactyl what we were told to do. And after a few minutes the new objectives stopped popping up. Very confusing game and I do not recommend it. Maybe, only MAYBE, to a younger generation.","April 12","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
