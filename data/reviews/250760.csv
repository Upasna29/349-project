This has all that and more. Remember the annoying sounds and music that some games had due to the very primitive soundboard. Well forget about that with Shovelknight because the music is just beyond awesome. Everything about it screams well done, and there is also a person in the very first town that you can talk to if you want to change the music in case you find it repeatative. Just gather more notepages and he can play more songs.\nThis game is filled with hidden treasure, fun jokes, awesome characters (a horse in a dress!), lovely artwork, great enemies and very well done boss fights.\nThe game is like a combination of Duck Tales, Super Mario, Mega Man, Faxanadu and many more epic titles + more. If you are looking for anything to tickle the old nostalgic nerve this is the game for you. Even thou I have tried words can't describe how awesome this game is. Try it for yourself. You won't regret it.\n\nTL;DR  10/10 this game is awesome go buy it!","June 25, 2014","true","7.0"," 836 of 908 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","836","908","0","4"

You might as well grab 15€ from your wallet and burn it if you are a fool. You will get no joy from this if you don't have what it takes, you little piece of garbage. I don't want to go anywhere near this game if I don't have enough time to sit back and properly enjoy it again. I assure you that you will feel the same. The 8-bit music will drive you insane with nostalgia, the controls are disgustingly good, especially if you have a decent controller, the art looks like it was made by an 8-year-old prodigy genius blessed by angels. All in all, I rate this game 1 if we're using a simplistic binary rating system where 1 means 'recommend', and 0 means 'do not recommend'.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/250760/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Shovel Knight is a 2D side scroller platforming game - it was developed and published by indie games developer Yacht Club Games in June 2014. The game was initially released on PC, 3DS and WiiU and then later ported to PS3, PS4, Xbox One and the Vita in early 2015 - it has also made it's way onto the Amazon Fire TV platform too.\n\nGameplay\n\nYou play the role of an anonymous character, as you collect treasure in this 2D world. Your characters main attack is, you guessed it, his shovel which has various uses throughout the game, the main one is being used to hit enemies around the head with. You can also use the shovel to dig up treasures hidden in dirt found around each level.  The shovel also comes into the platforming side quite a bit too, you can use it to jump on top of other enemies to bounce up to higher points in order to reach harder to reach areas for extra treasure.  I especially liked the way the game handles death, each time you die, you will drop three sacks of treasure, which deduct off you total - when retrying the level, the three sacks remain where you died allowing you to pick them up again, this of course leads to some interesting gameplay elements when you die in a pit of emptiness or other areas where it is impossible to get to without dying again.\n\nThroughout the game you also encounter various traders which will let you spend your hard earned treasure to upgrade your character with other secondary abilities, whilst these are not always needed in order to progress in the game, they certainly make it a lot easier - the upgrades can consist of health upgrades or extra items.\n\nEach level also has an end boss to it; plotting you against some classic NES boss fights, requiring a degree of platforming and classic hack and slash moments. The boss fights are well really done and each has their own unique battle style.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics in Shovel Knight are some of the best 8 bit style graphics I have seen. We are seeing this graphic style becoming ever popular on Steam, and it's nice to see a game put so much extra care into producing a well made looking product. Each of the levels are colorful and full of vibrant colours, the animation on all of the monsters and NPCs are really nicely put together as well. This game really will give you a nostalgia hit if you are an older gamer.\n\nAudio/Soundtrack\n\nThe audio and soundtrack in Shovel Knight is just amazing - so much so that it was released for individual purchase on release of the game. The soundtrack was worked on the gentlemen who also worked on the Mega Man theme tune too. This is another aspect of the game that will really give you flash backs to your childhood if you played on the NES/SNES.\n\nDifficulty\n\nI found this game to be particularly difficult - again this is down to the platforming side of it because I am god awful at the genre, but the boss scenes are also sufficiently challenging as well. You have to work out the bosses attack patterns in order for you to take as little damage as possible because sometimes, some of their attacks are unavoidable so damage is inevitable. The platforming side has some hard moments in too, whether it be the levels where you have to navigate across floating platforms in complete darkness with only a few glimpses of light from lightning storms to see where you are going. The difficulty is nicely paced and doesn't ramp up too quickly, allowing you to get to grips with the gameplay before throwing you in against the really difficult stuff.\n\nLevel Design\n\nEach of the levels in Shovel Knight are really well set out. Each level has its own theme and its own style of enemy to fight against. Throughout each level there are plenty of opportunities to show off your platforming skills for reaching difficult to reach ledges and navigating moving platforms over pits of darkness just to get that one health upgrade! Along with the the abundance of treasure to find in each level either by just killing enemies, you will also find mounds of dirt on the ground and up walls which lets you put your shovel to work, these normally result in thousands of treasure coming out so keep and eye out for them.  Along each level, you will come across a number of checkpoints, these checkpoints can either be used as just that, or you can destroy them, rewarding you with even more treasure, but renders the checkpoint useless, so this should only be used when you don't mind having an awful lot of backtracking to do if you die. I made the mistake of doing this twice on two checkpoints without knowing the consequences and I thoroughly regretted it when I realized what I had done, especially when it was the last two checkpoints before the boss.\n\nGame Length and Replay-ability\n\nA full playthrough of Shovel Knight took me just around ten hours to complete - I thought it was a very good length game for it's price, and upon completion the game, you also unlock the "New Game+" mode which is something I really look for in any sort of game like this, so it was nice to see. I actually thought this would of been a nice game to incorporate local co-op in someway, but sadly there isn't any element of multiplayer. With the extra game mode, you could easily put about twenty hours into this game, something you don't very often see from Indie titles.\n\nTechnical Issues\n\nWith Shovel Knight being a 2D experience, the graphically options are very limited, however you can play the game at full resolutions all the way up to 4k, granted it doesn't make that much a difference on the appearance side of things, but it's nice to see it being supported. With full controller support, you should really be taking advantage of that, as with all platforming games - I tried playing with the keyboard and it was just a train wreck trying to get through the platforming...\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, Shovel Knight is a game that will be welcome in 99% of people's library, even if you didn't experience the games on the NES/SNES, you will still get a huge amount of enjoyment out of this game. The graphics are gorgeous, and soundtrack just rounds off this game to be an almost masterpiece. I can't think of anything negative to say about the game. For the price of £10,99, this is an absolute must buy for any gamer out there.\n\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Shovel Knight (one of the few successful kick-starter games to come along) is like the proverbial Ghost of Christmas Past that tags along the spirits of Mega Man, Contra, Duck Tales, Castlevania and Legend of Zelda all in one charming and fantastic package. It's a homage and a love-letter for the era all wrapped up in one of the years finest games. Shovel Knight, however, doesn't only get by on its charm or its looking-glass mirror of nostalgia, because while Yacht Club clearly display a fanatical and almost pin-point perfect ability to replicate what was great about all those legends they are also able to display a modern, forward thinking approach to gaming. This is a mash-up of old and new that strikes gold from the get go.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=291530511\nOne may argue that Shovel Knight is no where near as difficult (although that is not to say the game does not provide ample challenge) as games such as the old Mega Man or Castlevania titles but then that would be missing the point entirely. It's clear from the get go that not only do the developers of Shovel Knight want to drown you in a dippy whirl of nostalgia, most importantly they want you to have fun. Shovel Knight employs a Dark Souls style mechanic where if you die you get a chance to reclaim all your lost gold. Should you die again before being able to recollect these items they are lost for good. Where Mega Man gave you lives and then forced you to restart the level after using them all up, Shovel Knight is more generous by strategically placing checkpoints through each level that will see you re spawn at the last one reached, provided you still have some gold in your pocket. Loose all your gold and you will be forced to re-tackle the level.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=290973571\nShovel Knight is presented in an 8-bit retro aesthetic that will be instantly recognizable to anyone who grew up in the era when these kinds of games were immensely popular. Taking on the role of a tiny knight with, you guessed it, a shovel - your quest is simple - save the land from an evil Enchantress that has enslaved the kingdom using her own macabre version of the Knights of the Round Table who go by the name of The Knights of No Quarter and locate your lost and dearly beloved who appears to have been kidnapped by the evil Enchantress herself. Apart from clearing this forsaken land from each Knights evil clutches, Shovel Knight will also fight a host of random enemies that spawn on the map that are just as equally delightful, charming and incredibly creative to engage with. Shovel Knight oozes character and charm by the bucket-load and it will take something particularly mighty to knock it off my perch for best game of 2014.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=291203444\nShovel Knight hits pay-dirt right from its first dig and it scratches an itch in me that few modern games have been successful at achieving. Do yourself a favor and pick this game up as it honestly deserves all the attention and success it can get so that hopefully we will see some more in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 21, 2014","true","22.8"," 282 of 345 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","282","345","0","6"

For my full review, please visit Real Gamer Reviews[realgamerreviews.com]\n\nCAN YOU DIG IT, SUCKA?\n\nI'm sorry. I had to.\n\nThis is the best Megaman game that's been made in nearly 2 decades.\n\nThis game is a very very high-quality tribute to the games were popular during the late 80's/early 90's. The influences are obvious - The character itself, the level design, boss fights, graphical style and music are very reminiscent of the early Megaman games. The level selection pays tribute to the slightly-less-than-linear level select screen of Super Mario Bros. 3, where there is a general direction of progression, but you may be given the opportunity to stray from the path at times. The shovel jump mechanics are a less-than-subtle throwback to the pogo stick in Ducktales. Most importantly, however, is that the controls are both simple and responsive. If you miss a jump, it'll always because you missed the jump, rather than the game itself boning you. As with most 2D platformers on PC, I would strongly recommend a controller (with the Xbox 360 controller being the standard).\n\nThe difficulty of this game is often spoken about. The game is fairly difficult, but I do have to stress that this game is NOT Nintendo difficult. The difference is mainly that although Shovel Knight does have challenging sections, there is rarely a point in the game that is strictly unfair. Most of the time when you die, it'll be more of a "dammit, I messed up" than a "this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" type of thing. Furthermore, unlike many NES games of old, there is no limit to the number of lives you have. Instead, dying causes you to lose a portion of the gold you've collected, which gets left at the point at which you died. You then spawn at the latest checkpoint and have an opportunity to obtain the money that you dropped. This means that there are rarely any parts of the game that require extensive replaying of the same areas over and over again. Seasoned platform gamers (for which this game is most likely targeted at) will probably get through this game without too much of a struggle. Newer gamers however are likely to get stuck and potentially frustrated at various segments of the game. With that said, regardless of how difficult you may find the game, each level you complete will feel like an accomplishment.\n\nAs previously mentioned, both the graphics and the music in the game are very much influenced by game such as Megaman. The graphics are, in a sense, "beautifully ugly", in that it is an 8-bit style game done in high resolution. The music is more or less the type of chiptune that you'd expect from a game like this. It's catchy, yes, although I found the music less memorable than the NES titles that inspired this game.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good NES-style 2D platformer. Yes, the price of this is currently relatively steep for an indie game (as it has never been bundled or, to my knowledge, gone on special for any significant amount to this date). With that said, as PC gamers, we are spoilt for choice. We live in an age where, on Steam, and with the overabundance of bundled games, we are able to get decent-quality games for very cheap. From a value-for-money point of view, I would recommend getting much cheaper-but-high-quality 2D platformers such as Super Meat Boy, Limbo, Braid, Spelunky and a host of other games well before you got this one. However, if you're like me and time is a considerably more limiting factor than money, then Shovel Knight is the best value.\n\nIn other words, I strongly believe that Shovel Knight is the best 2D platformer currently on Steam, bar none.","October 30, 2014","true","10.7"," 198 of 237 people (84%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","84","198","237","16","8"

I can’t count how many times it has given us good games. Not to mention that those games wouldn’t have never seen the light of day if it wasn’t for Kickstarter and all of the Backers. Just another reason to thank those Backers.\n\nShovel Knight is like a dream come true. It looks, feels and plays itself like a game from the, how I like to call it, golden age of gaming. The NES/SNES Age. Actually I’d go as far as to say it’s a love letter to the genre itself … just like Axiom Verge.\nOr no I’d even go as far as to say that Shovel Knight is a game people write love letters about.\nIt’s beautiful. It’s magic. It’s so much more.\n\nNow let’s get into it shall we?\n\nStoryYou slip into the role of the one and only Shovel Knight. A Knight wielding a Shovel as his weapon. Sounds crazy right? You’re on a journey with Shield Knight as you stumble upon the Tower of Fate. Inside both Knights find an amulet, a cursed one, and Shovel Knight passes out. Upon awakening Shield Knight is nowhere to be found. Thus, he starts to live a depressing life in solitude up until the day on which the Evil Enchantress and her Order of No Quarter show themselves to take over the land.\nWill Shovel Knight take up his Shovel and face evil? Or will he continue to live his life in solitude and forget about Shield Knight?\n\nWell that’s as much as I’m going to spoil the story for you.\n\nAtmosphereOh where do I begin? The sound, the look, the feel, the gameplay … a perfect harmony. There’s not one point which I could point at and say ’You don’t fit in here! Begone fiend!’. Really everything works together.\nIf you grew up with the NES/SNES or games like this you’re also struck by Nostalgia. The game certainly has it’s charm, not only for veteran players, but for new players as well. There’s so much love and detail in every character and level that you just happen to fall in love with the game.\nBut don’t get me wrong. Shovel Knight knows exactly when to be cool and stay old-school and when to be hip and defer to a more modern approach. The larger sprites and the variety of colours is something you wouldn’t be able to find and enjoy on a NES/SNES. That’s one advantage of being able to develop and play a Retro game like this on the PC.\nI grew up in the 90’s and let me just say that back in the day this game would have been acknowledged like a work of art. The way enemies behave, the more than fitting and catchy tune of each level and not to mention the boss fights … It just takes you way back in time and you just remember games like Mario, Mega Man or Castlevania.\n\nGameplayPretty straight forward. In the beginning it’s you and your Shovel vs the World. You can jump, of course, and you do have two different kinds of attacks. By pressing the Attack Button you, obviously, attack and by jumping and pressing down you perform a drop attack. But wait there’s more!\nAfter some time, and collections some treasure, you’ll be able to buy Magic which helps you to defeat enemies or even a Fishing Route, which you can use on specific places for some treasure.\nThat’s actually pretty much it there’s to say about the gameplay. The game’s really pretty straight forward just like the games used to be back in the day. But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to learn or that the game is for babies. Au contraire mon frere! You’ll have to learn and memorize the movement and attack pattern of the enemies in order to slay’em.\n\nVisualsWhile I might have talked ‘bout it earlier let me again get into it.\nThe game’s a work of Art. It looks beautiful and it’s a perfectly example that pixel games aren’t dead and should never die!\nThere’s just something else ‘bout games with such a retro feel and look. Especially nowadays where everyone’s focusing on making their games as real and photorealistic as possible.\nWhile this isn’t a bad thing per se … I feel like even if you don’t like games with an art style likeShovel Knight you’re missing out on so much by default. Play the game. But don’t only play it. Feel it. Embrace it. Get lost in it. There’s so much love and detail in every character and in every level that I can’t describe how important it is to just play and enjoy it.\n\nCheatsThe game does feature several cheats. One where you start at the last level, or with a specific Armor and whatnot. Keep in mind that if you use cheats of any kind that you'll be unable to unlock any achievements so using a cheat code is just for people who want to rock the game in a fancy way.\nYou can even increase the challenge with said cheats if you want.\nThe most known cheat would be the so called Butt Mode. Stop the giggeling!\nOkay it actually is rather funny. Here's what it does. It replaces recurring nouns in the game with the word Butt. So if you want to feel like a 12 year old again or just want to have a laugh every now and then this is the right cheat for you.\nI won't list any more cheats tho since they're easily found on numerous sites.\n\nWhat else can I say?To be honest with you folks … I could say so much more about the game but I believe I’ve made my point. That point would be:\nBuy it. Play it. Feel it Love it. Enjoy it.\nThe game is worth every penny and if you happen to see it on sale go ahead and buy it on the spot. It’s a game which deserves your money. It gives you so much back in return.\nIt’s seriously a game which you either end up loving or writing love letters about.","June 14, 2015","true","24.5"," 145 of 177 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","145","177","16","10"

There's a purity driving the experience, distilling the essence of classic 2D platformers without sacrificing depth or refinement, continually asking you to reevaluated your expectations as it pours out an abundance of creativity. It gave me something I already loved and then found ways to make it better, as I made my way through with a stupid grin on my face like I was rediscovering games again for the first time.\n\nThere's this fundamental mechanical understanding at the heart of Shovel Knight that forms the invisible glue holding it all together. Every platform, enemy, and secret area is tuned so perfectly to how the game plays that playing it feels almost instinctual, like you knew before even picking up the controller exactly how everything works. And that's likely in large part do to how much Shovel Knight borrows from the games that built the genre it resides in, but there's never a feeling that it's ripping anything off. It's entirely its own creation, with its own quirks and strategies, but playing it is so natural and fluid that it feels like an old friend that's been hiding all these years.\n\nShovel Knight's understandable nature shouldn't be mistaken for simplicity, as the burden has simply been shifted from interfacing with the game to relentless level designs and boss fights. Progression always feels earned and satisfying, be it a treasure chest at the end, a tricky enemy, or just managing to clear a difficult platform sequence. But Shovel Knight also never falls into the realm of being unfair. Its rules are plainly laid out and death is simply another learning experience, as you figure out new ways to tackle a situation. No matter how many times I died it never seemed as if the game was cheating me, and I always wanted to rush immediately back in to try it again.\n\nWhere so many 8-bit games require root memorization and perfect execution, Shovel Knight doesn't want to waste your time or break your abilities; it wants to teach you how to play better. Success is rewarded and brings with it new challenges such as destroying checkpoints for a bigger reward, or secret areas you couldn't access or weren't aware were there before. It made me want to seek out everything there was to see, to take on the biggest challenge to discover new tools and places, and never failed to have something cool to show me at the end.\n\nPlaying Shovel Knight was probably one of the more nostalgic experiences I've ever had with a game. It reintroduced me to that raw joy and excitement I had when I first started playing games as a child, but without the memory shattering disappointment that so often comes with revisiting the things I used to love. It stands on its own as a brilliantly executed creation without dismissing that which came before it, familiar yet completely inspired and so unbelievably fun with every swing of your shovel; the sort of game I feel compelled to tell others about and all but force them to play in the hopes they experience what I did from the very first screen.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Y0h6i-zGA","December 22, 2014","true","9.1"," 118 of 145 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","118","145","9","0"

I think it is safe to say this is one of the most hotly anticipated indie titles coming out this year... I'm trying to figure out how Yacht Club Games did it. Did they boil a vat of nostalgia stew using "Dark Souls" bones for flavoring; a stew Carl Weathers and Samwise Gamgee themselves would be proud of? No. Did they lock "Dark Souls" and "DuckTales" in a candlelit room with Barry White blasting? Maybe. However they have done it, they did it. The crazy ♥♥♥♥ers did it. They made a fun game, an homage to why we started gaming in the first place. This is not the greatest game in the world, no. It is simply a tribute. A great tribute nonetheless.\n\nIt is a simple premise: Shovel Knight and his warrior BFF Shield Knight got their pixelated butts whooped.  Shield Knight is MIA and Shovel Knight took an early retirement. But now a new and evil force is out in numbers - the Enchantress and her Order of No Quarter. Shovel Knight heads out on one last quest, to restore goodness to the land.\n\nYou travel from level to level, dispatching enemies and platforming very similarly to "Ducktales," complete with treasure collecting and atypical weapon use. You have two attacks (along with some magics) to deal a variety of enemies, each with their own weaknesses and tactics. It is deceptively challenging. Not "tear your hair out and sacrifice your firstborn" challenging, but a fun challenge. There are secrets to find as well, so keep an eye out for things that look out of place.\n\nThe levels are wonderful... each one is unique and beautiful to boot. I am getting tired of pixel games, honestly. All these RPG Maker games... hideous and same-y. But "Shovel Knight" is gorgeous. It reminds me why pixel-style art made a comeback in the first place. Everything flows and you'll find yourself taking dumb damage because you are busy staring at the background and stages.\n\nThe gameplay,charming story, and excellent levels are great but the soundtrack, to me, is the star. I equate the "Shovel Knight" soundtrack to that of the "Halo" soundtrack. It is integral. It is inspired. It is catchy as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't mention the boss fights. Amazing. Think "Dark Souls." Every boss has his or her own special style, one that you have to master. Expect a challenge.\n\nThis game is cute. It has heart. And it wears its influences on its sleeves, from the bonfire checkpoints to the treasure chest brimming with pixelated treasure. "Shovel Knight" is not a risky game; it is not doing anything new. It is doing something tried and true. But it does it honestly and with its own unique charm. "Shovel Knight" is a blast.","June 26, 2014","true","12.3"," 80 of 99 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","80","99","2","3"

One with immature memes, pointless obscure NES references, low-effort pixel graphics, and trial-and-error difficulty that'll make you pull your hair out? Good, then look at literally everywhere else, and stay away from Shovel Knight.\n\nUnlike the useless piles of Super Meat Boy clones and the uninspired puzzle platformers, this game does something that nobody has thought of before: it shows us the reasons we love retro gaming by removing all the things we hated about it. Take out the punishing difficulty, unintuitive physics, blinding-speed reaction times, tedious grinding, and ridiculously stressful objectives, and it turns out, yes, there’s still something left to love about the old games beyond masochism and nostalgia, something that was lost over the ages.\n\nDifficulty is not hard, but not easy; it's about just at the right level to feel satisfying when skill takes over. The controls and jump arc are simply perfect. There are tons of secret tricks that aren't explained, but will make you feel smart when you discover them yourself. Tough challenges become simple if you find clever ways to use your items. Graphics use the retro color palettes to great effect and can only be described as sweet, shiny eye candy, nothing like  the crappy MSPaint doodles you'll see in other pixel games. It's got powerful, energetic chiptune music that doesn't always make sense, but is catchy and gets you pumped to play -- every track is like some offspring of the Wily fortress music from Mega Man 2 and Castlevania 2's Bloody Tears. You can wreck enemies with the Downstab from Zelda 2, the Deluge from Faxanadu, the microphone from Kirby's Adventure, or even a fishing rod -- or sneak past them with invincibility, if you've got magic power to spare. Best of all, the challenges are rewarding and simply a joy to play from beginning to end -- you'll never feel afraid of what the game has in store for you, you'll just want to see more. And even if you die, you can even get your stuff back if you dare to try again.\n\nBelieve the hype. As of now, I consider Shovel Knight the best fake retro game of all time. If you don't get why the retro fad is even happening in the first place, how so many gamers could possibly have such blind nostalgia for such old, technically inferior games with chiptunes and pixel graphics, this game might just show you why we all love retro gaming and why it will never go away.

Shovel Knight is the tale of a knight with an unconventional weapon out to take down the Enchantress and rescue his beloved. Giving nods to old 8-bit titles such as Mega-Man, Super Mario, and Castlevania, Shovel Knight shows us that retro still holds up even now. Borrowing all of the best bits and pieces of each of those titles and making them it’s own, Shovel Knight perfects each aspect and delivers a thrilling game experience.\n\nPRO-----------------\n*Simple, tight controls\n*Detailed 8-bit environments and animations\n*Retro gameplay and mechanics\n*Lots of sub-weapons to mix up your arsenal\n*Collectibles\n*Mini-games\n*Challenging boss battles\n*Amazing soundtrack\n*Effective upgrade system for health and magic\n*Tons of secrets to find\n*New Game +\n\nCON-----------------\n*Bad? There isn’t anything bad about Shovel Knight!\n*Ok fine, If you have to have a con, it’s that the game isn’t nearly long enough for how awesome it is.

After all, there are AAA titles from well known companies that go for less.  I've played through more NES classics than I can remember.  Bubble Bobble, Castlevania, Contra (sans the Konami Code, you scrubs :-P), Mega Man 1-6, Metal Storm, Super C, and The Legend of Zelda are a few that come to my mind while trying to make a quick list of some titles I've completed.  I wish I could tell you that I beat Battletoads, but I'd be lying.  The prospect of reliving the genre with a new game sounded too good to be true.  I've played newer "retro" games, but even when good, they are rarely able to resurrect the experience the older titles.\n\nWhen I heard about the release of Plague of Shadows, it wasn't enough for me to buy this game.  I thought, "Playable boss character? So they probably replaced the main character's sprite and gave him a projectile."  So I kept waiting to catch sale.  I finally purchased it at $10.04, and it still took me months to get around to playing the game.  After 30 seconds into the first stage I felt like an idiot for sleeping on this title for so long.  If Shovel Knight had existed during the NES era, it would be the type of cartridge people would be happy to pay $75.00+ for today.\n\nIt manages to completely capture the essence of the genre without feeling derivative.  The developers have somehow managed to create a product that draws from the good parts of the 8-bit era while ditching unecessary artifacts.  The colors, sounds, and animations are candy to the eyes and ears.  I knew I was in for a treat mere moments after jumping into the first stage.  I was even more impressed upon making it to the first town and interacting with the people there.\n\nIt took me roughly 9 hours to complete Shovel Knight's adventure for the first time, a feat which apparently can be accomplished in less than 45 minutes by highly skilled speed runners.  The game encourages you to play through again with New Game+ (higher difficulty) and as Plague Knight.  There is also a challenge mode and many Feats (achievements) for you to attempt.  I'm currently two stages into my Plague Knight file and don't think I could be more amazed by this game.  Rather than opting to lazily reskin Shovel Knight, Yacht Club Games gave Plague Knight his own storyline and unique playstyle.\n\nAs if Shovel Knight didn't have enough replayability, the developers are planning to release additional playable boss characters.  It is difficult for me to imagine them topping the existing content, but I should probably have a little faith after already underestimating them so grossly.   Is this game worth $14.99?  Absolutely. Buy Shovel Knight now.  If you are a fan of platformers or seeking NES nostalgia, you will dig it.","December 5, 2015","true","21.2"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","46","51","8","2"

I may have missed some stuff, but main game-wise, I've dug up about what's offered here.\n\nAs a fellow Kickstarter backer, what do I think of this game? Well, to put it shortly...I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVED THIS GAME! I'm really glad that this game saw the light of day, unlike some other Kickstarted projects out there, and I am content with how it turned out. Yacht Club Games, I applaud your efforts here.\n\nShovel Knight is pretty much as if someone took Mega Man, DuckTales, and the Metroidvania concept and threw it together in a 2A03 blender set to VRC6, threw in some modern enhancements, and released it out to the world for everyone to try. This game really feels like it could have been on NES, from the graphics to the audio all the way down to the core gameplay. Yes, I know that there are instances of proof that part of the game can't be done on NES, but who cares? I felt like some of the added changes helped with making the game much better, in the long run.\n\nThe story itself is pretty much like other NES games: Forgettable. But come on, you're not here for the story. NES games were never recognized for that. The dialogue spoken throughout is also pretty cheesy and full of puns, which I think adds to the charm of the game. You can probably get a good laugh out of it, or at least a smile on your face.\n\nIn contrast to that, the gameplay is just excellent. As I said, it's a mix of Mega Man, DuckTales, and Metroidvania stuff. You can slice at enemies with your sharp shovel, bounce off of them to inflict damage and reach higher terrain, and use an assortment of side weapons. The side weapons are definitely built for combat, but most of them are also coded to aid in exploration. There definitely will be levels where you need to use a certain item to advance through, which I think is excellent...though I wish there were more levels/areas in the game that did that, too. But aside from that, you can go through the whole game with just the shovel, like how you can go through all of a Mega Man game with just the Buster.\n\nI think that the difficulty is fairly set. With how the levels are designed and how the gameplay is handled, it's really your fault for failing, which I appreciate with games like this. It also makes you learn the game's mechanics instead of giving you an unnecessary tutorial, which I also like. You can also give yourself a better challenge by destroying the checkpoints, which give you more gold in exchange of having to start from a previous area of the level upon death. With New Game+, you start with your previous equipment/upgrades, but you take more damage, can't find food in the levels, and you have less checkpoints in the level. Definitely for those who want it NES hard.\n\nThe level design is superb. Yes, they are linear in nature, like with every NES game. But all the enemies/platforms/items are fairly placed out across the place to synergize with the gameplay. There are also plenty of secrets hidden in each level, which gives an excellent risk vs reward feeling of finding and completing each secret area. They also provide a nice place to test out any relics that you find, if you do find any.\n\nWhile difficult, I think that the game is also rather forgiving. You don't have a lives system, and you don't get a game over for dying so much or for any other condition. That said, you do lose some of your gold upon death, which you can recover in the same area that you died in, akin to Dark Souls. I like this...but I have a bit of a gripe with it, too (explained at the bottom). I think that the checkpoints are properly spaced out throughout the levels, which aids with some of the forgiveness that the game offers. Either way, if you fall, just get back up and try again. It's not game over unless you make it game over.\n\nI like how the bosses are handled. They don't really have a pattern, but a set list of moves that they choose to execute depending on the situation. These moves are pretty easy to pick up on, and they definitely fit the theme of the boss.\n\nThe graphics for the game are just nostalgic glory here. I know that some of the colors in the palette in this game could never show up on a NES game...but I don't care. These added colors really help with the mood and design of the levels/enemies. Yacht Club Games did amazing with making sure that they would work on the NES, similar to how Capcom could get more than three colors on a single sprite. Just great authenticity. The animations are buttery-smooth, too.\n\nThe sound...OH MAH RAWR! It's just...too good. The music done in this game was composed with Famitracker, but uses an expansion chip called the VRC6, which was only available in some Konami games for the Famicom, notably Akumajou Densetsu (Castlevania 3). I consider this one of the best expansion chips for the Famicom, and I really was excited to see it being used for this game. Oh, unlike some indie retro games out there, the sound effects in this game really do sound like they could have came from the NES, so kudos to that, as well.\n\nIf I had one complaint about this game, it would be how the money bags are sometimes spawned upon death. I've had moments of not being able to reach any floating bags, all because they would be in an area that's impossible to return back to safety, especially over bottomless pits. I hope that a future patch can resolve that.\n\nOne play session will vary on your skill level. For me, I beat the game in a bit over 7 hours with 84% item completion for my first playthrough, though it seems like it's an average of 4-6 hours for everyone else...and less than 1 1/2 hours if you're really that good at the game. There's New Game+ for those who want to extend their time with the game with a better challenge. But either way, with the quality of the final product, I say the price is justified.\n\nOverall, as a PC gamer, a NES gamer, and a Kickstarter backer, I really enjoyed this game. It's by far one of the greatest games I've played this year, and I'm really happy that this game was completed. I can't wait to see what else Yacht Club Games has in store soon, either for this game or for another. If you're a fan of retro games (especially the NES), you owe it to yourself to pick this game up.","June 26, 2014","true","8.7"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","33","43","0","0"

I'm sure you've already heard that a million times by now because this game has been hyped up by just about everyone that has played it. Well, there's a good reason for that. The reaosn is... it lives up to the hype. It's one of the best games made in year. Perhaps one of the best game EVER.\n\nShovel Knight is a 2D platformer where you run and jump around swinging your shovel at enemies and objects. You can also use your shovel to bouce off of enemies and objects as well. The gameplay is very similar to that of Mega Man and Ducktales. You also get some pretty cool powerups along the way, by them secondary items that use magic, or just upgrades to your main gear. You get them by buying them with gold. You get this gold by collecting gems throughout the levels. When you die, you lose some of your gold and get sent back to your last checkpoint. However, if you get back to the place where you died, you can reclaim your gold as it is separated into three floating sacks. Pretty nifty way to punish you for dying without limiting you to a number of lives. The levels are picked from an overworld map very similar to the style of Super Mario Bros 3. There are even some enemy encounters on the map that aren't associated with specific levels or locations. There are also a few towns to visit, which is the root of a lot the game's humor along with serving as the main hubs for shops.\n\nThe great thing about Shovel Knight is how it really commits to the retro style. It's all pretty faithfully 8 bit in visuals, sounds, music... almost everything. It also controls like a dream. It might be intimidating at first, and you might assume it will be classically NES hard. Well, it's not too tought. Believe me, there are harder games out there. I may not be able to beat most Mega Man games, but Shovel Knight wasn't too much of a problem. The game can get tricky, even a little frustrating at times, but it keeps things interesting by constantly throwing new things at you and I never found any part of the game to seem hopeless. Whenever I had trouble with a part, I knew it was because I was doing it wrong, not necessarily because it was just incredibly tasking. The balance is great and is only further aided by the tight controls. There are also a good number of secrets for you to keep your eyes peeled for.\n\nThe presentation is wonderful. The 8 bit art style is very charming, and the setpieces are very detailed. Not to mention all the pretty colors used. The sound effects are very satisfying, from jumping, to hitting enemies, so collecting treasure. The music is amazing. Just listen to the title theme and try not to get totally pumped for this game! (SPOILER ALERT: It can't be done.) Everything just comes together in one glorious package of pure awesomeness.\n\nComplaints? I guess I have a few, though they are very minor... but... well no game is perfect, Not even this masterpiece. For as retro as most of it is, a few things are modernized. The scrolling background and some of the colors and sound capabilities... plus a lack of slowdown... most of that might have been a bit much for an old NES game to handle. Also, there are lots of checkpoint, which isn't very classically inspired. You CAN destroy them for gold so that there aren't checkpoints but... they are there by default. There's also autosaving and achievements which can't be turned off. These things aren't bad. In fact, they are all here for a reason, but they DO break the retro style a tiny bit. That's all. Also, there's no multiplayer options. I mean, online would also be breaking the retro style, but local mutliplayer, co op, or switching off on deaths or something... that would've fit just fine. However, I assume the game would need to be made a lot differently if two players were involved in the quest, so I can't really complain for something the game didn't do and honestly didn't need to do. Perhaps in a sequel, eh? ;)\n\nOverall, this game is great. The controls are so tight and are coupled with fun and intersting gameplay. The difficulty curves quite nicely. The presentation is incredible. Even little details are well done, giving each boss knight their own personalities rather than just having them be generic themed bosses at the end of themed levels. There's a certain cohesiveness. This game is amazing. It costs $15, and is well worth it. It's worth even $20, honestly. In fact, if this game had a physical copy, I'd be willing to pay $30 for it! It's THAT good. It's a must have, and even now is making me reconsider what my favorite game on Steam is because it's just so great. Buy it now. Don't bother to wait for a sale. The sooner you get this game and start playing, the sooner you will be happy. You're welcome.\n\nEDIT: There wasn't enough room to add my full review of the additional Plague of Shadows content or my thoughts on challenges. The challenges are fun if you're into that, but I found them a bit annoying. The Plague of Shadows campaign that has you playing as Plague Knight is basically like a second game, with lots of new and interesting gameplay and challenges that spice up the familiarities.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/extraxi/recommended/250760/","extraxi","Magnus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/extraxi/","464 products in account","There are a lot of video games. Many try to capture a retro style to win over a nostalgic crowd, or try to pull a more unique art style to grab people's attentions. Others tell deep stories that hook you in, make you feel invested, like you have to get to the end. Few try to sell on quality gameplay alone, something that's genuinely fun to play.\n\nFew games do all three. Games like Dark Souls, Shadow of the Colossus, Bastion, Transistor, Earthbound... And now, Shovel Knight.\n\nFrom start to finish, Shovel Knight is a fantastic game. In the first level, it teaches you how to play subtly without throwing it out at you in a text box, much like Megaman X had done years ago. The controls are simple, each move shown to you as you accomplish it on your own without heavy handed guidance. Even the ability to identify an alternate path or a hidden wall is subtly placed into the world, so you always know what to look for. And everything is used throughout the game from then on, in new, creative ways each time, through platforming and combat.\n\nThere's more to my mentioning of Megaman. Shovel Knight uses the original color palette of NES... The very limited number of color choices presented is clear in the still vivid scenery. It stays true to its nostalgic feel. Each world is unique in more than just appearance as well. The variation of enemies is absolutely beautiful, new types of critters appearing in every single stage. Even Rats, re-used throughout the game, are fought completely differently each time. From little Helicopter Rats to ones that outright explode when killed.\n\nAnd finally, the story. The prologue is simple, a tale of fallen heroes... Many more than you'd think at first. But Shovel Knight gets up, and goes to fight the good fight. The story builds up further in short conversations with enemies. It deepens as you fight your rival more and more, until you learn something about him that changes everything. But most importantly, this game is about saving Shield Knight... And when Shovel Knight dreams, there's only one thing he dreams of.\n\nBuy Shovel Knight. Don't wait for a sale. Play it.\n\nCatch her.\n\nAddendum:\n\nYears pass, things change... While this is a great game, this is currenlty the worst version of Shovel Knight on the market. PS4 has an exclusive level and boss. Xbone has an exclusive level and boss. Wii U gets challenge modes, some type of diary, and even co-op.\n\nThe PC version has nothing extra, no redeeming features other than being a great base game and extra campaign. But why does the PC version have to be the worst on the market? It's a scummy thing of Yacht Club Games to do, punishing PC players for being just that.","June 27, 2014","true","9.6"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","1"

You control the shovel knight and can dig, and bash enemies with his weapon of choice. You fight through various stages and will face various puzzles, traps and enemies, but with even spaced checkpoints you won't pull your hair out too much.\n\nI have just earned the halfway achievement after dying many times but I still think this is a great game. The level design is challenging but not too unforgiving if you have a bit of patience. You can also upgrade a bit against the bosses allowing a hard fight to become more reasonable (Dark Souls style). There is a lot of humour within the game adding a few giggles to your progress. I would recommend using a controller to make the game more fluid.\n\nThey recently released a free DLC that adds a whole new challenge as the Plague Knight, but I think it will take me a while just to finish my first playthrough.  I am pretty crap at these type of games, which normally means they have to be pretty good just to keep my interest.","September 28, 2015","true","7.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/250760/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","Shovel Knight is a game that brings back the good old NES days. Truth is, Shovel Knight fails to do one thing: Disappointing me. Shovel Knight is not only easily the best game of 2014 so far, but it's one of the best I've played in recent memory. It's greatness can be rivaled with others like Mass Effect and Minecraft. Shovel Knight is easily one of the best platformers of recent memory, too. The Rayman games, for example, were highly praised with their cute visuals and awesome soundtrack, but Shovel Knight takes these visuals and makes it hardcore nostalgic and the soundtrack into an 8-bit unforgettable masterpiece, thus making it far superior to that series to me. They say that "Nothing is perfect," however they also said, "Nothing is impossible." Where am I going with this? This might just be one of the few perfect games that I could've ever encountered.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics take you back to the time when realistic graphics weren't the big thing. Shovel Knight successfully recreates the graphics from an NES game like this and also modernizes it with some new colors and also the amazing animated backgrounds. The characters, and more specifically, the Order of No Quarter, look outstanding. They're all knights, yet the creators were able to make each one unique. To me, King Knight was the best looking of all of them and really went well with his theme. However, they all look nice. Well, besides the Black Knight, who looks pretty ugly. However, you only encounter him less than 5 times in the game, so that isn't much of a flaw.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay, again, recreates what the NES games, and even games from that time and older did. They had the simplistic controls with no holding hands. Sure, it took a while due to how many last gen games I played since they all hold your hand, but it was easy to get adjusted to them. It also mixes some of the greats, like Mega Man, Zelda, even a hint of Mario. At first, the levels appear to be repetitive, but then you realize that they become more and more unique as they go on, and the bosses were amazing. No one was too difficult at all. There was the occasional rage, but I expect that from a game that wants to recreate the NES era. Speaking of difficulty, this game has been talked about because of its easy difficulty compared to the real NES games. This is true, but like I explained earlier, Shovel Knight does not hold your hand and also the bosses can make you rage when you go against the more notorious bosses like Plague Knight, Frost Knight, and Spectre Knight. In the end, you realize that the difficulty is easier compared to Mega Man and Zelda, however it's harder than the modern games like Call of Duty. It's a perfect balance and I see nothing wrong with it.\n\nStory\nThe story is straightforward. Shovel Knight had a companion named Shield Knight, who tagged along with him on his journey. However, one day, Shield Knight sacrificed herself to stay in the tower while Shovel Knight could get out alive before the tower seals. Shovel Knight, mourning the loss of his comrade, becomes a farmer and does cheap work. However, one day, the Enchantress, who is the main antagonist of the game, opens up the tower again and the Order of No Quarter, consisting of King Knight, Spectre Knight, Tinker Knight, Mole Knight, Plague Knight, Frost Knight, Propeller Knight, and Treasure Knight, begin to spread their evil throughout the land. Shovel Knight realizes that Shield Knight could be alive in there still, and he also wants to get rid of the evil knights who spread their terror. Overall, I enjoyed the plot and loved the last few minutes of the game. The ending was wrapped up effectively and told a great, yet simple tale that I saw no problems with.\n\nAudio\nThe audio also highly impressed me with the good old chiptune soundtrack, and even had a few contributions from one of the all-time greats known as Manami Matsamune, who made the Mega Man soundtrack. The music is cheery, fast paced, and also unforgettable. The boss themes especially peeked my interest and made the bosses even more terrifying. Tinker Knight's theme 'The Schemer' also made you think that there's more than meets the eye. The sound effects are simplistic and hardcore nostalgic. You will not be disappointed.\n\nReplayability\nThe replayability is very strong in this game. You can play different playstyles with the armor selection towards the middle of the game, beat Shovel Knight on New Game+, defeat the bosses without dying, and go achievement hunting. The achievements can keep you busy and the New Game+ makes it even more rage-inducing. You will get quite a bit out of this game unless you're a one-and-done kind of guy. In fact, if you are one of those kinds of people, why are you reading this paragraph?\n\nVerdict\nShovel Knight stands out among the crowd as one of the best games I've played in such a long time. Platformer fan, nostalgia fan, medieval fan, whatever you are, this is a must-buy for anyone on Steam and is one of the games you NEED in your Steam library, along with Garry's Mod and a few others. This game does something few games have ever done, and that, my friends, is have no significant flaws that ruin the experience. You NEED this game. You will not be disappointed.\n\nGraphics- 9.5/10\nGameplay- 10/10\nStory- 8.5/10\nAudio- 10/10\nReplayability- 7.5/10\n\n**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**\n\n.:10/10:.\n\n+Amazing chiptune soundtrack\n+Awesome characters\n+Floors it on the nostalgia pedal\n+Simple controls\n+Balanced difficulty\n+Strong replayability\n+Difficult achievements\n+Modernizes the NES visuals","August 7, 2014","true","24.8"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatlimey/recommended/250760/","thatlimey","Limey [BDay in 2]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatlimey/","128 products in account","So, another retro-style 8-bit game pops up. Many may think that the style is horribly overdone today and will pay no attention to Shovel Knight.\n\nI have a message for those of you - if you like platformers at all, DO NOT IGNORE THIS GAME.\n\nShovel Knight takes place in an unnamed kingdom, under threat by the Enchantress and the 8 Knights of her Order of No Quarter. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Yeah, the Mega Man comparisons can be pretty plentiful, especially since the Mega Man series is what I usually see as the best platformers ever made.\n\nSTORY:\n\nThe story is pretty run of the mill, protagonist (Shovel Knight) and his companion/lover (Shield Knight) roamed the land in search of adventure, until one day, Shield Knight was taken from him by the dark power of a magic amulet. Don't roll your eyes just yet, because it gets good. While the story is simple, it deepens as he game goes on, through little bits of dialogue you may come across here and there.\n\n-----MINOR SPOILER - KEEPING IT AS VAGUE AS POSSIBLE-----\nThere's a sequence near the end that shows that Shield Knight is not a flat, boring character used just to provide a love interest for the main character - she has her own merits, and is an equal, and that sequence shows just how well they work together and how much worse off Shovel Knight is without her. All that is shown through gameplay that lasts...about 3 minutes, 5 tops.\n----------\n\nSo, the story actually stands up pretty well.\n\n\nMUSIC:\n\nHoly hell, this soundtrack is incredible. The tunes are extremely catchy, and, strangely enough, I would actually encourage you NOT to listen to any of the music outside of the game until you've heard it inside. That's right, I'm counting music as spoilers for this game. Jake Kaufman has done an amazing job as always.\n\nMega Man 2 always had my favourite 8-bit soundtrack. Up until I played this game.\n\nMINOR SPOILER: There is one track in the game that has taken my place of best sad 8-bit song from Mega Man 3's Proto Man Theme - Shield Knight Requiem. You'll know which track this is when you play the feels inducing sequence it goes with.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThe game plays brilliantly, the jumping is precise, the controls, while a bit weird at first (A and D for left and right, W and S for up and down, J to attack and K to jump) work very well once you get used to them. The level designs are all done very well, with specific mechanics and enemies being used in each of the Knight Lairs, and in each specific Lair alone, keeping the game fresh and interesting and, most importantly, challenging, as you have to learn new adversaries and mechanics to deal with. Almost all deaths in the game feel like your fault, something you can improve on.\n\nThe bosses work differently than most bosses I've seen in platformers like these. In other platformers, the bosses will have an attack pattern, performing attacks in a pre-determined sequence. Learn the pattern, and you can take the boss down with ease.\n\nNot the case here - the bosses in Shovel Knight have set attacks, but completely lack any pattern. This makes the bosses do their job MUCH better - testing the player's skill. You have to learn their attacks, not the pattern - you need to learn their attacks and make sure you know how to counter them.\n\nThe checkpoints are a point of interest, because, save for in the first level and the final level, checkpoints can be broken to yield vast amounts of money, rendering the checkpoint beyond use. Death does not punish you by knocking off a life, leading you to an inevitable and frustrating Game Over. Instead, dying takes away some of your dosh, which you must then recover in the next life if you want it back. Sometimes these flying bags can end up in awkward or downright unreachable places, which, while annoying, could be viewed as punishment for messing up, encouraging you to improve. This checkpoint system means skilled players can receive a large monetary bonus if they so decide. Of course, getting cocky and then messing up after destroying checkpoints can send you from any length through the level all the way back to the start, so choose wisely.\n\n\nLENGTH:\n\nThe game lasts around 5 to 6 hours, depending on your skill, on the first playthrough, an ample length, but it's packed full of secrets to find, one of the most notable being the Music Sheet collactables. 46 sheets are out in the world, hiding wherever, which can be returned to the village bard, who will pay you 500 gold for each, who can then play them for you - the music sheets in question form the game's soundtrack, so you can listen to your favourite tracks (provided you found the sheet) while scurrying about the village.\n\nOn top of that, there's a New Game +, unlocked after beating the game for the first time. This makes checkpoints much more scarce, about 2 per level, where once there may have been 3 times as many, healing items are almost never found, the most healing you'll get is the Ichor Of Restoration (given by the Troupple King (I could explain what a Troupple is, but you're better off finding out for yourself)). Trying to beat the game like this is even harder, and would probably add a fair bit of length to the game (I say would; I've not actually been able to finish New Game + yet.)\n\n\nVISUALS:\n\nThe design of the levels and foes, aesthetically, is brilliant, with each stage's looks, features and enemies having their own style, keeping the game looking new and interesting. The game was designed with a limited colour palette, to mimic the NES's restrictions. Of course, not all parts of the game, such as the parallax scrolling or a few colours the NES's limits prevented here and there, but overall, the game stays very close to the 8-bit era it's based on, with the UI looking like it's come straight out of Castlevania, and the overworld map being very reminiscent of that from Super Mario Bros. 3.\n\n\nOVERVIEW:\n\nShovel Knight is an 8-bit platformer that has elements from previous games of the era, and uses them magnificently. it excels in all areas. It's not just a retro 8-bit platformer aspiring to be like the classics - it's better than the classics.\nIt's challenging but enjoyable, and has enough of its own merits to stand tall, without needing to use nostalgia as a crutch - the NES era was not my childhood, that was the PS1 era. So if Shovel Knight's not sucking me in with nostalgia, then it must be something else giving me this rampant love for the game.\n\nThe early Mega Man games used to be what I considered the best platformers.\nThat title now belongs to Shovel Knight.\nThis game is EASILY worth the £11 (or reigonal equivalent) price tag.\n\nIf you enjoy platformers, are looking to get into the genre, or are a veteran of platformers, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.","July 25, 2014","true","16.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","3"

If you had to condense your memories and nostalgia of staring glass-eyed over your NES into a single story, you'd probably come up with something like Shovel Knight.\n\nThe titular Shovel Knight must traverse the land, fighting the villainous knights of the Order of No Quarter to save his beloved Shield Knight. Each level takes it's own Mega Man-esque theme and runs with it, from romantic flying airships to an explosion-prone potion laboratory. Gameplay is extremely tight, graphics and sound make the most of 8-bit aesthetics, and a New Game Plus allows Shovel Knight to bear some much-needed difficulty fangs in the spirit of brutal, Konami-esque difficulty.\n\nHowever, my recommendation for this game comes from it's free DLC, Plague of Shadows. It manages to spin the game's story from a boss's perspective, from heroic gallantry to a touching story of loving others and yourself. It's one of the most genuinely sweet love stories in all of gaming.The updated gameplay mechanics are a delight as well.\n\nThis game is throwback a la Jeet Kun Do - taking all the useful and best parts, discarding the frustrating and archaic, leaving an airtight, short-but-dense romp for maximum fun.

Here's why.\n\n1.) This game is in 8-bit.\nMost kids/adults who play this game get a very reminicent feeling of playing on every 8-bit gaming platform. That's sorta the build of this game, trying to be like none of the other indie games out there, but yet not going out of the way to be different. It does something simplistic, bringing you back to the 80s, 90s, and 2000s with 8-bit video games.\n2.) The soundtrack.\nReally should be under the 8-bit criteria, but still good none the less. This game's soundtrack was cleverly designed to bringing back some nostalgia with classic SNES and NES music from popular videogames. And what more could be said? It's ♥♥♥♥ing catchy! You could dance to this (Plague Knight).\n3.) The DLC.\nAdding one of the villans to the very exclusive playable character list is actually a smart idea. And with his entirely new gameplay, caused my 45 deaths with shovel knight to shoot up to 145 deaths. (I suck, he's hard.) The only mistake in the DLC is Vat (the item) comes mid-game and is really the most used utility that you'll get. Most of the items I had I never really used. (Stoneskin potion, Running feet elixer, big boom) They cluttered up my quick select menu, causing me to die because I didn't want to pause the game.\n4.) Plot line\nPlot: You're a serulian knight with a kick-♥♥♥ shovel on a quest to defeat the enchantress and find out what happened to shield knight. You fight other knights. Simple as that. Nothing more, nothing less. It's fine like that.

Not only did it fulfill what I expected, it actually exceeded my expectations, it's challenging, you'll rely a lot on skill, the level design is so amazing I haven't been this frustrated ever since I played megaman again 3 years ago. It is a delicious mix of Castlevania, Megaman and Ninja Gaiden. The Retro graphics are enjoyable and the pixel art is amazing, its pretty hard to sprite in that style without making it look out of place due to the lack of limitations.\nYatch Club Games really nailed it with this game. If they ever announce a Sequel, I would gladly play it if its as enjoyable as this game was. Sincerely, best Ten Bucks I ever spent.

Shovel Knight perfectly encapsulates the community wanting their retro game feel, while still maintaining a modern experience in flow and glitch-free gameplay. Pulling from the experiences of Mario 3, Zelda II, Megaman, Duck Tales, and other retros games Shovel Knight mixes these all in a pot and gives us something we couldn't experience on a NES by expanding on colors and gameplay that the system would not have allowed at the time. That's what makes Shovel Knight appeal to so many of us.\n\nThe game itself is fantastic. The action platforming and game design makes you feel like you are playing a Castlevania Megaman love child. Each zone has its own theme (a castle for king knight, a graveyard for spectar knight etc.) drawing from the best part of Megaman; its uniqueness. And the stage has hidden areas and challenge rooms giving you the exploratory feel of a Castlevania game. Your trek to the boss is challenging, but not frustrating and the game allows you to make things more difficult for yourself by rewarding you for destroying checkpoints. Defeating a stage always feels like a true accomplishment because the boss battles are hard and long fought. Once completed you are back to the overworld where you may be met with random encounters, challenging areas to test your skill, or fun banter with merchants and towns people. Combine that with masterful music and beautiful artstyle and you find almost no issue in the game.\n\nThe only issues one can bring up are sadly the game is too short, and the difficult cap may be high for those new to platformers. I myself had a hard time in many areas and I adore games like this. A lot of trail and error is involved, but with deligence any player should be able to finish the game. On the issue of the game being to short. I do not necessarily think that is a bad thing. A game as good as this is bound to leave a player wanting more and wanting more is what all games should leave you feeling. I do not hamper on Shovel Knight for being to short because it is my own selfishness that wants 20 more bosses and stages, endless music, and new and greater challenges.\n\nOverall Shovel Knight is an easy 10/10 and I have taken my nostalgia goggles off even for this score. I may seem biased, but even if I didn't have history with the aforementioned games Shovel Knight would still be a fantastic piece on its own. For those new to platformers and this style Shovel Knight will be a refreshing challenge and a wonderful gameplay adventure. For lovers of the old platformers this is the game we have been waiting for; all your favorites wrapped up in a new intersting experience that will both satisfy your thirst for nostalgia and leave you begging for more.","July 2, 2014","true","15.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/250760/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Shovel Knight begins as most adventures do. Two adventurers, Shovel Knight and Shield Knight, are off on a journey when they come across the Tower of Fate. Inside they find a cursed amulet, which knocks Shovel Knight out. When he wakes up, Shield Knight is nowhere to be found. Shovel Knight becomes depressed and begins living a life of solitude, until one day the Evil Enchantress and her Order of No Quarter arrive to take over the land. Shovel Knight takes up his trusty shovel and makes his way to the Tower to defeat the Enchantress and her Order. Why he’s got a shovel in particular is never really made clear, haha.\n\nWhile simple, the story does it's job. It keeps you interested and gives you a purpose. This of course is accented by amazing gameplay inspired by old school retro classics such as Mega Man, Castlevania, The Adventures of Link, Super Mario Bros, and even Ducktales. Shovel Knight borrows a few mechanics from some of the aforementioned game, but succeeds in making them its own. You can use your shovel to attack enemies, as well as dig up piles of dirt to find treasure, gems, and coins (these serve as your currency). You can also do a downward plunge attack, very much like Scrooge's pogo stick in Ducktales. This is pretty much all you can do, that is until you get your first relic. Relics are your sub-weapons, similar to Castlevania, with each use costing Magic to use. You can swap between relics at anytime via the inventory screen. They each have a specific use, like the Phase Locket allowing you to temporarily become invulnerable, or the Fiery Wand, which allows you to shoot fireballs in a straight path in front of you. Relics are found in one of two ways: either by finding the NPC Chester hidden in each stage, or by buying it from Chester in the first town. Buying it from him in town is more expensive though! In addition to these attacks and relics, you can aslo purchase abilities and armor upgrades in a later area.\n\nThe range and variety of enemies is impressive for any game, retro or otherwise, and there are some particularly good Mega Man-inspired boss battles. They all have their movement patterns to learn, but rather than just shooting a red flashing body part three times each encounter always has a more complex puzzle element. In Shovel Knight boss battles are things you actually look forward to as a culmination of the level’s ideas – not a semi-interactive cut scene before the next stage. Where the game doesn’t excel quite as well is the level design, which vacillates between making clever use of the shovel and more generic 2D platform arrangements. There are a lot of cleverly hidden secrets and shortcuts though, which together with the fact that you have to collect dropped gold from your corpse when you die is as reminiscent of Dark Souls as it is Super Mario World. Instant death whenever hitting a spike pit seems excessive punishment though and even if the checkpoint-ing is relatively generous the platforming gets so difficult by the end that it still won’t be enough for many less experienced gamers. Shovel Knight himself is also quite heavy for a platform character, although after an hour or so play you simply adjust to his slightly slower rhythm.\n\nIn most cases the game understands exactly when to stay old school and when to defer to more modern design theories. Even the visuals aren’t really anything like a NES. The number of colours and larger sprites are PC Engine level at least, which may seem inauthentic but allows for much more interesting visuals while still maintaining the retro tone. Shovel Knight’s creators clearly understand that while graphics are never entirely timeless good gameplay is, and if Shovel Knight really had been released back in the early ’90s it would’ve been rightly acknowledged as a great example of its art. The soundtrack for the game is fantastic. Each level has their own catchy tune, as does each boss fight. As you collect songs from the stages, you can sell them to the Bard in town for 500 gold each. Then at any time, once you've returned a song, you can request that the Bard play it in town for free! Good times are had by all.\n\nShovel Knight is a fantastic call to nostalgia and is a well-designed game overall. There's also a New Game+ feature where enemies deal more damage to you, and 45 achievements to collect in all! Thankfully you don't even need to open the Steam overlay to see what achievements you have, because at the main menu you can select "Feats" so see all of your accomplishments. The game is playable both with and without relics, so the game is as challenging as you want it to be. Can you dig it? I sure can!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=390117464\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 9, 2015","true","33.6"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","23","37","0","3"

All those flashy reviews praising it all over the place. Then I played it - finished it in two sittings and I liked it. It was good. It had charme, controlled just fine and had a decent difficulty. I had a fun couple of hours with it, but all in all I wasn't as impressed as I anticipated to be. I played through it a second time though - for Butt-Mode alone - so kudos to the developers for that :D\n\nAnyways, Shovel Knight got an update – and this update did it for me. Plague Knight, for me at least, is very enjoyable to play. I love the countless options to suit his abilities to your playstyle and I love to go at this game with a totally different way of thinking. The levels themselves haven't changed that much (although they've been adjusted to Plague Knights abilities), but still this felt like almost a new game. Shovel Knight and Plague Knight play considerably different and playing as Plague Knight elevated the game immensely for me.\n\nNow let's get to the other changes. The story in Plague Knights campaign is wholly different from Shovel Knights. It plays out as an alternate universe of sorts, where Shovel and Plague Knight's paths cross from time to time. Plague Knight has his own motives, his own hub and even a sensible setup for this hub to make sense in the original universe. There are a lot of small touches, which make the story interesting and give you those "aha"-moments with regards to Shovel Knights campaign.\nFor example:  The Hall of champions does not sport ghosts as main enemies, but Knights. This gives you the feel, that you as Plague Knight set up the Hall of champions for Shovel Knight. You destroy the knights and thus make room for the ghosts.\n\nPlague Knight has his own expansive set of upgrades, which comes in several forms. Upgrades for his basic bomb throwing, his charge-bomb-jump-thingy, his "up+x"-move and his cloak. Theres is a ton of options for you to play around with. I got stuck with the Samus Aran-Way of doing things. Jumpy spin attack + the ability to bounce of walls. Died this way at times - totally worth it!\n\nAnyways, as a free update, this is totally worth your time. Some may not like Plague Knights kinda "sloppy" movement and his jumping ability - but it does give you a new challenge and provides you with a cutesy story along the way.\n\nFor me, personally, this update was the kicker Shovel Knight needed to get my full approval. It was a good game from the start - now it is an excellent game, worthy of your undivided attention.\n\nBtw: Yacht Club Games, please keep your love for details at this awesome level you got going. Small touches, like Percy (being a horse and all) actually kicking a lever, instead of using it normally – this is the stuff that makes me smile from ear to ear!","September 21, 2015","true","14.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Shovel Knight is a superbly developed platformer that adds various genres from older games into the mix; You have some influence from Megaman regarding your freedom of choice in which stage you can pick first, Super Mario (for obvious reasons), a little Metroidvania in there, and some LoZ. While it may be quite a task to list which game mechanics have been inspired by specific games of the genre that I've aforementioned, I'll spare you the details and point out the good points of this phenomenal revival of the classic platformer.\n\n-Good story, with the cliche of saving the "princess" (Shield Knight), but nevertheless a good story\n\n-An expanse map that features the areas and territories governed by other enemy knights you have yet to face. Plus, side quests of all difficulties can be accessed, allowing for more replay value even after you beat the storyline!\n\n-There is a Mana mechanic included, which allows you to pull off special moves during any tough situations!\n\n-Digging and harvesting jewels is practically the backbone of this game. While this may sound like an effort, it's actually quite addicting (and easy) to rack up thousands of jewels in-game. Plus, you can reward yourself by upgrading Shovel Knight with more health and mana! However, it's just as easy to lose money as it is to gain; the difficulty of the game is reasonable, and if you're not careful, you may find yourself losing scores of that hard earned cash.\n\n-Armor Upgrades that alter your defenses, attack capability, and general physics in platforming. Each one has its pro's and con's well balanced in such a way that no armor is "stronger" than the other.\n\n-In addition to your Armor Upgrades, you gain access to Shovel Upgrades as well during that same point of the game. Again, each has its pro's and con's. These moves deplete your mana bar varying in strength of the attack respectively.\n\n-Each knight that you battle is equipped with a quirky personality, generally regarding it's motif. This results in commendable characterization. And the dialogue is memorable as well.\n\n-Amazing soundtrack that captures the moment of each stage setting.\n\nUltimately, this game is a must-have for all you avid old-school gamers out there. As stated before, a little bit of everything from the classics have been incorporated into this game, so it never grows stale. Would highly recommend!\n\n","November 24, 2014","true","10.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

If you were to round up a group today's best game developers who grew up with an NES, Genesis, or SNES in their home, and send them back to 1991 to make a game with all the knowledge and skill they had in 2014, Shovel Knight is what you would end up with.\n\nThis game is stellar. I really can't find anything bad to say about it. As I write this review in July of 2014, it's easily the best video game I've played this year. It's very popular and very trendy nowadays to make "indie" games using pixel art, but no game of that style that I've played has even come close to what Shovel Knight is doing here. This is a labor of love by people who love video games, and who have loved video games for a long time.\n\nAnyone who doesn't play this game is doing themselves a disservice, especially if your a gamer of a certain age. Few video games are capable of magic. Shovel Knight is one of the ones that is.","July 21, 2014","true","10.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The 8-bit music is great and suits perfectly the game.\n\nNow that the style is out of the way, I will focus on the flesh of the game:\nThe Shovel Knight has to battle through 8 levels and their associated boss before being able to tackle the final levels and the final boss. A few other levels or boss fights exist on the world map, which is presented in a style reminiscent of Super Mario Bros 3. Unlike Super Mario Bros 3 there is only one world map to explore, so the game might appear short (around 8-10h), but each level is long and received so much care and is so unique that Shovel Knight is really a tight experience that doesn't overstay this welcome or feels like a repetitive grind.\n\nI started this section with the description of the levels on purpose, because each level is actually very unique and has its own gameplay quirks and its own visual style and its own original boss fight. This is really where the game shines, in its variety of situations associated with an excellent level design.\n\nThe Shovel Knight is able to perform a drop-down attack with his shovel, which will be at the center of the gameplay. Some harder sections require to navigate through screens only with drop-down attacks. Some platforms can only be activated with a drop-down attack on a switch. Some secret places can be accessed through a drop-down attack then rebound on an enemy.\nThe combat features a lot of different enemies with their own visual style and attacks. Unlike recent Rayman or old Mario games where enemies feel more like a moving obstacle rather than a dangerous threat, Shovel Knight requires more subtlety and fighting skills.\nA secondary attack which can be equipped with a wide range of magic powers helps deal damages or evade them.\n\nThe only real controversial point about the game is that a player loses money upon dying. The money can be retrieved on the location of death, but it can sometimes be impossible to retrieve. The good thing is that there is an incentive not to die even though there are no finite "lives" and that it creates mini-challenges, the bad thing is that some levels can squeeze their fortune out of the player and will make it harder on already struggling players.\n\nOverall, Shovel Knight is a polished game full of personality made by talented developers, it offers a tight and satisfyingly challenging experience, and shines through its perfect gameplay and excellent level design. An easy recommendation for anyone looking for a good action-platformer.","February 25, 2015","true","10.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I'm still a fan of games like castlevania, megaman or the mario series, but most of the other games are not very good and hasn't aged well in my opinion.\n\nSaying this, I love shovel knight, is a game that made a good mix of 8 bit gameplay with modern gameplay. This is a game where difficulty is skill related and not unfair like some games from the NES era. The levels are well designed, with tons of secrets locations that require some strategy to reach. Also the shovel mechanics are remniscent to the duck tales series, which is great since makes the plataforming very funny.\n\nGraphics are great, isn't like most indie games where one has the feel that they used nes sprites for laziness or skill rather than artistic direction. The animations are superb and do a good job on telling the emoions of some characters. I's true, Shovel Knight pulls things that couldn't be used on a real NES, but still, is a game that feels close to those game from the final years of the console.\n\nMusic is also good, nothing to write home about but makes his job well. The writing is also well done, it has a great sense of humour and the story gets an emotional ending that will make you want for more.\n\nIn conclusion, shovel knight is one of he best games that I had played this last year, is a proof that kickstarter games could work when you put realistic goals, and is a test that you can make 8 bit games this day that doesn't feel lke lazy jobs and that could get the status of timeless clasic,","February 24, 2015","true","5.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Such an amazing nostalgia trip for those of us who remember what it was like being a child growing up in the late 80's / early 90's. Some new age gamers might not "get it". The game is as casual or difficult as you want it to be depending on the items you collect throughout the journey, so it's definitely a game that can be played by everyone.\n\nThere is checkpoint system implemented in the stages so it's casual but after the tutorial stage you are given the option to destroy the checkpoints you come in contact with, for hardcore gamers this is a Godsend. If anyone remembers games where dying at a boss meant repeating the entire level over again, this is for you. Honestly I don't remember any NES game that did this, most games had checkpoint systems implemented and I feel it's a bit of a misnomer and hyperbole...\n\nThe music is created by the incredibly talented Jake Kaufman of Contra 4, Double Dragon Neon and Mighty Switch Force fame just to mention a few. It's definitly no slouch in terms of catchy tunes so it'll keep you thinking about the game long after you've shelved it.\n\nIt borrows game play elements from games like Mega Man, Zelda II, Ducktales and Super Mario Bros. 3 just to give an example of what to expect. There is a small upgrade system implemented but it doesn't take control over the game entirely. You still have to earn most of your upgrades through good old fashioned game play and I thought it was a fine balance. It'll give you an edge in the early game to buy out shops but aftewards you will have to rely on some skill which could proove frustrating to some gamers not used to those sorts of elements.\n\nI found the game fair in difficulty, none of the stages are "easy" but none of them are overly frustrating either. I noticed the game never ramped in difficulty too much, it kind of goes up a notch with each new wave of bosses and seems to level off from there. With some replayable factors such as New Game+, it will keep you coming back to try again. The only way to get good at games like this is to keep playing and memorize them, it will become more enjoyable if you plug in the hours.\n\nThe one big peeve I have about the game is the sloppy level design, I found it a bit erratic at times and too random. The one big flaw with this game is the way it flows and that could proove to be an issue for speed running. The relics are all hidden off the beaten path but once aquired could be used to create shortcuts through most main stage obstacles.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a flawless masterpeice but it's definitely a sleeper hit / hidden gem type game like Little Sampson, Whomp 'Em or Panic Restaurant... it definitely has charm and you can tell passion was put in to it. If this was released 20 years ago it would more than likely have a large cult following today and be worthy of being sold at auctions for hundreds of dollars.\n\nIf you enjoy old school games, you will definitely put the effort in to playing this and will be rewarded for your effort of growing to love this game even more. If you're not good at retro style games, you should probably steer clear of this title as you're bound to be disappointed and think it's terrible... when it really isn't.\n\nOverall if I had to rank this game, which is stupid and subjective, it's an 8 out of 10... the pros far outweigh the cons. It's a great game if you give it a chance.","June 27, 2014","true","26.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","4","4","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/broham65/recommended/250760/","broham65","Zenn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/broham65/","80 products in account","I have played many games in the era of NES. Megaman. Metroid. Rygar. Ducktales. Castlevania. Super Mario Bros. Legend of Zelda.\n\nAll of these games. These challenging, challenging games, and its here in 2014, where I find a game that absolutely trumps each and everyone one of my NES favorites. It has the level design, the aesthetic, the music, the artstyle, and most of all: The challenge.\n\nThis game is by far, one of the most fun, and sometimes the most challenging, of all the 8-Bit Classic Platformer type games that I have ever played. This game takes all of my feelings for Mario Bros. 3, Ducktales, Castlevania, Megaman, and just, combines it into one sweet package.\n\n-When you play, the system that acts as your "lives" so to speak, is replaced with instead "loot". In stages, you collect gold, treasure, gems, and jewels from either chests, mounds of dirt in the ground that you dig up, or secret parts of the wall where you'd have to hit as if Castlevania in search for chicken. When you do die, however, your total loot will be decreased by a good chunk, and three bags of loot will fly up into the air awaiting for you to recollect them when you return from the checkpoint.\n\n-Speaking of chicken, you do have a lifebar like Castlevania and Megaman, which you are able to fill up by finding either random apples or carrots strewn about the stage, or finding a platter of chicken/turkey in the walls. However, those platters don't always contain chicken.\n\n-Jump and Attack. With Jump, you basically jump. You can attack while jumping, so theres that out of the way. With attack, you are able to either slash the air, or dig piles of dirt and rock laid around the stages to collect treasure and gems. At some points, you are able to slash at certain blocks in the walls, and collect more bountiful treasure, that which acts as your lives. When jumping, if you hold the down button, your shovel will point to the ground like Scrooge McDucks cane, and you can jump off of, and deal damage to enemies, or jump off of blocks of dirt and sand. Some secrets will require you to have an enemy or two alive to jump up to higher heights.\n\n-When you move, The momentum of Shovel Knight as you play him feels somewhat like Megaman and Simon Belmont's movement speed, if not just a little bit faster, but far more manouverable. This helps give people that played games like Castlevania and Megaman a familiar sense of movement from old games, and give people just getting into this type of game a comfortable feeling for whats in store.\n\n-The music made by the Jake Kaufman, or known as "Virt", along with some added tracks by Manami Matsumae, who herself composed the music for Megaman, is absolutely top-notch, and gets you rearing to go into this 8-bit Adventure. It is very upbeat, and action-packed, and pairs well alongside each stage you'll visit.\n\n-The Challenge you'll find in this game is somewhat subjective, but from what I have found, the challenge aspect curved up at an excellent pace. It starts off somewhat slow, letting you get a feel of the game at first, and then gets progressively harder and harder, but never making your deaths its own fault, but rather your own for either going in too hard or messing up on your own prediction.\n\nThis is a game much like Megaman and Castlevania, where you are required to assess each new situation, sometimes with great caution. Unlike Megaman, however, but more like perhaps, Super Mario World, you can run in to several checkpoints throughout the stage, represented as a clear crystal adorned atop of a golden shaft sticking from the ground. Run past one of those and you'll activate it. IF you're feeling risky, you can get yourself some extra loot by striking the checkpoint three times, and gain a good few hundred in treasure, but destroying the checkpoint in the process.\n\nThe bosses you'll fight are all represented as Knights, and unlike Megaman, but more like Castlevania, no boss will have one single weakness, but with each item you find, you'll have a variety of different ways to go about beating them. And as well unlike Megaman, you can redo the stage, and as well re-fight the boss. That can be taken as awesome or annoying, personally I thought it was cool.\n\nIf you don't take my word for it, then let me say this. I haven't bought a game, or have gotten a game the "legit" way since 2012, not unless someone gifted it to me.\n\nThis is one game, which I tell you here and now: You should not pirate this. Yacht Club Games, deserves every pound, penny, dollar, ounce, ruppee for making such an incredible, challenging, and fun game.\n\nBuy this game.","June 30, 2014","true","24.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

It not only successfully replicates the aesthetic and design philosphies of the 8bit era games that it's paying homage to (primarily Mega Man) but it manages to, in my opinion, be straight up better than those games in nearly every way.\n\nEven if you found titles like Mega Man 2 to be too archaic for whatever reason, Shovel Knight adds in enough modern convenience through the likes of intelligently placed checkpoints to allow practically anyone to succeed.  For those wanting a more traditional challenge, you can manually destroy those checkpoints to get bonus gold - a great example of scalable difficulty.\n\nThe audio visual aesthetic is sublime - it does its best effort to stay within the confines of the NES's hardware while cheating slightly to expand upon the color pallette and allow environmental/lighting effects.  If you're even remotely fond of chiptune music, the OST here should be enough reason for you to check this title out.\n\nSeriously, just pick this title up.

I purchased it after having heard the rave reviews and I must say that I was not disappointed.\n\nThe game at its basest level almost reminded me of the classic Megaman games, though, instead of an arm cannon you use a shovel to defeat your enemies.  That same shovel is also used as a pogo stick to bounce off of the environment as well as your enemies, and is a tool that the game requires you to master especially toward the end when timing and control are all that stands between you and a gruesome death.\n\nThe map phase of the game takes place on a map that is reminiscent of Mario Bros. 3, with levels, towns to purchase items from, and adventure locations sprinkled across it.  Each of the levels that you play has a theme based around the boss, and each of these these levels unlocks an ability similar to those that that particular boss has.  By the end of the game you're capable of swapping between a large supply of tools acquired from previously defeated enemies, some of which are dangerous weapons, others are invaluable tools.  Combine this aspect with the ability to purchase health and mana upgrades, a variety of items, and armor and weapons, and you've got a significant amount of lite-RPG added into the formula.\n\nThe story is rather light in the game (as you might expect) though it does convey the sense of urgency that Shovel Knight has in rescuing his love, Shield Knight, from the clutches of evil.  As far as action-platformers go, I was pleased with the story and it kept me entertained.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to any one particularly enjoys action-platformers with a touch of RPG, and would suggest the game to anyone else who has an open enough mind.  Just be prepared to scream obscenities at your computer screen for half an hour until you finally experience the sweet taste of victory.","May 2, 2015","true","6.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

That could just be me however. The soundtrack is done true to style and incredibly well, you'll most likely be looking up the songs pretty quickly after hearing them.\n\nThe story is basically any NES game's story, a simple tale of saving the kingdom from an evil force. Nothing much, but then again, that's intentional! Not every game needs a sweeping plot full of twists and turns, after all. The dialogue is full of humor, whether intentional or not.\n\nThe game may be a little too difficult for some, full of moments in which you'll be thrown into bottomless pits by knockback. The difficulty is just as retro as the rest of the game, which isn't always something people go for.\n\nAll in all, if you enjoyed the platformers of the NES days or are just looking for a difficult yet fair platforming game for the PC, get Shovel Knight.\n\nP.S.: Use a gamepad.","October 2, 2014","true","6.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This NES-esque platformer captures the spirit of retro gaming by combining quirky characters, iconic gameplay elements from Castlevania, Ducktales, and Zelda II, and a FANTASTIC soundtrack that I still listen to every day (kudos to one of my favorite VGM composers, Jake Kaufman)!\n\nForgiving in the way that there are no game overs and plenty of ways to get past each screen, ranging from pure shovel tactics to using an invincibility charm to bypass it altogether if something gets too frustrating. For the hardcore (like me!), the game offers plenty of freedom to make your playthrough VERY hard through its achievements! I cannot describe how awesome it felt to hear the staff roll theme reprise after completing the game without dying.\n\nPick it up for yourself and your friends!

Add in touches of the Duck Tales pogo and Adventure Time-esque NPCs, and you're getting the idea.  Sure, plenty of games are trying to do 8-bit retro now, but Shovel Knight is possibly the most polished, well designed example of how it should be done right.\n\nGraphics:  Obviously there is more detail than an original NES game, but everything is bright and clear like Mega Man.  Enemies and projectiles stand out so nothing is ever cluttered.  The designs are unique on regular enemies as well as the bosses and NPCs and everything is animated well.  The stages all have their own personality and look great.\n\nSound: virt (with a cameo by Manami Matsumae of Capcom fame) has made a catchy chiptune soundtrack which fits the game well.  I have to give him extra credit for each Order boss having their own boss theme, which I certainly wasn't expecting.  I'm waiting on the physical cd to see how well it works outside game, but I have every expectation I will still enjoy it and it definitely is enjoyable in game.\n\nDesign & Challenge:  Perhaps over everything else, the level design is where the game really shines.  You can tell how much work went into getting this just right.  Playing through just once so far I died plenty, but with repetition over difficult parts you can see just how smoothly a stage flows when done right.  Just as a basic playthrough things were never maddeningly difficult, however the feats (achievements) are certain to test the very best platformer veterans.\n\nFun:  This game is very fun!  It has it's own style and clearly a sense of humor, but what will get me back to it is the feeling of getting that platformer on Nintendo that you will go back to time and again, even if you blaze through it. I highly recommend this game!","June 28, 2014","true","16.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Every level has its own enemies and mechanics with simple patterns that later create unique obstacles for the player. There are a few checkpoints on the way to the level's boss and I really appreciated that; Shovel Knight can be quite hard, but fair. Most of my deaths were a result of impatience and I was able to learn from them, I never got stuck for too long. The magic abilities were also a big help.\nOverall it's a really refreshing platformer with beatiful art style and music.

Some of them are quite good, while most of them don't quite hit the mark. Shovel Knight doesn't belong in either of these categories. It belongs in the category of "nailed it". Upon starting up Shovel Knight (which I had been waiting for for a very, very long time), I was hit by music that reminded me of the music I heard in games I played as a kid. Progressing through the game, the rest of the music got even better, one of the tunes still stuck in my head after I put the game down. Music isn't the only thing the game has going for it, though.\n\nThe graphics look just like you'd expect a game inspired by the NES/SNES era to look like: pixelly, and gorgeous. The backgrounds are beautiful, the enemy designs are awesome, and the boss designs are absolutely incredible. The gameplay is tough at times, but the controls are good enoug hthat with a bit of practice, the tough areas can be conquered with ease. The dialogue is hilarious at times (there's an NPC that you can interact with solely for puns), and at other times it can be pretty cheesy. There's plenty to do even after you unlock everything from the shops (collecting the different songs, collecting all relics, New Game+, etc.).\n\nWith that all said, that doesn't mean there aren't a couple things I didn't like. The lack of shovel upgrades, for example, is rather disappointing. However, these small qualms are very much shadowed by all the positives that hte game offers. Having already beat Shovel Knight the first time through, I can say I'm already prepared to hop back into New Game+ and continue the adventure. Even after that, there's still perfecting each stage and boss.\n\nThrough all of that, I'd say that Shovel Knight is definitely worth the $15 and you should pick it up as soon as you possibly can if you were even remotely interested in it. Any fan of platformers (especially Mega Man) will adore this gem.\n\nTo sum it up in just three words: I dig it.","June 26, 2014","true","15.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Its not the most difficult platformer in the world so newbies shouldn't have much trouble but the experienced platform gamer will still find it rather satisfying to play. The controls are simple, easy to learn and reasonably responsive, the level and boss design are awesome and the story is...ahh...so so... But in Shovel Knight's defence, it's more about the gameplay and thats where it shines most brightly.\n\nTo sum it all up, Shovel Knight is sure to please anyone who enjoyed NES gaming as a past time, because it takes the best parts of some real classics while still feeling fresh and unique.

This game is ment to be a nice throwback to the NES era of gaming.  The fuel for this game is nostalgia, through and though.  Also much like the NES era of gaming, you could have games about, roughly any sort of weird nonsense you can throw together and alot of it would stick because it was origonal.\n\nShovel Knight plays like alot of your favriote games if you are old enough to have been raised by Nintendo.   You play as the title character, Shovel Kight, who is an honorable knight who weilds a fearsome shovel to vanquish his foes!  Shovel Knight himself is likeable, though his backstory cliche' he really is the honrable type, and trys to talk his way out of a situation before being accosted.\n\nThe Level designs are great, unqiue, and each one offers a diffrent experience (Personal favriote and most hated is the graveyard level.), there are two towns, a host of bizzare characters within, and all of the bosses have just about as much personallity as you do.  The other knights are also based on simmiler gimmicks, like Plague Knight, King Knight, Specter Knight, and each boss battle is rather enjoyable.\n\nThe game does take a measure of skill, it starts off nice and easy and has a gentle learning curve to never make it frustrating.  There are also plenty of hidden easter eggs and secrets strewn across the levels for you to find, from music notes, to more gems, to strange fish-fruit people.  Shovel Knight himself has a large arsonal of relics to use, each also new and unique with that perfect edge of fun and nothing feels worthless.\n\nSo, overall if you crave the olden days and tripple A hasn't been scratching your itch for awesome RPG like settings, or if you permanatly wear your nostalgia goggles I can recomend Shovel Knight to you.\n\nFor Shovelry!","August 30, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I havent finished the game yet so i dont know if the game is either long or short, and I dont plan to look at any other reviews to check if so, but i do know that there is an achievement where you have beat the game in 1hour and 30minutes so i guess that just about explains it. Now i'm going to narrow down the game for you and will put a few shovel puns in here because I am a horrible person.\n\nYou're a knight with a shovel. The shovel doesn't have mystical powers. It does have special abilities with just a few purchases, but all and all, It's just a normal, blue, steel(?) shovel, you dig? Your land is being taken over by a bunch of evil knights, and you could just take them down one by one, but oh no! Your partner is missing, so you have to do it anyway...(what???). But hey, don't throw in the trowel! With enough upgrades and support from the people you encounter along your journey, you'll surely dig those big bad knights a grave or two. (It hurts. The puns are actually hurting me.)\n\nI've been anticipating this game for a very long time now and was not at all dissapointed and I hope the developers at Yacht Club Games continue to make great games like this in the near future.\n\n9.5 out of 10","June 30, 2014","true","12.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You collect gems and you can dig them out of the groud.\nIf you feel really special, you can even use your shovel as a pogo stick, don't question it man.\nYou can even kill other knights, because they're broke and don't have quarters. They can't even play an arcade machine, man.\nIf you go to a town, you can get stuff. If the game is too hard, cheat. If it isn't then don't, 'cause that's stupid.\nI like this game, I'd dig it out in spades, but I suppose it depends what kind of hole you dig yourself into. I personally want to plow it right up. I like this game so much that I think about it every knight. I personally don't think they truly steel anything. You dig?\nBad jokes aside, whether you like the NES style or not, you should still pick up this game. It takes every good game mechanic, refines them, and steels the NES art style and instruments.

Don't wait and buy it when it is on sale, that would be doing a disservice to not only Yacht Club Games and Shovel Knight, but also yourself (This may or may nit be true).\n\nNow with that out of the way, let's start with my review.\n\nStory:\nShovel Knight puts you in the shoes of the titular character as he travels throughout the land to stop "The Order of No Quarter" and "The Enchantress" with shovel in hand. That is really all that is needed of the plot, since the game is an homage of games past which also lacked in the plot department. This isn't a bad thing, since it has enough of a plot to give you an excuse for the adventure at hand.\n\nGraphics:\nShovel Knight looks beautiful! Fantastic pixel art is on display for the whole journey, with each area having a distinct visual flavour to it. You'll travel to all sorts of fantastical locales, ranging from an ancient underground city to an airship in the skies.\nEach member of "The Order of No Quarter" also look fantastic, each having an interesting design to them.\n\nSound:\nFor the most part (read: 98% of the game), Shovel Knight has a wonderful chiptune soundtrack, each delightful tune is easy on the ears and you can find yourself humming along to each one. The sound effects are also excellent. They sound great, but never overpower the fantastic music. There was only ever one tune in the whole game I did not like, mainly because it sounded rather generic for where you are in the game.\n\nGameplay:\nThe only thing I can say about the controls in Shovel Knight is that they are sublime! Everytime you die, you can tell it was your fault for messing up a jump or taking a hit, not the game being cheap. Each time you die, you lose a portion of you gold, but it will float in bags until you collect them or die again, so you have a chance ro regain you lost gold. By the end of the intro stage, you'll have the basic controls mastered, and the game doesn't even tell you how to do any of the moves so you have to learn to do them on your own. The only thing the game tells you how to do is how to use your current relic, which is classic Catlevania controls (Up+Attack).\nEach level is wonderfully handcrafted so that you face a specific set of challenges in each stage. I only got stumped once on where to go in one of the stages because where I had to go looked like a bottomless pit. Each boss fight is unique in how they fight, and there are more bosses than just "The Order of No Quarter" and "The Enchantress".\nAnd unlike a game like Mega Man where you will tend to gravitate to one or two weapons, all the Relics in Shovel Knight are useful in some way or another. One of the first relics you can get is the Fishing Rod, which lets you see sparkling areas above bottomless pits which means you can get something worth while by dropping the fishing line and catching something there. Using the Fishing Rod is also required to get some of the secrets in the game, and there are a lot of secrets.\nEach stage is littered with secret areas, be they hidden alcoves or entirely hdden rooms, all of them found with only your wit and some with visual indications (each visual indication is unique to each stage as well). Within these secrets are a plethora of different challenges and rewards, ranging from chests with some bonus gold to new relics. The ones that contain relics have some sort of challenge you have to do in order to familiarize yourself with how the new relic works and to get out safely with all gold intact.\nThere are two towns in the game, each with NPCs that you can talk to for some cute dialogue to merchants that will sell you various items. Standard town stuff. The world map works just like Super Mario Bros. 3, so it is pretty self explanitory.\n\nConclusion:\nShovel Knight is perfect in every way. Great controls great soundtrack, great graphics, and is a perfect homage to the games of yesteryear. With only one tiny blemish to speak of in my honest opinion.\n\nSo my final verdict for Shovel Knight is to buy it without delay!","July 1, 2014","true","48.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Granted, I'm biased because I helped Kickstart the game, but there is so much to love.\n\nMusic is fantastic, the style is wonderful, the color really harkens back to the old NES days, and the game is just fun to play.\n\nFor anyone who has seen Egoraptor's Sequelitis on Megaman X will appreciate the intro stage. Though, not as story driven as Megaman X (with the whole Vile Encounter), the intro stage offers JUST as much learning for the player. It's brilliantly designed. Just like the rest of the levels and how each stage works very hard to introduce new elements and lets you sweat over the perilous situations you're thrown in.\n\nI've seen lots of complaints about instant death. Well of course there's ton, it's a tough game. Are those stages beatable? Of course they are! Any skilled platformer will be able to beat them. Not to say you aren't ;) Just take a breather and try to recognize the patterns.\n\nThe items were, I feel, very lackluster in comparison to the rest of the game. They felt ignorable, and situationally-important. You could beat the game without relics (there's an achievement for that), so they end up feeling quite useless. Tweaking some of the magic costs might help, but they really aren't that useful until you get the armor for them.\n\nOverall, one of the best games you can get today that really tip a hat towards good design. Also, I really liked the story for some reason. It's simple, neat, and I felt something at the end.\n\nAlso. Butt Mode: "X&BUTT" Enter that in the name select screen.

Built to look like games near the end of the 8-bit days, Shovel Knight plays like a mash-up of several games. Fighting is similar to Zelda 2 and Castlevania, and platforming is very tight, so controlling the titular Knight is very easy. There are a couple of frustrating moments that can end up getting catching you out, but a removal of a life system means the only things you lose are distance and money. The boss fights you encounter are simple at first, but slowly become more complicated and require deft gameplay to conquer. Coupled with fast-paced arranges of the stage themes, you'll soon find the one boss that stands out to you, either out of a sense of amazement or a sense of "JUST ONE MORE STRIKE"\n\nThe story is nice enough - it starts out a little cliché, and if you're sharp you'll spot the story's end-game quite quick. The characters are enjoyable (both with personalities and fights) and the world you explore is colourful and interesting (even if there's a bit of cliché here and there)\n\nThe sub-weapons (relics) in the game can allow people still learning how to play platformers expertly to get through tougher parts of the game (eg health potions, anchors that fly in an arc), but don't have to be purchased in order to complete the game. You even get achievements for beating the game in this wa, suggesting to folks that yes, it CAN be done!\n\nThe strongest part of the game, I feel, is the music - so many memorable melodies, from "Plains of Passage" to "The Vital Vitriol", there are very few tracks in the game that won't leave an impression on you. Unsurprisingly, everything is pure chip-tune to match the style of the game - the sort of stuff that you wouldn't be surprised to hear coming from an old NES.\n\nOverall, it has a bit of cliché to it, but Shovel Knight is still very refreshing to play after a host of pure-platformer games. Whilst the developers are still working on additional game modes that range from mainly visual changing modes (similar to Butt Mode, something that changes a few words around) to playing as boss characters in their own stories, as it is right now the game is amazing in its own rights. And at £10.99, you can't go wrong!","August 2, 2014","true","51.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything about it is well designed and well implemented. I suppose Mega Man meets Ducktales is my best description; Shovel Knight can jump, slash, and do a "pogo" jump on the heads of his enemies.\n\nThe game has pretty tight controls despite the retro look, and Shovel Knight is a flexible character that, despite getting lots of abilities through relics, doesn't need them. The game takes a Dark Souls approach to punishing the player for death, spurting out some money each time you die. That money can be picked up again if the player manages not to die before doing so.\n\nThe game isn't very hard, but there is a little bit of a learning curve with shovel mastery. In a way, the game lets you make the game harder by allowing you to destroy checkpoints for cash, forcing you to restart at the beginning of the level if you break them all.\n\nBosses are rather varied, especially considering the sort of game it is. Enemies are, too, as are the environments and obstacles. Shovel Knight can get a few upgrades to his weapon, and a few different armors with different effects. On top of this, he gets 8 "relics" that are optional (they don't come from bosses). Health and mana pools can be expanded and there are chalices that act as "sub" or "e" tanks, except that they are only filled from two particular NPCs and they have three different effects depending on the contents: full HP/MP, treasure magnet and invulnerability for 10 seconds.\n\nI wasn't expecting the story to really be much, but it's silly, light hearted and not all that bad.\n\nIt's around the length of a Mega Man game or Ducktales for a 100% playthrough without a guide, which is about 8 hours, but the game can be completed in a speed run in well under 1:30 or so (there's even an achievement for it). There's a NG+ that makes the game more difficult, and there's a lot of Kickstarter stretch goal content that's not in yet but will be added as free updates later.\n\nThis game doesn't need a pricecut if you're at all fond of the NES era, and it's well worth the $15 bucks even without the extra content in yet.","August 13, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cobaltbw/recommended/250760/","cobaltbw","CobaltBW","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cobaltbw/","66 products in account","Shovel Knight is incredibly well designed.\n\nAt first inspection, it may appear to be just a derivative 8-bit platformer that just borrows elements from Ducktales and Megaman, but not only does it share its ancestors' best traits, it also throws in a lot of its own gameplay mechanics that makes for an interesting and well fleshed out experience.\n\nThere are no lives in this game, so you can infinitely respawn at checkpoints. Where Shovel Knight diverges from the drivel of most game's checkpoints systems is that it has an attached risk-reward system. You can bust the checkpoints and receive more gold, but when you die, you lose gold and have to return to that part of the stage to collect it... and if you busted the checkpoint, returning to that part of the level just becomes much more difficult. It's a means to the same ends as the traditional lives/game over system, but comes with the benefits of being more dynamic and player-controlled, and hence makes replaying stages more interesting.\n\nThe game is quick to get you right in on the action, but it also successfully manages to get the player to care about the story. You can talk to characters, there's an intro cutscene, and several quips of dialogues between Shovel Knight and the boss characters (all of which can be skipped), but what really sets Shovel Knight's story apart is how it melds it into the gameplay, with my favorite design trick being the dream sequence. After the first level, Shovel Knight dreams that Shield Knight is falling, and the player is told to catch her. There is no punishment for failing this. You can just let her fall, wake up and go the next level. But the player WANTS to catch her, he WANTS to succeed in this dream. And when you get out of your dream, you have to wake up yourself, then you can choose how to exit the cutscene. This cutscene is repeated and expanded upon into bonus minigames ("Save her from the monsters!") and the whole thing is completely optional.\n\nThis is damn good story design. Giving the player these moments where they are given direct control over story events creates an emotional attachment to the characters. It establishes a motivating drive for the player which intrinsically ties gameplay to story. And it's all designed in a way that is nonobstructive to gameplay, but rather benefits it by creating clear motivations and expectations for the player. Ever seen Egoraptor's rants on Ocarina of Time in his Sequelitis episode? This is the exact opposite of that. The plot is clear cut. There's no convoluted JRPG story arc ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's just a gameplay-driven story, where the story serves the gameplay instead of the other way around -- a design type I would like to see a lot more of.\n\nThe lore is quite well-fleshed out and enjoyable to explore, but the game's other artistic aspects do not falter behind. The pixel art in this game is gorgeous, enemies are charismatic, well-animated, and diverse in theme and design, and the music... well, the music is created by Jake Kaufman; I think that speaks for itself.\n\nThe game is kinda short but has a lot of replay value. All of the items are unique and fun to use, New Game+ and the achievements (which, by the way, actually all feel really fun and skillful to pursue, unlike a lot of other games' achievement systems) offer lots of ways to amp up the difficulty and explore different aspects of the gameplay, and the stages themselves are well laid out and filled to the brim with secrets.\n\n\n\nI will nitpick on what I think are some of the game's design flaws though:\n\n* There is a disparity in the difficulty of platforming compared to the difficulty of combat. Shovel Knight doesn't throw any cheap shots at you, but it does punish you with instant death whenever you miss your jump on certain areas. This is fine of course, games as old as Super Mario Bros. do this; but you can take up to twenty hits from the enemies themselves, and the stages are full of instant health refill items. I'm personally far less afraid of the bosses than I am of certain platforming segments, and it's of no fault of either element; it's just how the game's punishment system works. If it were me, I would have toned down the player's health a little bit, but I also would have integrated some sort of Dynamite Headdy-style or Zelda-style death pit system, where the player doesn't instantly die and has a chance to recover after falling.\n\n* Phase Locket is easy mode. Doesn't seem like a problem in a non-competitive non-multiplayer game, but it kind of is because it detracts from the player's incentive to experiment with other items. I have to deliberately avoid this item in order to feel like I'm playing the game correctly. This is something I can forgive if the item took a lot of skill to overpower the rest of the selection, but it's pretty disappointing when you realize its power on your first or second playthrough.\n\n* This is kind of personal preference more than anything, but I kinda do like the old lives system better at times. Finite retries creates a tension where the risk of having to start all over heavily incentivizes the player to rethink his plan of action.... Losing money works to the same end while also having a more dynamic checkpoint system attached to it, but because it's just money, it's not always as effective of a motivation as the traditional lives system was.\n\n\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who is interested in platformers, but I'd also recommend this to anyone who's not interested in platformers and just wants a jump-start into the genre. It's easy to get into, has a lot of gameplay depth, and is very immersive for its genre. I can think of very few platformers that would rank as high as this in terms of gameplay quality. At $15, it is easily worth your money; I already have this game for both the WiiU and PC, and I don't regret either purchase.","September 1, 2014","true","30.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The art and music are beautifully well done, giving each level its own feel, and also creating a world to be immersed in. The story is not something that should be looked over, either. A story of heartbreak and vengeance. A quest to save his lost love, taken over by evil. The controls are smooth as silk and any mistakes or deaths are completely your own fault.

If diamond was in the rock paper scissors rotation it would be an automatic win. Shovel Knight is in all diamond, thats why he beats rock, paper, scissors, and even shoot. This game combines a lot of elements you see in the Call of Duty franchise such as The Adventures of Nazi Zombies, or Ghost Tales, and even Castlevania: Lord of Duty. This game gets a well deserved rating of Delicious out of Yummy. I would reccamend you have a powerful computer, so many bits.","July 15, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It pulls together the aspects of platforming that make the genre great, and then adds its own touches to make them even better. The art and music are beautifully well done, giving each level its own feel, and also creating a world to be immersed in. The story is not something that should be looked over, either. A story of heartbreak and vengeance. A quest to save his lost love, taken over by evil. The controls are smooth as silk and any mistakes or deaths are completely your own fault.  The only complaint I have is that it was a little short, but I can imagine someone getting a good 15 hours out of this game if they scrounged for collectibles and took more time to enjoy the little things. 9/10","July 5, 2014","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love this game, and it's a shame I didn't discover this sooner. I recommend this to my friends and all those who want to experience a casual yet fun playthrough or a self-challenging game.\n\nShovel Knight is described by the older players as a love letter to old 8-bit games and a refreshing nostalgic game bringing back childhood memories. But how about to younger players like me, whose childhood was focused on 3D console gaming? I didn't grow up with a lot of 8-bit games, nor have I completed any of them. But playing this was so fun that I brought my laptop everywhere to play on my free time. All of this is new to me, and I feel so thrilled!\n\nControlsFirst, the game's controls were so simple I mastered playing by the end of the first stage. Unlike the other games I've played, I only have to use (my own binding) WASD, E, left arrow, and right arrow keys. Seven keys. The most I used was around twenty. Simplicity is elegance.\n\nChallengesSecond, its challenges. This game has so many frustrating obstacles (lights off! pits! exploding stuff! surprise attacks! WIND! SPIKES! SINE DAGGERS! SCROLLING SCREENS OF DEATH! I hate you so much). All of these obstacles are cleverly crafted to be hard yet manageable, which when the player overcomes these, it gives a real sense of victory. Well, for me I found the wind physics and scrolling screens hard, but after pwning these parts I feel so happy. Then after completing the entire game thrice, I still feel triumphant.\n\nStory, and of course, SpoilersThe main campaign features Shovel Knight on a quest to save his beloved and constantly dreams of her. Simply put: he defeats powerful knights who he never intended to fight, but they're blocking the way to Shield Knight. He even gets to defeat the most powerful evil being in existence. He's a pint-sized dude about to burst from sheer badassery.\n\nIn the first playable boss update, Plague Knight, an insane alchemist, is developed as having emotions and insecurites. He betrays his ruthless and powerful 'companions' to concoct a potion that can get him all he wants. Turns out he only wants the love of his crush and went his way to be stronger in order to woo her. Aww. His story ends with more heart-tugging and cuteness overload.\n\nThis game is an excellent example of a vital rule in creative writing: show and don't tell. We get shown how Shovel Knight loves Shield Knight through dreams and (more subtly) gameplay. We get shown how Plague Knight deals with his inner demons (both emotionally and quite literally). In the ending montages, we see the other knights doing what they like to do/what's happening to them, and they all turn out so adorable and somehow, human.\n\nDevsFourth, the developers are geniuses. Aside from their good storytelling, they made the best DLC I have ever played, they are chipper devs and insert so much funny jokes in the game, and they have so much passion for this game. The Plague DLC was so great it felt like a new game all over again with radically different mechanics yet we know it's just the same. I have so much faith in them to create equally impressive storylines for the two other knights that are in the spotlight.\n\nMusicJake Kaufman's an excellent composer and manages to capture the feel of the stages he composed for. Pridemoor Keep's was majestic, just like how kingdoms are. The Lich Yard's was a blend of creepy and smooth. The Lost City's theme gives an explorer feel. Stranded Ship's song was funky and shows off a powerful thing. Clockwork Tower had a tech-y feel that it somehow reminds me of Portal 2. The Flying Machine's stage song is beautiful. Entrance's theme felt bombastic and victorious. Ascent was a quiet remix of the main theme, and you're so close to your goal. ????'s song was as creepy as Portal 2's Ghost of Rattman or SCPCB's ambience music. Then the finale boss, and the grand finale. Magnificent!\n\nThen we get new music for each Knight DLC. Plague Knight's new songs were a boatload of awesome. One felt clandestine, the others chaotic, and two so lovely and heartwarming. Considering that Virt mentioned in a youtube video of a let's play that he was going through so much at the time of these songs' creation, it definitely shows. He's brilliant, and the music is lovely. You should also go here for music, people.\n\n","October 18, 2015","true","131.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had worried that I would play Shovel Knight, which was supposed to be a true NES style experience and I would be disapointed in the same way I am when I go back to play a nostalgic game from my childhood. Sometimes you boot up that NES and realize, ♥♥♥♥, this game just isn't what I thought it was.\n\nLuckily, Shovel Knight is a game that, how do I say this, it feels like the NES games you remember, even while you play it. Its phenomenal through and through. It eliminates the troublesome elements that ruin the nostalgic experience of playing old NES games such as bad controls, framerate drops, flickers, and unfair arcade driven difficulty.\n\nShovel Knight was an absoute joy for me to play through to 100% progress in about 12-13 hours. The mechanics are fun as hell and before they have a chance to become tiresome you've earned some stellar upgrades that shake things up and allow customization of the way you play.\n\nThe writing was great and fun throughout, my girlfriend constantly remarked on how adorable and cute things were.\n\nThe art style was excellent and they made the old school feel new again with great animations and effects. The characters are master class pixel art and totally fun and unique.\n\nThe game can be extremely difficult, but it mostly always fair and your deaths are usually a result of rushing or failing to regard the mechanics; the mechanics which you are introduced to a steady pace and are ramped up through the game.\n\n***** Plague of Shadows expansion ****\n\nAfter I completed Shovel Knight, I played the Plague of Shadows expansion where you play as one of the villains from the Shovel Knight story. This expansion was approximately another 8-9 hours to 100% completion. Just as the Shovel Knight campaign before it, it was excellent.\n\nEntirely new play mechanics are introduced throughout this campaign. At first they felt very clunky, but I think that was because I had just played the Shovel Knight portion. I very quickly developed experience with the new skills and found them to be an absolute blast to play with.\n\nThe levels are quite different and have a variety of new and interesting mechanics to drive a playthrough as this new character. There are clever new collectables, plus some pretty cool easter eggs that explain to positioning of things in the Shovel Knight campaign.\n\nI found myself on several occasions getting giddy with joy when encountering characters from the first game and the incredibly clever ways the developers tied in a totally new story than runs parralel with Shovel Knights campaign. The ways this is handled are a riot and lead to many awesome and fun encounters with characters you love from the first game.\n\n** Conclusion **\n\nI highly reccomend Shovel Knight as a standalone game, and with the *FREE* Plague of Shadows expansion it becomes even more valuable (plus there are two more boss expansions on the way). This is easily one of my favorite games of all time and I can't wait to see what the next expansion was like. Thank you very much to the developer Yacht Club Games for this astounding piece of videogame history.","November 2, 2015","true","26.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I always knew that it was going to be an amazing game that easily surpasses other games attempting to be retro, yet fresh. I'll say it now, Shovel Knight is the best game that I've played in years. This game's controls are all SNES-TIGHT (that's a good thing). You can easily follow the momentum of Shovel Knight as he runs and jumps. The difficulty is perfectly in place for the era it is portraying and truly feels like a SNES game. The penalties for dying aren't unforgiving, but it's enough to make you think twice before running around without precaution in certain areas. In the game, you have to collect treasure to earn money and buy upgrades for your health, magic, and equipment. This adds a very nice drive to exploring all of the secret areas available in order to become as strong as possible. On top of superb music, bosses, level design, and a "perfectly basic story," (in the sense that it's not complex because it doesn't need to be for this type of game, which is another good thing) the shovel is what makes this game EXTREMELY unique; you can do so many things with it, like finding magical weapons that a hidden merchant will give you in secret areas of the levels throughout the game. Everything about this game is absolutely fantastic! I literally walked away from this game after beating it with nothing bad to say about it. If you are a gamer that appreciates well-made retro games, it is an absolute must-buy that I would recommend everyone playing.","July 17, 2014","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So many games claim to be "8-bit" these days, but nothing has come as close as Shovel Knight in my opinion.  Apart from the widescreen aspect ratio and subtle parallax backgrounds, the gameplay is very NES feeling.  If you loved NES games like Mega Man, Duck Tales, Castlevania, etc., this game will hit your nostalgia button hard!  However, it's gameplay stands on it's own, and is far from a clone.\n\nThe combat itself is simple, with a forward slash and down slash/pogo mechanic that feels very similar to Duck Tales.  Shovel attacks can be upgraded, and there are purchasable Castlevania-esque relics which give you magical combat abilities as well.  The map is structured like Mario 3, with main stages and mini-stages.  The stages themselves feel very similar in structure to both Mega Man and Duck Tales, with separate screens, lots of secrets, and engaging boss battles to conclude each stage.  The music is also very well done (and can be purchased on Virt's bandcamp for "name your price").  Shovel Knight is full of references to many NES greats, but it has it's own charm and feels fresh and unique in a really good way.\n\nI think the best feature of the game is the checkpoint system.  Checkpoints operate on a really nice risk/reward mechanic subtly reminiscent of Dark Souls.  The player has unlimited lives and checkpoints are free to use... However, you can destroy most checkpoints for extra gold and challenge (there is even a feat/achievement which encourages the player to complete the whole game by destroying all checkpoints).  I felt like the gold income vs. upgrade costs kept me hunting for gold, and encouraged me to destroy checkpoints for that extra income.  Yacht Club did a great job with this checkpoint system because it caters to both novice and expert players.  After you finish your first playthrough, NG+ mode doubles enemy damage and cuts over half of the checkpoints out of the game.  The best part about this system is that challenge is available for players like me who want it, but my young children can still enjoy this game as well.\n\nLastly, in addition to NG+ mode, the game has some nice feats/achievements to add another layer of replay value (eg. destroy all checkpoints, finish the game without dying, finish the game in less than 1:30, and more).  There's also a hidden element to the game which adds a TON of new ways to play... For example, it's possible to run the game NG+, no starting items, faster movement, and 1 hit deaths!  I won't spoil anymore :)\n\nTL;DR... Buy this game <3","July 6, 2014","true","16.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The best way to explain Shovel Knight is in terms of other games, so here's what we've got:\n\n--Super Mario Bros 3 style world map (including random bonus levels and bosses that shuffle around).\n--Super Ghouls n' Ghosts style platforming, combat, and level design\n--Duck Tales style cane jump (now a shovel jump of course) and treasure collecting\n--Dark Souls style experience system\n\nAs you platform and shovel-battle your way through each level, you'll want to find and collect as much treasure as you can get your hands on, since treasure is equivalent to XP and can be used to purchase upgrades.\n\nMuch like Dark Souls, however, if you die at any time, ALL OF YOUR GOLD will be dropped and you'll be sent back to the nearest checkpoint. You have one opportunity to make it back to your gold and recollect it or you lose it permanently.\n\nAn interesting twist that is NOT like Dark Souls is that you can actually DESTROY the checkpoints in the level, which gives you a hefty chunk of treasure/XP, but prevents you from using that checkpoint. (If you die, you'll be sent back a LONG way.)\n\nThere are villages on the map where you can spend your treasure to buy HP and MP upgrades. There are also upgrades for your armor and your shovel. You can also purchase various tools and relics (used to cast spells).\n\nThe levels in the game start out challenging, but they can get seriously difficult in some places. The first two bosses (the Black Knight and the King Knight) are pretty simple, but once you get to the third boss (the Lich King), the difficulty ramps up quite a lot. The boss battles are well crafted as well. They provide a lot of challenge, but the bosses have patterns and exhibit "tells" for special attacks, allowing you to learn the boss' techniques and develop your skill at them.\n\nWhile most of the game succeeds at being very challenging without resorting to cheap surprises or death traps, some of the later levels use tactics that will definitely try your patience. In true Dark Souls spirit, prepare to excessively curse and repeatedly protest that you've had about enough of this bu||sh!t only to keep playing anyway. With both Shovel Knight and Dark Souls, it begins with trying to win for fun; and it ends with trying to win because F*CK YOU, MOTHERF*CKING GAME. F*CK YOU RIGHT TO HELL.\n\nAh, good times.\n\nYou can replay levels (including boss fights) as many times as you want for extra money.\n\nVisually, the game appeals to your nostalgia, but the gameplay incorporates many popular conventions from modern games.\n\nIt's an RPG platforming adventure, and it's a pretty good time.","July 4, 2014","true","9.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unlike Mega Man, it has a simple overworld map where you can choose your next destination, be it a boss level, or a town where you can buy upgrades for Shovel Knight. The music is amazing, and probably my favorite part of the game. Again, it's very Mega Man inspired, but much more elaborate than something you could do on a NES.\n\nThe difficulty is just right for the most part, though I did feel like I wanted to punch someone a few times in Plague of Shadows.

Many would call it 'nostalgic', but I personally think it's great in it's own way; aside from the classic graphics and recognisable soundtracks many will recognise from the bit-era.\nIn short:\n\nGOOD\n+ Nice ol' iconic platforming, defeating your enemies, aquiring ways to defeat said enemies... a great formula done almost perfectly and with a bunch of new engaging ideas!\n+ Level design and atmosphere. It's a small game, but filled to the brim with personality. You'll see a lot of old themes like the 'halloween/undead' stage and the always hated ice-stage, but also a lot of fresh mechanics and themes for such a simple platformer.\n+ Bosses deserve their own mention. I always love games with good bosses. I know many feel the same, so here ya go. Definite plus.\n+ Though simple, the story is actually pretty intruiging. You might see all the twists coming, but they still do their own original thing with it. Which is why I like the Shovel Knight and Shield Knight characters quite a lot. It's extremely solid, and open for many new stories to build onto it.\n+ Soundtrack also deserves it's own mention. Though all the iconic sound effects are the way we know them, the music really is the gigantic lovely cherry on top.\n+ There are multiple ways to play the game to give yourself more challenge, and the game also comes with a few achievements to hint at some of these other plastyles!\n\nNOT SO GOOD\n- I played it on a keyboard but I admit it would probably be FAR nicer with a controller. So if you don't have one the controls might be a bit annoying.\n- Relatively short. It has pretty good replayability, but somehow you still feel like they could've done so much more. Especially when you look at the Mario3-esque overworld map going on.\n- Instant-death spikes? Yes. But it's about the worst kind; the sideways ones. Slip one pixel to much to the left at a snail pace? Dead. It's reaaally something platformers should abolish for some more creative ideas. Dying to a boss at a difficult fight is challenging and fun. Doing an entire section of platforming without a scratch and dying right before a checkpoint? Frustrating.\n- Though I earlier praised the music. It tends to change to another version EVERYtime you enter another section of a town or something. Normally, this is great, gives every section it's own feel. But here it's actually taking away the atmosphere it's supposed to give because it keeps switching every 4 seconds when you're running through the towns.\n\n\nAnd that's basically it aside from some personal thoughts. I could be getting a little bit ahead of myself by saying Shovel Knight, the character, would be perfect lined up to the likes of Mario and Sonic. If only in extremely iconic design and the world his character lives in. Extremely simple, but very recognisable and engaging.  For example, I wouldn't be surprised to see him or Shield Knight in Smash Bros, things like that. I'd personally love to see far more of this, so I hope the team is planning on expanding this fun world of knighthood and I recommend this to any one who's up for a good old school challenge!","January 24, 2015","true","55.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Need another platformer as of old in your life? Simply buy this game.\n\nThat's the gist of this game; it is probably the best platformer this year, and if it wasn't for Rayman Origins and Legends, I'd say this is the best platformer in the past five years.\n\nWhat Shovelry is This?\nWhat's the best way to describe this game? Think of Megaman-like bosses, each one has a theme and style of attacks; Castlevania (older ones) controls meant for two button controllers, with relics activated with up and attack button, and special items (relics in this game); and Duck Tales hopping and loot, which you actually want, to increase your character's health, mana, armor, shovel blade techniques and relics.\n\nAll these gameplay ideas and level designs comes together beautifully in this game. Neither game mentioned here feels like it was added in for a gimmick or was neglected.\n\nThe controls irked me at first, resorting to the retro Castlevania mechanic of UP and ATTACK to use an item. However, once you get used to it, everything else is buttery smooth with full control over your character's jumping and movement. You are not terribly slow as Simon Belmont nor fast as Mario; the best sort of comparsion I can think of in terms of speed is playing as Megaman X without the boost ability.You only need to tap the down button to activate your down-thrust attack, not hold it, and to quickly change back to standing just press the ATTACK button to stop yourself. Some obstacles will require you to stop yourself from destroying the platform beneath you.\n\nThe most important thing is that Shovel Knight got the job done right for a platformer: You are liable for your own deaths, not the game's limitations on you.\n\nDifficulty along with certain cheats (yes, a game from 2014 actually has cheats that will amp up the difficulty and/or break the game) encourage you to replay this game in a variety of ways.\n\n[If you want a full list, check this link:] http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=280263875\n\nThere are also some in-game things you can do to add or lessen the difficulty such as destroying checkpoints for extra loot and having goblets to give you health, temporary invincibility and a magnet for loose treasure bags. Some achievements will require you to play the game in certain ways, if you care for them, so I think the replay value is above standard but nothing too exceptional.\n\nMy only complaint I have about the way the game handles difficulty is I have to cheat to play the game NG+ mode from the start (without carrying equipment). You can still get achievements by playing the game normally on a different save file. (NG+ mode, by the way, increases the damage you take from enemies and environment hazards. Vanilla NG+ mode is all right, you just start with everything unlocked from your save from the get-go.)\n\nFor the best experience, I'd recommend playing this game from the start in NG+ mode for hardcore platformer fans.\n\nThe Superb Qualities of a Challenging, Not Hard, Game\nLevel design is a hit or miss for some; they are five-minute bursts full of themed gimmicks and challenges. I thought the approach was novel and true to its NES roots. No two obstacles and/or platforms felt the same.\n\nFor example, the underwater area has tentacles to hop on over pits of death and spikes on the roof with higher jumping physics underwater. The magma area has green globs to hit on enemies and lava pits to make them less dangerous and being able to jump on with your shovel. The flying stage has gusts of wind that require you to make your way around blocks and scaffolding in a certain way.\n\nI can go on, but as you can see, there is more to each level than a simple paint-job. Some enemies do reappear with some added quirks suited to the stage hazards, like the knights with shields.\n\nIn the King Knight stage, they're simple; they block, they hit. In the Treasure Knight stage, they have a different color to designate them AND they toss anchors in a parabola direction that makes them more dangerous than before. In the Propeller Knight stage, they fly and have the ability to blow you around. Some other common knights with shields have more or less HP.\n\nBosses. The best way I can describe these bosses is to recall my favorite boss fight, ever: Fighting Zero from Megaman X2. If you recall, Zero didn't have a set-list of attacks that had a pattern to them, rather, he fought based on some moves he had and also where you are in relation to the boss. All of the boss fights in this game have that same feel and I absolutely love it.\n\nIf I go based on how many boss encounters there are, there are 24 fights, some are random encounters on the overworld map or hidden bosses in NPC areas. Like Megaman, you fight 8 masters/knights and then you fight them again in a gauntlet, one after the other. Also, you fight your rival three times, slightly different in each encounter. You can rely on your Shovel wits alone to beat them or use your relics as tools to win the battle.\n\nOut of all the boss fights in the game,. The Tinker Knight is the only let down because is so stupidly easy. Twenty-three other encounters more than enough make up for that.\n\n[h1"It's only ]FOUR HOURS!?"[/h1]\n\nGame length is the one most people are worried about. This varies from person to person, but if I had to set a length on a blind playthrough, going 100% will take you from 5 to 10 hours.\n\nI finished this game in six hours with an 84% completion rate, mostly from the musical sheets I didn't want to find. Just like the games it idolizes, the game is meant to be short, satisfying and wanting you to come back to replay it for fun. The cheat-list greatly adds to the replay value, so I'd say this is easily worth $15 for those undecided.\n\nDig Thy Shovel. Squire!\nLastly, this game is FUN. Remember that word? Want to watch a giant king apple fish dance? Want to hear puns knightly to cheer up a stubborn toad? Want to smack potions into the walls for points in a mini-game for treasure? You can do that and more in the game. This is a game that not only was crafted in memoration of the glory days of platformers but also has an amount of admiration for the game itself.","July 11, 2014","true","17.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

The graphic, the soundtrack etc. The story is a knight caled Shovel Knight who use a shovel (duh) as weapon of choice goes to battle other knights and fight the final boss. The story is not so remarkable and you can see the plot from miles away. No plotholes though. Story progression is so like Megaman (big fan here); fight 8 bosses, go to final stage, re-fight the bosses again, then fight the final boss in 2 round fight. So if you're into great story and plot, you gotta lower your expectation for this game.\n\nThe best part is the gameplay. As I mentioned before, this is 2D platforming, so lots of jumping involved. There are many things you can do with your shovel; attack enemies, dig treasures, pogo jump like in Duck Tales, upgrade it to add special attack, bury dead bodies.... forget the last one. There is no difficulty setting, but there is New Game+ which is harder than normal; enemies do more damage, less checkpoints. There are music sheet s to collect if you're into collecting stuff. You can upgrade health and magic in the game with money. There's no heart upgrade or find4-pieces-to-upgrade stuff. You also need money to get upgrades for armor and shovel. And to buy relics.\n\nUnlike Megaman games whre you get special weapon from bosses, this one doesn't have it. Instead, you get relics which is usually buy from store. You can find the store inside the town or secret places in the stages. The relics cost magic when used si you cannot spam them. Some for only help killing the enemis while some helps with the platforming stuff like the sword (air dash ftw) and phase amulet. Relics are fun to use, so experiment with all of them.\n\nGraphic? It's 8-bit style. Need to say more?\n\nThe soundtracks is 8-bit music. So if you're not in 8-bit music style, you have hard time listening to it in the entire game. I personally enjoyed the music as well as other 8-bit music from other game. You can listen to the soundtrack for free here http://virt.bandcamp.com/album/shovel-knight-original-soundtrack\n\nThere are some things that I don't like in the game. No double jump (really??), boss fights are kinda too easy, the health tank are cheap way to win a boss fight in normal mode, story itself is not interesting.\n\nThere will be more feature added as mentioned in their Kickstarter page. I totally recommend this game for platforming fans, especially those who appreciate the old NES 8-bit style.\n\nAny comments or feedback is appreciated.","June 28, 2014","true","14.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This was the first game that made me feel confident enough to help invest in the project when it was still very early in development.\n\nMany months passed, and now it's finally out. How does the finished game hold up? Astonishingly well, actually. It successfully delivers on the promise of a true old-school, NES-style game with mechanics borrowed from classics such as Mega Man, Ducktales and Zelda II. There's even a bit of Super Mario Bros 3 style overworld map and patroling enemies thrown in for good measure. Also makes the rare accomplishment of emulating the look and feel of a real NES game, whereas most modern-made retro games only manage to capture the look and feel on some level, but not quite all there.\n\nOnly critique I can give is that sometimes you might find yourself letting go of your left/right direction while trying to hit down for the downthrust attack, but the most recent update rectifies this by allowing you to remap the down key to another button, if you so wish.\n\nI can say with confidence that I am proud to have been one of the thousands of backers that helped get this project off the ground. Absolutely fantastic game, and one that I will likely be finding myself revisiting time and time again.","June 30, 2014","true","39.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It got the art style down perfectly (though the color range is not as limited as the NES, thank the gods), the music is authentic and absolutely amazing, and the controls are tight and satisfying as all hell. It's a perfect platformer, action game that also makes any 90's Kid nostalgic deep inside.\n\nBut here's the ingenious, oh so beautiful thing about the game: It never needed the nostalgia novelty, the NES 8-bit grahpics, the chiptunes, or even the limited NES controls, to actually be so amazing. It's a damn fantastic game, long enough to not overstay its welcome, and every level is designed perfectly for forcing you to master said controls, and new elements.\n\nSo it may be a tired notion of Indie games using pixel art to pitch itself, but this is a case where the developers had a great game as a foundation, and then made it look and sound like a great NES game... not the other way around.

The game is VERY reminiscent of Mega Man classics in gameplay. You, Shovel Knight (aka. the Blue Burrower) have to defeat 8 enemy knights (with names like 'Spectre Knight' and 'Plague Knight') before you can enter the Tower of Fate and challenge the evil Enchantress. Ducktales is also a big influence. You collect gems for money, and you can pogo on enemies with your shovel. Castevania and Zelda mechanics are also borrowed, the towns are basically from Zelda II, and the map is reminiscent of Mario 3. The developers also said Dark Souls was a big influence, but I haven't played it so I couldn't say how. Unlike many modern retro-style games, this one isn't overtly a parody of other games, and instead plays the "knight with a shovel in a NES game" setting pretty straight.\n\nIf you have good memories of classic NES games and like platformers, this love letter to classic NES games is a must play.","December 9, 2014","true","24.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But that doesn't mean that this game is bad. It's pretty far from it actually. Shovel Knight is an extremely well polished 8-bit retro throwback, that checks all the objectives of great 80s platformer. Visuals are pretty spot on, sountrack is not bad and game really plays well. Unfortuntely it misses a massive points for lack of originality. This is basically an "Mega Man with a shovel", at least the core gameplay that is. Gimmicks are from MM. Character speed and jump height are from MM. Enemies are heavily inspired from MM. Even some particular screens of the levels are pretty copy-pasted. I would forget this completely, but unlike other recent platformers that are wrongly accused for lack of originality, Shovel Knight could really use some more charm and unique flavors in gameplay and presentation. it doesn't mix many concepts and doesn't add anything new. It realizes one concept and nothing else. Fortunely this concept is realized pretty well.\n\nThis game is also not for casual players. While this isn't particularly hard game, it offers no difficulty settings and 80s One Hit Death Spikes are plenty, sometimes amping up frustration. Luckly those moments are not that prominent in comparison to the whole game. Otherwise it goes smooth with 60FPS, clevel boss designs and satisfing enough gameplay.\n\nNo. Hype isn't real. I played some better platformers recently, but Shovel Knight is still a not bad experience. It's pretty much worth $15, but I would suggest taking it, like me, with at least -33% discount.

Your objective is linear in story but wide in scope. Stop the "Enchantress." As she has taken over the land. Yes, not groundbreaking but the story works for this game. The narrative is not even the primary focus, yet it has been entwined with fantastically witty lines and subtle references which offer a tribute to the era of video games it draws in a large majority of it's core concepts from.\n\nGameplay is quick, but not twitch like. This is not your twitch reaction platformer, this is not Super Meat Boy. The game allows breathing space for thinking and planning before moving across the stage. Your repetoire of moves consist of a shovel strike and a Mario-esque curb stomp from above. Extra abilites like shooting fireballs for example; can be aquired later into the game.\n\nThe world map is a spitting image of Super Mario 3's. A top down scrolling area of different locations you may choose to conqueor. Your main hub is the town. The town is where the RPG element kicks in. As upgrades to your health and magical power can be purchased from merchants, along with other little things here and there. If you are looking for a vast expanse of customisation, this is not the game for you. The gameplay, first and foremost focuses on completeing area after area and slaying boss after boss.\n\nSpeaking of levels, the difficulity of the game rivals that of older ninja Gaiden games, stage after stage of environments and enemies for you conqueor. A somehwat generous health pool and semi-frequent checkpoints offer some saving grace from death and gold that is lost on death is able to be re-collected from the place of your demise.\n\nBoss fights lay at the end of every level and is one of the things that Shovel Knight really gets right. Every fight challenges you and most importantly, the bosses react to your movements, if a corrupted knight boss see's you try to hit him from above, he will quickly dodge back into the air for example. Fights are long enough they provide a sustained challenge and the repotoire of their moves is varied enough for the fight to feel fresh and exciting on all fronts.\n\nThe music that accompanies Shovel Knight are orginal chiptunes that suit the area your are venturing in and provide a wonderful background to your quest.\n\nShovel Knight is a platformer, through and through. The vibrant bit graphics and charming narrative provide a wonderful base to some of the most smooth, fluid and inituitive platforming gameplay I have seen in years. The game started off as a wonderful Idea in the first place but Yacht Club Games really polished it to be one of my favourite games of 2014 so far.

I expected it to be good, but it outshined itself in every element. It was miticulously crafted from start to finish and was assisted by the fantastic soundtrack. Each level has fantastic artwork and design and the boss battles all feel unique.\n\nThe game itself is short (at a run time of around 5-7 hours) , but the new game plus mode after the game's ending improves the run time a great deal. If you get Shovel Knight, don't expect to stop the game at the end of your first quest. NG+ has a great challenge to it with double damage to you, no health pickups (save for your own chalice), and half as many checkpoints as before. It'll make boss battles very difficult, but never frustratingly enough that it feels impossible.\nThe lack of a lives system (instead of losing lives, you lose a portion of the treasure you've obtained) also improves this feeling. You can recover the money you lost from each death if you get back to that point without dying. This element never makes the death feel painfully brutal like the games it is inspired by, but keeps death with enough meaning that you still desire to get back to the point you failed to pass.\n\nAll in all, the game proved itself to be a real joy to play and well worth your time and the $15 cost. I cannot wait to see what Yacht Club has in store for the game's further developments and their future projects.","June 30, 2014","true","17.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/memphizzx/recommended/250760/","memphizzx","MemPhiZ ZX - #HeroesNeverDie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/memphizzx/","3164 products in account","My review on Shovel Knight:\n\nThis game is a 2D platforming game with lots of NES flair thrown into it. The graphic, the soundtrack etc. The story is a knight caled Shovel Knight who use a shovel (duh) as weapon of choice goes to battle other knights and fight the final boss. The story is not so remarkable and you can see the plot from miles away. No plotholes though. Story progression is so like Megaman (big fan here); fight 8 bosses, go to final stage, re-fight the bosses again, then fight the final boss in 2 round fight. So if you're into great story and plot, you gotta lower your expectation for this game.\n\nThe best part is the gameplay. As I mentioned before, this is 2D platforming, so lots of jumping involved. There are many things you can do with your shovel; attack enemies, dig treasures, pogo jump like in Duck Tales, upgrade it to add special attack, bury dead bodies.... forget the last one. There is no difficulty setting, but there is New Game+ which is harder than normal; enemies do more damage, less checkpoints. There are music sheet s to collect if you're into collecting stuff. You can upgrade health and magic in the game with money. There's no heart upgrade or find4-pieces-to-upgrade stuff. You also need money to get upgrades for armor and shovel. And to buy relics.\n\nUnlike Megaman games whre you get special weapon from bosses, this one doesn't have it. Instead, you get relics which is usually buy from store. You can find the store inside the town or secret places in the stages. The relics cost magic when used si you cannot spam them. Some for only help killing the enemis while some helps with the platforming stuff like the sword (air dash ftw) and phase amulet. Relics are fun to use, so experiment with all of them.\n\nGraphic? It's 8-bit style. Need to say more?\n\nThe soundtracks is 8-bit music. So if you're not in 8-bit music style, you have hard time listening to it in the entire game. I personally enjoyed the music as well as other 8-bit music from other game. You can listen to the soundtrack for free here http://virt.bandcamp.com/album/shovel-knight-original-soundtrack\n\nThere are some things that I don't like in the game. No double jump (really??), boss fights are kinda too easy, the health tank are cheap way to win a boss fight in normal mode, story itself is not interesting.\n\nThere will be more feature added as mentioned in their Kickstarter page. I totally recommend this game for platforming fans, especially those who appreciate the old NES 8-bit style.\n\nAny comments or feedback is appreciated.","June 28, 2014","true","14.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This was the first game that made me feel confident enough to help invest in the project when it was still very early in development.\n\nMany months passed, and now it's finally out. How does the finished game hold up? Astonishingly well, actually. It successfully delivers on the promise of a true old-school, NES-style game with mechanics borrowed from classics such as Mega Man, Ducktales and Zelda II. There's even a bit of Super Mario Bros 3 style overworld map and patroling enemies thrown in for good measure. Also makes the rare accomplishment of emulating the look and feel of a real NES game, whereas most modern-made retro games only manage to capture the look and feel on some level, but not quite all there.\n\nOnly critique I can give is that sometimes you might find yourself letting go of your left/right direction while trying to hit down for the downthrust attack, but the most recent update rectifies this by allowing you to remap the down key to another button, if you so wish.\n\nI can say with confidence that I am proud to have been one of the thousands of backers that helped get this project off the ground. Absolutely fantastic game, and one that I will likely be finding myself revisiting time and time again.","June 30, 2014","true","39.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Bosses don't have a soft/hard enrage. So while bosses might appear hard at first, soon they'll get really boring once you figured out how to cheese them.\n+unique characters, fighting with a shovel is awesome\n- characters are really limited in the sense that they always do the same thing. Either you can just talk to them, which is useless, you can buy something from them, which can be useful, or you fight them, there's no real character development\n+there's multiple ways to beat every level\n- due to the nature of the game, levels are really linear\n+there are many relics\n- most relics are kind of useless, or only used once in gem levels\n- at the beginning gold is kind of scarce but useful for health upgrades and your first relics, but later on gold becomes useless because a) you get a lot of gold b) the item system is kind of bad in shovel knight. You can only buy a few shovel upgrades, and there are no clear armor upgrades because there's no armor value in the game. Expensive armor always has a disadvantage, and the advantage it provides is minimal. The best armor in my opinion is the red one since it's simply an upgrade with no disadvantages.\n+ shovel knight is a good homage to old school games\n- because of that, there are many outdated mechanics that just feel frustrating, even jumping feels really weird oftentimes\n\nGet this game if you enjoy old school games and don't mind being challenged a bit, otherwise skip it imho","January 10","true","11.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

In order to do so, shovel knight must defeat eight members of "The order of no Quarter".\n\nShovel Knight is very much inspired by our beloved classics. Mario, Zelda, megaman, castlevania, it's very easy to see how shovel knight has been inspired by all of these games, but all in the best way possible. The best thing shovel knight inherited from those games is the marvelous level design. The tutorial level is wonderfully done, teaching you the basic mechanics without the need of a message or even a button display. Even in later stages, the game will never put you in a dangerous situation without teaching you first, something that megaman in particular was always known for.\n\nThe overworld map looks a lot like the Mario Bros 3 map (there are even wandering enemies with special fights or stages), and you can usually choose the next stage from 2 or 3 avaiable, and visit the villages, where you can buy upgrades, relics and equipment with the gold you got on the levels. Relics basically works like spells, but there are also chalices that can hold liquids which will grant you one time effects (like the bottles in zelda). You can also upgrade your shovel, but there are only three upgrades. One of them makes sparks come out of your shovel while you're at full health (zelda again). There are some different armors too, but I felt like just one of them was really useful, so in terms of upgrades the game could do better.\n\nShovel Knight is great, and as far as I'm concerned it deserves the praise it's been getting. Combining the best elements from classics, with great boss fight and some beautiful animations, it's pretty easy to recommend this game whether you enjoyed the classics that inspired it or not.","June 30, 2014","true","49.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

I played this game to completion on the Wii U first, but the experience was nearly identical to this version. The influence from classic NES games like Castlevania, Ducktales, Mega Man, Super Mario Bros. 3, and Zelda II blend perfectly to make this game. Even though it bears similarities to those games, its execution feels brand new as opposed to a straight rip off. Shovel Knight has tight controls, brilliant level design, hilarious dialogue sequences and such a steady learning curve. In addition, the amount of content here is well worth the price tag (currently fifteen dollars). There is so much to collect and see, like the rogue characters you encounter on the map, collecting music sheets, or even new game plus.

The game has gorgeous pixel art, amazing music, tight controls and fantastic designs for enimies bosses and allies. This game is one of the best of 2014, however, that doesn't mean it is flawless. The story is quite bad, and although they try to throw a plot twist at the end it's not that exciting. I found there were times where shovel knight moved further than I inputed, some levels have have checkpoints that are way to far away from one another, sometime doing small jumps can be incredibly difficult. The game also has some items that are just plain useless. Shovel Knight is an outstanding game with very few problems, if you love the old NES games then you will feel right at home. Going for 100% is extremely difficult due to a select few achievements, however if you go start to end without any of the upgrades the game is going to become quite difficult, however if you are good at games like this you can complete the story in under 1 hour and a half. That being said for the $15 dollar pricetag it is well worth it, I'm very pleased with my purchase and I'm interested in seeing more games from the indie developers Yacht Club Games.

Perhaps most impressive is the fact that the old style graphics and music were not done as a shortcut or to make things easy; they were clearly done out of love and affection, and the work is of high quality throughout. The quirky, off-beat humor is tastefully done and never wears out it's welcome or grows stale, and the game turns a few of the age-old tropes on it's ear in surprising (and excellent) ways.

I've played a lot of games in my day but and I don't know if its age but I haven't felt anywhere near as engaged with them as I did when I was a kid. This game broke that pattern. The design is thoughtful and innovative without resorting to gimmicky extras or the cheap deaths that most 'hard platformers' have. By the end I was progressing along at a daring clip and I realized that, for once in a very long time, I was doing so because I had legitimately mastered the mechanics of the game. It's that sort of feeling you get when you play the same map on a multiplayer shooter way too much. When I beat it for the first time it felt very differen than winning most games I've played.

One playthrough and I'm going to shell out the $15 to buy it on 3DS & another $15 for the Wii U (and any future console it may come out on). ProJared gave this a 10/10, BalrogtheMaster gave it a Check + (Best score on his review show, BNGR), and The Completionist wouldn't shut up about it. So after seeing his 101st episode (guess the gane), I decided to buy it for myself. I got it on PC because obvious reasons. (*cough* #PCMASTERRACE *cough cough* )  That next day, I played the entire game (The basic adventure, not New Game +) and loved it. The Bosses, The Relics, and who could forget, the Troupple King (A trout mixed with an apple and it's a king and it dances. Do you need more of an explanation.). If you've played game like, Ducktales, Castlevania, Mega Man, just combine them and you have the wonder that is Shovel Knight. Also Jake "Virt" Kaufman (Apologies if I mispelled), the guy who did the soundtrack for Ducktales Remastered, Double Dragon Neon, and pretty much most games by WayForward (Which most of the members of Yacht Club Games are from), did the soundtrack.

The music is masterfully put together. The controls are smooth and the difficulty is true to the games it pays tribute to. The story is well put together and the towns and characters create a unique story that gave smiles and laughs.\n\nI will say that however I was a bit disappointed with the game for its length. Upon purchase, what I had seen of the map remined me of Mario games, with many levels leading up to one castle and many worlds. This is not the case. There is only one map. It only draws from Mario loosely in appearance, and that enemies will move about on it. I had expected a longer game for the price I'd paid (got it 33% off even). After thinking this, I noted that its brevity was commonly noted in reviews. Shovel Knight draws mainly from Megaman and DuckTales, and I personally have never played the latter and only Megaman 2 of the Megaman series. However, when I remembered that both of these games/series had just 8 or less levels in a complete game. And in both Megaman 2 and Shovel Knight, each level is packed with diverse puzzles and platforming challenges as well as great design and enough content to keep the player occupied for quite a while on just that one level, not to mention  the hidden music scores . Even with only  8 Knight levels and 3 levels of the Tower of Fate  it owes tribute to the Megaman series with a similar organization to the robot masters and Dr. Wily's castle. Therefore, Shovel's Knight's length no longer bothers me.\n\nI am looking forward to updates with hopefully Shield Knight as a playable character. This is a game that I would play again!","December 31, 2014","true","27.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tenchberry/recommended/250760/","Tenchberry","Tench","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tenchberry/","81 products in account","Surprise, surprise! Its an indie game! The best way I could describe Shovel Knight, from the perspective of someone who didn't experience the NES first hand is a case of "old dog, new tricks". This platformer harkens back to the old 8-bit style of the NES in terms of both visuals (sortof, technically, its not actually 8-bit, but whatever) and gameplay, and audio, whilst having a very modern sense of game feel at it's core.\n\nThat's the essential part, and one of the best things , in my opinion, about Shovel Knight. It could've just been a nostalgia trip, but honestly, at the core of it is an extremely well designed game that uses the basic control scheme of the NES to create an impressive level of depth (Just like some NES platformers! HOW ABOUT THAT ♥♥♥♥!). The spells you're given are given are all extremely fun to play and experiment with (Although, Fireballs are a bit OP).\n\nThis game feels like a kind of evolution of the 8 bit style. Story elements are told through gameplay segments that give a great sense of attention to the mainly character driven plot (Though, like 8 bit platformers, the story is quite simple, in general. It does gain some unfounded depth throughout the game, however.)\n\nThe boss battles are all amazing, with the right level of challenge leeway such that you can beat the bosses in a number of ways (No use weapon X to beat this boss a la Mega Man). the score is FANTASTIC (virt has the OST available to download, GO GET IT!).

The story is simple; rescue your friend and fellow warrior Shield Knight. She was taken by the Dark Enchantress and is being guarded by a team of evil knights, each with their own themes. In this way, the game feels like Mega Man. There is "King Knight", who's level is a giant castle filled with royal themed villains. Specter Knight inhabits a graveyard and has an army of ghosts and skeletons. The banter between your character and others is witty and made me chuckle from time to time.\n\nThe visuals look like the final generation of NES games. The pixel art is well done and feels authentic. I feel like its limited visuals never take away from the game, but do add character and flavor. Music and sound is good, but never had me really impressed. It just kinda does the job.\n\nThe difficulty in this game is tricky. Many of these games pride themselves on being difficult, and Shovel Knight would like to make you think it's challenging, but its not. Sure some of the jumps are tricky and you do instantly die when you come in contact with spikes, but the game is so amazingly forgiving in other areas. There are numerous checkpoints, infinite lives, and 2 items that refill all your life and mana. Anyone with basic platformer skills and the ability to learn from experience can beat this thing in under 6 hours.\n\nSadly, the replayability on this one is pretty minimal. Once beating it, there is a new game+ mode, but I found little interest in it. This game shines in its character and polish. Worth a play through for those wanting something nostalgic, charming, and somewhat challenging.","December 28, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can tell that it's crafted from the love of retro platformers like Mega Man and Castlevania, and it genuinely feels like one of the great games you would have played back in the day and would have stacked up alongside the big names released at the time easily. It plays very much like a Megaman game but its not as difficult. The knights moveset is simple yet intuitive and the majority of the powers feel essential to use and are not just there for show. One downfall i would say is that the first magic power you get (Chaos Orb) is an absolute boss destroyer. The bosses themselves are challenging without it though.

Checkpoint systems are ingenious, losing gold on death is much better than having lives and gives a greater motivation for players to stay alive (also it's less frustrating than a flaccid "GAME OVER" screen). And there are so many new things introduced in every stage I never found myself getting bored, you should absolutely buy this game, its well worth your money! I mean what were you going to do with that $15 anyway? Buy a sandwich or two?\n\nFine, go buy your sandwich, sure it will taste good for the 15 minutes you're eating it, but then what? It's gone, just like that, and you know what? I bet you're still hungry.\n\nWell *this* game is like a sandwich that lasts *forever* and if you get tired of it, you can put it in the fridge and get a different sandwich. But when you feel like getting some of that moutwatering Shovel Knight sandwich you haven't had in such a long time, it'll be there, right there in your fridge waiting for you, because Shovel Knight will always be there for you, so you should be there for it!","July 3, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shovel Knight does not rely on cheap nostalgia, but instead takes a classic genre and elevates it to another level. Some tasteful updates have been made to make this game look beautiful and feel right at home on modern systems, while also staying true to its identity. Graphics, music and gameplay feel very genuine and immersive. The storytelling is emotional and mostly interactive. Very fun to play, and starts to get challenging about halfway through the game. Highly recommend!\n\nI'm looking forward to the additional features and game play modes that Yacht Club Games has promised for this title.","December 6, 2014","true","36.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world map is set up like Super Maro Bros 3 so you move across the world as you select which bosses to fight and which extra levels to clear.\n\nThe towns in the game offer spots for the Shovel Knight to level up his weapon, armor, or to collect relics to add to his arsenal. The relics offer unique ways of fighting bosses, clearing enemies, or just skipping through the stages faster.\n\nThis is a complete throw back to the old platformers of the late 80's and early 90's with a refined set of controls that are silky smooth.

It is a homage to the old NES classics, but the game really does stand on its own, even without the added nostalgia. Controls are immaculate (when using a controller, at least), the soundtrack is memorable for every stage, and the story and characters goes well beyond what one could reasonably expect from a retro title like this.\n\nOne of the best parts of Shovel Knight is the excelent difficulty curve. The game manages to challange you throughout the entire game, without ever leaving you frustrated or bored. The game never holds your hand, and expects you to make your own tactics from the available special powers, of which there are plenty. With infinite lives and a generous checkpoint system though, you really shouldn't find this game more difficult than other games unless you are particularly bad at platformers.\n\nAs can be expected of this kind of platformer, completing the game for the first time can be done in about 6 hours. This might seem on the short side, but as the gameplay never go stale, this really is a game that one can play over and over. Even with the game itself complete, there are plenty of achievements that are quite challanging, and helps add replay value to the game. In addition, the developers have more material that will eventually be added to the game for free, so the fact that the game can be completed in one hour and 30 minutes shouldn't deter you from purchasing the title, as it holds plenty of value.","July 7, 2014","true","42.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shovel knight has a downward stab and a regular shovel swing. Once he progresses far enough he can upgrade his equipment and forge new armors that give him special abilities or make his shovel able to perform new tricks.\n\nEvery level has a special item that if you find it in the dungeon, you can get it right then and there- the only issue is you need to purchase it. If you do not find the item in the level, don't fret! You can buy it in town from the underground salesman. The bosses are unique and provide an interesting spin on each fight that requires for you to play a different way each time.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the game is the replay value. In most games released today there isn't much replay value. The game is typically too long to enjoy a second playthrough in most games and there aren't many reasons to do so. In Shovel Knight if you beat the game you have the classic new game + but considering how short the game is, it's easy to pick up again and play a different way. The steam achievements also help push for this game to have multiple play throughs (A no death run, no money run, no item run, etc etc) which goes back to the roots of achievements: Awarding the player for achomplishing something that would be worth a reward.\n\nIf I was to give one specific reason to buy this game: It is because the game is easy to pick back up when you take a break from it, each level is short enough to finish within 10-15 minutes and if you want to take a break the game auto-saves. It's easy to pick up and put back down and helps a ton when you're trying to take a break from other things.","August 26, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DMoC/recommended/250760/","DMoC","virgeofcerberus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DMoC/","121 products in account","(TL;DR version at the bottom)\n\nTimeless is a word many use to describe the 8-bit era of the third generation of consoles. Whether it's the tight game play of games like Mega Man, the simplistic, timeless nature of pixel art itself, or simply nostalgia for simpler times, the love of these games is undoubtedly shown by the slew of retro-inspired indie games released in recent years. While many of them are fantastic games in their own right, few have quite the same amount of heart as Yacht Club Games' debut title Shovel Knight. Shovel Knight takes a great deal of inspiration from many classic NES games. The overworld is charmingly Mario 3-esque with minibosses scattered throughout. The platforming reminiscent of one Scrooge McDuck from the somewhat recently remastered Duck Tales. The towns are full of NPCs to interact with, à la Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. And the level layout and boss structure is inspired by the aforementioned Mega Man. With all of this clear inspiration from past classics, it can be hard for a game such as this to form an identity of its own. I'm happy to say that this is not the case with Shovel Knight.\n\nThe story of Shovel Knight is a simple one. While exploring the Tower of Fate, Shovel Knight suffers the loss of his beloved Shield Knight and the tower is sealed shut. His spirit broken, Shovel Knight gives up his life of adventuring in exchange for one of solitude and seclusion. That is until the land is seized by the evil Enchantress and her Order of No Quarter, an intimidating group of eight knights that fit the mold of Mega Man's iconic Robot Masters both mechanically and in design quality. As a result, the tower is unsealed and after digging himself out of his rut, (that's the only pun I swear) Shovel Knight sets off to defeat The Enchantress and unravel the mysteries of his love's presumed death at The Tower of Fate.\n\nIn the beginning stage, the game does well to introduce you to many of its mechanics: moving, jumping, slashing, hopping, and of course, digging. What's extraordinary about this kind of game design is that it conveys all of this to the player without a single tutorial or annoying prompt telling you what to do. Now, this is largely due to simplicity of the game in comparison to modern games of today, but this kind of game design has been dying out for years for an alternative that is, in my opinion, much more lazy and much less creative. Shovel Knight's mechanics are one of its many strong suits. Not only is your shovel used as your primary weapon, it's also a useful tool used to traverse each level. Digging through sand to reach some treasure or perfectly timing a hop off an enemy to reach an area otherwise inaccessible are both interesting and fun implementations. It's been a long time since I've played a game that just feels this good. Every jump and slash are incredibly precise. If you die in this game it's your fault and yours alone. And you will die. A lot.\n\nUpon death, you drop some of the gold you had on you at the time. To get it back, you must reach the area you died at to pick it up again. Die again on the way to your gold however, and it's gone. While not anywhere near as harsh, this system will be familiar to anyone who's played any of the Souls games. Unlike the grueling, start-from-scratch difficulty of the various NES titles Shovel Knight draws so much inspiration from, Yacht Club Games opted for a much more accessible checkpoint system where in each stage contains roughly four to six checkpoints. Now that's not to say the game isn't difficult. Where the classic games we grew up with were both difficult and unforgiving, (sometimes to mask the games lack of content) Shovel Knight is difficult, but also forgiving. And to me this is the perfect blend. Think this system is blasphemous? Then destroy the checkpoints as you go! Destroying each checkpoint not only increases the games difficulty exponentially, it also rewards you with a ton of cash to upgrade your weapon and armor. Upgrades include multiple sets of palette swapped armor with varying abilities and shovel upgrades like the ability to launch a spark across the ground if your health is full.\n\nShovel Knight's level design is top-notch, with each level's design reflecting each boss respectfully. The viking-like Polar Knight dwells in an icy tundra, the flying Propeller Knight commands a massive airship, and so on. Each level feels distinctly different from the last, with new obstacles and trials to keep you on your toes. Secrets like gold or music notes can be found throughout each level by finding tiny differences in walls and then blasting through them with your mighty shovel. From plains, to dark laboratories, to factories full of cranking gears, variety is an important piece of the puzzle that is a great platformer, and Shovel Knight displays that fact prominently.\n\n(VERDICT)\nAt around seven hours your first time through and a new game plus mode with increased damage for replay ability, Shovel Knight is a great value that delivers in simply every way. It plays flawlessly, sounds incredible, and looks gorgeous. With the way Shovel Knight melds all of its inspirations together and introduces its own interesting mechanics, Yacht Club Games has created something truly special. Something that isn't a Mega Man rip-off or a Zelda clone, but a game that is uniquely Shovel Knight; a passionately written love letter to the late great games of the NES era.","July 3, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As others have stated, Shovel Knight draws upon classic Mega Man games, Zelda II, SMB3 and to an extent, Ducktales and Castlevania. It does what it intends to do perfectly, gameplay feels solid, story is there to keep you motivated but doesn't try to preach to you, music is some of the best chiptune around and the graphics are aesthetically pleasing. Of course it isn't a 'true' NES game in regards to console limitations as that would just be silly to make sacrifices at the cost of complete authenticty. Stuff like screen flickering and enemy limitation etc. do not detract from the gameplay at all.\n\nThat being said, the game isnt entirely perfect. My major complaint is that it is quite short and left me wanting more, but thats to be expected of the game design employed. Thankfully, free DLC is to come, so that sorts that out, but I would have still loved to see maybe more 'Wily Styled' stages for the end game, instead of just 2 before the final boss. Difficulty-wise, the game may throw a cheap tactic at you at times, but for the most part, its about on par with some more modern 2D platformers, such as Rayman Origins/Legends. It is not '1980s Nintendo Difficult', but it isn't mind numbingly easy. Achievements/feats that encouarge players to not even get hit once throughout a playthrough are there for those who want a challenge, NG+ also solves this dilemma.\n\nOverall, a solid title well worth the $15 just for the fact that more content is to come and what we have now is worth it regardless. If you're a fan of any of the previously mentioned titles that this game draws upon, I would highly reccomend it.","July 2, 2014","true","37.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

ProJared gave this a 10/10, BalrogtheMaster gave it a Check + (Best score on his review show, BNGR), and The Completionist wouldn't shut up about it.

Something that obviously has months and months of care and hard work put into it, regardless of how simple the game is. Shovel Knight is in short, a joyful walk down NEStolgia days with inspiring tight gameplay, beautiful and admiring pixel art, and an abundance of incredibly polished chiptune music. I was a kickstarter backer since it was announced, and I was very worried with the few delays they made, but the final product has proven to be 100% worth the price of admission.\n\nYou play as an adventurer Shovel Knight, our pogosticking protagonist who's searching for his long lost companion Shield Knight. Both of them were exploring the mysterious Tower of Fate, when the dark magic of a cursed amulet cast them out and sealed the tower. When Shovel Knight awoke, Shield Knight was no where to be found, but instead The Enchantress has risen to power and spreads evil across the land. Now Shovel Knight must quest out on a search for his long lost companion. Also in his way are several other cleverly themed knights in an ensemble known as "The Order of No Quarter", each with their own unique character and fighting specialties.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a side-scrolling mixture between NES classics like Mega Man, Super Mario 3, Castlevania, and DuckTales. It also happens to take some modernization from newer games. For example: there are no lives per se, but instead when you die, three money bags spring where you bit the dust, and you must recover them to save from losing any gold a la the notoriously difficult Souls series. Along your journey you can spend gold you collect to upgrade your shovel to perform new attacks, or purchase different armors that all have different effects. You can also buy relics from a traveling salesman which allow you to shoot fireballs, dash in mid air, and go invincible for a short period of time among several other abilities.\n\nThe art is very impressive for that 8-bit pixel look that so many developers are caught on lately (myself included). The animations are very characteristic and help bring the game to life with ease. The game can almost guarantee a giggle the first time you see Shovel Knight dig through a treasure chest. Speaking of the giggles, the dialog is extremely humorous and doesn't allow the game to take itself too seriously. It tries for the casual joke or two at the expense of actual game knowledge, which helps make the game feel more alive and interesting. These two components help seal the game and bring it to life. However, there are a couple reused assets for enemies. For example different mage enemies, and rat like enemies are made different only by their color palettes. A small nitpick to an otherwise gorgeous and endearing world.\n\nFinally, the music is possibly my favorite thing about the whole game. Jake Kaufman(Shovel Knight's composer and OCRemix veteran code-named "virt") is bound to have put himself on the map with this soundtrack, and with the help of Manami Matsumae(Mega Man composer) it's really no surprise. Each tune is specifically designed to run on actual NES hardware and helps secure that classic retro feel to the game. Thus, the music in this game not only shines, it radiates light in every way. Every level has it's own distinct composition, while each boss has a remixed version of that same song. It's instantly catchy chiptunes will have you hook, line, and sinker throughout all of the almost 50 compositions. Jake has also been kind enough to offer the entire soundtrack, as well as a second full arrangement album from various artists, each for a "you name it" price tag on his BandCamp page.\n\nShovel Knight is an astounding achievement that just plain works. Every person attached to this project put their heart and soul into the game, and it shows in every way. Rarely do I say that an independent video game has a shot at making it to Game of the Year status, but Shovel Knight easily digs its way to the top of the list. A must-have gem in any Steam, 3DS, or Wii U library. (9/10)","July 1, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It takes inspiration from many classic games such as Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda, DuckTales, Metroid, Mega Man, and the list goes on. You take on the role as Shovel Knight whose beloved friend, Shield Knight, has been taken away and it is your job to pass through the multiple levels and save her.\n\nThere are multiple stages in this game and each of them have a different element to them which differentiates one from the rest. The levels have some difficulty to them but a set amount of checkpoints allow the game to feel less "rage-inducing." The checkpoints may also be ignored or "broken" in order to achieve more jewels or treasure, the curreny in the game, which may be used to purchase new armor, items, health upgrades, magic upgrades, or shovel upgrades. Each of the bosses at the end of the level are unique so the game does not get tedious or feel boring at any point. There are also collectibles in the form of "Music Sheets" which are in hidden locations throughout the game and can be collected for money, providing an incentive.\n\nThe best part of the game is the fact that it is extremely replayable because of its brilliant concept and level design. The score is also amazing and very true in achieving that "NES" feel to the game. Any fans of classic games will appreciate this game and anyone who enjoys having fun will enjoy it as well. It definitely provides some challenge on the first playthrough and there is also a New Game + Mode for the daring. Overall, Shovel Knight is just a blast to play through and just shows the power of KickStarter.\n\n9.5/10","July 2, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's reminiscent of the 2D platformers of times gone by as it was consistently hyped up to be, but surpasses other modern games that attempt to follow that old school formula: Mega Man 9 and 10 immediately come to mind. Each stage feels unique, each boss is well-designed, and the game slowly ramps up in difficulty enough to stay interesting but without such a high difficulty curve that it gets too frustrating. The soundtrack is fantastic, again reminiscent of the 2D platformers of times gone by. The game's sense of humour (and writing/dialogue in general) is charming and got a chuckle out of me a few times; talking to NPCs is always a treat, even the nameless ones. I don't want to comment on the controls too much, since I used a PS3 controller that's seen better days, but they may take some getting used to depending on what 2D platformers you've played most recently.\n\nBasically, I couldn't recommend Shovel Knight enough. If you're a fan of 2D platformers both old and new, you owe it to yourself to pick up Shovel Knight. Whether you have nostalgia for these kinds of games or not, I guarantee that this is one of the games that people will be taking about when they talk game of the year, and it's worth every penny of its current price point.","July 2, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's reminiscent of the 2D platformers of times gone by as it was consistently hyped up to be, but surpasses other modern games that attempt to follow that old school formula: Mega Man 9 and 10 immediately come to mind. Each stage feels unique, each boss is well-designed, and the game slowly ramps up in difficulty enough to stay interesting but without such a high difficulty curve that it gets too frustrating. The soundtrack is fantastic, again reminiscent of the 2D platformers of times gone by. The game's sense of humour (and writing/dialogue in general) is charming and got a chuckle out of me a few times; talking to NPCs is always a treat, even the nameless ones. I don't want to comment on the controls too much, since I used a PS3 controller that's seen better days, but they may take some getting used to depending on what 2D platformers you've played most recently.\n\nBasically, I couldn't recommend Shovel Knight enough. If you're a fan of 2D platformers both old and new, you owe it to yourself to pick up Shovel Knight. Whether you have nostalgia for these kinds of games or not, I guarantee that this is one of the games that people will be taking about when they talk game of the year, and it's worth every penny of its current price point.","July 2, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It looked neat but I didn't really think I would buy the game.\n\nThen I watched Nintendo's Treehouse stream for ComicCon and they were speed running the first four levels. It looked pretty fun.\n\nSo lets get down to the game.\n\nVisuals: Stays true to the retro nature of old 2D games from back in the day. Doesn't try to follow the whole "block" trend. "Block" graphics is not retro. Its just... blocks. But this game does retro right. So the visuals look great, and the animations are smooth.\n\nSound: Sound is great. When you are going for a retro 2D game, then you get the sound you would expect. The songs are top notch.\n\nGameplay: Its a 2D platforming game. Run left and right, jump, attack. Its real simple.\n\nControls: Easy to control. Come on, this is a 2D game. If you play it then play it with a controller. I didn't even try the keyboard.\n\nDifficulty: Well it varies, not overbearingly hard, not too easy. It depends on the person.\n\nFunctionality: For me it launches quick, and plays smoothly. I haven't had a bug or issue with it yet.\n\nWhat I find interesting about this Indie company is that the platforms that this game is currently on is Nintendo Wii U, 3DS, and Steam, Linux, etc. Its odd how they skipped out on Xbox and Playstation but I think that is actually kind of refreshing. Rarely do I see Indie games created for Nintendo and PC and the company has created trading cards for Steam's whole level up system.\n\nAll in all, DEFINITELY 10/10.

It's about the length of a Mega Man or Mega Man X game, but, in my opinion, a bit easier. There's a decent amount of side content beyond just the boss levels, and user-options to make the game more difficult (such as beating the game without the use of relics). The levels are well-designed and there are very few "cheap" moments. Boss designs, both aesthetically and functionally, are fantastic.\n\nLike old-but-good NES games, it's short, sweet, and has plenty of replayability.","June 29, 2014","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In spite of the hype about how good it is, simply because it's a throwback to retro games - the game is overall very average in difficulty and it was only deep enough mechanics wise to get me through the first 3/4ths of the game.\n\nThe issue specifically was that if you just did a couple quick runs of older levels, you'd acquire all the gold you need for any of the interesting gear. It is great though that they allowed you to run the levels again just in case you were something like 200 gold short of something. The re-runs simply award too much, making them worthwhile to farm. You could argue I ruined my own experience by farming, but I found this out from being in the very situation aforementioned. Gold then later becomes utterly useless, which was disappointing because the suspense of death is nearly lost then.\n\nDespite all that, the graphics style is pleasant, reminding me of Kirby Superstar and Sonic. I enjoyed the movement/mechanics, the knight behaving like Link in Super Smash Brothers Melee (if he had a pogo shovel.) I'm not an 80's kid so I don't really have a bigger arsenal of experience with retro games to compare it to.\n\nThe music, I'll be honest - I expected better. However, I allowed myself to be hyped about this game; so there's that. The tunes actually are quite catchy and some deliciously solemn (when trying to catch Shield Knight in particular.)\n\nThe story was predictable, but I didn't really buy the game for the story so I'm not disappointed. Characters were predictable as well, but less so than the story - and their mechanics were fairly interesting and fairly unique (I am inexperienced, though.)\n\nThe best parts of the game were really the goofy/silly dialogue and the gameplay (not story, music, etc.) Despite me saying it was average difficulty, there was some brutal and frustrating parts for myself - but I fully expected to be frustrated going into this game.\n\nIf I were to give it a rating, it would be 8/10 overall. Got a good 10 hours out of it. Took me 12 to beat it.","June 30, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The design is thoughtful and innovative without resorting to gimmicky extras or the cheap deaths that most 'hard platformers' have. By the end I was progressing along at a daring clip and I realized that, for once in a very long time, I was doing so because I had legitimately mastered the mechanics of the game.

I haven't and won't be 100% this game, but to me this game is very important to notice, especially in our time where a lot of indie developers go for a retro aspect in their games. Shovel Knight gets it right. He hits just the right spot and digs deep... Come on, you can't talk about this game without including a pun!\n\nIn all seriousness though, Shovel Knight is retro in all the good ways, it has well composed chiptune soundtrack, is hard in the way that old games like the megaman games were and does the 8-bit look right. Everything looks like what it's supposed to be.\nIt has cheesy humour, bright colours, funny characters and a cute (and a bit cheesy) story but the absolute most important aspect of the game, is it's tight mechanics. There were few times in my playthrough when I felt like the game was screwing me over and that felt fantastic.\n\nSo... Did you like games like the old Mario, Megaman and Sonic games?

I think Shovel Knight is a FANTASTIC game. The levels are EXTREMLY well designs and all completly unique and each bringing some new mechanic.

But my few complaints have to be all the instant-death traps, always causing me to either fall into a bottomless pits, lava, and spites; Makeing me feel that my heath bar was useless, and some of the time you can't reclaim your money,and I died ALOT,  (Especialy Propeller Knight's and I have to give alot of respect to ANYONE that had completed the game without dying of falling into a bottomless pit). But that is about it. After the ever challenging final platform puzzles before the boss in each stage that I especialy always die on, you always feel the most satasfaction as you deliver the final blow on the Order of No Quater.

What am I seguing to, you might be asking. Well I’ll tell you gentleman! It’s Shovel Knight. The first game made by Yacht Club Games. I first laid eyes on this game whilst strolling through Youtube one day and my goodness it looked glorious. Shovel Knight was funded by Kickstarter in April of last year and now has FINALLY been released. So, was it worth the wait? Did Yacht Club Games earn our money? Listen up and follow me after the jump!\n\nSTORY\n\nShovel Knight being that it’s developed in 8-bit most people would completely skip it, and they, I find, would be missing out on such a great story of love, loss and redemption. The story, itself is one of the 8-bit era. Shovel Knight must save his lost love Shield Knight by defeating The Order of No Quarter and The Enchantress. So you know the drill tragic event happens, love has been lost, must fight multiple enemies and evil order in order to get back what was lost. You’ve heard it before, but it hasn’t been executed as well as this in a very long time...if ever for these types of games honestly. The characters and environments are so damned fresh and lively that it brings me into the world.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nSo being a Shovel Knight what else would you use but a trusty shovel to bring down The Order of No Quarter? The combat is simple and very responsive for any player to pick up and play. You get an easy swing of the shovel as well as a downswing, akin to Scrooge McDuck in Ducktales or Cranky Kong in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. If you need a little more digging power you can purchase different suits of armor and upgrades for your spade throughout your journey, as well as upgrading your health and mana. In order you purchase these upgrades you have to collect gold. Whether it be piles of gravel, opening chests, discovering secrets, or whacking your enemies collect the gold and pick your poison. Along with all of this you get a series of items that will help you on your journey, like an Anchor, Fireballs, Dirt Gauntlets and many more. With these items and more you can bury your enemies into the dirt. It’s very clear that old school games were\n\nVISUALS AND SOUND\n\nWith a game like this the sound and visuals are always key points for me. These days it seems some people care for crazy visuals and orchestrated sound, but I grew up on the bits and chips so by all means, dig them up and let me enjoy them. Shovel Knight’s style of progression is a breath of fresh air to 8-bit style games. This is a game that deserves the term “Nintendo” game. The music is just as good if not the best part of the game. Jake Kaufman is a master at what he does when it comes to music and Manami Matsumae (Mega Man Composter) helping with a few tracks just gives the soundtrack more weight.\n\nWrap Up\n\nShovel Knight is very much a love letter to 8-bit but it is absolutely not stuck in time. It’s characters and story engaging, it’s combat masterfully crafted and the visuals and sound exactly what you need to experience this game. It oozes confidence and knows exactly what it is and goes far beyond what it tries to do. It’s one of the best games I have played this year and is a game that everyone should play. No matter what is keeping you from playing this game, dig right through the vault of heaven with your...Shovel...I think I reached my pun quota for this review!","September 17, 2015","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as one of the Knights of the Order of no Quarter, Plague Knight, and have a ton of customization. The gameplay changes slightly, but you go through the same levels as Shovel Knight, but with extra collectables.

It brings back fond memories of my NES/SNES childhood. It isn't purely relying on nostalgia though. It is also a pretty good game - an amazingly well-made platformer. Tight controls, clever level design, interesting enemies, useful items and a gorgeous soundtrack - all of this blends together perfectly and results in a game that is a lot of fun to play. Unlike several other recent retro platformers that were inspired by some of the most frustrating and infamous NES titles, Shovel Knight isn't all that hard. Sure, the second half of the game is still challenging, but as long as you are at least somewhat competent with 2D platformers, you will make constant progress. While it isn't that hard to finish, Shovel Knight provides other challenges beyond simply completing the story. There are lots of hidden secrets that you can hunt down, there is a harder new game+ mode and you can also attempt speedruns or no-death-runs. This game has a lot to offer.\n\nIf you liked Mega Man, DuckTales and/or Castlevania, you will love Shovel Knight. If you never played any of those games, chances are you will love Shovel Knight anyway. It is one of the most enjoyable platformers out there.","August 12, 2014","true","35.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good graphics, tight controls, LEGONDARY MUSIC, simple but good story, good characters, useful upgrades and spells, the works! however this game is not completly perfect though. You are put into a Super Mario Bros 3 like world where you travel around and select the levels when you get there. I might not be saying that in vary good detail but it is hard to describe.\nThis game has great levels -with exeptions being Plauge Knight and Phantome Knight - I think that's his name-. The starter level is good for the begining of the game and getting use to it's mechanics and controls.\nYou will find treasure along the way and strangly you feel like you really want it to as if you are craving it!\nyou get some spells later in the game but I will only mention my faveorites. 3 being the fire staff wich shoots a fireball in a straight line wich might sound boring but it is amazing useful. 2 being the invinceibility pendant wich makes you invinceable for like 3-4 seconds and is amazing helpful. 3 being not a spell but a consumeable item called Icore, there are 3 types of Icore. Icore of reniew wich gives you full helth and mana, Icore of defence wich makes you invinceable for 10 seconds and Icore of fortune wich makes all the treasure come to you when it is droped.my faveorite being the Icore of reniew.\nThere are I think 6 bosses that you have to defeat before going to the final boss - kinda make the brilliant Mega Man games -. the bosses are King Knight, Phantome Knight, Plauge Knight, Treasure Knight, Tinker Knight, Frost Knight i think and wind knight... I think... these bosses have deferent ways of attacking and have deferent patterns to exploit to defeat them.\nThe stages you need to get to the bosses at the end of the stage are mostly fun with again, good music with two exeptions. HOWEVER SOME OF THEM ARE SO FREAKING UN-FORGIVINGLY HARD THAT IT HURTS!\nYou will find merchants and upgrades that you can spend your gold on and they all are quite nice but some i really dont use that much at all.\non the way you can find wondering people that you can fight to get treasure and these characters are actuly pretty cool and fairly challenging.\nyou can actuly find music pages around towns and stages that you can give to a bard and he will  give you 500 gold for each one you bring to him and ever better, you can make him play them to you! all the stage music that you like you can make him play to you!\nAt the end of the game you fight the end boss who is vary hard but she is not tooo bad HOWEVER she hase a second for that is unfortinatly not as epic as the first one and is vary simple to beat.\nThe ending of the game is GREAT! I give this game a 9/10 because it is so close to prefection with its great levels and secrets to the legondary soundtrack but it was a frustraiting experience at that. I recomend this to anyone who likes a good chalenge and likes side scrolling adventure, btw this review was done by a thirteen year old! :D","December 6, 2014","true","73.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is amazing on every level possible. It takes you back to the NES days taking inspirations from other NES games most obvious Ducktales, Megaman, and Castlevania. It also has some of the best control in a game I've ever played. Some games suck on keyboard compared to controller *cough*AVGN Adventures*cough*. If you press a button it responds the exact milasecond you press it. There is no pressing A..... and then it responds. Another thing I should mention are the graphics. They are the best throw back to 8-bit I've ever seen. It may seem that they are trying to do this to sell their products. DON'T THINK THAT. This game looks great for 8-bit even having some of the best video game music. My hat and roses go to Jake"Virt"Kauffman for making THE best soundtrack of the past years. It is the best version of 8-bit music since Megaman 2... FROM 1989!! My favorite video game song of all time is the King Knight level music. Also here is the OST by the amazing Virt http://virt.bandcamp.com/album/shovel-knight-original-soundtrack. I should stop babbing and get to the point. GET SHOVEL KNIGHT FOR THE WII U, 3DS, OR PC.

Now, it isn't nearly as demanding as neoretro platformers like Castle in the Darkness or Super Meat Boy, but I think that's a big part of its (well-derserved) popularity.  Even players who are inexperienced in the genre can muddle through Shovel Knight and take in the candy-colored sights and sweet blippy sounds and feel satisfied -- but it does take skill to finish it with finesse.  So what the game lacks in lacerating challenge it makes up for in surprising mechanical depth.  I think that's quite a feat!\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't emphasize how wonderfully strange the world of Shovel Knight is.  Certainly, beloved sword & sorcery tropes are invoked, but I don't think we've ever encountered a sawed-off warrior who uses his spade-blade to deflect projectiles, pogo off enemy heads, unearth buried treasure and properly extinguish campfires.  Oh, and he worships an elixir-spitting forest god who is half-trout, half-apple.  I've said too much!

Throughout stages, you can dig up piles of dirt that reveal treasure, which you can then use to buy upgrades, armor, and helpful items to give yourself a boost for that one area that really makes you want to break your keyboard or controller.\n\nI disagree when people assume that graphics make a better game, because those people are wrong and are judging a book by its cover.\nTake a look at the old NES games, and tell me that graphics make a good game.\n\nShovel Knight is a take on the old 8-bit classics we all grew up with and loved to play after school and on summer vacation.\nEverything is there, the 8-bit graphics, chiptune music, and the difficulty: YES, I said difficulty.\nThis is a game at times makes you want to rip your hair out, but with trail and error, you succeed, and you feel satisfied. This game gives you satisfaction when you finish your goals.\nModern games today don't really serve any kind of punishment for failing, they just keep holding your hand, giving you handicaps all the time; there is no challenge anymore.\n\nShovel Knight is a great gem of a game that deserves its praises; everything about what makes a game a game is here.\n\nThis soon-to-be modern classic, hopefully get the sequel it deserves.","July 14, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sorry I'll stop now, but seriously, Shovel Knight manages to take all the elements of the previously mentioned games, blend them all seamlessly together, yet maintains an original feel whilst giving nostlagia for a simpler time, if that makes sense. Heck even the walking animation of Shovel Knight reminds me of Arthur from Ghosts 'n' Goblins.\n\nYou feel as if in you're in control at all times during gameplay, jumping, attacking and platforming all feel excellent and reliable, level design also never came off to me as cheap simply due to actually how good the control of Shovel Knight himself was.\n\nArt style is enticingly retro with great sprite work, colour palettes and sound choices, the OST is pretty solid as well, A personal favourite being the track that plays during the first level. The plot is rather cliche, but still enjoyable, for me it was the likability of the main hero that made not shrug the story off.\n\nFor it's asking price, I did feel rather bothered by it, £7 would of been a perfect price for this game, but there is replayabillity in the form of New Game +s, achievements and unlockables. However this is a fine, fine tribute to an older time yet with fantastic gameplay.

The design is thoughtful and innovative without resorting to gimmicky extras or the cheap deaths that most 'hard platformers' have.

You may be surprised to learn that that one Shovel Knight is, in fact, Shovel Knight.  The game is a legit love letter to the 8-bit hits, with the occasional nod to the newer stuff that's come along since.  It's tough but fair, with an agreeable death system nobody was brilliant enough to come up with in the 80s.  I won't spoil the references made in the design and gameplay, since discovering them for yourself is part of the fun, but as for the most immediate, the game certainly plays Megaman-ish.  If, y'know, Megaman handed in his signature Buster for a shovel.  It's a lot more fun than I made it sound just now.\n\nThe story's dialogue is fun to follow, and the music is hella rad.

I assumed this would be another retro-platformer that mistakes torturing players for gameplay fun (most old games, while challenging, weren't as hard as people make them out to be).\n\nBoy was I wrong about the game. It surprised me to no end. The difficulty curve is quite gentle and the innovative checkpoint system (you can destroy checkpoints for loot if think if you're good enough) plus infinite lives with loot-recovery a la Dark Souls make the game a blast to play.\n\nThe mechanics are like a greatest hits collection of the NES era with clear influences from Mega Man, Duck Tales, Zelda II, Super Mario Bros 3 etc. - yet the game is much more than the sum of its parts / it's a whole new enjoyable experience.\n\nWith around 6 hours on first try (depending on your skill it might take more or less time) and no chance to find everything at first (replayablity), there's plenty of bang for your buck. Also, some of the Kickstarter stretch goals like co-op or playing as a boss character haven't been implemented yet (don't get me wrong, the game is otherwise feature-complete), there will be plenty of fun to be had in the coming months too.\n\nHighly recommended!","June 29, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's about the length of a Mega Man or Mega Man X game, but, in my opinion, a bit easier. There's a decent amount of side content beyond just the boss levels, and user-options to make the game more difficult (such as beating the game without the use of relics). The levels are well-designed and there are very few "cheap" moments.

In spite of the hype about how good it is, simply because it's a throwback to retro games - the game is overall very average in difficulty and it was only deep enough mechanics wise to get me through the first 3/4ths of the game.\n\nThe issue specifically was that if you just did a couple quick runs of older levels, you'd acquire all the gold you need for any of the interesting gear. It is great though that they allowed you to run the levels again just in case you were something like 200 gold short of something. The re-runs simply award too much, making them worthwhile to farm. You could argue I ruined my own experience by farming, but I found this out from being in the very situation aforementioned. Gold then later becomes utterly useless, which was disappointing because the suspense of death is nearly lost then.\n\nDespite all that, the graphics style is pleasant, reminding me of Kirby Superstar and Sonic. I enjoyed the movement/mechanics, the knight behaving like Link in Super Smash Brothers Melee (if he had a pogo shovel.) I'm not an 80's kid so I don't really have a bigger arsenal of experience with retro games to compare it to.\n\nThe music, I'll be honest - I expected better. However, I allowed myself to be hyped about this game; so there's that. The tunes actually are quite catchy and some deliciously solemn (when trying to catch Shield Knight in particular.)\n\nThe story was predictable, but I didn't really buy the game for the story so I'm not disappointed. Characters were predictable as well, but less so than the story - and their mechanics were fairly interesting and fairly unique (I am inexperienced, though.)\n\nThe best parts of the game were really the goofy/silly dialogue and the gameplay (not story, music, etc.) Despite me saying it was average difficulty, there was some brutal and frustrating parts for myself - but I fully expected to be frustrated going into this game.\n\nIf I were to give it a rating, it would be 8/10 overall. Got a good 10 hours out of it. Took me 12 to beat it.","June 30, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best way I could describe Shovel Knight, from the perspective of someone who didn't experience the NES first hand is a case of "old dog, new tricks". This platformer harkens back to the old 8-bit style of the NES in terms of both visuals (sortof, technically, its not actually 8-bit, but whatever) and gameplay, and audio, whilst having a very modern sense of game feel at it's core.\n\nThat's the essential part, and one of the best things , in my opinion, about Shovel Knight. It could've just been a nostalgia trip, but honestly, at the core of it is an extremely well designed game that uses the basic control scheme of the NES to create an impressive level of depth (Just like some NES platformers! HOW ABOUT THAT ♥♥♥♥!). The spells you're given are given are all extremely fun to play and experiment with (Although, Fireballs are a bit OP).\n\nThis game feels like a kind of evolution of the 8 bit style. Story elements are told through gameplay segments that give a great sense of attention to the mainly character driven plot (Though, like 8 bit platformers, the story is quite simple, in general. It does gain some unfounded depth throughout the game, however.)\n\nThe boss battles are all amazing, with the right level of challenge leeway such that you can beat the bosses in a number of ways (No use weapon X to beat this boss a la Mega Man). the score is FANTASTIC (virt has the OST available to download, GO GET IT!).

The quirky, off-beat humor is tastefully done and never wears out it's welcome or grows stale, and the game turns a few of the age-old tropes on it's ear in surprising (and excellent) ways.

Heading out with only his blue suit of armor and his shovel, you battle through levels of increasing difficulty and danger with a checkpoint system and boss encounters very much lovingly reintroduced in the Mega Man style - each with their own speciality and traits.\n\nDesign-wise we've gone full Nintendo here, and not in a bad way. 8 bit style. NES color palette. The music is generally awesome throughout the whole game, with some real standout tracks. Level themes for Lost City & Flying Machine are my favorites and I found myself humming along for so many of the themes. for The campfire music captures a bit of Final Fantasy nostalgia in its melody.\n\nOld school platformers typically relied on the tired method of death punishment with a defined amount of lives before game over but Shovel Knight borrows from the Souls series of punishment where you will drop behind bags of your gold at your death location which you can then retrieve. If you don't make it back then of course you will lose that gold.\n\nThe controls in a platformer of this type are critical and everything feels super tight: jumping, attacking, item usage, cancel animations - it's all there and it really makes the game shine when you hit the tougher levels and end up pulling off a combo of moves that make your jaw drop. In particular the phase locket can really allow for a lot of unique situations where you can pull your ♥♥♥ out of the fire and save yourself from certain death.\n\nAnother great aspect of being a throwback is that Shovel Knight does bring a challenge to the table. Both levels and bosses will test your mettle often, sometimes to frustrating levels but it's never a game that feels cheap or unfair.\n\nThe only gripe I could possibly have with the game is it's length. I beat it in around 6 hours of playtime, it could be done much faster than that. However when you step back and compare it against the old school platformers that length is actually pretty decent. Longer than basically any Mega Man game. It's hard to really complain about this especially when Yacht Club Games is bringing more and more content to the game as part of the Kickstarter stretch goals. There is also some re-playability with NG+ and some tough achievements like no death runs.\n\nI loved this game and can't recommend it enough.\n\nTL;DR: 9/10","January 23, 2015","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no hand-holding, there's just you and what skills you can bring with you.  There is no level or equipment grind, no gear to make your life easier and no cheap tricks to win the day.  Much like the games of old, it's all on you to make it to the right side of the screen.\n\nThis game embodies everything that made the NES classics the NES classics.  The music, the air-tight controls, the aesthetics and the sometimes brutal, skill-based difficulty, and even the "menu lag" that was commonplace because of a lack of available frames to make the menu look to be opening smoothly.\n\nIf you're a fan of skill-based platformers, or a veteran of the bygone eras when games like Castlevania, Metroid, Zelda and Mario were the undisputed champions of the CRT screen, you will find absolutely nothing here to be disappointed by.  This game is the "Golden Age" of NES platforming in its rawest form, and even the achievements will keep you hunting for that perfect playthrough in ways you'll find unusual and challenging, extending your playtime with more than just a frustrating, pointless collection-fest.\n\nYou want a review?  97% of 3,366 people recommended this game.\n\nThere's your review.","January 22, 2015","true","94.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As it takes a lot of stuff from old games, it tweaks and refines them into much better experience and gameplay.\n\nThe Story is quite simple but still quite charming and mysterious. Shovel Knight & Shield Knight were adventuring in this forsaken, evil tower until they triggered some kind of horrendous magic and Shield Knight dissapeared. Shovel Knight managed to escape with a broken heart, as the tower sealed itself once again. Years later, the squad of evil guys appear and the tower opens once again. Shovel Knight decides to return there and find out what happened to his dear friend Shield Knight. And also to kick the bad knights asses, of course!\n\nThe gameplay itself is kind of a same as in Castlevania, but instead of a whip you have a shorter ranged shovel what you can use to dig, whack and pogojump only into enemies. There's also upgrades and usable items which you can buy to make your Shovel Knight much better.\n\nThe stage desing is like in Megamans but with checkpoints which you can also destroy for harder challenge. Each of the main stages has their own special theme and in the end of each one their unique boss. There's also special stages and random special encounters in the world map for more shovely action.\n\nThe music in this game is as awesome as the game itself. What I've seen, there's over 40 unique tracks of music for each stage, boss and town. If you love Megamans music, you'll love this one too.\n\nIn the end I don't have anything negative to say about this game. It's so charming and awesome that I can't but to recommend this to everyone who love old NES games and to those who are new to this genre. ♥/♥\n","June 27, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As others have stated, Shovel Knight draws upon classic Mega Man games, Zelda II, SMB3 and to an extent, Ducktales and Castlevania. It does what it intends to do perfectly, gameplay feels solid, story is there to keep you motivated but doesn't try to preach to you, music is some of the best chiptune around and the graphics are aesthetically pleasing. Of course it isn't a 'true' NES game in regards to console limitations as that would just be silly to make sacrifices at the cost of complete authenticty. Stuff like screen flickering and enemy limitation etc. do not detract from the gameplay at all.\n\nThat being said, the game isnt entirely perfect. My major complaint is that it is quite short and left me wanting more, but thats to be expected of the game design employed. Thankfully, free DLC is to come, so that sorts that out, but I would have still loved to see maybe more 'Wily Styled' stages for the end game, instead of just 2 before the final boss. Difficulty-wise, the game may throw a cheap tactic at you at times, but for the most part, its about on par with some more modern 2D platformers, such as Rayman Origins/Legends. It is not '1980s Nintendo Difficult', but it isn't mind numbingly easy. Achievements/feats that encouarge players to not even get hit once throughout a playthrough are there for those who want a challenge, NG+ also solves this dilemma.\n\nOverall, a solid title well worth the $15 just for the fact that more content is to come and what we have now is worth it regardless. If you're a fan of any of the previously mentioned titles that this game draws upon, I would highly reccomend it.","July 2, 2014","true","37.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is simple; rescue your friend and fellow warrior Shield Knight. She was taken by the Dark Enchantress and is being guarded by a team of evil knights, each with their own themes. In this way, the game feels like Mega Man. There is "King Knight", who's level is a giant castle filled with royal themed villains. Specter Knight inhabits a graveyard and has an army of ghosts and skeletons. The banter between your character and others is witty and made me chuckle from time to time.\n\nThe visuals look like the final generation of NES games. The pixel art is well done and feels authentic. I feel like its limited visuals never take away from the game, but do add character and flavor. Music and sound is good, but never had me really impressed. It just kinda does the job.\n\nThe difficulty in this game is tricky. Many of these games pride themselves on being difficult, and Shovel Knight would like to make you think it's challenging, but its not. Sure some of the jumps are tricky and you do instantly die when you come in contact with spikes, but the game is so amazingly forgiving in other areas. There are numerous checkpoints, infinite lives, and 2 items that refill all your life and mana. Anyone with basic platformer skills and the ability to learn from experience can beat this thing in under 6 hours.\n\nSadly, the replayability on this one is pretty minimal. Once beating it, there is a new game+ mode, but I found little interest in it. This game shines in its character and polish. Worth a play through for those wanting something nostalgic, charming, and somewhat challenging.","December 28, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shovel Knight is definitely that, but it's also the finest example of that in the last few years.\n\nDeveloped by Yacht Club Games, This is yet another success of how Kickstarter can bring you a game that would of not otherwise been made via  traditional funding methods.\n\nShovel Knight takes the retro-ness to a new level though. It's incredibly faithful, whilst removing some of the limitations of the NES console (like sprite flickering, and some other limitations). The developers stuck to the original NES color palette, though they added an 1 or 2 extra colours as Yacht Club insisted that they couldn't make certain things look the way they wanted without the extra colours. It's outstounding what they did with the limitations. The pixel art is absolutely full of character, talent and is wonderful to look at.\n\nYou play as a knight that wields a shovel -  aka Shovel Knight (how awesome, right?). The story is quite simple, Shovel Knight and Shield Knight fought alongside each other, traversing across the world seeking treasure together. But for reasons that I won't spoil, you are seperated. After secluding himself and griefing for Shield Knight, he digs up his shovel again, hoping to find and rescue Shield Knight.\n\nThe sound uses a sound engine that was used in some of the Japanese Famicom console or something along those lines. You can even put the sound track onto a NES cartridge, and it would play on a NES! (Sadly, the whole game wouldn't though - as I mentioned, they removed some of the limitations that wouldn't make it possible to play it on a NES console). It definitely nails the authenticity of 8bit sound.\n\nThe music is probably why I instantly fell in love with Shovel Knight within the first 30 seconds of the first level. What a cracker of a track. Every single level has a track that you will be bopping and humming melodies to for days. This isn't music that is 'good for chiptunes', it is GREAT music that just happens to be chiptunes.\n\nAs every track has a theme, so do the levels. Every level has a themed boss (Propeller Knight, Polar Knight and Mole Knight - for instance), where the whole level will be themed around the boss mechanically and visually. Every level adds some new mechanic and challenge that keeps it fresh as you progress through the game.\n\nThe razor tight controls are why it's so fun to play (I would recommend playing with a pad). It takes elements from certain games like Duck Tales, Megaman and Mario... and combines them with some light RPG elements. What you have is a game that feels, looks and plays oldschool. But has the polish and design tendancies of a more modern game. It gets quite challenging towards the towards the end of the game too, but newgame+ is where you will find the real challenge as checkpoints are halved, enemies do more damage, and most food platters that heal you will instead, turn into bombs that will try to bury you.\n\nI can't really praise Shovel Knight enough. It does so much right, and if it was released 20 years ago, it probably would of been hailed as a classic.","July 30, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does a pretty good job of resembling one as well. This game isn't just a nostagia trip.\n\nShovel Knight is an 8-bit platformer that takes inspiration from the best some of the best NES games ever made: Super Mario bros 3, Mega Man, Castlevania, Ducktales and even Legend of Zelda 2. The game's controls may be hard to get used to at first, but if you really need to you can rebind the keys. The game teaches you how to play without instuctions (however the PC version will be harder to learn since thier are 30+ keys that could do something). The character you play as, Shovel Knight, moves right away once the key is pressed and stops right away when the key is let go, something that platformers really need.\n\nEach level in the game is unique, every level in the game has its own types of obstacles . Underwater, lava, dark, icy and air levels are examples of what you willl see in this game. Each level also has secrets, which are hidden well.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is really cool, sounds just like NES music. Thier is even a song in it that was made by the person who made the Mega Man music.\n\nThe story in this game is just like and NES game as well, (just with a few differences) girlfriend gets kidnapped and you battle Black Knight,  "The Order of No Quarter" and The Echantress to have a chance to save her. Not a story dirven game, but its not a bad story either.\n\nI highly recommend this game, it is really fun to play, it plays like an NES game and even just as a platformer in genral is awesome.\n\n\n","November 21, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I want to enjoy them, but they often come off as bland, uninspired, and lacking a distinct charm that I crave.  Hell, it took me until Team Fortress 2 to even own an FPS title.\n\nSo yeah, I'm a fan of the classics, and it saddens me that younger gamers seldom get a taste of what gaming was like back in the day.  Leave it to Shovel Knight to set the record straight.\n\nRight from the first notes of the intro stage theme, I knew that this was gonna be FUN.  And I was exactly right.  It was FUN.  The distinct charm that I crave.  FUN.\n\nPoetic language aside, I love just about everything in this game.  The gameplay is simple to understand yet hard to master.  The presentation is quirky and colorful (the main character wields a shovel, for Mew's sake). and everything from the 8-bit graphics to the kickass chiptune soundtrack reeks of retro charm.\n\nSpeaking of retro, the gameplay reflects this quite well.  As stated before, it's simple and draws inspiration from several sources, yet it still feels like its own entity.  After all, it's still a game made in 2014, and the achievement system and upgrade shops serve as a reminder to this.\n\nOf course, a game isn't retro without challenge, and it's sadly the one point that I find slightly lacking.  That's not because there is no challenge; it just feels like the wrong kind of challenge at times.  I can tolerate challenge via level design and game progression, and Shovel Knight does that well.  However, I still can't get over certain factors that feel rather cheap at times.  Enemy placement is ungodly annoying, especially in the later levels, and design choices like the blackout segments from the Lich Yard never cease to infuriate me.  Even then, all you're doing is losing money upon death, but if you die repeatedly, get ready to grind gold and backtrack to get what you want.\n\nBut I can overlook this.  Because really, if that's all I have to complain about, then Shovel Knight is truly worthy of the acclaim it's received.  Mainstream developers, take notes.  Because indie companies are on the rise, and if this game is any indication, they're doing your job better than you are at the moment.\n\n9.5/10; currently my favorite game that I first played in 2015","April 5, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is only one real gripe I have about it (and a secondary minor one), but the music, level design, and even the story are amazing.  The bosses (some of them anyways) are not as hard as one would think and can be dispatched pretty easily, and you inherently have infinite lives on a given level.  While you do lose loot on death and you can destroy checkpoints (those concepts I like), it's not quite enough to balance out the fact that it's more about your patience on a level than using a more traditional lives pool.\n\nAs I said earlier though, music, gameplay, level design, and the story are very well detailed and worth indulging in the game.

I am inclined to agree, but this game has the advantage of having more shovel-related puns. Off the top of my head, I don't know that Ducktales had even one of those...\n\nOn a more serious note, this is a pretty sold action-platformer in which you play a shovel-wielding knight waging war against an evil cadre of fantasy villains. Along the way, you talk to villagers, encounter half-trout/half-apple allies, collect magical relics, and slay dragons with a gardening implement. It's all pretty fun stuff. Graphics are bright, colourful, and polished.

Something about it didn't let me stop playing. I sat down and beat it start to finish, non-stop. (Okay I had to pee once) I'd like to blame it on nostalgia, but the only thing truly unoriginal oldschool thing about Shovel knight is the 8-16 bit style. I suppose you could say the boss fights remind you of Megaman. The overworld reminds you of Mario. But there's relics, secrets and technical combat you don't really get from those games.\n\nShovel your way to riches and hoard it until you can afford the ever increasingly expensive upgrades. Search for the relics, which will not only give you combat advantages or movement boosts, but provide useful for future secrets and challenges. The gameplay is just different - and in a good way. You wield a freakin' shovel!\n\nGUESS WHAT, THOUGH. There's a STORY to Shovel Knight and it's awesome. You lose you beloved Shield Knight (f) and have nightmares about saving her. You battle your way to the Evil Enchantress who has either captured or killed Shield Knight. Black Knight, your rival, runs into you often along the way. You must defeat the Order of No Quarter in order to proceed to the Evil Enchantress, which consists of different modded Knights with interesting and often humorous characteristics.\n\nI started Shovel Knight expecting to screw around. Decided to do some playful voices and be dorky with it. Maybe rush through it, being all tryhard. But I ended up falling in love. At some point I forgot I was doing voices and really got engrossed in the entire situation. I'm glad I was streaming because this is a game I want to remember. It's on YouTube as a playlist now, for those interested. It took me about 4:45 to beat the game fully.\n\nMy favorite part is how well Shovel Knight teaches you how to play without directly telling you. Every level introduces a new mechanic, and there's always a part on each level (especially the tutorial) that teaches you new things. And you'll have to reapply the things you learned at a moment's notice.\n\nAs far as challenging yourself... When you die, you release what seemed like 1/3 or 1/4 of your gold. Think of it as a more forgiving Dark Souls. You can go back to where you died and pick up that gold. Alternatively, there are checkpoints on each level. If you feel like the level is easy, you can actually destroy the checkpoint crystal for gold. If you do well on the level (I'm uncertain on the specifics, could be not dying or taking damage) the crystal changes color and holds more gold the more you pass without defeat. So you can also get accumulative growth in gold for taking the risk of removing the checkpoints.\n\nShovel Knight has great functionality IN SPADES....... Just play it.","September 28, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shovel Knight however is the exception to the rule, as the most polished title I've ever seen come from a Kickstarter campaign I can definitely say that this game comes highly recommended and with yet more free content on the horizon, Shovel Knight is the gift that just keeps on giving.\n\nClearly inspired by the NES era of gaming and with obvious nods to the classics of old (specifically the Megaman series, a fond favourite of mine) this game delivers on all fronts. With a quality sound track, imaginative art direction and larger than life characters, this challenging platformer delivers on everything it promises. I had been looking forward to this game for a long time and picked it up at launch, but waited to write a review because I was so impressed with it that I really wanted to do it justice. After experiencing some recent disappointment with hyped up Kickstarter titles (namely Hyperlight Drifter) I felt now was the best time to share my love for Shovel Knight in the hopes that more passionate developers will find inspiration in the example set by Yacht Club Games and that indie gaming can return to being less about unwanted hipster drama and more about quality gameplay from developers who genuinely care about the medium.\n\nIf being impressed by the base game wasn't enough Yacht Club released the first of a number of free DLCs in the form of Plague Knight's adventure, one of the bosses from the base game whose story you can now play through to see how he ended up in the position he's in when you encounter him as Shovel Knight. Not only did this DLC manage to be surprisingly different from the base game both in terms of how Plague Knight plays and offering his own seperate story, but it also managed to keep things fresh by having a very different feel and adding a dash of extra humour to the character to make the initially creepy Plague Knight actually seem surprisingly sympathetic, funny and dare I say somewhat lovable. This leaves me very confident that the upcoming DLC adventures will by just as polished and I have to say I am really looking forward to them.\n\nShovel Knight is easily up there with the best of Indie titles, alongside such great games as Cave Story and Freedom Planet, I really can't recommend this game enough! For those of you who have fond memories of the NES era and younger gamers who want a retro experience, you really can't go wrong with Shovel Knight, so do yourself a favour and get shovelling for shovelry!","April 3","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, the gameplay is solid, challenging at some points and the story is decent for a "kickstarter/indie" game.

You could even say that I really dig it (runs away).\n\nYou can really see all the dedication and effort that was put into making this game. The Controls are great, The soundtrack is great. The Level desing is great. Even the characters have a lot of charm and personality to them, even though they don't exactly have a lot of depth to them. Shovel knight is also full of humor and all kinds of references, and both of tose have been done extremely well. I laughed out loud a couple of times while playing this game.\n\nThe levels are also quite varied and they are full of all kinds of little secrets to find. And then the boss fights, oh those boss fights. Each of them has their own theme(just like the levels they are in), and all of them are simply fun and quite challenging to fight against. Speaking of challenge, the game starts out quite easy, but the difficulty ramps up quite quickly, yet the game never felt unfair. If you die, you only have yourself to blame. You can always try to blame the game but you are only lying to yourself if you do that you silly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game did have a few flaws though. Some of the items you can get are EXTREMELY overpowered compared to others. Also, it is a bit silly that you can tank a huge hit from a boss no problem, yet a spike scratching your ankle is an instant kill. The game is also a lil short, but I didn't really mind it that much because the level of quality remained high from beginning to end. If they make another Shovel knight game, I really hope they would make a co-op mode of some kind, where the other player could play as the Shield Knight. If that  ends up happening, they better send me a million dollars for creating this idea.\n\nOverall, Shovel knight is 1 of the best games of 2014, and I'm gonna give it an 8,5 out of 10. I'm looking forward to seeing Shovel Knight 2: The Shoveling someday\n\n\nEdit: Well it seem that I got what I asked for. Plague of shadows update was released, and it dramatically increased the amount of content in the game by adding a challenge mode and a completely new character who has his own campaign. With the Plague of shadows, Shovel knight reinforces it's status as 1 of my favorite indie games of all time. Keep up the good work Yacht club!","March 8, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

I usualy don't write reviews as I'm quite bad at staying objective, but this game deserves a review.\n\nReview: Shovel Knight\nLet me start of by pointing out how amazing this game is. This game has giving the so many memories, and I cant remember how happy I was when I got that "perfect achievment score" notification when I speedran the game and made it That was untill they added another 20 achievments\n\nThis game is probably my favourite game of all time. It's just perfect, hands down.\n\n• The soundtrack is just great. It's a good ol' 8Bit soundtrack, that still sounds fresh and modern somehow. In a good way. They even had the creator of some of the original Mega Man sound track help with the making of some of the soundtracks in this game.\n\n• The level design is fantastic. Every level is unique from the others, and while they can be hard to begin with (my first playthrough took me 13 hours, I'm so bad), but with practise they can easily be beaten in a few minutes.\n\n• Just like with the levels, the bosses are unique, and unlike many other platformer-bosses, these bosses have a personality, so you end up liking them, and they're not just "can I get this over with ASAP" like so many other bosses I've fought in my years of gaming.\n\n• Plague of Shadows: This update allows you to play as one of the bosses, Plague Knight. This updated almost doubled the amount of content in the game, as the update wasn't just a reskin of the original game. Plague Knight has his own storyline, own very unique and fun controls, and a whole new item system. I would gladly have payed for this free DLC.\n\n• Plague of Shadows also added a challenge mode, with roughly 20 challenges for each character, Shovel Knight and Plague Knight, and I really enjoyed those. Some of them are completed in first try, and some of them can take hours and will result in you having to buy a new gamepad. The replayvalue of those challenges vary, however, some of them are good for practising.\n\nConclusion While this game is very comparible to games like Mega Man and Castlevania, Shovel Knight does by no means rely on "nostalgia" to be a good game. It's simply just an 8Bit platformer done right. Very right.\nYou don't need to be an old school 90's kid who grew up with Mario and Mega Man to enjoy this game.\nSo if you're looking for a cheap game that will provide months of entertainment, then Shovel Knight is the game for you.","September 17, 2015","true","86.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shovel Knight is set in the style of NES style platformers of old. The game can be categorized as an "Action Platformer" You attack, jump and even do moves to traverse much like Link does in Zelda II and Duck Tails. This simple addition adds so much availability for unique platforming segments. The game is the perfect difficulty. If you die, it's your fault and your fault only. The characters are unique, the levels are the just the right difficulty, and it doesn't hold your hand. My favorite part of this game is the first level. Teaching you how to play the game without a bunch of menus and tutorial segments. I've completed this game on WiiU and Steam. It's available on many different types of platforms if that's your thing. And with the promise of free DLC coming out, You get so much bang for your buck. My only complaint is when you get hit you get slightly knocked back. This isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. It's minimal at most but it's still a minor complaint I have. It could of been a lot worse, but still something to mention.

If you grew up playing console or cabinet games this game is for you.  It's what would happen if Blizzard decided to make a 2D 16bit platformer.  Nearly every good aspect of the ancient platformers (Super Mario, Zelda, Contra, Castlevania, Ducktales) are represented along with a great period soundtrack.\n\nI played through in roughly 15 hours, (much of it offline so steam didn't report it well.)  The storypieces weren't a detraction being in text (with no speech) it was immersive in the nostalgic sense.  I can see how a younger player might not get it, but if you ever played the classic platformers you will find this entertaining.","June 12, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That´s a good thing. :-)\nThere are also traces of Mario in there.\nBut fear not, the game is far from a clone, it brings enough of its own to the table, while paying homage to the classics.\nEverything is tied together with an upbeat chiptune soundtrack, which I quite enjoyed.\n\nDifficulty & Stuff\nI would say the difficulty is medium. While I mentioned Mega Man 2 earlier, this is far easier. While there are some tricky platforming sections, frustration is kept low. The boss fights range from easy (King Knight) to fairly punishing (Plague Knight!).\nBy gather gold and gems you can afford items and permanent upgrades to your life and magic to make things easier.\n\nDeath sets you back to the last checkpoint, which are fairly spaced out. You also lose a portion of your gold, which is left floating at the place where you fell, to recollect.\n\nDuration & Replayability\nThe game took me about 6-7 hours to complete. After that, there is a New Game Plus mode, which has you starting with all of your gear, but increased difficulty (mostly less health pickups and more damaging enemies).\nI have not completed it yet, but it is noticably harder than the first round.\n\nThere is also a number of "feats" (achievements) to be gained, and a lot of secret rooms to find.\n\nHeartilty recommended if you like classic platformers from the NES era.\nI guess the game is rather kid friendly, there is no actual violence, the Shovel Knight gives his adverseries a sound spanking, but nobody is killed.\n\nAlso: The Shovel Knight´s deadly sin is Greed, seriously, hoarding all that gold.. ;-)","May 27, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You could even say that I really dig it (runs away).\n\nYou can really see all the dedication and effort that was put into making this game. The Controls are great, The soundtrack is great. The Level desing is great. Even the characters have a lot of charm and personality to them, even though they don't exactly have a lot of depth to them. Shovel knight is also full of humor and all kinds of references, and both of tose have been done extremely well. I laughed out loud a couple of times while playing this game.\n\nThe levels are also quite varied and they are full of all kinds of little secrets to find. And then the boss fights, oh those boss fights. Each of them has their own theme(just like the levels they are in), and all of them are simply fun and quite challenging to fight against. Speaking of challenge, the game starts out quite easy, but the difficulty ramps up quite quickly, yet the game never felt unfair. If you die, you only have yourself to blame. You can always try to blame the game but you are only lying to yourself if you do that you silly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game did have a few flaws though. Some of the items you can get are EXTREMELY overpowered compared to others. Also, it is a bit silly that you can tank a huge hit from a boss no problem, yet a spike scratching your ankle is an instant kill. The game is also a lil short, but I didn't really mind it that much because the level of quality remained high from beginning to end. If they make another Shovel knight game, I really hope they would make a co-op mode of some kind, where the other player could play as the Shield Knight. If that  ends up happening, they better send me a million dollars for creating this idea.\n\nOverall, Shovel knight is 1 of the best games of 2014, and I'm gonna give it an 8,5 out of 10. I'm looking forward to seeing Shovel Knight 2: The Shoveling someday\n\n\nEdit: Well it seem that I got what I asked for. Plague of shadows update was released, and it dramatically increased the amount of content in the game by adding a challenge mode and a completely new character who has his own campaign. With the Plague of shadows, Shovel knight reinforces it's status as 1 of my favorite indie games of all time.

Shovel Knight is set in the style of NES style platformers of old. The game can be categorized as an "Action Platformer" You attack, jump and even do moves to traverse much like Link does in Zelda II and Duck Tails. This simple addition adds so much availability for unique platforming segments. The game is the perfect difficulty. If you die, it's your fault and your fault only. The characters are unique, the levels are the just the right difficulty, and it doesn't hold your hand. My favorite part of this game is the first level. Teaching you how to play the game without a bunch of menus and tutorial segments. I've completed this game on WiiU and Steam. It's available on many different types of platforms if that's your thing. And with the promise of free DLC coming out, You get so much bang for your buck. My only complaint is when you get hit you get slightly knocked back. This isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. It's minimal at most but it's still a minor complaint I have. It could of been a lot worse, but still something to mention.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FireEatingNinja/recommended/250760/","FireEatingNinja","FireEatingNinja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FireEatingNinja/","623 products in account","Shovel Knight deserves some major praise. Something about it didn't let me stop playing. I sat down and beat it start to finish, non-stop. (Okay I had to pee once) I'd like to blame it on nostalgia, but the only thing truly unoriginal oldschool thing about Shovel knight is the 8-16 bit style. I suppose you could say the boss fights remind you of Megaman. The overworld reminds you of Mario. But there's relics, secrets and technical combat you don't really get from those games.\n\nShovel your way to riches and hoard it until you can afford the ever increasingly expensive upgrades. Search for the relics, which will not only give you combat advantages or movement boosts, but provide useful for future secrets and challenges. The gameplay is just different - and in a good way. You wield a freakin' shovel!\n\nGUESS WHAT, THOUGH. There's a STORY to Shovel Knight and it's awesome. You lose you beloved Shield Knight (f) and have nightmares about saving her. You battle your way to the Evil Enchantress who has either captured or killed Shield Knight. Black Knight, your rival, runs into you often along the way. You must defeat the Order of No Quarter in order to proceed to the Evil Enchantress, which consists of different modded Knights with interesting and often humorous characteristics.\n\nI started Shovel Knight expecting to screw around. Decided to do some playful voices and be dorky with it. Maybe rush through it, being all tryhard. But I ended up falling in love. At some point I forgot I was doing voices and really got engrossed in the entire situation. I'm glad I was streaming because this is a game I want to remember. It's on YouTube as a playlist now, for those interested. It took me about 4:45 to beat the game fully.\n\nMy favorite part is how well Shovel Knight teaches you how to play without directly telling you. Every level introduces a new mechanic, and there's always a part on each level (especially the tutorial) that teaches you new things. And you'll have to reapply the things you learned at a moment's notice.\n\nAs far as challenging yourself... When you die, you release what seemed like 1/3 or 1/4 of your gold. Think of it as a more forgiving Dark Souls. You can go back to where you died and pick up that gold. Alternatively, there are checkpoints on each level. If you feel like the level is easy, you can actually destroy the checkpoint crystal for gold. If you do well on the level (I'm uncertain on the specifics, could be not dying or taking damage) the crystal changes color and holds more gold the more you pass without defeat. So you can also get accumulative growth in gold for taking the risk of removing the checkpoints.\n\nShovel Knight has great functionality IN SPADES....... Just play it.","September 28, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each detail enhances the love that Yacht Club Games and us as players have for the genre in many, many ways that add up throughout its welcome runtime (8-10 hours not including Plague Knight content) and never overstay their welcome. The plot is simple, easy to follow, and gives you better motivation than most triple A games nowadays, but the tight controls, practical arsenal, and excellent use of the classic 8-16bit style, gives it an emotion of its own that's hard to put into words. I was simply floored by the game as a whole, as well as the intelligence it assumes you have as a human being. Games were hard in the past to increase their longevity and keep it from getting boring too quick. Shovel Knight is hard because Shovel Knight's task is hard! But the struggle is infinitely worth it\nStory: What it needs to be/10\nGameplay: 9/10 (10/10 if you have the pleasure of being the plague knight)\nMusic: 10/10 no questions asked. I really loved how at the hub worlds like villages, the music changes it's 8 bit synths a little bit with each area.\n\nVerdict is 9/10 because there is no perfect game yet but if nothing steps up soon I will be happy to throw my vote in the suggestion hat.

The platforming is engaging, with treacherous enemy placement and a down attack mechanic that boosts your height.

As a result, I have no particular nostalia for its aesthetics, but I found it damn charming anyway.  Great art and animation, and fantastic music.  The developers' choice to limit themselves to an 8-bit palette, while ignoring other technical limitations of the era, works well and I find the design more cohesive than pretty much any other throwback pixel art game I've played.\n\nThe game is difficult by modern standards, but certainly nowhere near a "masocore" platformer.  Ultimately, I really enjoyed how it played despite a few frustrating bits.  The fact that the character control feels just about perfect in terms of respoviness goes a long way to mitigating the challenge.  I'm guessing the game is actually quite forgiving in comparsion to many of the games it pays homage to, but I think it's just right in terms of proving a challenge that feels like it can be overcome without requiring so much practice it stops being entertainment.\n\nBefore buying, I was unsure about the game because of that difficulty and because I have no particular reverance for it's ancestors, but I'm very glad I gave it a shot.  While it's not a game that I think is going to be especially memorable for me, I ended up enjoying it a lot.","January 11, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all though, if you like Duck Tales mixed with Zelda and a dash of Super Mario for good measure, then this game is for you.\n\n:Tips to avoid pulling hair out over losing dat phat, phat loot:\n\n-The fishing pole can grab dat phat loot that looms over chasms after you've died.\n-Keep a yellow potion to snag other phat loot you don't have time to grab.\n-Sometimes, if it's a tough area--and the save station is a ways back--it might be best to let dat sweet phat loot go until later.

There is only one real gripe I have about it (and a secondary minor one), but the music, level design, and even the story are amazing.  The bosses (some of them anyways) are not as hard as one would think and can be dispatched pretty easily, and you inherently have infinite lives on a given level.  While you do lose loot on death and you can destroy checkpoints (those concepts I like), it's not quite enough to balance out the fact that it's more about your patience on a level than using a more traditional lives pool.\n\nAs I said earlier though, music, gameplay, level design, and the story are very well detailed and worth indulging in the game.

It does a pretty good job of resembling one as well. This game isn't just a nostagia trip.\n\nShovel Knight is an 8-bit platformer that takes inspiration from the best some of the best NES games ever made: Super Mario bros 3, Mega Man, Castlevania, Ducktales and even Legend of Zelda 2. The game's controls may be hard to get used to at first, but if you really need to you can rebind the keys. The game teaches you how to play without instuctions (however the PC version will be harder to learn since thier are 30+ keys that could do something). The character you play as, Shovel Knight, moves right away once the key is pressed and stops right away when the key is let go, something that platformers really need.\n\nEach level in the game is unique, every level in the game has its own types of obstacles . Underwater, lava, dark, icy and air levels are examples of what you willl see in this game. Each level also has secrets, which are hidden well.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is really cool, sounds just like NES music. Thier is even a song in it that was made by the person who made the Mega Man music.\n\nThe story in this game is just like and NES game as well, (just with a few differences) girlfriend gets kidnapped and you battle Black Knight,  "The Order of No Quarter" and The Echantress to have a chance to save her. Not a story dirven game, but its not a bad story either.\n\nI highly recommend this game, it is really fun to play, it plays like an NES game and even just as a platformer in genral is awesome.\n\n\n","November 21, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shovel Knight however is the exception to the rule, as the most polished title I've ever seen come from a Kickstarter campaign I can definitely say that this game comes highly recommended and with yet more free content on the horizon, Shovel Knight is the gift that just keeps on giving.\n\nClearly inspired by the NES era of gaming and with obvious nods to the classics of old (specifically the Megaman series, a fond favourite of mine) this game delivers on all fronts. With a quality sound track, imaginative art direction and larger than life characters, this challenging platformer delivers on everything it promises. I had been looking forward to this game for a long time and picked it up at launch, but waited to write a review because I was so impressed with it that I really wanted to do it justice. After experiencing some recent disappointment with hyped up Kickstarter titles (namely Hyperlight Drifter) I felt now was the best time to share my love for Shovel Knight in the hopes that more passionate developers will find inspiration in the example set by Yacht Club Games and that indie gaming can return to being less about unwanted hipster drama and more about quality gameplay from developers who genuinely care about the medium.\n\nIf being impressed by the base game wasn't enough Yacht Club released the first of a number of free DLCs in the form of Plague Knight's adventure, one of the bosses from the base game whose story you can now play through to see how he ended up in the position he's in when you encounter him as Shovel Knight. Not only did this DLC manage to be surprisingly different from the base game both in terms of how Plague Knight plays and offering his own seperate story, but it also managed to keep things fresh by having a very different feel and adding a dash of extra humour to the character to make the initially creepy Plague Knight actually seem surprisingly sympathetic, funny and dare I say somewhat lovable. This leaves me very confident that the upcoming DLC adventures will by just as polished and I have to say I am really looking forward to them.\n\nShovel Knight is easily up there with the best of Indie titles, alongside such great games as Cave Story and Freedom Planet, I really can't recommend this game enough! For those of you who have fond memories of the NES era and younger gamers who want a retro experience, you really can't go wrong with Shovel Knight, so do yourself a favour and get shovelling for shovelry!","April 3","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You are able to revisit levels to find things you may have missed.

This game is hands down one of the best games you can get on steam in my opinion.\n\nThe feel of the game reminds me of so many classic NES games. Things such as:\nZelda\nMario\nMega Man\nCastlevania\n\nYou basically run around through different levels collecting a variety of items (power-ups, coins, hidden music sheets) and fight a boss at the end of each level. You are able to revisit levels to find things you may have missed. The coins you use in town to buy more power-ups (new skills, more health/mana, items).\n\nFor anyone who grew up playing the games I listed earlier (and enjoyed them) this game is definitely for you.","April 22, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trojanhorse711/recommended/250760/","trojanhorse711","TrojanHorse711","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trojanhorse711/","80 products in account","Update (5.25.16) - Adjusting some details to accommodate for newly added features. And as a side note, this only covers the standard campaign.\n\nIf this landed on the NES way back as it is (sans modern-era features like achievements and Streetpass), it would have been GOAT. As it stands, it's my personal GOAT.\n\nGameplay: Absolutely fantastic. The controls are designed for a NES-style platforming experience, and on Wii U it's pretty simple. However, on PC you have a variety of different options. The physics and actions are what you'd expect from a 2D 8-bit platformer, and unlike most platformers I've played (that aren't Mario), Shovel Knight makes them near-perfect. As far as what this game has going for it, it doesn't try to directly copy from Mega Man or Mario. Rather, it takes inspiration from the better games of its era and crafts something original while still keeping within the restrictions of the era. 10/10\n\nGraphics: It, like many, MANY pixel-art games these past few years, boasts an "8-bit retro aesthetic"; notably it's become one of my pet peeves. However, out of all the games that try to claim authenticity (forgive me for misspelling), Shovel Knight comes incredibly close. In fact, graphics-wise it's one of the very few games that deserves the title (the others being Mighty Gunvolt, Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10; not even the recently-released Axiom Verge deserves this due to a crapton of visual effects more suited to a modern game despite having really solid foreground art). From there, a great visual style and some top-tier NES animation makes for a great-looking game overall. (Special mention goes to the Xbox One version, which near-perfectly emulates the Battletoads style in both Turbo Tunnel and Wookie Hole) 9/10\n\nDifficulty: Standard gameplay isn't quite challenging. I'd say it's about as difficult as Super Mario Bros. 3, to give a direct comparison. It ramps up around the third area (Flying Machine, Standed Ship, and Clockwork Tower). The bosses, on the other hand, are pretty difficult until you get used to them. Once you beat the main game, you unlock New Game Plus, which is by far more difficult than you'd expect. Enemies deal double damage, reduced number of checkpoints, barely any health recovery...oof! (XB1 only - you fight the Battletoads in a level that is basically a clone of the Wookie Hole and the infamous Turbo Tunnel. Expect that to be pretty difficult.) 10/10 it's fair.\n\nMusic: Jake Kaufman is no stranger to chiptune composition. One of his most famous works outside of Shovel Knight was Shantae for the GBC. Here, he doesn't mess around. Together with Manami Matsumae, Shovel Knight boasts an impressive soundtrack composed entirely in authentic NES chiptune with very catchy tunes that wouldn't feel out of place in the NES era. (Special mention goes to the Village theme and "The Forlorn Sanctum", which successfully implement a variable mix.) 10/10\n\nWriting: The story itself is standard-fare for a video game. Your girlfriend has been captured, go save her! Defeat a multitude of bosses along the way! However, the dialogue in this game is wordy, and although it's definitely quirky there's so much of it that I felt it wasn't really all that authentic. Granted, I liked it, but considering not many NES games had that much text unless it was an RPG, it felt jarring. 8/10\n\nPSN Exclusive Features: It features a three-stage boss battle against Kratos, from God of War, and gain armor that lets you play like Kratos does. As I have not purchased nor played the PSN version, I an unable to give this a score as of writing. N/A\n\nXBL Exclusive Features: You fight the Battletoads in a three-part level: One in a level resembling and playing just like the Wookie Hole, another in a level that's straight-up Turbo Tunnel, and then all of them in one final showdown. It's crazy-hard (though probably easy compared to the original, which I have not played), but it's fun and it's probably the best throwback to the Battletoads I have ever seen. Although I criticize Microsoft's usage of Rare IP sometimes, I would argue this is the best use of it to date. After the boss battle, you get Toad Armor, which lets you play almost exactly like a Battletoad (controls, moves, and all), and you get to talk with the various characters (including, surprisingly, Professor T. Bird); and you even get to play the original Turbo Tunnel all you want. Kudos to Yacht Club Games for making this happen. 10/10\n\nWii U Exclusive Features: It incorporates Miiverse on the bottom screen, which you can use to view tips or general posts. It's pretty nifty, but I never found it all that useful. On the plus side, it allows you to use the Wii Remote to capture that authentic NES style of control. Edit: It also sports amiibo, which either allows you to have co-op multiplayer (which why would they lock that to an amiibo?) or lets you customize your own "Custom Knight" and use a variety of different abilities and relics, most exclusive to the amiibo mode. It's decent enough, but I only fully recommend it if you're going for a challenge run and/or New Game Plus, and the $12.99 paywall may deter you if you don't have the money to spare. Thus, I felt it unnecessary to raise the score. 7/10\n\n3DS Exclusive Features: Outside of it being 3D, it has a Streetpass Arena, which lets you record gameplay and fight other players with that recorded gameplay. It's a silly little throwback to Mario Bros, and I found this pretty well done. Edit: Much like the Wii U, it also has "Custom Knight" mode, which functions the exact same as it does on home console. It lacks the co-op multiplayer aspect, however. 9/10\n\nSteam/PC Exclusive Features: N/A\n\nConclusion: Shovel Knight solidified its place as my favorite game of 2014, and is up there among my favorite games of all time (the others being Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, Paper Mario, its direct sequel, and Splatoon as of 5/25/16). If you're looking for an authentic retro throwback, this game is for you. If you're not looking for that and are instead looking for a good platformer, then you'll find, as I have, that this game transcends nostalgia and treats the player with a genuinely great game.\n\nOverall: 10/10\nPC: 9/10\nPSN: N/A\nWii U: 10/10\n3DS: 10/10\nXbox One: 10/10 (recommended platform)","June 12, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It\'s an old-school Megaman style platformer, with old-school difficulty. It\'s brimming with fun, personality, and polish. Every aspect of the game oozes the love that its developers have for games. Expect excellent level design, gorgeous graphics, a kicking soundtrack, a surprisingly engaging story, and a plethora of hidden easter eggs and extra features.\n\nThe only complaint I have is in the Dark Souls-like recovery mechanic. When you die, a proportion of your wealth is left where you died. In Dark Souls, it is left a few seconds behind where you died, so you can safely retrieve it. In Shovel Knight, the bags of gems that spawn where you died would often not be reachable without you dying again.\n\nThis was definitely frustrating, but do not let it sour you on this gem of a game.

I won't go through a whole list) games at the height of their greatness should get this game. This game is worth it at full price and if the creators make another I'll be there to support it at release.\n\nTight simple controls like you would have on the NES, fantastic music, fun levels with secrets, random humour...\n\nIt plays something like a Megaman/Mario/Zelda2 -ish conglomerate.\n\nIt's just the perfect homage to the classic greats, while still creating its own identity. The creators put a lot of love and detail into this one. I can't recommend it higher for a game of its genre.\n\nRated 8/8 bits.\n\n**Goatician :)\n\n\nPLAGUE OF SHADHOWS UPDATE:\n\nIf you thought Shovel Knight was hard before (I didn't -- full achievements), then Plague Knight's campaign will soon change that.\nPlague Knight controls a LOT more awkwardly, with less HP, more knockback (almost strictly worse), has somewhat awkward attack patterns, etc... Initially.\nIt's one of those risk/reward things, since after I got the hang of him, I was able to pretty much fly around the map taking out enemies with precision. Mind you, this won't be easy at first, since the number of times I shot myself into spikes, or just missed/slightly overshot a platform, bumped into an enemy to my doom, pressed the wrong sequence of buttons to stop myself from falling were many. But the pay-off is very worth it -- for example, going back to fighting Spectre Knight (?.. the ghost one), he initially mopped the floor with me, but the second time around I was flying all around him, dodging his attacks/hitting him from safe angles..\n\nAll plague-knight levels are tweaked, and some include secret passages for a slightly more difficult path for (a something). The bosses play identically, however, since your movement style and attack patterns are completely different this changes things up in a nice way. This should not come as a spoiler (you had to have predicted it) but when you fight shovel knight himself, it is just great to see how they gave his boss music the epic boss fight theme that matched the happy tune of the intro level/shovel knight theme.\n\nIt is also interesting how they changed to world so you see it from the eyes of this villain (misunderstood?). The story is again mostly bare-bones just like how shovel knight tried to emulate the NES games of glory.\n\nNew Challenge Maps: There are also some legitimately difficult challenge maps which are fun little side missions. I hope they eventually release the exclusives for PC.\n\n\nOverall, I hope there are more expansions (free or not), or sequels. Plague knight has been a great addition to the game (again, if you find it way too hard, stick with it, because once you figure him out it is a *lot* more fun).","June 19, 2015","true","32.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're a fan of platformers at all, or you've tried to go back and play classics and been put off by their difficulty, Shovel Knight is a perfect game to start with. While it looks retro, it does an incredible job of melding modern game design with familiar highly refined mechanics and controls to create one of the best games I've played this year.\n\nThe story is about 6 or so hours long and full of optional bosses, secrets in each level, and loads of entertaining achievements to try for that give you an extra level of challenge if that's what you're looking for. There is a ton of replayability here, especially considering there is a new game + available as soon as you beat the game the first time that makes the game significantly harder.

The game features classic elements, borrowing from games like Legend of Zelda: The Adventure of Link. Mega Man, Super Mario Brothers, and Castlevania.\n\nThe game is difficult. But in all the proper ways that make retro games good. Never did I feel the game was unfair or trying to hard to be difficult for the sake of being difficult. Where most "Retro Style" games these days aim for a ridiculous level of frustration and difficulty, Shovel Knight focuses on making a good, challenging, and entertaining game that's fun to play.\n\nPlenty of replay value thanks to achievements being present that actually have some challenge to them (Don't get hit for a whole level, don't die for the entire game. Beat the game without buying any special weapons or items...etc.) So there's many ways to play, as well as the ability to choose what direction you want to go in on the world map. (Bosses and levels come in sets but the order you take them in is entirely up to you.)\n\nThe game is designed well and the visuals and sound are fantastic. I recommend turning up the excellent soundtrack and enjoying what is destined to be considered a modern classic.\n\n10 out of 10. No regrets.","August 3, 2014","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Like, its almost unfair to other games, in the way that you can have some reasonably attractive girls at work/school, but they don't get noticed because this new smokingly-hot babe is making them uglier by comparison.\n\nEverything about Shovel Knight IS the best of the NES era. It feels mostly like Mega Man and Duck Tales, with hints of Mario 3 and Castlevania, but it manages its own identity as well, to avoid coming off as a nostalgia gimmick.\nThe attention to detail (if you're impressed by 8bit detail) will blow your mind; the whole game is carefully and lovingly crafted, and this starts to become apparent after the first platforming level, when you can explore some of the minor RPG elements within the towns.\n\nHowever as much as I'd like to say it's perfect, I'd have to subtract at least 3 points for BLATANT lack of difficulty. This game is enjoyable from start to finish, but insultingly easy. This is the only area it fails to live up to its NES inspirations.\nOh sure, I died here and there, but it was always due to unexpected knockback into spikes/pitfalls.\nThere is a New Game+ which apparently provides greater difficulty, though I haven't noticed enough of a difference to make me feel like playing through it again right now.\n\nOne of my favourite things about the game play, is it never provides you with a true "double jump".\nSide Rant: I bloody HATE double jumps. They can work in SOME genres, like perhaps a "metroidvania", but never a straight platformer.\nPutting a double jump in a platformer automatically removes 95% of the difficulty (and this game's easy enough) so merely for avoiding that obnoxious bandwagon, I have to award a bonus point to my arbitrary score.\n\nI'll call it an 8. With a higher, and better balanced difficulty, I could easily see this being a perfect 10.\n","July 16, 2014","true","16.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I did miss a lot of games in 2014 but that still can't deny how great this is. I am a huge NES classic fan especially Mega Man and this game is a must for any fan of the NES classics. It is an amazing throwback with great visuals and an AMAZING soundtrack. Think Castlevania meets Ducktales meets Mega Man.  It has a world map straight out of Mario 3 and 8 bosses with an intro stage along with a village where you can buy and sell things, and an airship with armor and shovel upgrades.\n\nThe bosses are creative, colorful in personality, and fun to fight. All the boss patterns are fun and interesting and with no order of each move it can be challenging. There are many secret areas in where you can get more loot, relics, or music sheets to certain songs that you can sell and then play in the village. The gameplay and design are fairly thought out. You stop in your place to slash with your shovel. You can use your shovel to use a pogostick-like attack. Later in the game you can get a charge slash that makes the movement really awkward when you charge it. The movement feels a little too slow in my opinion and the jumps feel too high in comparison.\n\nI rarely felt like I was cheated out of a life but it did happen and I can't excuse that. The challenge is lacking for the style of game. You are never faced with too much at one time with no chance to get the pattern. It always feels a bit too safe. I never died to losing all my life or to a boss. I only died to bottomless pits and spikes that sometimes felt cheap. This game is built around a speedrun and to get full completion you will need to master that speedrun and that is only a sign of good design.\n\nI could go on and on about everything this game has to offer but i'd rather have anyone reading this be playing this great platformer. So what are you doing still reading this?! Go play Shovel Knight! You won't regret it. 9/10 Would shovel again","January 2, 2015","true","23.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Like, its almost unfair to other games, in the way that you can have some reasonably attractive girls at work/school, but they don't get noticed because this new smokingly-hot babe is making them uglier by comparison.\n\nEverything about Shovel Knight IS the best of the NES era. It feels mostly like Mega Man and Duck Tales, with hints of Mario 3 and Castlevania, but it manages its own identity as well, to avoid coming off as a nostalgia gimmick.\nThe attention to detail (if you're impressed by 8bit detail) will blow your mind; the whole game is carefully and lovingly crafted, and this starts to become apparent after the first platforming level, when you can explore some of the minor RPG elements within the towns.\n\nHowever as much as I'd like to say it's perfect, I'd have to subtract at least 3 points for BLATANT lack of difficulty. This game is enjoyable from start to finish, but insultingly easy. This is the only area it fails to live up to its NES inspirations.\nOh sure, I died here and there, but it was always due to unexpected knockback into spikes/pitfalls.\nThere is a New Game+ which apparently provides greater difficulty, though I haven't noticed enough of a difference to make me feel like playing through it again right now.\n\nOne of my favourite things about the game play, is it never provides you with a true "double jump".\nSide Rant: I bloody HATE double jumps. They can work in SOME genres, like perhaps a "metroidvania", but never a straight platformer.\nPutting a double jump in a platformer automatically removes 95% of the difficulty (and this game's easy enough) so merely for avoiding that obnoxious bandwagon, I have to award a bonus point to my arbitrary score.\n\nI'll call it an 8. With a higher, and better balanced difficulty, I could easily see this being a perfect 10.\n","July 16, 2014","true","16.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is one of them.\n\nGraphics;\nThe game looks just as good in motion as it does in any of the screenshots with great designs and fantastic pixel art. What I love most is the fact that the game isn't held back by any of the palette or sprite limitations one might put upon themselves when developing a game in the style of an NES classic.\n\nSound:\nWithout a doubt the music and sound is completely evocative of those old Capcom and Konami classics. From what I could tell this part is actually rather close to being able to run on that old 80's hardware. Obviously, there's not gonna be any competetion for audio channels between music and sound effects, but I really wouldn't be surprised if the soundtrack were totally doable on an NES cart (perhaps with one of those later model sound-chips).\n\nGameplay:\nThe game was smartly designed to not just emulate the mechanics of a single game or genre and instead grab elements and ideas from several of the era's best titles. You've got a Mario-3-like overworld, with Mega Man style stages and Bosses. You have an inventory of subweapons and a primary attack with just enough delay on it to take you right back to Castlevania. And hey, how about the pogo stick hop from Duck Tales just for good measure? It's a game that's hard but not too hard with some very clever enemy and stage design.\n\nTLDR;\nEver beat Mega Man or Castlevania on the NES? You owe it to yourself to play this game.\n\nNever played anything older than a Gamecube?

What isn't to love?\n\nI mean honestly, if the above doesn't sound good to you, then this game probably isn't for you.\nFor those a bit more on the fence, I suppose I'll elaborate a bit:\n\nIn Shovel Knight, you play the titular knight in a battle against the Order of No Quarter. To do so, you travel to various stages and, in classic Megaman style, travel right while fighting enemies, platforming, and finding secrets.\n\nThroughout the level, you gather up Gems and Coins either outright, via slain enemies, or via secrets and chests, in order to gain Gold, which you can spend at the Village on various Health and Armor upgrades or items.\n\nYour shovel is your main weapon, with the ability to outright smack your enemies or pogo on them ala Duck Tales, and similarly can be used against blocks of various types of dirt and/or rock to traverse the screens.\nItems work similarly to Castlevania, with a limited resource that drains every time you use it (in Shovel Knight, it's pots, as opposed to Castlevania's hearts), though in Shovel Knight you gain the item permanently and can swap between them at your leisure. Even within the first 3 main stages, the selection of items you get is large enough to accomodate a variety of playstyles and strategies.\n\nThe bosses and stages themselves are very remniscient of Megaman, with each stage having a particular theme carried out that matches the Boss. The Bosses themselves have a nice variety of attacks and pattern that, although at first are hard, can be read and manipulated, just like Megaman. Enemy types vary from neat and strange, like the helicopter-rat thing, to fairly standard fare, like the 2spooky skeleton. The music is always wonderfully fitting, and creating a sense of mood and enhancing all of the stages without being distracting.\n\nMovement feels good. Controls are responsive. Hitboxes don't feel wonky.\n\nIn essence, this game is great.\nIf you agreed with the first sentence, you probably already have the game.\nIf you hate retro and/or have terrible taste, you probably weren't gonna get this game anyway.\nIf you're interested, but worried $15 is a little steep, let me assure you that based off of the 3 main stages I've played so far and the size of the overworld map, that you are in for a decent amount of gameplay. Moreso if you want to replay anything, which you most likely will. It's absolutely worth it.\n\nGet digging.","June 27, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a very short loop life and makes me long for something with more meat. MegaMan 2, Mario, Ducktales, they were all able to do better things with the music.\n\nIt also expects you to know Mario standards of being able to jump over the wall of the world, but it only lets you do this when it wants you to do this. So thinking this was a regular thing, I attempted to jump over the wall of the world and died because I didn't realize the developers didn't want me to be able to do that trick there when it worked elsewhere.\n\nGetting away from those complaints, Shovel Knight is a fairly simple game with a platforming appeal that is tough, but forgiving, and in general, a fun game. The mechanics are fairly simple, there's a fun bit of exploration involved, trying to figure out every nook and cranny you need to break.\n\n7/10","June 28, 2014","true","174.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The bosses/most minibosses give you a awesome challange and always come up with the genius of patterns that are really unpredictable and still keeps up the paste. The upgrades/Relics/Armor upgrades are really unique in their own ways and they really help in complicated situations. And are also really fun to use I might add. The stages and enemies are rich and alive in this 8-bit world with the best sounding 8-bit music you will ever hear in your life (Reminds me of Mega Man) and the background, level design, and layout of each stage won't ever dissapoint you. Even though I haven't gotten far into the game myself. (And trust me, I will get right on it.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/250760/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Shovel Knight is a retro-style action platformer that was heavily inspired by classic NES titles such as Mega Man, Castlevania, The Legend of Zelda and DuckTales.\n\nYou play as Shovel Knight, a knight named after his signature weapon. He's a former adventurer who had been roaming the land alongside his friend Shield Knight for years. One day both came across the mysterious Tower of Fate. While Shovel Knight and Shield Knight were exploring the tower something awakened and all of a sudden all hell broke loose. At some point Shovel Knight passed out. When he woke up his friend was gone and the tower was sealed. Devastated, Shovel Knight gave up the life of adventure and started living in solitude. One day a mysterious order of knights appears out of nowhere and start ravaging the land while the Tower of Fate opens up again. It is time to dish out some shovel justice.\n\nShovel Knight stays very true to the games that inspired it. It looks and feels like an NES game. Actually the developers deliberately tried to keep it as close as possible to the original NES aesthetics. There are some features in Shovel Knight that the NES would not have been able to handle. The developers stated that they were working under the assumption that the NES would still be supported today so while still being an 8-bit system the cartridges would have vastly improved chip sets.\n\nShovel Knight's gameplay is a mix of platforming and combat. Shovel Knight can simply strike enemies with his shovel but is also able to jump up and perform a downward strike to deal damage to enemies and bounce off of them. This is a necessary move at some points in the game since there is no double jump. He can also use his shovel to dig out piles of dirt or some walls to find treasure, opening up a way or reveal secret passages. It is possible to reflect enemies' ranged attacks via shovel strikes with the right timing. Shovel Knight has three resources: health, magic and gold. In normal mode getting hit reduces Shovel Knight's health by half a point while in new game plus mode one hit equals one full point of health lost. Touching spikes always results in a death. Magic is drained whenever an artifact is used. There are several artifacts hidden throughout the level. While you can replay almost every level as often as you like those artifacts can only be purchased at a hidden vendor the first time you visit the respective level. If the level is completed without the artifact having been found that artifact can be purchased at the vendor in town. Gold is used for buying artifacts as well as upgrades or sidegrades. Shovel Knight can upgrade his shovel as well as his health and magic pool as well as buy alternative armor sets that often have one particular benefit while carrying one disadvantage that other armor does not have.\n\nThe artifact system is very reminiscient of the one in the Zelda games. Shovel Knight can have one artifact at a time selected. The selected artifact can be changed anytime by bringing up the inventory. There is a wide variety of artifacts and while most of them have an offensive use some are primarily used for defensive or utility purposes. There is for example a fire staff, a locket that makes you invincible for a few seconds, a fishing rod that can be used to catch treasure, health pickups or collectibles and a dagger that enables mid-air dashes. While artifacts make the game a whole lot easier they are not required to beat the game. It is entirely possible to complete the game using only the shovel if you are skilled enough.\n\nShovel Knight starts you out on a world map from where you enter the first level. While the game is mostly linear and all boss levels need to be completed to get to the final level you can often pick the order in which you tackle the boss levels. There are also some optional bonus levels that only serve the purpose of collecting treasure. There are two towns that can be visited when you feel like spending your gold. Also, there are some enemy encounters that don't occur within a level but on the world map. Aside from the optional treasure levels and the world map encounters you can revisit any level as often as you like.\n\nEvery boss has a specific theme with his level reflecting that. For example there's King Knight, a knight who is not actually a king but nonetheless dresses like one and resides in a pompous castle which is also not his. Or there's Treasure Knight who wears an old-fashioned diver's suit and can attack by shooting an anchor chain at you. His lair is in a flooded shipwreck. Every level has some specific mechanics which are unique to that level, keeping the game fresh.\n\nCompared to many other games Shovel Knight is quite tough. It is however not overly hard nor is it unfair. The controls are very tight and responsive and with all of the enemies it comes down to the player knowing their patterns and behaviour. Every level has a bunch of checkpoints from which you can restart after you die. Since there is no life system you can retry as much as you want, but you drop a part of your gold every time you die. Luckily this gold can be reaquired if you make it to the point where you died. Checkpoints can actually destroyed for bonus gold, so be careful around them. You don't want to destroy a checkpoint by accident. However, if you accidentally destroyed a checkpoint or just lost too much gold you can always leave the level and enter it again. If you leave the level without having beaten it everything is reset to the point before you entered it.\n\nThe graphics and music of Shovel Knight do very well within the developer's self-imposed confines. The graphics are colourful and show great attention to detail. The music does a good job in conveying the respective level's atmosphere. All of the ingame music can be found as music sheets and given to the bard in town. Aside from paying you in treasure the bard will then play any of those songs for you if you ask him.\n\nShovel Knight is still to be expanded content-wise. While what you get when you buy it is already a full game the developers are currently working on an expansion campaign in which you play as the boss Plague Knight. There will be several more content updates in the future. Since they were promised due to the game's kickstarter campaign reaching its stretch goals all of those will be completely free which is awesome.\n\nIn summary, the developers have done a great job at Shovel Knight and the game delivers everything they originally strived for. If you are fond of platformers and/or retro games you should give Shovel Knight a try.\n\nMore reviews here","March 10, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Stages are varied enough to be fun with interesting patterned boss fights at the end of each stage.\n\nHowever, this is one of those games that wants you to "pick your own" difficulty level, because there is no traditional difficulty selection. The mid-stage checkpoints are all optional, and most of the health/mp upgrades as well. Personally, playing through it with using all of those, the game was far too easy, tallying up the deaths at the end most were from one specific boss fight and the bonus areas. If you get all the health upgrades as they become available, it becomes extremely hard to die due to running out of HP, most of my deaths came from bottomless pits. On top of that, some of the sub-weapons seem to give you invincibility when you use them, making them go-to weapons for every single boss fight afterward, but thats also part of your own difficulty level if you want to use it.\n\nHaving said that, the game feels great to play, the art is true to its NES style in pallet and always maintaining a 1:1 pixel ratio, with good slightly-better-than-NES music as well. I'd recommend to anyone that enjoys either MegaMan or platformers in general.","June 18, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(Heck, I have absolutely no nostalgia for NES platformers, I grew up on the ones on the PS1 like Crash and Spyro) While it has some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t here or there, Shovel Knight does a nice job at letting the player make their own difficulty, i.e. you can buy all the upgrades and ichors or you don't have to at all. While the game is not really difficult normally, you will need to have some experience in the genre to win, this game doesn't really hold your hand.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowboundhusky/recommended/250760/","snowboundhusky","Shibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowboundhusky/","265 products in account","Shovel Knight is an amazing game. Reminiscent of old NES/SNES games, it keeps the retro feel while still keeping to standards of some modern day games. When it comes to the actual meat of the game, I can't really say much negative about it: The gameplay is smooth and quite responsive, the story is beautiful and still simple to keep grasp of, and the visuals are top-notch for a game emulating older-style graphics. A negative that I can admit, however, is that it feels extremely short. In just a few hours, you can crank through all of the bosses and the side content of the main story and it leaves you wanting a little more. However, with the most recent update to it, it now has an added campaign where you play as one of the bosses through his own story, as well as adding a challenge mode for players feeling cocky or wanting a good test of their skill.\n\nAll in all, even with the game feeling a fair bit short, Shovel Knight is a great game and is definitely worth the money for it. More updates are planned for it, including more of the side campaigns and other possible goodies, so pick it up!\n\nFor Shovelry!","September 21, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've been busy. And when I got time I just didn't feel like it. But now I have (finally) finished Shovel Knight and said to myself: "Hey, why not?"\n\nShovel Knight. A game that came at least a year or two ago and I have just managed to finish. In 14 hours. Don't get fooled, though, those are 14 hours through out nearly a year, for reasons I'll go over later on.\n\nThis is a game that aims to bring out nostalgia from the old great times of NESS games (I actually wasn't around by then, but, hey, it works too). You play as Shovel Knight, a knight... with a spade instead of a sword. You are on a quest to find the Evil Enchantress and rescue your old friend Shield Knight from her and her Order of No Quarter, a selection of the most bombastic knights I've seen in a videogame. The game will keep throwing in new mechanics, enemies and challanges until the very end of the game, so you don't get bored; and without the hardware limitations of the NESS era, the guys over at the Yatch development studio have managed to create a game with enough content to be considered a game worthy of today's standards without dropping the old times feeling.\n\nWhich gets me to... Shovel Knight tries to mimic a lot of things that games before the second millenia had, and the difficulty is something that is replicated masterfully. And I almost wish they hadn't. Oh dear god, at the end of my fourteen-hour-long run I had a death count of 168. That's more than 10 deaths per hour, at about an average of a shameful fall into a bottomless pit or getting my skull obliterated by a boss every six minutes. I remember that, sometimes, I said to myself "I still have an hour or so of free time and I'm bored. Let's see what I can play..." while I scrolled through my Steam Library, only to find Shovel Knight, and thinking "Yeah... maybe another day. I don't feel like flinging my laptop across the room right now". This game takes guts to play. And it turns out that what I finished was just the base game, and that I still have New Game Plus and the Plague Knight free expansion left. Oh, boy...\n\nWhat can I say? This is a game that is going head first into my "games that I love and hate" list.\n\n+ Entertaining gameplay with very simple mechanics.\n+ Very easy to learn. Almost impossible to master.\n+ Has the right length for a game like this. And, quite honestly, I don't know if I would have been able to stand much more of it.\n+ An absolute ton of secrets, side quests and achievements. Completionists better know what are they getting into...\n- This is no walk in the park whatsoever. The game WILL frustrate you, and the risk-vs-reward sistem is totally stacked against you. Just so you know.\n- Some parts are just downright ridiculous. Either perform a pixel-perfect sequence of jumps and mid-air item usages or fall to your death and lose a quarter of your current money and about a sixth of your leftover sanity. You missed the plataform and killed yourself before you could get to the point you died so you could recover your loot? Welp, sucks to be you: there goes another quarter of your earnings and the other one is lost forever! Christ, I think I rage quited about three times in my first playthrough.\n\nThis game gets a 7.5 out of 10. Definetely deserves to be called a "classic".","December 16, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/250760/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Shovel Knight is a retro-style action platformer that was heavily inspired by classic NES titles such as Mega Man, Castlevania, The Legend of Zelda and DuckTales.\n\nYou play as Shovel Knight, a knight named after his signature weapon. He's a former adventurer who had been roaming the land alongside his friend Shield Knight for years. One day both came across the mysterious Tower of Fate. While Shovel Knight and Shield Knight were exploring the tower something awakened and all of a sudden all hell broke loose. At some point Shovel Knight passed out. When he woke up his friend was gone and the tower was sealed. Devastated, Shovel Knight gave up the life of adventure and started living in solitude. One day a mysterious order of knights appears out of nowhere and start ravaging the land while the Tower of Fate opens up again. It is time to dish out some shovel justice.\n\nShovel Knight stays very true to the games that inspired it. It looks and feels like an NES game. Actually the developers deliberately tried to keep it as close as possible to the original NES aesthetics. There are some features in Shovel Knight that the NES would not have been able to handle. The developers stated that they were working under the assumption that the NES would still be supported today so while still being an 8-bit system the cartridges would have vastly improved chip sets.\n\nShovel Knight's gameplay is a mix of platforming and combat. Shovel Knight can simply strike enemies with his shovel but is also able to jump up and perform a downward strike to deal damage to enemies and bounce off of them. This is a necessary move at some points in the game since there is no double jump. He can also use his shovel to dig out piles of dirt or some walls to find treasure, opening up a way or reveal secret passages. It is possible to reflect enemies' ranged attacks via shovel strikes with the right timing. Shovel Knight has three resources: health, magic and gold. In normal mode getting hit reduces Shovel Knight's health by half a point while in new game plus mode one hit equals one full point of health lost. Touching spikes always results in a death. Magic is drained whenever an artifact is used. There are several artifacts hidden throughout the level. While you can replay almost every level as often as you like those artifacts can only be purchased at a hidden vendor the first time you visit the respective level. If the level is completed without the artifact having been found that artifact can be purchased at the vendor in town. Gold is used for buying artifacts as well as upgrades or sidegrades. Shovel Knight can upgrade his shovel as well as his health and magic pool as well as buy alternative armor sets that often have one particular benefit while carrying one disadvantage that other armor does not have.\n\nThe artifact system is very reminiscient of the one in the Zelda games. Shovel Knight can have one artifact at a time selected. The selected artifact can be changed anytime by bringing up the inventory. There is a wide variety of artifacts and while most of them have an offensive use some are primarily used for defensive or utility purposes. There is for example a fire staff, a locket that makes you invincible for a few seconds, a fishing rod that can be used to catch treasure, health pickups or collectibles and a dagger that enables mid-air dashes. While artifacts make the game a whole lot easier they are not required to beat the game. It is entirely possible to complete the game using only the shovel if you are skilled enough.\n\nShovel Knight starts you out on a world map from where you enter the first level. While the game is mostly linear and all boss levels need to be completed to get to the final level you can often pick the order in which you tackle the boss levels. There are also some optional bonus levels that only serve the purpose of collecting treasure. There are two towns that can be visited when you feel like spending your gold. Also, there are some enemy encounters that don't occur within a level but on the world map. Aside from the optional treasure levels and the world map encounters you can revisit any level as often as you like.\n\nEvery boss has a specific theme with his level reflecting that. For example there's King Knight, a knight who is not actually a king but nonetheless dresses like one and resides in a pompous castle which is also not his. Or there's Treasure Knight who wears an old-fashioned diver's suit and can attack by shooting an anchor chain at you. His lair is in a flooded shipwreck. Every level has some specific mechanics which are unique to that level, keeping the game fresh.\n\nCompared to many other games Shovel Knight is quite tough. It is however not overly hard nor is it unfair. The controls are very tight and responsive and with all of the enemies it comes down to the player knowing their patterns and behaviour. Every level has a bunch of checkpoints from which you can restart after you die. Since there is no life system you can retry as much as you want, but you drop a part of your gold every time you die. Luckily this gold can be reaquired if you make it to the point where you died. Checkpoints can actually destroyed for bonus gold, so be careful around them. You don't want to destroy a checkpoint by accident. However, if you accidentally destroyed a checkpoint or just lost too much gold you can always leave the level and enter it again. If you leave the level without having beaten it everything is reset to the point before you entered it.\n\nThe graphics and music of Shovel Knight do very well within the developer's self-imposed confines. The graphics are colourful and show great attention to detail. The music does a good job in conveying the respective level's atmosphere. All of the ingame music can be found as music sheets and given to the bard in town. Aside from paying you in treasure the bard will then play any of those songs for you if you ask him.\n\nShovel Knight is still to be expanded content-wise. While what you get when you buy it is already a full game the developers are currently working on an expansion campaign in which you play as the boss Plague Knight. There will be several more content updates in the future. Since they were promised due to the game's kickstarter campaign reaching its stretch goals all of those will be completely free which is awesome.\n\nIn summary, the developers have done a great job at Shovel Knight and the game delivers everything they originally strived for. If you are fond of platformers and/or retro games you should give Shovel Knight a try.\n\nMore reviews here","March 10, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Shovel Knight is an ode to the old platformers of the NES era that many grew up with back in the late 80s. However, Shovel Knight stands firmly out on its own and clearly has its own identity due to the game's characters, setting, atmosphere, soundtrack, and gameplay. This 8-bit wonder is easily worth the money and time put into it as not only is it a fair and fun challenge to overcome, but Yacht Club Games (the developers) are ever at work coming up with new additions to their product ensuring there will always be something new for the game somewhere down the line. I cannot stress enough how good this game is and why everyone should give it a try.","March 5","true","23.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artificialraven/recommended/250760/","artificialraven","ArtificialRaven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artificialraven/","625 products in account","Shovel Knight is a 2d platformer that pays homage to and uses gameplay elements from classic NES games such as: Castlevania, Super Mario Bros. 3, Duck Tales and Mega Man series. Shovel Knight's partner, Shield Knight, disappears in the cursed tower and he goes on a journey to return to the tower to find her. Meanwhile the Evil Enchantress sends out her evil band of knights, The Order of No Quarter, to terrorize the land.\n\nI love this game. From the classic 8-bit graphics to the 8-bit music, it reminds me of the NES games I played when I was a youngin'. It takes some of the best elements from those games I mentioned above and brilliantly makes them its own thing. Shovel knight can pogo bounce on enemies with his shovel and smack them with it too. Later on there are armor and shovel powerups you can purchase but they're not necessary to complete the game. Along the way you can also find relics hidden in each stage that will help you considerably but remember to have enough magic points to use them. Health and magic upgrades can be purchased in town as well as relics you've missed as long as you completed the relic's corresponding stage. There's a warmup stage right in the beginning so you can get comfortable with how everything works before you set out to beat the Order of No Quarter. And you'll need all the practice you can get because the later stages can be quite difficult.\n\nEasy to pickup, hard to master, this is a great game if you have a nostalgic itch that needs scratching. Hell even if you don't have any nostalgia for the style, it's still a solid game. The developer, Yacht Club Games, still has plans to add more playable characters in the future but at the time of this review we have Shovel Knight and then Plague Knight to play as once you beat the game. I highly recommend this game. A must buy if you're a fan of classic NES platformer games or just platformers in general.","March 21","true","29.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I guess it's the ultimate retro-nostalgia-pandering game, built entirely out of old references like a Tarantino film. except instead of excessive swearing it has excessive bad puns.\n\nMost retro style indie games will at least try to innovate a little, or throw in a gimmick, but I couldn't find a single new idea in this entire game. If this were made in the 80s, it wouldn't be remembered as a classic, it would be that decent-yet-forgettable title that ripped off everything creative around it. Kinda like most big studio games we get today, heh.\n\nBut in the end, it's still good! It is an adequate platformer, very polished production. A little too easy, not very clever level design, but there's not a single BAD thing anywhere in it. It took no risks, but it has no ugly stains.\n\n+ The soundtrack by Jake Kaufman is awesome stuff.

It's definitely built on the building blocks of early NES games (Mega Man, Zelda 2, Mario 3), picking and choosing select elements of each in but adding them to their clever level design that definitely hits the nostalgic feel without that feeling of "But I've played this already".  Also of note is the music Jake "Virt" Kaufman, who provides another amazing musical score built out of a freeware program called Famitracker, which helps add to its retro aesthetic.\n\nThe story is pretty minimal, but the most important aspect of gameplay is nailed.  Shovel Knight controls perfectly, with a fun pogo jump mechanic that's a combination of Zelda 2's down-stab and Ducktales cane jumping that can keep you moving fluidly if you dont want to stop and fight anything and a few other weapons you can find to supplement your shovel attacks.  Overall, its the type of game that will appeal to more than just a retro entusiast, this is a well crafted and original game.

It feels as though every game rips off Cave Story's asthetic, or they feel the need to cram in stupid physics or RNG sections.\n\nShovel Knight isn't one of those games.\n\nThe controls are very tight for an indie platformer, Shovel Knight has a limited attack range and the levels are designed around this and his ability to dig up terrain blocks. The music is fantastic, it's Kaufman and Matsumae, you cannot improve on that. Even my most hated level had a theme I find stuck in my head from my repeated failures.\n\nThe only thing that truly seperates this game from its predecessors is a lack of a life system, where they've instead opted for a Demon's/Dark Souls-esque system where you only drop your money which has to be recovered. And in typical Souls fashion, the levels are easy if you take it slow but fiendish if you try to rush, especially if you want to be cool and go for those final achievements.\n\nIf you find the money and have any fondness for 2D platformers, then you should definitely pick this game up.","July 3, 2014","true","26.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's essentially 95 percent Megaman and maybe 5 percent some other games but it's really good no matter what.\n\nControls feel great, there's tons of little secrets, I adore the music and the bosses are probably the best part. The game is fairly easy (nowhere near as hard as Meatboy and others) with maybe a smidgen of difficulty at the last level. It depends probably what items you use. If you want to cheese it or are too frusterated you can pretty much just phase locket most of the game.\n\nThe bosses are the best part. Almost none of them are wait-around-and-hit-weakpoints. You can attack and stay on their butts the whole time. I really like that you can play super aggressively on them and take quite a few hits before going down. Level design is pretty much exactly Megaman style but obviously melee.\n\nMy only problem is the game is absurdly short. I beat it in 5 hours and thats after doing all the levels too. There's a new game plus mode but it doesn't change much at all. Less checkpoints, no food, and enemies do more damage. No level change or anything so that kind of bummed me out.\n\nThere's also a code to replace most of the text with "butt" so yeah.

Why aren't you playing this yet? BUY IT THE ZOMGBBQHYPEHYPEHYPE!\n\nFangirling aside, let's talk about the technical side of things.\n\nGraphics:\nIt's pixel art. Not strictly 8-bit pixel art actually. In an actual 8-bit machine they can only render 8 colours at a time in any particular sprite or layer. Which explains why in true NES games, the colour of the enemies change together with your character. (Biggest culprit again Megaman series)\nShovel Knight has a lot of places where it looks 8-bit at first glance. But, if you colour pick and line the shades out they do break the limit.\n\nHow did they keep that 8-bit feel? Colour choice. It all boils down to the painting.\n\nGameplay:\nPerfectly right controls. It will jump the moment you press jump. Some games have a slight delay in jumping but this doesn't have it. If you inch, he will inch. If you pogo stick he will pogo stick. Oh, yes he can bounce on enemies and some objects like Scrooge McDuck.\n\nBest played on a controller for very good reasons. There will be really tricky platform sections where a bad keyboard cause a lot of needless suffering. Which leads to the next section.\n\nDifficulty:\nIf you're the kind of person who have very bad jump timing/slipping off platforms, this will be a very very hard game for you.\nIf you're a fresh newbie in the platforming scene, expect a steep difficulty curve.\nIf you're more experienced in casual platforming, still expect a somewhat steep curve.\nIf you're an old veteran of the NES Nintendo Hard era, this is definitely the game for you!\n\nThere will be times where you will die. Repeatedly. And you will feel like flipping the table because That One Section gets in the way. Boss fights are very fast paced and expect a few tries before getting the hang of it. Unless you're in the NES veteran level.\nThings do get easier as you get more relics (Magic) and upgrade the Shovel Knight's gear (Armour/Shovel). But they're not going to prevent accidental falls from derpiness :P\n\nThe map is mapped out ala Mario Style, which means mini-areas and mini-bosses will move around the map after completing each stage. I won't spoil who they actually are.\n\nStages can be replayed to get more money (or you missed a secret) but bewarned! In Mega Man the bosses dissapear for good after you beat them.\n\nNope. Not in Shovel Knight. Bosses WILL wait for you at the end of the stage. New relics will make some stages a ton easier to farm.... just come prepared.\n\nAll in all, expect a challenge!\n\nMusic:\nAll the music here are Chiptunes. It might take a while to get used to the kind of beepy gritty sharpy feel. The most earworm tune is the village music. Despite the high quality of the visual production, the music takes a while to catch on.\n\nWhen you do get used to it, it's really nice! Adds a lot to the feel of the stage and the game in general.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhat are you doing? BUY IT NOW! The only folks I'd think twice for are those with terrible coordination. But don't fret! You can try! I used to suck really hard in platforming. Then eventually with practice I get better. Platforming is like riding a bike, you'll remember it for life.\n","August 10, 2014","true","32.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
