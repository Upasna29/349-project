I couldn't tell. Because even in full screen mode, the resolution is set. It doesn't stretch or scale to the size of the screen. My monitor has a high resolution, so I COULDN'T SEE WHAT I WAS DOING. How a game created in 2012 could fail to accomodate people with even mid-range monitors and screen resolutions baffles me. I solved the very first level and then gave up, because it was giving me a headache. Don't get this game unless you either have a 1024x768 resolution, or don't mind manually switching to that every single time you play the game.\n\nNot worth the effort, from what I can see.

Not helping Mumbo Jumbo's case is their lack of action to fix the problem when it first came up, and things only went downhill after they deleted the achievements and (initially) refused to restore them. It should also be noted that two other Midnight Mystery games (Devil on the Mississippi, Haunted Houdini) had the same update process as Salem at the same time, so why Salem was broken and why Mumbo Jumbo didn't bother to fix it before things got out of hand is, again, baffling.\n\nI'd keep a wary eye on Mumbo Jumbo and their games and check the forums to see what's going on before you give them any money. You are free to read the original review below.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW FROM FEB. 14, 2015:\nI cannot, under any circumstances, recommend this game. Additionally, I cannot recommend purchasing any games from Mumbo Jumbo. I'd advise to stay FAR away from Mumbo Jumbo after they removed the achievements from this game, a feature that was the incentive for me to purchase via Steam rather than, say, Amazon or some other digital storefront.\n\nMumboJumbo is too lazy to fix this game, in particular, and rather than put in the effort to listen to customer feedback and implement fixes for what they broke to begin with, they would rather REMOVE features and further break their games. I have noticed whenever they updated their games on Steam, there are no notes or documentations on what was done to warrant the update.\n\nI would only follow Mumbo Jumbo just to make sure if they bring any more games to Steam I can be sure to avoid Mumbo Jumbo's games like the plague.","February 14, 2015","false","11.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

If you expect an easy HOG, buckle up.\n\nLong version:Midnight Mysteries 2: The Salem Witch Trials was the game that introduced the plot-driven lightweight adventure game format to this franchise of hidden object games. It did so with a unique approach, so there are many differences compared to other similar games on today's market.\n\nFor one, the plot is thick and difficult to follow: the author we met in the first game is contacted by another ghost, the spectre of Nathaniel Hawthorne, who asks him to get to the bottom of the mystery of the titular witch trials. This task quickly gets a lot more complicated after we get entangled in family dramas, feuds, and even a legal dispute with the local Indian tribe.\n\nGameplay mirrors this complexity. Hidden object scenes take a secondary role to classic point ‘n’ click game elements, including item combinations within the inventory. Progress requires the player to listen to the story to decipher where to go next. So, in short, it isn’t meant for the HOG rookies, and even veterans may find a decent challenge in it.","March 2","true","7.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The puzzles didn't feel as connected, and the hidden objects were completely uninvolved with the story.  In the EAP one, they felt meaningful to the story, and you would use objects found, to find other objects.  it was cool.  This one has you find a bunch of objects, and then seemingly unrelated, find one more object that was there the whole time -- you just couldn't click on it.  The game was more complex, and the puzzles were obtuse -- I even was forced to use a walkthrough for a couple parts, as the hint system is insane.  You have like thirty objects in your inventory, and the hint system demands you get a hint on one object....\n\nI come down on it, because I really liked the first one, and hoped they would continue with that style.

And the story, which ties Nathaniel Hawthorne to some blood curse from the Salem Witch Trials and a Native American land treaty seems pretty incomprehensible - maybe it's because I'm not as familiar with Hawthorne as I was with Poe (the first author in the series).  The hidden object scenes are decent, and some of the other puzzles are okay, but the wide amount of travelling back and forth and the lack of guidance at several points make me not recommend it unless you're interested in seeing the evolution of the game genre.\nAlso, the Achievements don't work.

That said it worked nicely, although at a few points I wasn't entirely certain where to go, although at that point I rifled through my inventory items and worked out the first of two rather delightful easter eggs within the game. The puzzles are pretty simple and the hidden objects are not very hidden so it's nice if you want a totally casual experience. I normally play this kinda thing when I'm tired and can't focus on something more complicated so it was just about perfect for that.\n\nThe game has achievements but sadly these are broken under steam - apparently by the most recent (March/2014) patch. I really like these types of games and if you feed me a good one, chances are I'll buy more from you but I'm surprisingly picky when it comes to buying games that actually work right and I do like my achievements.\n\nAlso it's worth noting there is no free play or equivalent at the end of the game so make sure to collect everything you need before you finish.\n\nStill it's a nice game, and if they fix the achievements it'll be a good one to pick up for something fun to amble through.","May 23, 2014","true","11.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I played through all of Story Mode.  As someone who is new to this type of game, one feature I wish had been included was some way to have hints for the puzzles.  Sometimes, I got very stuck and my only options were to either go online to find out the solution or to "skip", which did not allow me to learn how to solve the puzzle.  The downside was that in looking online, I got the whole solution, when I would have preferred just getting a starting hint of some kind.  And there was one puzzle where the solution I found online did not work.  It was a puzzle where you have to slide books out of the way so that a particular one can get to a particular spot.  The opening arrangement in my game was different than the opening arrangement I found on the website.  That said, overall, I did enjoy the game.  The story was not quite as rich as the previous game (it was longer, certainly, but not as well-connected), but it was still immersive, and I enjoyed seeing how the different charcters and puzzles interacted with the main plot.

The game offers an interesting story, more interaction, more animations, more puzzles, and less eye spy elements. It almost feels like playing a point-and-click adventure. For an eye spy game, I thought it was decent.","November 5, 2012","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/208620/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","It's now Hawthorne, another writer, that asks you to investigate his death and the Salem Witch Trials that may be the beginning of his family's curse. Will you find why he was cursed?\n\nWhile the story relies a lot on History, the plot is hard to follow, like in the first game. I mean, another writer asks you for peace, you're focusing on his death and asking people around but you're mainly thrown into the Salem Witch Trials and the condamnation of an innocent soul, because of his ancestor. There are also bonus scenes from Oz and Alice in Wonderland if you find the right items.\n\nBut the puzzles are finally more challenging, the game is more an adventure one than HOG and you have some quite scary moments. Objects are still hard to find but the additionnal bonus are quite refreshing - not only you have still ravens to find but lucky charms too.\n\nThe graphics are good, when you're not discussing with ghosts during the night, you're thrown into a cold setting, when your friend died.\n\nThe only problem is that they added achievements but only in beta and you need to make some manipulation before being able to unlock them. I think it never was pushed on an official update.\n\nAt least, this game is better than Edgar Allen Poe Conspiracy, more challenging and perhaps more structured in the plot. It's probably the game that makes more sense in the series anyway.","April 22, 2013","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
