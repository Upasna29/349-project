I did like that it took longer to complete as a result with more complex puzzles and with the sailing feature. It was fun to explore the island and the surrounding ocean, but I think that the quality of the controls could be improved for an overall better navigating experience. There was also less interaction with other characters, so be prepared for a lot of independent tasks and puzzles that don't involve interviewing the suspects. Overall, I enjoyed this game, but if you want a Nancy Drew game that is a little bit more fast paced I would recommend checking out some of the others in the series.","June 20, 2014","true","10.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

It has the full range of puzzles and tasks, but falls short on the story. The graphics were great as always, and seeing Bess and George was great. The ending has a great twist for those of us who have played all the other Nancy games. On the hole this game is great for players both young and old.  Those of us familiar with the Nancy Drew series will be well satisfied.","June 25, 2014","true","10.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There are only two people on this island to talk to. I communicated most with an obnoxius parrot. No wonder why it's called Dread Island. The background music haunted my mind long after gameplay. I had to turn it off. And, with very little human communication in this game, I played in silence. The plot was as flat as you can get. The ending was predictable. I only wanted to finish this game to get my money's worth. It still wasn't.\n\nI recommed recommend Alibi in Ashes if you're looking for a light-hearted game and especially if you're interested in switching roles in the game.","November 6, 2015","false","8.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The monkeys could be incredibly tedious, but it was possible to beat them and get all of their "prizes". As someone who has played the games from the beginning, I appreciated who the culprit turned out to be.","June 7, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought this game because I haven't played any of the recent Nancy Drew game in a while. Normally I can solve puzzles without the help of a walkthrough eventually, not in this game. Do not waste your money on this. I would highly suggust another Nancy Drew games such as Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Curse of the Blackmoor Manor, Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake.\n\nPRO:\nYou get to see Bess and George (Nancy Drew's Best Friends)\n\nCONS:\nWay too complicated puzzles (ex. finish a colored Sodoku in 75 sec) that you need to have the walkthrough printed and next to you at all times.\nIt's way to easy to figure out who the Kidnapper is\nDrive a golf cart that 5mph around routes that are curvey and long\nStory its self not interesting\nHave to use a walkthrough to understand the plot.\n\n0/10: I really wish I could just get my money back on this one.","November 24, 2014","false","9.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"
